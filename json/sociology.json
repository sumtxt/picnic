          "title": "The effect of legislation on perceived disability discrimination: a heterogeneous difference-in-differences analyses",
          "authors": "Alexi Gugushvili, Jan Grue",
          "abstract": "Equalizing opportunities and outcomes between individuals with and without disabilities is a stated goal for most governments in Western welfare democracies. Yet, significant disability-based inequalities remain in many domains of life. One of the causes of this gap is the widespread discrimination of individuals with disabilities. Over the last two decades, most European countries have introduced anti-discrimination legislation to reduce disability-based discrimination. This study examines the impact of anti-discrimination legislation on perceived disability discrimination across 28 European societies using data from the European Social Survey and newly compiled information on disability-related laws. Using a heterogenous difference-in-differences approach, our analysis covers the period from 2002 to 2020, focusing on adults aged 25 to 64 who report disabilities. We find no evidence that anti-discrimination legislative changes reduced perceived disability discrimination in the analyzed countries. There is some supporting evidence, though, that the adoption of an anti-discrimination legal framework, in the long run, was linked with higher perceived disability discrimination among males. We conclude that across Europe, and in keeping with the persistence of disability-based inequalities, legislative efforts have so far been ineffective in combating disability discrimination as perceived by people with disabilities.",

          "title": "The religion of White identity politics: Christian nationalism and White racial solidarity",
          "authors": "Samuel L Perry, Joshua B Grubbs",
          "abstract": "Though recent research on White racial solidarity has advanced our understanding of White identity politics in the United States, the religious underpinnings of White identity politics remain understudied. Building on the documented conflation of religious, racial, and national identities among White Americans, we propose American Christian nationalism is best thought of as the religion of White identity politics. Drawing on nationally representative data with a strong, novel measure of Christian nationalism and tested measures of racial solidarity, we find Christian nationalism is among the leading predictors of racial solidarity but solely among White Americans. Specifically, Christian nationalism among (only) White Americans predicts greater racial identity salience, believing their racial group has a lot to be proud of, that their racial group members share much in common, and that it is important for their racial group members to work together to change laws unfair to their racial group. The result is that while Black and Hispanic Americans on average score higher on indicators of racial consciousness and solidarity than White Americans, at higher levels of Christian nationalism, White Americans become indistinguishable from their Black and Hispanic counterparts. Moreover, among Black Americans, Christian nationalism is negatively associated with the belief that Black people should work together to change laws unfair to Black people, suggesting that while Christian nationalism increases or reflects White racial solidarity motivating White identity politics, it may weaken Black Americans’ motivation to advocate for Black Americans in politics.",

          "title": "Breathing unequal air: environmental disadvantage and residential sorting of immigrant minorities in England and Germany",
          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer, Felix Bader, Ingmar Ehler, Henning Best",
          "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighborhoods as immigrants—the relevant counterfactual—they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

          "title": "Overstatement of GDP growth in autocracies and the recent decline in global inequality",
          "authors": "Roshan K Pandian",
          "abstract": "After rising for almost two centuries, global income inequality declined substantially after 2000. While past scholarship on global inequality has explored several causes for this recent decline in inequality, these studies take for granted the official GDP figures released by national governments. A parallel social science literature has documented the manipulation of official data to exaggerate economic performance in autocratic countries, but this work has stopped short of examining the broader implications of this phenomenon. In this study, I explore the overstatement of GDP growth figures in autocracies as another contributor to the recent decline in estimates of global inequality based on officially reported GDP figures. Drawing on satellite-based night-time lights data and an empirical strategy from recent research, I compute model-based estimates of GDP overstatement in autocracies. I then combine this information with data on within-country income inequality to arrive at adjusted estimates of global income inequality in a sample of 109 countries constituting 92 percent of the world’s population. I find that between 1995 and 2014, ~20 percent of the decline in global inequality can be explained by the overstatement of GDP growth in less democratic countries. I conclude by discussing the broader implications of these findings for our understanding of global inequality and its political economy.",

          "authors": "Samuel Stroope, Rachel J Bacon, Michael S Barton, Elizabeth E Brault, Rhiannon A Kroeger, Joseph O Baker",
          "abstract": "Institutional anomie theory (IAT) posits that religion is a social institution that influences crime, yet religion has been relatively neglected in empirical research on IAT. We elaborate the role of religion within IAT, methodologically differentiate religious traditions, and empirically test hypotheses regarding local religious ecologies and community homicide over time in the United States. In analyses of county-level panel data, we find that increases in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are directly associated with increases in homicide rates, while increases in the Catholic adherent rate are directly associated with decreases in homicide rates. Using spatial analysis to examine spillover effects from adjacent locations, increases in the Catholic adherent rate and the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with increases in homicide, while increases in the mainline Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with decreases in homicide. The total effect (both direct and indirect) for changes in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate is the largest in the model. In sum, elaborating and extending IAT, this study theorizes and then demonstrates the importance of differentiating between specific religious traditions for understanding spatial and temporal patterns in crime.",

          "title": "Remote/hybrid work in flux: work-place/preference mismatch and adaptations",
          "authors": "Wen Fan, Phyllis Moen",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented employer-driven shift to remote/hybrid work for those whose jobs allow it, but then came retrenchments, forging disjunctures between where one works (remote/hybrid or in-person) and individual preferences, which we term work-place mismatch. We draw on a combined worker power, employer biases, and adaptive strategy theoretical framing to investigate work-place mismatch in light of remarkable pandemic-precipitated shifts in place of work, opening up possibilities (and preferences) for remote/hybrid arrangements. In addition to examining inequities in work-place mismatch, we theorize employees’ possible adaptive strategies when confronting such mismatch—shifting where they work, changing their locational preferences, or intending to leave or actually leaving their employer. Using a nationally representative four-wave panel (October 2020–April 2022) of US employees who worked fully or partially remotely during the pandemic, we find that work-place mismatch is widespread, especially among those returning to on-site work. Hispanics, Black men, and those lacking a college degree are most likely to experience unfulfilled interest (mismatch) in remote work. Structurally disadvantaged mismatched workers also experience constrained strategies—less apt to change their work location or quit relative to white or college-educated workers.",

          "title": "Are women with disabilities more at risk of intimate partner violence?",
          "authors": "Justine Hervé, Katherine Theiss, Sophie Mitra",
          "abstract": "Women with disabilities may face heightened risks of intimate partner violence (IPV) given the discrimination and barriers they face in society. While some country-specific studies explore the link between disability and IPV, cross-country research remains limited. Using internationally comparable data for women aged 15–49 from eleven countries (Cambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Timor-Leste, and Uganda), we assess whether women with disabilities consistently face higher IPV risks. Controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, women with disabilities have a 6-percentage-point higher risk of IPV compared to those without (P &amp;lt; .05) in the pooled sample. At the country level, this association is significant in five countries. The link between disability and IPV also varies by type, with stronger associations for severe physical IPV (seven countries) and weaker associations for sexual IPV (two countries). Logit decomposition analysis in the five countries where the disability gap in exposure to IPV is significant shows that observed differences in characteristics account for part of the gap. However, unobserved factors, such as stigma, also play a significant role in driving the disparity. Additionally, our results suggest that the lack of consistent findings across countries may result from data limitations, such as small sample sizes, measurement errors, and reporting biases. This underscores the importance of developing evidence-based approaches to better measure disability and IPV in household surveys.",

          "title": "The wages of investor power: shareholder exploitation in Europe",
          "authors": "Matthew Soener, Davon Norris",
          "abstract": "Exploitation, or the ability of property owners to gain at worker’s expense, is a classic sociological explanation for inequality. However, it is a difficult process to identify and empirically show with most data sources. Using data on European corporations from 1995 to 2020, we ask if shareholder gains come at the expense of employee earnings in a process we call “shareholder exploitation.” Panel estimation results confirm a robust antagonistic pattern with shareholders experiencing cumulative advantages relative to employees over this period. We further explore moderating mechanisms in this process. These results show globalization effects and the importance of the profit rate over time. Antagonism between shareholders and workers increases when profitability declines but attenuates when profitability increases and workers can claim more of the surplus. By using ideas from critical political economy, this paper has important implications for the study of inequality.",
