          "title": "How Values and Uncertainty Shape Scientific Advance in Peer Review",
          "authors": "Daniel Scott Smith, Neha Nayak Kennard, Tianyu Du, Daniel A. McFarland",
          "abstract": "Tens of thousands of scientists contribute to peer review as journal editors and reviewers of the millions of manuscripts submitted every year. How do they decide what is quality work? What values do they apply in evaluating which science merits publication and which does not? How do they respond to dissensus and uncertainty? Who has the greatest influence over the final outcome? This study combines close reading with large language models to analyze 80,000 reviews of 28,000 accepted and rejected manuscripts in engineering and the life sciences. By following reviewers’ value judgments and editorial decisions, we come to a different view of how epistemic cultures are practiced in journal science. Instead of a consensual dialogue revealing salient norms, we find reviewers differently weigh (“commensurate”) their judgments to attribute value to works. Their pluralistic viewpoints elevate uncertainty about the work, and editors respond by aligning with the most negative of reviewers. Surprisingly, we observe engineers and life scientists find the same epistemic criteria are salient, valued, and influential, with novelty and accuracy being primary. These results underscore how contingency and uncertainty are structural features of STEM peer review and essential to its effectiveness and legitimacy.",

          "title": "How Religious Subcultures Interact with Gender to Shape Educational Trajectories: A Rejoinder to Brady, Luft, and Zuckerman Sivan",
          "authors": "Ilana M. Horwitz, Kaylee T. Matheny, Krystal Laryea, Landon Schnabel",
          "abstract": "We respond to Brady, Luft, and Zuckerman Sivan’s critique of how religious subcultures—particularly Jewish upbringing—shape educational attainment. Their reanalysis, while differently specified, reinforces our central finding: adolescents with Jewish upbringing demonstrate higher rates of college completion and selective institution attendance. We defend our use of a multidimensional SES index—including income, education, and occupational prestige—grounded in stratification research, and we consider the theoretical and empirical utility of their proposed alternatives. Yet their replication overlooks the qualitative evidence central to our argument: the role of self-concept congruence, or the alignment between one’s identity and educational trajectory. Among girls with at least one Jewish parent, we find that attending a selective college is not simply an instrumental goal but part of who they envision themselves becoming. This congruence is shaped by a habitus rooted not only in social class but also in Jewish upbringing. In contrast, similarly positioned non-Jewish peers do not express the same identity-education alignment. We also respond to their concern that our work risks essentialism or reflects “culture of poverty” arguments. Our study explicitly avoids attributing educational outcomes to ascribed group identity. Instead, we identify clear, transferable mechanisms, including habitus and self-concept congruence, through which religious subcultures influence educational trajectories. These mechanisms are socially transmitted, shaped by family culture and broader structural contexts, and portable across groups and settings. By addressing these critiques, we contribute to debates about how culture shapes stratification without reducing outcomes to group-based determinism.",

          "authors": "Laura Acosta",
          "abstract": "Contrary to the classical sociological view that social conflict reinforces preexisting political divisions, this article argues that civil war can reinvent them. I examine this phenomenon through the evolution of civil wars in Colombia in the mid-twentieth century, a period initially marked by a Liberal–Conservative conflict that developed into a civil war between the state and communist guerrillas. Drawing on archival records, oral histories of civilians and combatants, and newspapers, I demonstrate that when one party invents an “imagined third”—an actor, external to the original conflict dyad, who lacks any connection to an actual military or political threat—to blame for the violence in civil war, a self-fulfilling logic turns the imagined third into a tangible enemy of the nation, thereby creating a new fault line. In Colombia, politicians’ baseless accusations and preemptive actions against Communists activated three mechanisms of fault line formation—enemy legitimation, boundary demarcation, and identity shift—that materialized the very revolutionary threats they claimed to prevent. This analytic framework of fault line formation in civil war opens new avenues for examining how political discourse can become self-fulfilling, how international threats are transformed into local enemies, and how wartime actors’ opportunities for action evolve—including the conditions necessary for sustained peace.",

          "authors": "Sam Parsons, Lucinda Platt",
          "abstract": "Across the world, disabled working-age adults face substantial labour market disadvantage, though with variation by age. For example, in the UK, the disability employment gap remains greater among those who are older. To investigate whether this means that more recent cohorts face less disadvantage or instead captures a greater impact of disability at older ages, we compare two British cohorts born in 1958 and 1989/90 identified with special educational needs or disability (SEND) in childhood. SEND functions as a classification bounded by the institutional context, which recognises particular conditions and forms of impairment as salient within the school context for a given time and system. By using a measure of disability prior to labour market entry we can compare employment gaps in youth across the two cohorts independently of subsequent labour market impacts on disability onset. We find that by age 25, those from both birth cohorts, particularly women, face substantial economic disadvantage. The gaps are, however, smaller for the younger cohort. While they increase in mid-life for the older cohort they show some convergence by age 50. Qualifications and social background explain less of the gap for the older cohort and for women from the younger one.",

          "authors": "Aleksandra Grzymała-Kazłowska, Anna Skiba, Julia Ostrowska",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes the generating of emotional energy in and out of homestay encounters involving Poles offering accommodation and Ukrainians fleeing the war. Starting from the literature on homestay support for refugees and community sponsorship, the paper utilizes and develops Collins' notion of emotional energy as a theoretical framework. We draw on 57 in-depth interviews conducted in three waves between April 2022 and August 2023 with Polish citizens who offered accommodation to forced migrants from Ukraine, usually co-living with them. The narrations on the participants' experiences were analyzed on three levels: micro (individual), meso (group) and macro (society). We argue that these encounters might produce high and low emotional energy extending beyond merely helping the migrants, with diverse impacts on those involved. Of crucial importance for the relationship during homestay encounters and their consequences turned out to be not so much the differences and similarities between the sides involved but, rather, a willingness by both parties to become involved in interaction rituals and to adjust (also on an emotional level). The results demonstrate the significance of expectations as well as preparation and support for both sides during homestay hosting.",

          "authors": "Maria Rubio-Cabañez, Josep Serrano-Serrat",
          "abstract": "This study examines how childhood emotions, traits, and behaviours influence concerns about gender inequality and racism in young adulthood. Drawing on the social psychology and social science literature, it examines whether childhood behavioural traits measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) influence concerns about discrimination. Using the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal dataset, the study shows that, among native males, internalizing behaviours in childhood (such as loneliness and frequent worry) correlate positively with later concerns about discrimination, while externalizing behaviours (such as strong temperament and impulsivity) show a negative correlation. Finally, native males with stronger prosocial traits are more concerned about racism. However, for females and foreigners—social groups that are typically discriminated against—these associations are not statistically significant. The results suggest that childhood behavioural traits shape political attitudes before political preferences crystallize and underscore the importance of understanding the developmental origins of discrimination concerns.",

          "title": "The role of parental attitudes and behaviour in the development of adolescents’ gender housework stereotypes",
          "authors": "Aleš Kudrnáč, Alexander Davenport",
          "abstract": "The enduring imbalance in the distribution of housework between men and women persists as a factor perpetuating gender inequality. Attitudes acquired during the ‘formative years’ often persist into adulthood; thus, it is crucial to identify the ways in which individuals develop gender norms during adolescence. While studies have provided convincing evidence that parents influence their children’s support for gender equality, both through passing on their attitudes directly and by setting an example through behaviours, we still know very little about how these influences affect the development of gender stereotypes about housework among adolescents. We build on social learning theory and existing literature to test if parents’ gender attitudes and distribution of housework influence whether their children stereotypically associate certain chores with men or women. In addition, we propose a further parental influence on their children’s gender stereotypes: the nature of parental decision-making arrangements. Using four waves of the Czech Household Panel Survey, we find evidence that all three factors affect adolescents’ housework gender stereotypes. Notably, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating the importance of consensual decision-making arrangements in promoting lower gender stereotypes in adolescence. Furthermore, we find that the effect of housework distribution is moderated by adolescents’ gender.",

          "authors": "Yifeng Wan",
          "abstract": "Who receives child custody—mother, father, or both—offers insight into family institutions and gender dynamics. Analyzing over 220,000 digitized divorce decrees from China’s patrilineal family system, this study reveals a paradox: despite mothers serving as primary caregivers, fathers more frequently obtain custody. Two institutional pillars of patrilineage explain this outcome. First, paternal grandparents commonly assume childcare responsibilities as fathers’ proxies, reducing mothers’ custody prospects. Second, fathers’ predominant ownership of the marital home creates additional barriers for mothers seeking custody. This paternal advantage intensifies in cases involving sons and in rural areas. Among families with multiple children, split custody arrangements predominate, typically allocating sons to fathers and daughters to mothers. These findings illuminate the interplay between family law, patrilineal tradition, and gender inequality.",

          "authors": "Edvard Nergård Larsen, Aleksander Å Madsen, Are Skeie Hermansen",
          "abstract": "How does the presence of immigrant coworkers shape the likelihood that minority employees stay or leave their jobs? This study uses linked employer–employee administrative data covering the entire Norwegian labor market to investigate how workplace immigrant concentration influences turnover among immigrants and their native-born children. Building on theories of organizational demography, we ask whether working alongside a higher share of immigrant-background coworkers fosters employee retention—consistent with mechanisms of social contact and homophily—or instead prompts workplace exit, as suggested by group threat and competition theories. Our findings reveal that greater representation of immigrant-background coworkers significantly reduces turnover among immigrants, especially when contact occurs within same-skill occupations. The exposure effects reducing the likelihood of workplace exit are also stronger when immigrant-background employees share the same national origin with their minority coworkers and when minorities are better represented among top earners in the organization. For children of immigrants, the effects of coworker composition are weaker, consistent with theories of assimilation and the weakening of ethnic boundaries across generations. Taken together, these results support social contact theories, which claim that a more inclusive work environment and coworker support in more ethnically diverse workplace contexts foster organizational attachment and reduce turnover among immigrant-background minority employees. However, minority employees’ increased retention in organizations with higher immigrant concentration may also reinforce patterns of ethnic workplace segregation.",

          "title": "Beyond the Diagonal Reference Model: Critiques and New Directions in the Analysis of Mobility Effects",
          "authors": "Ethan Fosse, Fabian T. Pfeffer",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade there has been a striking increase in the number of quantitative studies examining the effects of social mobility, with almost all based on the diagonal reference model (DRM). We make four main contributions to this rapidly expanding literature. First, we show that under plausible values of mobility effects, the DRM will, in many cases, implicitly force the underlying mobility linear effect toward zero. In addition, we show both mathematically and through simulations that the mobility effects estimated by the DRM are sensitive to the size and sign of the origin and destination linear effects, often in ways that are unlikely to be intuitive to applied researchers. This finding clarifies why, contrary to expectations, applied researchers have generally found mixed evidence of mobility effects. Second, we generalize the identification problem of conventional mobility effect models by showing that the DRM and related methods can be viewed as special cases of a bounding analysis, where identification is achieved by invoking extremely strong assumptions. Finally, and importantly, we present a new framework for the analysis of mobility tables based on the identification and estimation of joint parameter sets, introducing what we call the structural and dynamic inequality model. We show that this model is fully identified, relies on much weaker assumptions than conventional models of mobility effects, and can be treated both as a descriptive model and, if additional assumptions are invoked, as a causal model. We conclude with an agenda for further research on the consequences of socioeconomic mobility.",

This article proposes an alternative flexible causal approach, where we estimate the cumulative hazard, not the hazard itself, using an additive or “exponential-additive” specification with freely time-varying parameters. Our approach includes the proportional hazard as a highly special case that allows only monotonic survival probability ratios (SPR’s), while our approach allows any shape of SPR’s. An empirical analysis on recidivism using the duration until re-arrest after prison release on parole/probation is provided, where the SPR trajectory is not monotonic, but has an inverted-U shape over time.",
