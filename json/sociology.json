          "title": "Uneven Mixing, Network Segregation, and Immigrant Integration",
          "authors": "Linda Zhao",
          "abstract": "Classical theories of immigration posit that widespread intermixing between immigrants and natives is at the crux of immigrant integration, but do not specify what that looks like using network terminology. This study introduces the concept of uneven mixing, which captures variation in the number of intergroup ties that individuals hold in a network, as a strategy for assessing meaningful integration. A low level of uneven mixing represents more widespread intergroup ties, which is analogous to “blurred boundaries” that imply a less rigid sense of “us” versus “them.” In contrast, a high level of uneven mixing occurs when just a few individuals appear to cross over to the other side of otherwise unambiguous group boundaries. Using the case of classroom friendships, I show that native students embedded in more unevenly mixed networks are more closed off to immigrant cultures and view immigrants less favorably, even after accounting for their personal ties to immigrant classmates and the overall number of native–immigrant ties in the classroom. These patterns underscore the importance of considering the structure of intergroup ties when analyzing the relationship between networks and attitudinal integration. While this study focuses on immigrant integration, the approach used here is likely to advance knowledge on any kind of social integration that requires widespread intermixing across groups.",

          "title": "Frame Backfire: The Trouble with Civil Rights Appeals in the Contemporary United States",
          "authors": "Fabiana Silva, Irene Bloemraad, Kim Voss",
          "abstract": "Many scholars and activists consider civil rights to be a powerful, effective way to frame diverse causes, but do civil rights claims actually resonate? Building on social movements, collective memory, and public opinion scholarship, we conceptualize civil rights claims in three non-mutually-exclusive ways: as a highly resonant “master frame” grounded in core American ideals of equal rights, as an appeal to the idealized memory of the Civil Rights Movement, and as racialized messaging that is likely to provoke backlash. Using these conceptualizations, we derive expectations about the effectiveness of civil rights claims across diverse issues, beneficiaries, and audiences, which we test using two large-scale survey experiments. Respondents viewed “civil rights” very positively in the abstract and broadly agreed about the meaning in both closed and open-ended survey responses: civil rights are about ensuring equal rights and treatment, rather than addressing material needs. Yet, surprisingly, framing contemporary problems—even unequal treatment—as civil rights violations reduced support for government intervention. Indeed, we find widespread frame backfire : civil rights framing was counterproductive across issues (material deprivation, unequal treatment), beneficiaries (African Americans, Mexican Americans, White Americans, undocumented Mexican immigrants), and audiences (liberals, conservatives, Whites, African Americans, Latinos). Given the consistently negative effects across respondents, these findings cannot be adequately explained as racialized backlash. Instead, we propose that civil rights claims evoke comparisons to the historic Civil Rights Movement, making contemporary hardships appear less significant and prompting unfavorable contrasts with idealized claims-making of the past. Our findings challenge assumptions that frames resonate when they align with audiences’ values or appeal to positive collective memories; indeed, invoking idealized memories risks undermining support for contemporary causes.",

          "authors": "Olle Folke, Johanna Rickne",
          "abstract": "This paper describes sexual harassment risks from two groups of perpetrators in Swedish nationally representative survey data. We find that both women and men face elevated risks of intraorganizational sexual harassment from colleagues or manager when working in occupations dominated by the opposite sex. In contrast, they face elevated risks of extraorganizational harassment from outside groups like patients, customers, or clients when working in women-dominated occupations. Amounts of interpersonal contacts with potential perpetrators appears to be a relevant mechanism behind these patterns: gender minorities in occupations have more workplace interactions with individuals of the opposite sex, and workers in women-dominated occupations have more interactions with outside groups. The results also suggest that gender norms on occupation choice further contribute to the victimization of gender minorities at the hands of both perpetrator groups.",

          "authors": "Mike Vuolo, Sadé L. Lindsay, Vincent J. Roscigno, Shawn D. Bushway",
          "abstract": "Randomized audits and correspondence studies are widely regarded as a “gold standard” for capturing discrimination and bias. However, gatekeepers (e.g., employers) are the analytic unit even though stated implications often center on group-level inequalities. Employing simple rules, we show that audits have the potential to uncover applicant-side inequalities and burdens beyond the gatekeeper biases standardly reported. Specifically, applicants from groups facing lower callback rates must submit more applications to ensure an eventual callback, have fewer opportunities to choose from, and face higher uncertainty regarding how many applications to submit. These results reflect several sequential and cumulative stratification processes “real-world” applicants face that warrant attention in conventional audit reporting. Our approach can be straightforwardly applied and, we show, is particularly pertinent for employment relative to other institutional domains (e.g., education, religion). We discuss the methodological and theoretical relevance of our suggested extensions and the implications for the study of inequality, discrimination, and social closure.",

          "title": "Updating “The Future of Coding”: Qualitative Coding with Generative Large Language Models",
          "authors": "Nga Than, Leanne Fan, Tina Law, Laura K. Nelson, Leslie McCall",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade, social scientists have adapted computational methods for qualitative text analysis, with the hope that they can match the accuracy and reliability of hand coding. The emergence of GPT and open-source generative large language models (LLMs) has transformed this process by shifting from programming to engaging with models using natural language, potentially mimicking the in-depth, inductive, and/or iterative process of qualitative analysis. We test the ability of generative LLMs to replicate and augment traditional qualitative coding, experimenting with multiple prompt structures across four closed- and open-source generative LLMs and proposing a workflow for conducting qualitative coding with generative LLMs. We find that LLMs can perform nearly as well as prior supervised machine learning models in accurately matching hand-coding output. Moreover, using generative LLMs as a natural language interlocutor closely replicates traditional qualitative methods, indicating their potential to transform the qualitative research process, despite ongoing challenges.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize social science research. However, researchers face the difficult challenge of choosing a specific AI model, often without social science-specific guidance. To demonstrate the importance of this choice, we present an evaluation of the effect of alignment, or human-driven modification, on the ability of large language models (LLMs) to simulate the attitudes of human populations (sometimes called silicon sampling ). We benchmark aligned and unaligned versions of six open-source LLMs against each other and compare them to similar responses by humans. Our results suggest that model alignment impacts output in predictable ways, with implications for prompting, task completion, and the substantive content of LLM-based results. We conclude that researchers must be aware of the complex ways in which model training affects their research and carefully consider model choice for each project. We discuss future steps to improve how social scientists work with generative AI tools.",

          "authors": "Yoosoon Chang, Steven N. Durlauf, Bo Hu, Joon Y. Park",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a fully nonparametric model to investigate the dynamics of intergenerational income mobility for discrete outcomes. In our model, an individual’s income class probabilities depend on parental income in a manner that accommodates nonlinearities and interactions among various individual and parental characteristics, including race, education, and parental age at childbearing, and so generalizes Markov chain mobility models. We show how the model may be estimated using kernel techniques from machine learning. Utilizing data from the panel study of income dynamics, we show how race, parental education, and mother’s age at birth interact with family income to determine mobility between generations.",
