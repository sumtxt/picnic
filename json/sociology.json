          "title": "Toward a Unified Conceptualization of Social Capital",
          "authors": "Paulina Erices-Ocampo, Miranda J. Lubbers, jimi adams",
          "abstract": "Social capital is among the most broadly used concepts in social science. Despite its shared understanding as beneficial resources available from the connections between people, authors vary widely in their conceptualizations of social capital. To extract clarity from these disparate perspectives, we offer a systematic framework for conceptualizing social capital, which identifies three primary theoretical dimensions of scholars’ conceptualizations of social capital: ( a ) where beneficial resources reside, ranging from within individuals to the relationships between individuals; ( b ) beneficial network structure, differentiating closure from brokerage arrangements; and ( c ) the level to which rewards accrue, distinguishing individual from collective benefits. We illustrate how combining these dimensions produces a unifying perspective that fosters reintegrating social capital's disconnected conceptualizations. Finally, we draw on this framework to both reconcile seeming contradictions and gaps in social capital scholarship, and provide a principled means for prioritizing questions for future developments of social capital.",

          "title": "Black and White Wealth Differentials in the United States: Explaining and Recreating Persistent Inequality",
          "authors": "Fenaba R. Addo, Daniel Auguste",
          "abstract": "This review explores research on the sources of Black and White wealth and debt differentials and how these differentials recreate inequalities in both wealth and nonwealth outcomes. We discuss how the relationship between wealth and life outcomes is bidirectional, yet studies of racial wealth inequality overwhelmingly focus on wealth as an outcome. We suggest that studies that examine the relationship from wealth to life outcomes are necessary to enable full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the production and reproduction of racial wealth inequality and to identify policies in the United States to reduce racial inequality. We highlight research on entrepreneurship, race, and wealth to illustrate these dynamics. We conclude with a call for scholars to focus on community-level wealth, given scholarly and policy interests in closing the racial wealth gap.",

          "title": "Reference Group Effects and Parental Educational Expectations: Can Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effects Explain Immigrant Parents' High Expectations?",
          "authors": "Nora Huth-Stöckle, Schunck Reinhard, Eva Zschirnt",
          "abstract": "Taking the well-documented high educational expectations among immigrant parents as a point of departure, we explore how average achievement in a class influences parental educational expectations. Specifically, we investigate whether reference group (i.e., big-fish-little-pond) effects can account for immigrant parents' higher educational expectations for their children compared to nonimmigrant parents. We address this question by applying a multilevel (mediation) analysis to a representative sample of German fourth graders and their parents. To test how robust our findings are to our data-analytical decisions, we additionally conduct a multiverse analysis. We find consistent evidence across 4,608 model specifications that parents' educational expectations are higher when their child attends a low-achieving class compared to a high-achieving class, even after controlling for students' individual school performance, socioeconomic background, and a variety of performance related confounders. Furthermore, (average) class achievement partially mediates the relationship between immigrant status and parental expectations. Students with immigrant parents are more likely to attend low-achieving classes, which is positively related to higher parental expectations. Our results suggest that big-fish-little-pond effects also operate in parents' evaluation processes of their children's educational attainment.",

          "authors": "Laura Fürsich, Benjamin F Jarvis",
          "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that social networks matter not only for long-distance moves but also for short-distance residential mobility. And the emerging structural sorting perspective is integrating networks into understandings of segregation processes. We add to this literature by considering how former school peers influence residential choices. We use Swedish register data describing the residential histories of cohorts of students who attended the same primary or secondary schools in Sweden. We trace their residential choices in young adulthood and estimate the effect of distance to peers on these choices. To account for selection, we use the spatial configuration of older cohorts who attended the same schools to adjust for peer similarity on unobserved preferences and attitudes. Using conditional logistic regression models of residential destinations, we find that individuals are more likely to choose a neighbourhood close to former school peers. Drawing on a linked lives perspective, we also consider how the peer effects change over the early adult life-course. The models imply that other networks can displace the social influence of primary and secondary school peers. While our analysis does not consider segregation as an outcome, our results suggest that schools may play a role in reproducing patterns of segregation within and between generations.",

          "title": "Much to lose, no credentials to prove it – Educational aspirations and intentions of adult refugees as means of occupational status re-attainment",
          "authors": "Marvin Bürmann, Dorian Tsolak",
          "abstract": "We analyse how educational aspirations and intentions of adult refugees in Germany are shaped by their foreign educational credentials and their previous occupational status. Because the allocation of medium-skilled jobs on the German labour market heavily relies on a variety of credentials, unlike in the countries of origin, where skills are usually acquired on the job but not formally certified, refugees often cannot provide the credentials required to work in their previous job. We use status allocation theory and the concept of relative risk aversion to formulate expectations as to why some refugees may be more inclined to emit higher educational aspirations. Based on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees we first show that the German labour market is stratified regarding educational credentials, while both refugees without and with medium professional credentials occupied positions with a very similar status in their countries of origin. Based on regression models, we show that in contrast to refugees with professional credentials, refugees without credentials have higher educational aspirations and intentions if they occupied high status positions in their country of origin. However, additional analyses did not reveal this positive effect for female refugees. We therefore conclude that especially male refugees who have much to lose, see additional education as a salient way to avoid occupational status downgrades after migration. We conclude with a discussion of gender-specific mechanisms potentially at play shortly after migration and discuss the generalizability of our findings to other types and contexts of migration.",

          "authors": "Susanne Strauss, Ole Brüggemann, Julia Lang",
          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that gender pay gaps are perceived as fair or justified, not only by men but also by women. In this paper we contribute to the discussion of a biased evaluation of fair wages and assess whether the organizational context has an impact on fairness perceptions. We use unique data from a vignette study that was part of a representative online survey of 5,556 employees in 532 larger firms (&amp;gt; 100 employees) in Germany which are merged to administrative data. This allows us to consider different contextual factors at both the workgroup level and the firm level. In contrast to older studies we find that women tend to evaluate wages of female workers as unfairly too low. Moreover, the perception of (un)fair wages depends on the organizational context. Female supervisors and collective bargaining agreements in firms increase the likelihood that female employees evaluate other women’s wages as unfairly low. When employees talk about their wages with their colleagues, they are more likely to judge the wages of co-workers as unfairly low.",

          "title": "How perceived daycare quality shapes norms around daycare use and parental employment: experimental evidence from Germany",
          "authors": "Marie-Fleur Philipp, Silke Büchau, Pia S Schober, Viktoria Werner, C Katharina Spiess",
          "abstract": "Not only the quantity of formal daycare provision for young children, but also its quality has become an issue of political concern. This experimental study investigates how a hypothetical improvement in the perceived quality of daycare facilities shapes normative judgements regarding daycare use and working hours for parents with young children in Germany. The analysis is framed with theoretical concepts of ideals and accommodations of childcare and social norm theory. We draw on a factorial survey experiment implemented in 2019/2020 in the German Family Panel (pairfam) measuring underlying work-care norms for a couple with a 15-month-old child under different contextual conditions. Ordered logistic and linear multilevel regressions were conducted with 5,333 respondents. On average, high (vs. medium) hypothetical daycare quality for young children leads respondents to recommend greater daycare use and longer working hours for mothers and fathers by about 1 hour per week. Respondents who hold more egalitarian gender beliefs, those with tertiary education, native Germans and parents tend to respond more strongly to higher daycare quality by increasing their support for full-day daycare use. The results consistently point to the relevance of high quality for increasing the acceptance of formal daycare.",

          "title": "Colonial legacy and contemporary civil violence: a global study from 1960 to 2018",
          "authors": "Christopher Kollmeyer",
          "abstract": "This study assesses whether the legacy of colonialism continues to influence patterns of civil violence in the contemporary era. A large and established quantitative literature attributes civil violence to low levels of economic development and limited political rights, but few quantitative studies consider whether colonial legacy plays an enduring role in such conflicts. This is surprising given the substantial evidence showing that colonialism impeded long-run development in many parts of the world. Drawing on ideas from macro-comparative sociology, institutional economics, and political science, the study develops several theoretical expectations regarding colonialism’s effect on contemporary civil violence. These ideas are tested with a global sample of 152 countries observed annually from 1960 to 2018. Results from logistic regression models support the contention that (1) post-colonial societies are more prone to civil violence than non-colonized societies, that (2) ex-British colonies are especially prone to ethnic-based civil violence while ex-Spanish colonies are especially prone to socio-economic-based civil violence, and that (3) these historical effects change and evolve but never fully abate. This latter finding implies that elevated levels of civil violence are a path-dependent legacy of colonialism. The study ends by running robustness checks and discussing the theoretical implications of the study’s findings, in particular reflecting on our understanding of the long-run consequences of colonialism.",

          "title": "Gentrification in small cities: growth coalitions, civic engagement, and political participation",
          "authors": "Richard E Ocejo",
          "abstract": "Most gentrification research uses large cities as cases to make sense of how the process unfolds, while studies of gentrification in nonmetropolises tend to focus on the process’s similarities across differently-sized municipalities. Unexplained is how the distinct characteristics of differently-sized places inform how the process unfolds. Based on interviews with eighty-five stakeholders and four years of ethnographic fieldwork in a small city experiencing gentrification, this article advances a new understanding of the process by analyzing and theorizing the role of scale in shaping the social and political dynamics behind it. It argues that gentrification in small cities is different from what the process looks like in other places for two reasons. First, they offer conditions that facilitate small-scale actors who wish to form gentrification stakeholder-led growth coalitions. Second, they offer opportunities for these actors to get civically and politically involved in municipal government in direct, influential ways. While in decision-making roles, they effectively help to advance gentrification in their neighborhoods to better suit their economic interests and cultural preferences. By focusing on how place characteristics structure urban processes, specifically conditions in gentrifying small cities, and this article reveals the distinct features of gentrification in nonmetropolises.",

          "title": "Deep Learning With DAGs",
          "authors": "Sourabh Balgi, Adel Daoud, Jose M. Peña, Geoffrey T. Wodtke, Jesse Zhou",
          "abstract": "Social science theories often postulate systems of causal relationships among variables, which are commonly represented using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). As non-parametric causal models, DAGs require no assumptions about the functional form of the hypothesized relationships. Nevertheless, to simplify empirical evaluation, researchers typically invoke such assumptions anyway, even though they are often arbitrary and do not reflect any theoretical content or prior knowledge. Moreover, functional form assumptions can engender bias, whenever they fail to accurately capture the true complexity of the system. In this article, we introduce causal-graphical normalizing flows (cGNFs), a novel approach to causal inference that leverages deep neural networks to empirically evaluate theories represented as DAGs. Unlike conventional methods, cGNFs model the full joint distribution of the data using a DAG specified by the analyst, without relying on stringent assumptions about functional form. This enables flexible, non-parametric estimation of any causal estimand identified from the DAG, including total effects, direct and indirect effects, and path-specific effects. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of Blau and Duncan’s ( 1967 ) model of status attainment and Zhou’s ( 2019 ) model of controlled mobility. The article concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for future development.",
