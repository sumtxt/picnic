          "title": "Far-right contention in civil society: multiple lenses on action repertoires, actors, and targets",
          "authors": "Hans Jonas Gunzelmann, Christin Jänicke",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade, the far right has been on the rise in civil societies across Europe. Civil society organizations have been challenged by the far right in governments, political parties, and within their own ranks. However, there is little systematic research on how the far right stirs conflict within civil society. Civil society research has tended to ignore ‘uncivil’ society and has instead focused on social capital and cohesion. Research on the noninstitutional side of the far right has been growing but has largely neglected the consequences for established civil society organizations and their members. This article addresses these blind spots by providing a conceptual framework and a methodology for studying the far right in civil society, which is applied to a case study. First, we construct a conceptual framework that adapts the contentious politics paradigm to the study of civil society. We delineate far-right contention within civil society and construct typologies of the action repertoires, actors, and targets. Second, we develop a methodology that combines different lenses to expand our view on far-right contention in civil society. We propose a mixed-methods research design for mapping far-right contentious events. Third, we apply our conceptual framework and methodology to the case of Germany by empirically mapping the action repertoires, actors and targets. Our findings fundamentally shift the scholarly understanding of the far right in civil society: We find that far-right contention in civil society goes well beyond adversarial actions by far-right actors. This has important implications for researchers and practitioners.",

          "title": "Transmorphic organizations: racial segregation and discrimination against LGBTQ students at Christian colleges and universities",
          "authors": "Jonathan S Coley, Gabby Gomez",
          "abstract": "Do organizations that previously discriminated against one marginalized group go on to discriminate against other marginalized groups? If so, why and under what conditions? We address this question by developing a theory of transmorphic organizations, which suggests that organizations’ likelihood of discriminating against different groups over time will be contingent on their associated moral schemas and organizational identities. We test this theory by analyzing a unique, comprehensive dataset of discriminatory policies at 526 Christian colleges and universities in the United States, a set of organizations that has routinely been exempted from federal non-discrimination policies. Through logistic regression analyses, we uncover an association between schools’ historical policies on race and contemporary policies on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students among certain types of Christian colleges and universities. Specifically, evangelical Protestant colleges and universities that discriminated against Black students typically formally discriminate against LGBTQ students, whereas mainline Protestant and Catholic colleges and universities that discriminated against Black students rarely formally discriminate against LGBTQ students. We attribute this divergence to the increasingly conservative, individualist moral schemas of evangelical Protestants in general and the relatively exclusive organizational identities of evangelical Protestant colleges and universities. Our study’s findings hold implications for organizational theories of inequality and contribute to ongoing research on religion, race, LGBTQ rights, and higher education.",

          "abstract": "We conceptualize within job group income distributions as the outcome of claims-making over organizational resources. We examine same job group co-workers by race/gender in all U.S. state and local government workplaces. Findings show that 81% of the time White men earn more than the average worker with whom they share a workplace and job group. Conversely, Black and Hispanic women are disadvantaged respectively 83% and 84% of the time. On average White men’s earnings are higher when they share jobs with almost all other status groups, most robustly with all women and Black men. White women see consistent earnings advantages when their co-workers are Black or Hispanic women, but often also profit when working with Black men. Other race/gender groups experience more variation in their earnings relative to co-workers, but within racial groups men tend to benefit from same race women co-workers. We further explore variation in these patterns based on organizational racialization, finding that when managers are predominantly Black or Hispanic, White earning advantages shrink. This advantage is not sensitive to whether management is dominated by White men or White women.",

          "title": "Diverging pathways: first-year college courses and the gender gap in STEM degree attainment",
          "authors": "Dafna Gelbgiser, Oded Mcdossi",
          "abstract": "Gender differences in occupational plans in high school are an important predictor of the low representation of women among degree recipients in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Yet even among STEM-aspiring students, women are substantially less likely than men to obtain a STEM degree. Building on the educational literature on “curricular momentum” and recent evidence of the social and academic contexts of STEM introductory courses, this paper sheds light on the role played by first-year college courses in the diverging career pathways of men and women. Drawing on detailed transcript information of a nationally representative sample of US college students, we demonstrate that the proportion of STEM courses college students take during their first year and the gendered association between these courses and attainment are key explanations of gender differences in STEM degree attainment. Among students with similar STEM plans, men take a higher proportion of STEM courses than women, contributing to their advantage in STEM attainment. Even more consequential is the gendered association between STEM courses and degree attainment. The proportion of STEM courses in the first year of college is more predictive of men’s attainment than women’s, especially among STEM-oriented students. These findings suggest colleges should look closely at the courses men and women take in their first year and ensure the institutional and social contexts of introductory STEM courses allow all students to pursue their aspirations.",

          "authors": "Bent Nielsen",
          "abstract": "Age-period-cohort analysis is often done in the context of two samples. This could be samples for women and men or for two countries. It is of interest to ask if some time effects could be common across samples. We clarify how the well-known age-period-cohort problem for one sample carries over to the two sample situation. This is done through a reparametrization in terms of parameters that are invariant to the identification issues. The new parametrization shows which hypotheses can be tested and their degrees of freedom. Testable hypotheses can be formulated for non-linear effects, but not for the linear parts of the individual time effects. This conclusion remains when imposing cross-sample restrictions. The analysis is extended to the mixed frequency situation where age and period are measured at different scales. As an empirical illustration a study of Swiss suicide rates is revisited.",

          "title": "The Statistical Advantages of Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy for Estimating Intersectional Inequalities",
          "authors": "George Leckie, Andrew Bell, Juan Merlo, SV Subramanian, Clare Evans",
          "abstract": "Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) is a multilevel regression approach grounded in intersectionality theory. It examines inequalities across intersections of social identities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, class) and is argued to provide more accurate predictions of intersectional means than conventional methods that estimate group means directly or via regressions with all interactions. This study evaluates that claim using analytic expressions and an empirical illustration to compare simple and MAIHDA-predicted means against population values. Predictive accuracy is assessed via variance, correlation, bias, and mean squared error. Results show that MAIHDA estimates generally outperform simple means, particularly when decomposing intersectional means into additive and non-additive identity effects. The magnitude of the advantage depends on inequality patterns and group sample sizes. MAIHDA is especially valuable when inequalities are subtle or data for marginalized intersections are sparse—conditions common in practice. These findings highlight MAIHDA's practical relevance for quantitative intersectionality research.",
