          "abstract": "Researchers are increasingly examining policy officials’ perceptions of public opinion on climate change. However, limited research has examined the perceptions of individuals who participate in international-level environmental policy meetings. Here we show that 2024 United Nations Environment Assembly attendees ( N = 191) underestimate global public willingness to contribute 1% of their personal income to climate action by nearly half on average (37% versus 69% in actuality). This finding suggests that those who are directly and indirectly involved in setting global environmental policies may have a stronger public mandate for ambitious climate action than they realize. We discuss the implications of this finding and highlight the need for further research on international policy actors’ perceptions of public opinion; the factors that shape these perceptions; and how these perceptions may influence policy outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Energy insecurity, or the inability to afford energy needs, affects most low-income households in the United States and leads to risky choices and additional insecurities including food and health. Although there are government programs designed to provide relief from energy insecurity, eligibility is usually determined by household income, and those with incomes close to the threshold face uncertainty or may be left out. In many cases, these households turn to energy-limiting behaviors as a strategy to lower their electric utility bills. Here we explore the relationship between energy insecurity and energy-limiting behaviors and investigate alternative solutions such as energy storage and rooftop solar. This analysis demonstrates that solar and energy storage can offset two-thirds of the bill savings that households could attain through severe energy-limiting behavior. These systems could complement existing energy assistance programs to provide long-term bill relief, enabling occupants to live in their homes with comfort and dignity.",

          "abstract": "Marine heatwaves are prolonged periods of extreme ocean warming that can strongly impact marine ecosystems, fisheries, and aquaculture. In August 2024, northern Norway experienced one of its most intense marine heatwaves on record, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 18 °C—more than 4 °C above the long-term average. This event contributed to an unprecedented salmon lice outbreak at aquaculture sites, causing increased fish mortality and economic losses. Here we use numerical ocean model hindcast data, atmospheric reanalysis data, and in situ observations to identify the factors behind this event. Local weather conditions, including high solar radiation, unusually warm air temperatures, and weak winds, caused increased heat transfer to the sea surface and reduced ocean mixing. Additionally, large-scale atmospheric pressure patterns intensified warm air advection and freshwater transport along the coast, reinforcing local stratification and warming. These findings highlight the importance of advancing regional marine heatwave forecasting to support fisheries and aquaculture resilience under a warming climate.",

          "abstract": "Mesopelagic fish are integral to ocean food webs and play an important role in carbon transport through their vertical migration behavior. Ocean deoxygenation caused by anthropogenic warming is expected to pose severe threats to mesopelagic fauna by enhancing physical stress and changing predator-prey relationships. In agreement with this expectation, our fish otolith record in a Mediterranean sediment core shows near absence of mesopelagic species during Sapropel deposition between ~7 and ~10 thousand years ago, concurrent with high surface productivity and low oxygenation of mid-depth waters. Instead, the otolith record is dominated by fish species adapted to epipelagic habitats, including European anchovy ( Engraulis encrasicolus ) and silvery lightfish ( Maurolicus muelleri ). Subsequent reoxygenation starting ~7 thousand years ago is accompanied by a three-fold increase in total otolith abundance. The large majority of these are mesopelagic lanternfish (Myctophidae) that dominate the otolith assemblage from the middle-Holocene to the present. Our findings corroborate expectations that future expansion of midwater deoxygenation could severely deplete mesopelagic fish communities over the coming centuries, with major impacts on marine fisheries, marine conservation, ocean food web structure, carbon storage and other marine ecosystem services.",

          "abstract": "Summary Following a disaster, responders need to rapidly assess the extent of the damage. The prevailing view is that very-high-resolution optical satellite images can provide more accurate estimates of building damage than lower-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, we demonstrate that SAR-based damage proxy maps we produced after the 2023 Kahramanmaraş Türkiye earthquakes outperformed comparable maps derived from optical imagery. This finding held true for both a state-of-the art machine learning method and for visual interpretation. The SAR-based maps achieved an F1 performance score approximately twice as high as the optical-based maps (0.47 vs 0.24, 0.23 and 0.15). Additionally, SAR offers established advantages in both coverage and timeliness: SAR was able to image the entire affected area within ten days, whereas the very-high-resolution optical dataset covered only 5.4% of the SAR-covered area during the same timeframe. Using the largest ground dataset that we know of for any event, we show that the damage distribution captured by our SAR-based maps strongly correlates with the ground observations over a wide range of spatial scales from neighbourhoods (~1 km 2 ) to provinces (~10,000 km 2 ). Based on this experience, we argue that any reliable remote sensing-based damage assessment system should incorporate radar to complement other techniques.",

          "abstract": "Seagrass meadows are renowned for their associated ecosystem services and carbon sequestration capacity, with microorganisms playing a crucial role. However, the invasion of microplastics may disrupt these processes. Here, we conducted a one-month in-situ incubation of three prevalent types of microplastics in the seagrass meadow of Swan Lake, China. The results showed significant differences in microbial communities between the plastisphere and natural matrices. Cyanobacteria exhibited a strong preference for polyethylene terephthalate, and microplastic shape and their contact area with water may be key factors in shaping microbial communities. Meanwhile, microplastic invasion can shift carbon- and nitrogen-fixing microbes and related genes, thereby changing seagrass meadows’ carbon and nitrogen cycles. This may impact the carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass meadows and pose potential risks of water blooms. Additionally, the potential ecological risks posed by the large number of resistance genes adsorbed by microplastics in the ecosystem are also worthy of attention.",

          "abstract": "Seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Greenland’s coastal waters form the base of marine food webs and contribute to oceanic carbon uptake. In Qeqertarsuup Tunua, West Greenland, a secondary summertime bloom follows the Arctic spring bloom, enhancing annual primary productivity. Emerging evidence links this summer bloom to subglacial discharge from Sermeq Kujalleq, the most active glacier on the Greenland Ice Sheet. This discharge drives localized upwelling that may alleviate nutrient limitation in surface waters, yet this mechanism remains poorly quantified. Here, we employ a high-resolution biogeochemical model nested within a global state estimate to assess how discharge-driven upwelling influences primary productivity and carbon fluxes. We find that upwelling increases summer productivity by 15–40% in Qeqertarsuup Tunua, yet annual carbon dioxide uptake rises by only  ~3% due to reduced solubility in plume-upwelled waters. These findings suggest that intensifying ice sheet melt may alter Greenland’s coastal productivity and carbon cycling under future climate scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Forests not only regulate the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide but also shape local biophysical conditions by creating microclimates that buffer temperature extremes. However, ongoing deforestation and fragmentation are transforming forest interiors into edge environments, which may differ markedly in their microclimatic conditions and undermine local climate-regulating functions. Here, we quantify how proximity to forest edges alters thermal conditions across biomes and seasons using global satellite-derived surface temperature data from nearly 13 million sites. We find that forest edges are consistently warmer on average than interiors, with the magnitude of warming varying with biome type and season. During summer months, surface temperature at edges frequently exceeds the optimal temperature for vegetation productivity, particularly in tropical forests. These results suggest that continued loss of interior forest will reduce the capacity of remnant forests to buffer local climate conditions, potentially hampering ecosystem productivity and resilience.",

Yet, relief also limits the dimensions of small, frequent landslides in turn. But how local topography, lithology, and climate influence the size distribution and hazard of Earth’s largest terrestrial landslides remains unclear. Here we use Bayesian regression to estimate these effects on landslide volume, drawing on a worldwide sample of 411 cases, each involving &gt; 1 km 3 . Nearly two third of their total volume is volcanic and sedimentary rocks within 50 km of active fault zones, clustered in actively uplifting mountain belts and on volcanic plateaus. Volumetric estimates vary most distinctly with dominant topographic setting, regardless of local relief, general rock type, or contemporary climate. These largely negligible effects indicate that volume scaling statistics fail to capture differing bulk lithological properties, let alone a detection bias due to climatic controls on land cover, weathering, or erosion.",

We compile challenges and opportunities for the sustainable supply of these critical materials. Three types of electrolysers (alkaline, polymer electrolyte membrane, and solid oxide) and two types of fuel cells (polymer electrolyte membrane and solid oxide), along with eight associated critical materials (nickel, zirconium, platinum, iridium, titanium, lanthanum, yttrium, and strontium) are considered. Material supply sustainability is reviewed from six dimensions: supply disruption risk, environmental impact, social impact, resource depletion pressure, circularity, and substitutability. We show that the devices perform differently in the six dimensions. Major challenges for the alkaline electrolyser are resource depletion pressure and substitutability, while the challenge for polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysers is the supply disruption risk. Regarding solid oxide electrolysers, challenges are identified in supply disruption risk, resource depletion pressure, and circularity dimensions.",

However, vertical heat loss from the warm inflow to the cold upper ocean remains understudied. Here we use observations and numerical modeling to investigate mixing-induced vertical heat flux in a major trough, finding: (1) turbulent mixing transfers 1.7 W m −2 of heat to the upper ocean during observational period, potentially reducing sea ice growth by 0.2 m yr −1 ; and (2) mixing is modulated by undercurrent strength, with stronger undercurrent enhancing vertical shear across the on-shelf thermocline, promoting internal wave breaking and mixing. This flux is non-negligible in the on-shelf heat budget, particularly on annual and longer timescales. Our findings highlight the occurrence of vertical heat exchange over the Amundsen Sea shelf and indicate its potential role in modulating sea ice and ice-shelf melting.",

          "abstract": "Glaciar Perito Moreno, located in the Southern Patagonian Icefields, has long been considered stable despite widespread regional glacier retreat. Unlike neighboring glaciers, its frontal position and surface elevation remained relatively unchanged - until recently. For lake-terminating glaciers, retreat is strongly controlled by their basal topography, which remains poorly known for Glaciar Perito Moreno. Here, we present helicopter-borne ground-penetrating radar and bathymetric data, along with time series of surface elevation and velocity. We detect an acceleration in frontal surface lowering rates, from 0.34 m a − ¹ (2000–2019) to 5.5 m a − ¹ (2019–2024), accompanied by glacier acceleration and retreat. Using a simple numerical model projecting current thinning into the future, we demonstrate the potential for large scale buoyancy-driven retreat once the glacier recedes beyond a subglacial ridge. These findings reveal a high sensitivity to frontal dynamics and suggest that Glaciar Perito Moreno may now be following a similar pattern of other retreating lacustrine calving glaciers in Patagonia.",

Forecasting their spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems, carbon dioxide sequestration and other geoengineering applications. Here we propose a transformer neural network model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior microearthquake observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative microearthquake count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents of the microearthquake cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves R 2 &gt; 0.98 for the 1-s forecast horizon and R 2 &gt; 0.88 for the 15-s forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.",

          "abstract": "Around 80% of the world’s hard-rock lithium supply comes from pegmatites formed in the Archean Eon, yet our understanding of how Lithium-pegmatites form assumes magma source compositions not relevant to those Archean cratons hosting most of the giant Lithium-pegmatites. These models emphasize extraction of residual pegmatitic liquids from granitic magmas formed through melting sedimentary sequences. However, there is no evidence that such sequences provided the source to Lithium-rich granites and related giant Lithium-pegmatites in the Archean cratons of Western Australia. Economically important Lithium-pegmatites in these terrains form near faulted contacts between regional granites and basalt-dominated greenstone belts. Where spatially associated granites are Lithium-rich, they also contain unusually radiogenic Neodymium, resembling earlier, but spatially associated hydrated high-Magnesium diorites of mantle origin (sanukitoid). Intrusion of sanukitoids along crustal-scale structures prior to granitic magmatism induced Lithium-rich biotite alteration of the felsic basement beneath greenstone belts. Analogous to melting metasomatized lithospheric mantle to produce sanukitoids, melting of sanukitoid-infused basement beneath greenstone roots produced Lithium-rich granites and ultimately Lithium-pegmatite. Melting buried metasediments might produce Lithium-pegmatites, but most of the world’s giant Lithium-pegmatites formed along major crustal boundaries in response to the transfer of hydrous mantle-derived magma from metasomatized deep lithospheric domains in the Archean.",

Here, we test this hypothesis using age, trace element, and oxygen isotope data from zircon grains from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, the oldest known terrestrial minerals. The chemical composition of the analyzed grains reveals a significant shift at around 3.9 billion years ago that is consistent with a transition from shallow to deeper melting, which we posit corresponds to the change from a thermal regime dominated by impacts to one dominated by heat loss from Earth’s interior. This change permitted continental crust to thicken, differentiate, and endure.",

          "authors": "Zachary Thomas, Ellen D. Williams, Kavita Surana, Morgan R Edwards",
          "abstract": "Accelerating climate-mitigating technology, or climate-tech, innovation in the formative phase of the technology life cycle is crucial to meeting climate policy goals. During this period, firms create value across a broad set of products related to hardware, software, and services. We conceptualize this as a nascent value chain and operationalize this concept by identifying a set of product clusters and exploring the patterns of innovation within and across them. Specifically, we analyze 14 climate-tech sectors using a dataset of 12,929 early-stage private investments in 3,662 North American firms between 2006 and 2021. Descriptions of these firms reveal that innovation occurs in five distinct product clusters across the value chain. Within this dataset, only 15% of firms develop end products (i.e., downstream products bought by consumers), while 59% support these end products through components, manufacturing processes, or optimization products, and 26% develop business services. The temporal evolution of investments in these product clusters reveals three patterns of innovation among climate-tech sectors: maturing innovation (e.g., energy efficiency), characterized by coalescence around the dominant design of an end product with an increasing share of investments in optimization and services; ongoing innovation (e.g., energy storage), characterized by multiple waves of investments in evolving products enabled by flexible policy frameworks; and emerging innovation (e.g., agriculture), characterized by recent growth in investments across most product clusters and spillovers from other sectors. These patterns of innovation indicate ways that firms can add value to new climate-tech as it develops from the formative phase to the growth phase. An understanding of nascent value chains can inform policy design that supports climate-tech scaling by identifying underfunded product clusters and supporting development of a full value chain rather than only end products.",

          "abstract": "Novel carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches are essential to address climate change. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is being considered to enhance the ocean’s capacity as an atmospheric carbon sink. It is widely recognised that responsible development and deployment of marine-based CDR requires effective engagement with local stakeholders. This article considers how stakeholders could actively participate in OAE, enhancing their agency and identifying pathways to incorporate their skills and knowledge into research and deployment activities. Adopting a place-based approach in Tasmania, Australia, we interviewed 23 participants and asked them how they might contribute to future OAE activities in/around this island state. Participants saw themselves contributing to one or more activity-based themes: knowledge creation, regulatory oversight, safeguarding values, and/or stakeholder networking. While some responses were predictable (i.e. government representatives adopting regulatory roles), others were unexpected, highlighting the importance of proactively engaging with stakeholders. Several participants identified the need for further support to effectively perform their roles, including expert advice and access to resources. Capacity assessments can evaluate the ability of local stakeholders to play an active role in OAE activities and thus inform strategies to bolster capacity through learning and infrastructure development. We recommend integrating capacity assessments into OAE/marine CDR stakeholder engagement strategies. Further research is needed to develop and implement capacity assessments for OAE and other marine CDR approaches.",

          "authors": "Lu Liu, Chenjing Yan, Ping Wang",
          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a critical enabler of climate mitigation. However, its spatial and temporal impacts remain insufficiently understood. Using balanced panel data from 279 Chinese cities (2006-2019), this study examines how AI (measured by robot adoption) affects carbon emission intensity. We apply the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model to uncover heterogeneous impacts. The results indicate that AI significantly reduces carbon emission intensity, thus contributing to climate mitigation. Nonetheless, the magnitude of this effect varies substantially across cities. The mitigation benefits are more pronounced in cities with limited natural resources, those located within the five major economic zones, and non-traditional industrial centers. These patterns reflect the presence of a “natural resource curse” in resource-rich cities and a “social resource blessing” in socially advantaged regions. The GTWR results further reveal pronounced spatial disparities, with eastern cities experiencing greater reductions in carbon intensity than those in the west. Over time, this spatial imbalance has been narrowing, indicating a gradual convergence in AI’s climate mitigation effects. These findings underscore the importance for regionally differentiated AI development strategies and policy interventions to reduce spatial inequities in mitigation capacity. The study provides robust empirical evidence from China, offering new insights into AI’s potential to support equitable and effective climate action on a global scale.experiencing greater reductions in carbon intensity than those in the west.

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the effects that science-based targets (SBTs) have on corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we assess whether companies that commit to a net zero goal show a decrease in GHG emissions compared to similar companies that declare such goals later. Our results provide limited evidence that organizations with SBT reduce emissions, particularly for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as the findings lack strong statistical significance. We also examine whether the pace of emission reductions increases as companies approach their target year.

          "abstract": "The study aims to identify the relative impact of meteorological and socio-demographic variables on malaria incidence in India since their combined role is crucial for 2030 elimination target. While climate change influences the spatial and temporal patterns of transmission, its exact effect varies due to development efforts and malaria control strategies, which have significantly reduced the incidence. Mapping the decline in incidence over two decades shows persistence of hotspots (Central India, from borders of Rajasthan Gujrat to Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and eastern Madhya Pradesh and North-East) and areas of significant reduction. Statistical models delineate the role of temperature and rainfall (annual, seasonal and variability). Exposure to a minimum rainfall (60-120mm; IRR= 1.001) and warm temperature (IRR= 1.037) is necessary for transmission but a 1°C temperature increase during the summer months leads to a 13% reduction in cases. The variability from long-term average in temperature contributes to incidence (IRR=1.3) but precipitation thwarts (IRR=0.98). Integrating socioeconomic factors emphasise the vulnerability of historically marginalised social groups (ST) and enhanced adaptive capacity due to improved water sources and female education. It curtails the odds of high malaria incidence by 5.6% and 4·7% respectively. The role of last-mile health access is noted in better reporting. CART model also recognizes ST and Female education as dominant determinants of malaria prevalence. With the success of Micro-level strategies like DAMaN and MEDP the persistence of (“tribal”) Malaria can be addressed with women’s capacity building, education, integration with national nutrition schemes for equitable malaria elimination.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how different actors perceive their own and others’ roles in addressing climate change is critical to promoting societal-wide climate action. Yet, most studies focused on the perceptions held by the general population. We extended previous work by examining a unique sample of government, business, and resident representatives. We assessed the extent to which these three groups perceive different actors as responsible, capable, and likely to take climate action, as well as their own responsibility, capacity, and likelihood to act as residents or employees, respectively. We found that Dutch residents and representatives from governments and businesses believe that most societal actors are not doing enough and that the government and businesses are most responsible and capable of taking climate action. Compared to Dutch residents, however, representatives from governments and particularly businesses reported that they have relatively low responsibility and capacity to act. This discrepancy highlights the need to empower different actors, particularly professionals (i.e., from governments and businesses), to fulfill their roles in achieving climate goals. We discuss the scientific and practical implications of better understanding the perspectives of diverse actors and identifying ways to leverage their potential contributions to collective climate progress.",

          "abstract": "Global data have served an integral role in characterizing large-scale groundwater systems, identifying their sustainability challenges, and informing on socioeconomic and ecological dimensions of groundwater. These insights have revealed groundwater as a dynamic component of the water cycle and social–ecological systems, leading to an expansion in groundwater science that increasingly focuses on groundwater’s interactions with ecological, socioeconomic, and Earth systems. This shift presents many opportunities that are conditional on broader, more interdisciplinary system conceptualizations, models, and methods that require the integration of a greater diversity of data in contrast to conventional hydrogeological investigations. Here, we catalogue 144 global open access datasets and dataset collections relevant to groundwater science that span elements of the hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, food systems, governance, management, and other socioeconomic system dimensions. The assembled catalogue offers a reference of available data for use in interdisciplinary assessments, and we summarize these data across their primary system, spatial resolution, temporal range, data type, generation method, level of groundwater representation, and institutional location of lead authorship. The catalogue includes 15 groundwater datasets, 23 datasets derived in relation to groundwater, and 106 datasets associated with groundwater. We find the majority of datasets are temporally static and that temporally dynamic data peak in availability during the 2000–2010 decade. Only a small fraction of temporally dynamic data is derived with any direct representation of groundwater, highlighting the need for greater incorporation of groundwater in Earth system models and data collection initiatives across socioeconomic, governance, and environmental science research communities. A small number of countries, led by the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada, generate most global groundwater data, reflecting a global North bias in the institutional leadership of these data generation activities. We raise three priority themes for future global groundwater data initiatives, which include: data improvements through prioritizing observed and temporally dynamic data; elevating regional and local scale data and perspectives to address challenges relating to equity and bias; and advancing data sharing initiatives founded on reciprocal benefits between global initiatives and data providers.",

          "abstract": "Forest restoration is widely recognized as a global priority to sequester carbon, conserve biodiversity, and support the livelihoods of rural and indigenous people. Contemporary interventions often target landscapes with a substantial human presence, and they regularly call for stakeholder participation during project implementation. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence linking local involvement with multiple forest benefits over long time horizons. Using a unique dataset of four decades of government-sponsored tree planting in North India, we find that both substantive local influence over planning projects and sustained control over management into the present—a favorable combination of long-term, empowered local governance—is associated with greater livelihood benefits and improvements in forest canopy cover over time. Our work points toward complex socio-ecological relationships, which may be explained by a positive interaction between empowered local governance, interventions that align with local needs, and long-term local care for planted forests. This implies that current financial commitments may need to be accompanied by institutional reforms that give communities meaningful control over planning and build capacities for self-governance that can endure into the future. In light of this work, we suggest that a paradigm of ‘people-centered restoration’ may offer the best opportunity to support long-term environmental goals in densely settled landscapes in the Global South.",

          "authors": "Sara Nazari, Robert Reinecke, Nils Moosdorf",
          "abstract": "Groundwater, Earth’s largest source of liquid freshwater, is essential for sustaining ecosystems and meeting societal demands. However, quantifying global groundwater withdrawals remains a significant challenge due to inherent uncertainties in input data, sectoral allocation assumptions, and model parameterization. In this study, we analyze global groundwater withdrawals from 2001 to 2020 using a newly developed data-driven Global Groundwater Withdrawal (GGW) model and quantify uncertainties through Monte Carlo simulations. The GGW model integrates reported country-level data with global grid-based datasets to estimate annual withdrawals across domestic, industrial, and agricultural sectors at a 0.1° resolution (≈ 10 km). Our results indicate an average global groundwater withdrawal of 648 km³ a⁻¹, with an uncertainty range of 465-881 km³ a⁻¹. Agriculture accounts for 50% of total withdrawals, followed by domestic use at 34.5% and industrial use at 15.5%. Temporal analysis shows increasing groundwater withdrawal in 66% of the 44 IPCC WGI reference regions over the 20 years, with a global average annual increase of 0.5% (varying regionally from 6.5% annual increase to 9% annual decrease). Comparison with previous studies highlights the impact of methodological choices and assumptions about groundwater withdrawal on the resulting global estimates. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive uncertainty assessments and improved datasets. Expanding spatial coverage in underrepresented regions and enhancing temporal resolution, particularly for dynamic variables like irrigated areas, are crucial for more accurate groundwater withdrawal assessments. These improvements will enable better management and conservation of this vital resource in the face of growing global demands and climate change impacts.",

          "abstract": "Understanding thermal stress in tropical forests has taken on new urgency in light of accelerating climate change and expansion of deforestation and forest degradation. Degraded tropical forests in particular may be approaching critical temperature thresholds even more rapidly than intact forests, with implications for tree survival and ecosystem recovery. We investigate thermal stress in degraded tropical forests within the Brazilian Amazon Arc of Deforestation. Using land surface temperature data from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on the international Space Station (ECOSTRESS), we compared canopy temperatures of intact, selectively logged, and burned forests in Feliz Natal, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Upper canopy temperatures in previously burned forests were 4.1% higher (mean = 36.5 °C) and 50.9% more variable compared to intact and logged forests, which showed remarkably similar temperature distributions (means of 34.9 °C and 35.1 °C, respectively). Modeled leaf temperature distributions based on canopy temperature measurements from one of the warmest days in a 2 year dry season record indicated that 87% of leaves in the warmest burned forest patches exceeded the temperature threshold where respiration surpasses photosynthesis, compared to approximately 72%–74% in intact and logged forests, respectively, in the same time period. After controlling for environmental factors, burned forests were predicted to be 2.6 °C warmer on average [1.39 °C–3.96 °C, 95% credible interval] than intact forests across a 5–40 m canopy height range. Burned forests showed modest thermal recovery over time, with temperatures decreasing by approximately 1.2 °C over a 30 year recovery period. In contrast, logged forests showed minimal thermal differences from intact forests (−0.353 on average, [−1.125–0.274, 95% credible interval]) and negligible change (0.15 °C) over the same timeframe. While the absolute probabilities of exceeding damaging thermal thresholds remain low across all forest types under current climate conditions, the probability of leaves exceeding temperatures that cause permanent leaf damage was ten times higher in burned forests, with implications for the future of burned forest regeneration in water-limited regions of the Amazon basin. In particular, the combination of higher mean temperatures, greater temperature variability, and more frequent exposure to damaging thermal thresholds implies that burned tropical forests will experience substantially higher mortality rates and slower biomass recovery compared to intact and selectively logged forests, especially in water-limited regions where trees cannot rely on evaporative cooling to moderate canopy temperatures.",

          "abstract": "The unprecedented emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 provided a natural experiment to elucidate aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions and their effect on convective weather phenomena, particularly thunderstorm occurrence and lightning flash rate density (FRD), across the Indian subcontinent. The significant reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions, especially across the most polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), led to a marked decrease in aerosol optical depth (AOD), altering regional cloud-aerosol interactions and radiative effects. A rise in ENSO-compensated lightning FRD and an increase in thunderstorm days (TDs) were associated with aerosol depletion, suggesting a favorable environment for convective initiation under relatively cleaner atmospheric conditions over the extremely polluted region. The reduced AOD likely led to enhanced surface heating and decreased upper-level warming, reversing the previously stable stratification caused by very high aerosol loading. This natural instability favored the formation of a greater number of widespread thunderstorms. However, the observed reduction in lightning FRD per TD during the pandemic year indicates that, while more storms formed, each storm exhibited lower electrification, likely due to diminished cloud condensation nuclei. Relatively lower aerosol concentrations can promote an increase in storm frequency through radiative destabilization of the atmosphere. However, these relatively cleaner conditions also tend to reduce lightning frequency within individual storms, as the limited presence of aerosols constrains non-inductive charging processes in clouds. Thus, environments with fewer aerosols are associated with more frequent storm development but a decrease in lightning flashes per storm, reflecting a complex interplay between atmospheric composition and convective electrification. These insights advance understanding of convective storm responses to aerosol variability and have important implications for future atmospheric electrification trends under changing emission scenarios. This dual effect highlights the complexity of aerosol-cloud-precipitation-electrification interactions. It has implications for understanding convective weather responses to air quality changes and future climate scenarios driven by aerosol management strategies.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the unique annual cycle characteristics of tropical cyclone (TC) genesis in the South China Sea (SCS). In contrast to the TC bimodal structure in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and its unimodal pattern in the Northwestern Pacific (WNP), the SCS exhibits a distinct step-like pattern with two jumps—the first occurring from April to May and the second from July to August, with the flat condition during May-June-July. Hence TC in SCS witnesses the surprising transition between BoB and WNP. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, the Genesis Potential Index (GPI) is applied for a quantitative assessment of large-scale environmental factors. Results indicate that in the SCS, the mid-level atmospheric relative humidity is the dominant factor driving the first TC genesis jump in May, whereas the vertical wind shear contributes to the second jump. In the WNP, the mid-level atmospheric relative humidity remains the most crucial for TC peak feature. This study advances our understanding of the unique annual cycle of TC in the SCS in comparison with the neighboring BoB and NWP, offering valuable insights to improve the forecasting skills in the region.",

          "abstract": "Compounding climate extremes threaten ecosystems, agriculture, and public health, with intensification driven by a warming climate and increasing human interventions. However, the global linkage between temperature extremes and total water storage (TWS) deficits remains insufficiently explored. Here, we analyzed 22 years (2002–2024) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-FO satellite data to examine the spatiotemporal coincidence of elevated temperatures and TWS deficits and explore their bidirectional predictability. We find that low TWS episodes frequently coincide with or lag temperature extremes by about one month in major land–atmosphere coupling hotspots, including equatorial, subtropical, and mid-latitude regions, possibly due to enhanced evapotranspiration and soil moisture reductions. Pre-existing TWS deficits appear to intensify and prolong temperature extremes by reducing latent heat flux and increasing sensible heat flux, potentially creating feedback processes that amplify drought and thermal stress; however, these mechanisms warrant further investigation. Statistical tests confirm that these co-occurrences are unlikely to be random, whereas Granger predictability analysis demonstrates that temperature anomalies improve forecasts of subsequent TWS extremes in critical regions. Overall, our results underscore the vulnerability of water-limited areas under climate change and highlight the value of continuous TWS monitoring to better predict and mitigate the impacts of temperature extremes. They further emphasize the urgency of integrated water-resource management and adaptation strategies in regions prone to prolonged compound extremes.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is already affecting Canada's hydrologic cycle, posing challenges for water management in mining operations and increasing associated environmental and social risks. However, there is limited research that quantifies the extent of anticipated climate change impacts across Canadian watersheds with active mining. This paper aims to fill that gap by assessing climate change impacts on key hydroclimatic variables important for Canada’s mine water management. Baseline conditions were established for six key variables: annual precipitation, 24-hr Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) precipitation, 10-day extreme precipitation, annual mean temperature, hydrologic drought index like Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI), and annual snow depth. Date sources included Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Future climate change projections were generated using ECCC’s transformation equation for 24-hr IDF precipitation, the Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM) method for 10-day extreme precipitation, and downscaled, bias corrected CMIP5 ensemble projections for the remaining variables. The assessment considered two greenhouse emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and three future timeframes (2020s, 2050s, 2080s). The study reveals projected temperature increases within the case study watersheds of 2.4–3.5 °C by the 2050s and 3–7 °C by the 2080s under median or 50th percentile (p50) conditions. Annual precipitation is expected to rise by 11–16% (2050s) and 15–28% (2080s), with more intense shorter-duration events under p50 conditions. For example, the current 100-year 24-hr IDF storm is expected to occur more frequently, decreasing to a 27–49-year return period by the 2050s and a 10–40-year return period by the 2080s. Annual average snow depth is projected to decline by 21–73% (2050s) and 24–89% (2080s) under p50 conditions. These findings highlights that water management in Canada’s mining regions is set to face escalating hydrological changes under a changing climate. Effective management strategies are therefore essential to prevent intensified environmental and social risks.",

          "abstract": "Observations have been debated as portraying a multimodal distribution of tropical tree cover, even in regions with identical mean annual precipitation (MAP). Previous studies have discussed whether such multimodality is evidence of alternative stable states, which would indicate that tropical forests may irreversibly transition to a savanna-like state when deforestation and climate forcing reach a tipping point.&amp;#xD;However, doubts have been raised regarding this interpretation. Alternative hypotheses invoke heterogeneous environmental conditions related to soil properties, climate parameters beyond MAP, or human activity.&amp;#xD;Here, we explore the possibility that the influence of multiple environmental parameters can create multimodality in monostable systems when projected onto one dimension. We show that this situation can indeed occur, even if the system's only equilibrium state depends monotonically on the parameters, and even if the parameter values have Gaussian distributions. Such a situation would imply that tree cover may respond linearly to forcing, without any abrupt behavior, regardless of multiple peaks in the tree cover distribution. &amp;#xD;However, when considering ecologically more realistic parameterizations of tree cover, as used in process-based vegetation models, we find that multiple tree cover modes are more difficult to obtain in the absence of alternative stable states. The reason is that environmental conditions do not affect tree cover directly and independently from each other, but indirectly by affecting tree productivity and mortality. Consequently, a coexistence of forest and savanna in these models is only possible when imposing environmental parameters that are bimodal themselves.&amp;#xD;Motivated by this finding, we analyze the observed distribution of several relevant environmental parameters in South America, and find that none of them suggests a multi-modal tree cover distribution. Our results hence emphasize that possible tipping dynamics are a concern, but also call for improved estimates of tropical tree cover distribution and the role of fire-vegetation interactions.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can generate 100 simulation days in ~8 minutes with a single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July–November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990–2023 (r=~0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p&lt;0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (p&lt;0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.",

          "abstract": "Equatorial Asian fires are strongly influenced by teleconnections associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Additionally, fire intensity in this region varies depending on the specific type of El Niño event, namely the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño and the Central Pacific (CP) El Niño. However, their distinct impacts and localized variations remain insufficiently understood. Using both reanalysis and future projection data, we investigated the distinct influences of the EP and CP El Niño, as well as the IOD, on potential fire occurrences. Our results indicate that both types of El Niño significantly enhance fire activity in southern Equatorial Asia, with a stronger impact associated with the EP El Niño, whereas the IOD primarily affects the southwestern and south-central regions. These fire patterns are closely linked to large-scale atmospheric circulation changes, particularly modifications in the Walker and Hadley circulations, which influence regional precipitation and atmospheric subsidence, thereby altering vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture availability. Furthermore, fire-prone conditions in Equatorial Asia are modulated by land-atmosphere coupling, with the EP El Niño and IOD intensifying surface drying and heat stress, while the CP El Niño exhibits a weaker influence. Moreover, we found that the relationships between these three climate variabilities and Equatorial Asian fires are projected to intensify, with the IOD's influence expanding geographically in the future. Our findings provide a foundation for improving fire prediction and enhancing our understanding of climate-driven fire variability in Equatorial Asia under both historical conditions and future climate scenarios.",

Previous studies have largely focused on the influence of climate on vegetation, with insufficient consideration given to feedback effects and time lags. Here, we use Leaf Area Index (LAI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), soil moisture (SM), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data for 1982‒2023 in global drylands to investigate bidirectional time-lagged causal effects between climate and vegetation. We quantify these causal effects and explore the soil-vegetation-atmospheric moisture coupling strength along climate and tree cover gradients. Our results demonstrate an overall positive effect of SM and a negative effect of VPD on vegetation greening (i.e., LAI and EVI) in global drylands, while the causal effect of VPD (23.7%‒31.6%) is more widespread than that of SM (12.6%‒12.7%). We also find dryland greening depletes soil moisture and replenishes atmospheric moisture, albeit the latter to a lesser extent. The causal effect magnitudes of soil and atmospheric moisture on vegetation decreases with increasing tree cover, while the causal effect of SM on greening shows significantly steeper decline with increasing tree cover (p &lt; 0.001). These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of dryland vegetation dynamics under a changing climate.",

          "abstract": "Future climate-driven hydrological changes may strongly affect river exports of multiple pollutants to coastal waters. In large-scale water quality models the effects are, however, associated with uncertainties that may differ in space and time but are hardly studied worldwide and for multiple pollutants simultaneously. Moreover, explicit ways to assess climate-driven uncertainties in large-scale multi-pollutant assessments are currently limited. Here, we aim to build trust in future river exports of nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus), plastics (i.e. micro and macroplastics), and chemicals (i.e. diclofenac and triclosan) under climate-driven hydrological changes on the sub-basin scale worldwide. We used a soft-coupled global hydrological (VIC) and water quality (MARINA-Multi) model system, driven by five Global Climate Models (GCMs), to quantify river exports of selected pollutants to seas for 2010 and 2050 under an economy-driven and high global warming scenario. Subsequently, we developed and applied a new approach to build trust in projected future trends in coastal water pollution for the selected pollutants. Results reveal that in arid regions, such as the Middle East, East Asia, and Northern Africa, climate-driven uncertainties play a key role in future river exports of pollutants. For African sub-basins, high increases in river exports of pollutants are projected by 2050 under climate-driven hydrological uncertainty. Nevertheless, over 80% of the global sub-basin areas agree on the direction of change in future river exports of individual pollutants for at least three GCMs. Multi-pollutant agreements differ among seas: 53% of the area agrees on increasing river exports of six pollutants into the Indian Ocean by 2050, whereas 17% agrees on decreasing trends for the Mediterranean Sea. Our study indicated that even under climate-driven hydrological uncertainties, large-scale water quality models remain useful tools for future water quality assessments. Yet, awareness and transparency of modelling uncertainties are essential when utilising model outputs for well-informed actions.",

This article argues that while these cross-border practices may help companies reduce costs and comply with regulatory targets, they pose environmental risks, create regulatory loopholes, and undermine incentives to build domestic recycling capacity. To ensure effective battery recycling on a global scale, governments should introduce dedicated regulatory frameworks for cross-border trade activities to avoid ambiguities. International standards for information labeling and traceability systems covering batteries, waste batteries, and recycled materials are also needed. These governance efforts call for more research focused on the dynamics and impacts of transboundary trade in electric vehicle battery recycling.",

          "abstract": "Globally, solar energy has supplanted fossil fuels as the predominant source of clean energy. Scholars have been calling for techno-ecological synergies that minimizing unintended environmental consequences; however, empirical evidence is largely missing in the existing literature. Taking the world's largest PV power plant as a demonstration, combining remote sensing images with field data, we actively used the spatiotemporal dynamic analysis，gross ecosystem products accounting method and statistical analysis methods to show techno-ecological synergies for electricity generation and ecological recovery. Specifically, our analyses reveal that (1) PV panels reduced surface albedo. The albedo of three broad spectral bands decreased by &gt;15% in PV area; (2) comparing to areas between and outside the PV areas, areas under the PV panels enhanced vegetation cover by 61.86% (absolute coverage of 38.22%) and 131.80% (absolute coverage of 56.86%), unit area above-ground biomass by 133.71% (119g) and 235.48% (146g), and plant height by 31.02% (17.36 cm) and 45.58% (22.96 cm), respectively. Nevertheless, PV panels exerted a negative impact on soil organic matter but did not significantly affect other soil and vegetation indicators (i.e., soil water content, vegetation nitrogen content, and vegetation biodiversity, etc.); and (3) PV panels improved ecosystem services. Specifically, from 2010 to 2020, among the four ecosystem regulating services, carbon sequestration and oxygen release increased by 178.46% (70.92 t/km² and 51.58 t/km²), sand fixation by 13.76% (3920.19 t/km²), and soil retention by 4.16% (467.02 t/km²), respectively. Our study demonstrates a potentially sustainable mode in desert areas that supports vertical multiple land uses, improves the surface ecological environment while harnesses solar energy. With better understanding and management of the coupled human-natural energy systems, including the light allocation between PV panels，the selection of appropriate vegetation types beneath panels, and effective management, it is promising that there will be more techno-ecological synergies worldwide.",

          "abstract": "The frequency, scale, and severity of wildfires, driven by climate change, is steadily increasing in the Western United States. Sustainable forest management practices through forest thinning could reduce the impact of wildfires and provide lumber for wood-based, long-lived, and low-carbon building materials. This study explores the potential for harvesting biomass in California (CA) to mitigate wildfire risk and provide multi-decade carbon storage in the form of cross-laminated timber (CLT) for use in buildings. First, we assessed biomass resource availability finding that the total live hardwood and live softwood available in the wildland-urban interfaces (WUI) across CA sums to 14.1 million metric tons (MMT) and 34.9 MMT, respectively, which contains the equivalent of 90 MMT of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Then, we conducted a life cycle assessment of CLT considering softwood and hardwood sources to provide insights into emissions and energy demand associated with utilization of the wood removed for wildfire risk management. We found that the net life cycle carbon footprint of live hardwood and softwood when including biogenic carbon storage/emissions is 414 and 317 kg CO2e/m3 CLT, respectively. To incorporate the timing of these emissions and uptake, we have also conducted a cradle-to-grave time-dependent global warming potential analysis. The time-adjusted global warming potential for live hardwood and live softwood is -227 and -104 kg CO2e/m3 CLT, respectively. In terms of total CLT production potential, 0.03 and 0.005 million m3 CLT can be sourced from live softwood and hardwood, respectively, in WUI in gentle slopes in CA. The resulting insights and approaches from this study are broadly applicable to other forested regions and WUIs across the U.S. and world, and provide a holistic approach to use forest thinning as wildfire mitigation strategy in combination with a novel approach for life cycle assessment of building materials with a limited dataset.",

          "abstract": "Lightning activities could influence regional air quality and terrestrial ecosystems, through physicochemical processes such as lightning-generated nitrogen oxides and wildfire risks. However, characteristics and causes of lightning activities across high-latitudes such as pan-Arctic regions are still unclear. Here, we explore spatiotemporal variations and climatic drivers of lightning stroke density (LSD) across pan-Arctic regions (45°N-90°N) during 2010-2024, based on global latest lightning datasets. Results showed that LSD is up to 9.29 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 over pan-Arctic regions during 2010-2024, with positive trends of 0.556 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 for land girds. Regionally, LSD shows significant positive linear trends in North America (NAM), central Europe (CEU) and western Russia (WRU), high up to 2.159 strokes 100 km-2 year-1, 3.612 strokes 100 km-2 year-1, and 2.071 strokes 100 km-2 year-1, respectively. However, LSD decreases significantly by -2.042 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 in northern China (NCH). The possible climatic causes of LSD trends are examined across four regions through multiple linear regression and random forest models. Increasing sea surface temperature dominates positive LSD trends up to 1.125 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 and 2.119 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 over NAM and CEU, accounting for 52% and 59% of observed trends. Increased surface air temperature and reduced aerosols control jointly increasing LSD trends over WRU, up to 1.280 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 and 1.112 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 respectively. Negative LSD trends in NCH are mainly related to the increases of local wind shear, resulting in a decline of -0.934 strokes 100 km-2 year-1 in LSD trends. Moreover, random forest models as cross-validations also reveal similar climatic causes over these regions. Our findings highlight that lightning activities show increasing trends over high-latitude regions in recent decades, and suggest us need to fully consider impacts of climate change on future lightning activities under various emission scenarios.",

Natural aerosols are much less studied than fossil fuel-sourced aerosols for their air quality impacts, even though ‘natural’ aerosols such as dust and wildfires are likely to have substantially changed because of anthropogenic activities. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 and the Community Atmospheric Model version 6 atmospheric model, we simulated dust and open-fire PM 2.5 concentrations over Africa for preindustrial (PI), present-day, and future scenarios. Health impacts were assessed using the integrated exposure–response model applied to gridded population and disease-specific mortality data. Currently, we estimate that desert dust causes 30 000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 29 700–303 000) excess deaths annually in Africa (36% of the total excess premature mortality), while open fires result in 20 000 (95% CI: 19 500–22 500) excess deaths (24% of the mortality). All mortality estimates reported in this study represent annual excess deaths, calculated based on annual average PM 2.5 concentrations. Concentrations of dust dominate aerosol concentration at the continental scale, and paleo records suggest dust loading has increased by 55% since PI times. Because of the lower population in dust-dominated regions, these do not affect health as much as combustion but are still important. In PI times, we estimate deaths due to dust as 6400 (95% CI: 6050–6750) (or 7000 if we keep the population at current levels), showing a large growth to the present day (over 400% increase). Excess deaths due to open fires have increased from 6900 (95% CI: 5800–7400) in the PI to 20 000 today (approximately 190% increase). For future scenarios in 2100, there is significant uncertainty; therefore, we present a high and low scenario, indicating that in the future, between 53 000 (95% CI: 49 000–55 000) and 67 000 (95% CI: 63 000–70 000) deaths will result from dust. Similarly, for future open fire excess deaths, we estimate a range of 19 000–40 000 (95% CI: 33 000–44 000) deaths, including population changes (−1% to +100% changes relative to today). In the current climate, as well as in the past and future, the amount and proportion of deaths attributed to ‘natural’ aerosols exceeds 50% of the total PM 2.5 attributable mortality in Africa, showing that addressing possible changes in ‘natural’ aerosols is extremely important for improving air quality.",

Although interprovincial agricultural trade can alleviate regional food supply pressures, substantial uncertainties persist regarding the associated ammonia (NH 3 ) emission transfers and their impacts on air quality and human health. Here we fill this gap using a linear programming model to simulate interprovincial trade flows of 26 individual agricultural products, combined with high-resolution NH 3 emission inventories and air quality simulation. We found that interprovincial trade-related NH 3 emissions reached 2.94 Tg in 2019, accounting for 28.1% of total agricultural NH 3 emission, with predominant transfers from eastern and southern China to northern and central China. These trade-related NH 3 emissions contributed 2.6 μ g m −3 to annual PM 2.5 concentrations and caused 252 016 associated premature deaths. Mortality response to trade-related NH 3 emissions exhibited spatial heterogeneity across China, driven by regional variations in population density and PM 2.5 sensitivity to NH 3 emissions. Agricultural trade generated disproportionate health impacts, with Central China, Southwest China, North China, and Northeast China collectively receiving a net inflow of 28 776 premature deaths. Our results demonstrate that a cross-provincial ecological compensation mechanism needs to be established to balance agricultural trade’s impact on food security, air quality, and human health.",

Here, we use multiple AI models to generate observation-constrained projections of the occurrence probability of record events (REs) of annual maximum and minimum daily streamflow ( Q max and Q min ) in Pakistan. First, we trained and tested the AI models, using the occurrence probability of REs from simulated (input) data from five regional climate models and observed (output) river discharge data from 1962–2022. Then, we use the trained AI models to project the observation-constrained occurrence probability of REs until 2099 and conduct principal component analysis for the robust selection of AI model ensembles. The observation-constrained projections detect more REs in Q max and Q min in the late 21st century than expected under the stationary system does, highlighting intensifying hydroclimatic extremes. The upper Indus River shows that the return period of REs in Q max and Q min is approximately 15 years. The Chenab and Kabul Rivers (Jehlum River) are prone to more REs in Q max ( Q min ), with a return period of approximately 11 years. Uncertainties in the RE occurrence probability projections from regional climate models can be attributed to the heterogeneity in hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics across the study basins. This study suggests the nonstationarity of four major river basins in Pakistan, where water resources management should be updated with basin-specific strategic plans.",

However, the impact of climate warming on national-scale FP occurrence remains a great challenge. This study aims to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of FP occurrence and evaluate the contribution of historical climate change across China. Based on FP records from 1998 to 2019, we conducted temporal trend analysis and examined shifts in spatial centroids. Furthermore, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian model with Markov chain Monte Carlo method to quantify the effects of climate-related drivers. Our results show that while severe pest outbreaks have been largely controlled, the area affected by mild pest hazards has been gradually increasing. Additionally, a significant northward shift in the center of pest occurrences was observed (approximately 0.65° latitude per decade). Our hierarchical Bayesian model estimates that historical climate change contributed 48.0 ± 18.7% to pest occurrences, with temperature-related factors accounting for the majority. Notably, nighttime temperature variation had the largest positive contribution (27.4 ± 17.4%), whereas changes in daytime temperature had a spatially varied influence. Our findings indicate that climate warming, particularly nighttime warming, has driven the northward shift in FP occurrences, posing an increasingly severe threat to forest health in northern regions. These findings underscore the urgent need to address the risks posed by climate-induced FP hazards.",

Via factor analysis of 55 indicators across seven categories, we identified eight key drivers of mobile emissions. Based on these, we clustered the metro areas via Gaussian mixture modeling to obtain seven metro types. We used an extreme gradient boosting regression model to predict PMGEs based on all the indicators, excluding population. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations values, we identified the most relevant indicators. The model reveals that density and transit mitigate PMGEs, while car use and climate exacerbate it. The typology provides further insights into how these effects vary across network, mode share and development patterns. Ultimately, the typology can serve as a framework to identify relevant indicators and thereby guide the selection of strategies for effective, type-specific emissions mitigation.",

          "abstract": "In 2015, the Belize Solid Waste Management Authority launched the Solid Waste Management Project II to enhance solid waste management practices with a particular focus on biopolymers such as polylactic acid (PLA). This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of four potential waste management strategies for PLA in Belize: landfill, landfill expansion, cogeneration, and anaerobic digestion. A life cycle assessment was conducted with a functional unit of 1 kg of PLA at the end-of-life for each waste management scenario. Data from Ecoinvent V3.5 and process parameters from SimaPro V9.0 were collected and modeled in Microsoft Excel. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were assessed. Environmental impact results showed that operational requirements contributed the most to the impacts for anaerobic digestion, while the landfill scenarios were dominated by transportation requirements, and the cogeneration scenario was dominated by material requirements. The anaerobic digestion scenario had the lowest net environmental impacts across half of the assessed categories, primarily due to energy generation from biogas production. Environmental impacts can be reduced by diverting PLA waste from landfills to anaerobic digestion and cogeneration facilities. Additionally, uncertainty was the lowest in the anaerobic digestion scenario for most of the assessed environmental impact categories. Sensitivity analysis revealed that environmental impact results were highly influenced by key model assumptions, such as those for PLA degradation, transportation distances, and technology-specific parameters, indicating that further data collection is necessary to enhance the accuracy of these results. Integrated solid waste management scenarios that incorporated combinations of anaerobic digestion and cogeneration were found to have lower net environmental impacts compared to the business-as-usual scenario. This study underscores the need for further research to evaluate the feasibility of integrating these waste management alternatives into Belize’s waste management system.",

          "abstract": "Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is increasingly used to inform environmental policy decisions by identifying interventions with the highest net societal benefits. Here we focus on CBAs for nitrogen (NCBA), explaining its history, presenting results of a recent first global NCBA and discussing opportunities and limitations. NCBAs have been conducted since the late 1990s for various geographic regions in Europe, the US, and China, primarily to support air quality and eutrophication policies. A first valuation of damages and benefits of the full nitrogen (N) cycle was conducted for the European Nitrogen Assessment in 2011, followed by NCBAs for the USA, the Netherlands and Germany. Here we present a first comprehensive global NCBA. Total global damage cost of N pollution in 2010 was estimated at US$1.1 trillion, primarily from increases in premature mortality by N derived PM 2.5 (35%), terrestrial biodiversity loss by N deposition (33%), and marine eutrophication by N river loads (21%). Global benefits of N in 2010 were estimated at US$ 2.2 trillion with &gt;95% from increased crop yields. By 2050, global N-related costs will rise faster than N benefits because underlying models project that economic growth (GDP) increases willingness-to-pay to prevent N pollution more than crop prices. The geographical distribution of N-related costs will also shift, with China and India surpassing Europe and North America as regions contributing most to global N-related costs. The estimated N cost range for 2010 was US$ 0.6–2.2 trillion with uncertainty largely in dose-impact and damage cost relations. Given the large uncertainties, when using valuation and NCBA to select a N mitigation option, the net benefits should be substantially higher than the costs and markedly better than for a rejected alternative option. Use of NCBA is discouraged to compare international policy options that involve regions with very different levels of GDP, cultures and political systems.",

          "authors": "Nanditha J S, Gabriele Villarini, Shubhra Misra, Kathleen White",
          "abstract": "Precipitation intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are widely used for stormwater management planning and infrastructure design. Currently constructed based on past data, IDF curves do not reflect the potential impacts of current and future changes in the hydrologic system, potentially leading to over- or under-design of structures. Different disaggregation approaches have been developed to obtain IDF curves for sub-daily durations from coarse daily climate model projections. Here, instead of starting from daily IDF curves to obtain sub-daily ones, we use thermodynamic global warming simulations, which directly provide hourly precipitation across the contiguous United States (CONUS) for low- and high-temperature sensitivity models and future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Our results indicate an amplification of precipitation extremes at different accumulation periods from 1–24 h in all scenarios across CONUS, especially towards the end of the 21st century. This is particularly true for the U.S. Northwest, where we report a statistically significant difference in the amplification of 1–6 h precipitation extremes compared to 24 h extremes. In general, we find the precipitation magnitudes are projected to increase with decreasing precipitation frequency (i.e. higher return period/lower annual exceedance probability), for higher emission scenarios, towards the end of this century, and for global climate models that exhibit a high sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing. For instance, in the northwestern United States under high emission scenarios and based on high-sensitivity models, the 100 year hourly precipitation extremes are projected to increase by over 200%, while the 5 year 24 h precipitation extremes are projected to increase by less than 50% by the end of the 21st century. Our results suggest that applying daily amplification factors to sub-daily extremes could lead to significant underestimation of sub-daily extremes. Therefore, a careful examination of changes in sub-daily extremes, and their regional variability is required to mitigate challenges with the design and operation of current and future urban infrastructure.",

          "abstract": "This essay explores how the prospect of a “blue” Arctic Ocean—no longer covered continuously with sea ice—has shaped, supported, and challenged different visions for and prospective ways of ordering relations in the Arctic. Three examples of regional ordering projects initiated in anticipation of a changing Arctic Ocean are discussed: reinforcing club governance through the 2008 Ilulissat Agreement, a more inclusive approach through the Central Arctic Ocean precautionary fisheries agreement, and an Inuit-led governance project in a uniquely valued sea area (the Pikialasorsuaq) meant to (re)introduce a different form of socioecological order. These different illustrations highlight the varied ordering effects that the prospect of an increasingly ice-free Arctic Ocean has precipitated. In conclusion, the essay considers how geopolitical tensions have ushered in a period in which efforts to configure authority and order relations around the Arctic Ocean are increasingly enmeshed with and challenged by broader security and political orders and logics.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how China’s vision of a green world order affects global climate cooperation. It argues that China’s global green vision is technology driven, combining green industrial policy with geopolitical ambitions. While not fundamentally different from the Western vision, China’s strategy seeks to reposition the country at the center of the order through leadership in green technologies and by geopolitically leveraging its vision in international politics. This global green vision thus extends beyond climate mitigation, entering the realm of geopolitical competition and ultimately undermining international climate cooperation. Theoretically, the article develops a world-ordering perspective grounded in the concept of global green visions, demonstrating that green industrial policy can function not only as a domestic strategy but also as an instrument of international order building. Empirically, the analysis draws on a qualitative content analysis of primary sources, including official documents and semistructured expert interviews.",

          "abstract": "This special issue on what we call global green visions offers an alternative vantage point for understanding global environmental governance in the Anthropocene through the lens of world order(s). Specifically, we suggest in this introduction that a variety of international and transnational actors craft green visions, thereby not only outlining what (un)sustainability means for them but also promoting distinct conceptions of future world order. In other words, ideas about sustainability are not politically innocent; instead, each explicitly or implicitly revolves around a particular conception of world order. The special issue bridges and complements existing work in international relations and global environmental politics by examining how the global green visions of various actors interact with understandings of world order, rather than merely acknowledging that claims about what is “sustainable” and “unsustainable” are contested. In fact, global green visions are contested precisely because they entail renegotiations of how to govern under the increasingly difficult conditions of the Anthropocene.",

          "abstract": "The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) established the legal principles for recognizing sovereign rights over genetic resources and brought forward conceptual innovations for safeguarding the collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities. However, there is little research into which governance structures at the national level are most effective for promoting fair and equitable benefit-sharing. This article has two aims: first, to examine the effects of different regulatory approaches on economic and scientific development, and second, to look at the impacts of varying levels of inclusiveness on benefit sharing. To achieve these ends, we present a novel theoretical framework that captures two dimensions: regulatory centralization and inclusiveness. We use this framework to analyze how biodiversity governance in Brazil has changed since the 1990s by drawing on data from stakeholder interviews, policy papers, and quantitative sources. Our analysis points to three main findings. First, it suggests that open access under certain terms and conditions is arguably more effective for controlling access to genetic resources and promoting economic and scientific activities. Second, we find that higher levels of inclusiveness tend to strengthen benefit sharing. Third, power dynamics and structural inequalities can become important barriers to the participation of traditional knowledge holders.",

          "abstract": "A global green vision requires a low-carbon shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This transition, however, relies on significant material and energy inputs, exacerbating mineral extraction and dependence on fossil fuels. Adopting both a global political ecology and a critical international political economy perspective, this article examines the continuity of extractivist logic and practices, along with the increasing dependency on fossil fuels associated with the low-carbon transition. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including multisited fieldwork in nickel-producing provinces of Indonesia, this article investigates the extraction of green minerals within a resource-rich country that has a history of strong extractivism. We argue that in the context of a dominant extractivist regime, the global decarbonization agenda accelerates recarbonization and deepens fossil fuel dependency in mineral-rich countries, reinforcing social and environmental injustices associated with nickel extraction.",
