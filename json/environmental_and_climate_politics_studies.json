          "abstract": "The implementation and acceptance of climate policies depend on public perceptions of climate change. The media play a crucial role in informing the public discourse. While previous research has predominantly focused on written news, television remains the primary source of information globally. Here, we present an algorithm based on natural language processing techniques for identifying climate change coverage from subtitles of the leading German television news program, Tagesschau . Combining a dictionary approach with neural topic modeling, we classify the topics of over 28,000 news items (2015–2023). Our results show that climate change accounts for 4% of the total coverage, surpassed, for example, by sports coverage (9%). Acute crises, such as COVID-19, are covered more frequently and positioned more prominently. 80% of climate change coverage reports on climate policy, while only 10% covers climate impacts, like weather extremes. The latter tend to be covered in later news slots, indicating lower news value.",

          "abstract": "The solar wind can interact directly with the surface of airless bodies like the Moon. The interaction causes sputtering of surface materials and solar wind ions are also partially backscattered to space. Particles leaving the surface can have any charge-state. At the Moon, backscattered or sputtered positive ions 1–4 and energetic neutral atoms 5–8 have been observed, but all attempts to find negative ions in electron measurements have failed so far. Here we present measurements by Chang’E-6 from the lunar farside 9 revealing the existence of a layer of negative ions close to the lunar surface. We found that about $$2.{5}_{-0.8}^{+1.2} \\%$$ 2 . 5 − 0.8 + 1.2 % of the impinging solar wind protons charge exchange on the lunar regolith and are backscattered as negative hydrogen ions. The negative ion fraction is similar to the observed positive ion fraction 1,3 . We estimate a H − surface density of $$0.1{8}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}\\,{{{{\\rm{cm}}}}}^{-3}$$ 0.1 8 − 0.03 + 0.04 cm − 3 . On the dayside, the lifetime of negative hydrogen ions is short due to photodetachment 10 , confining them to a layer with a scale height of about 10 km. Such surface-bound layers or regions with negative ions should exist at any planetary object with a surface directly exposed to solar wind 11,12 , including low gravity bodies such as asteroids or comets.",

          "abstract": "Emperor penguin populations are predicted to decline rapidly over the current century owing to habitat loss in Antarctica arising from warming oceans and loss of seasonal sea ice. Previous work using very high-resolution satellite imagery from 2009 to 2018 revealed a population decrease of 9.5%, characterized by a continuous decline until 2016, with a slight recovery until 2018. Our study, for the sector 0° to 90°W, includes the recent period of sea-ice loss between 2020 and 2023 and provides a regional population update for around a third of the global population. We used supervised classification of very high-resolution imagery, linked to a Markov model and Bayesian statistics. Results indicate a significant reduction in emperor penguin numbers, variance in the methodology is relatively high, but provides a best fit estimate of 22% decline over the period equating to a reduction of 1.6% per year. This decline exceeds the predictions of demographic models based on high-emission scenarios. It is unclear whether the sector analyzed here reflects conditions around the entire continent and our results highlight the need to extend the analysis to all sectors of Antarctica to determine whether these trends are reflected elsewhere.",

          "abstract": "Intermittently closed estuaries provide important ecosystem services but are often overlooked in coastal and catchment research and management. These estuaries are highly vulnerable to human and climate disturbances due to their episodic closure to the ocean, yet remain understudied. This study maps 2245 intermittent estuaries globally, whose catchments currently support 55 million people, with projections of up to 101 million by 2100. Analysis of three decades of scholarly literature revealed that only 7% of these estuaries have been studied. Research on intermittent estuaries comprises 0.5% of all estuarine literature, despite representing 4–5% of estuaries globally. Major research gaps exist in Asia, South America, and Africa—regions with large, vulnerable populations. Over 90% of research on intermittent estuaries is conducted in (southern) Africa, Oceania, and North America, with most studies focusing on local physico-chemical and eco-hydro-geomorphological processes. This assessment underscores the need to expand research priorities to include ecosystem services, climate and human disturbances, and management, with greater international collaboration and leadership from intergovernmental organisations.",

          "abstract": "Understanding waterline variability at seasonal to interannual timescales is crucial for predicting coastal responses to climate forcing. However, relationships between large-scale climate variability and coastal morphodynamics remain underexplored beyond intensively monitored sites. This study leverages a newly developed 25-year (1997–2022) satellite-derived waterline dataset along the North American West Coast. Our results reveal distinct latitudinal patterns in seasonal waterline change, with excursions exceeding 25 m in the Pacific Northwest, decreasing to less than 10 m in Southern California and farther south. Waterline fluctuations strongly follow wave power in the Pacific Northwest ( R = −0.78), northern California ( R = −0.75), and Baja California ( R = −0.62), while Baja California Sur aligns more with sea-level variations ( R = −0.42). Interannually, waterline change exhibits latitudinal dependence: south of southern California, variability is low, with major erosion confined to strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, while northern regions show mixed responses. ENSO-driven storm track shifts modulate winter wave climate, resulting in enhanced (attenuated) erosion from southern California to Baja California Sur during El Niño (La Niña). However, further north, ENSO impacts are less consistent, reflecting a complex interplay of storm track displacement and intensification. These findings highlight the spatial complexity of ENSO-driven morphodynamics and provide a framework for assessing climate-induced coastal vulnerability.",

          "authors": "Tobias Müller",
          "abstract": "Critical analyses of extractivism have demonstrated that it frequently involves interconnected gendered impacts on local communities. While gender equality has become an important concern in the literature on sustainability and economic development, more intersectional and decolonial feminist critiques of extractivism are only slowly entering mainstream debates even though they offer important perspectives for thinking about the socio-political challenges Just Transitions are likely to face, especially in countries in Africa with weak governance systems. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the potential gendered impact of possible future just transition programmes in Africa through the analyses of different gendered impacts of three zones of resource extraction in Uganda, namely mining in Karamoja, a sugar cane plantation in Mabira Forest and oil extraction via the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). Employing an intersectional and decolonial feminist lens, the paper identifies three gendered dimensions of extractivist impacts, namely sexual violence, barred access to basic necessities and dispossession of land. It is vital to take these challenges seriously in order to avoid reproducing such gendered impact in attempts to achieve a Just Transition in Uganda and countries with similar socio-economic profiles.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation to climate change seems an agreed-upon necessity in 2025. However, questions of how, by whom, and for what purposes this adaptation should be pursued remain far from obvious, especially if it is to be planned and implemented in a sustainable manner. In our most recent Hamburg Climate Futures Outlook, we conduct an assessment of the plausibility conditions for sustainable climate change adaptation across the world, and identify a number of missing elements. In this Perspective, we summarize the findings of our assessment and discuss implications for climate action. We argue that three main issues are key to consider: First, it is essential to assess how climate change adaptation is understood in a given social context ranging from a reactive coping strategy to projected proactive engagement. Second, planning is a necessary but not sufficient condition for practicing and implementing climate change adaptation, and especially sustainable climate change adaptation. Third, to understand what makes climate change adaptation sustainable, research on and planning of adaptation require a better integration into the assessment of social dynamics of decarbonization and the physical context, such as internal climate variability and regional variation. The central part of this contribution discusses facilitating conditions for sustainable climate change adaptation, drawing on lessons learned from nine case studies in different regions around the world.",

          "abstract": "China has implemented stringent emission controls to reduce PM2.5 pollution, but the impact of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on regional heavy pollution events in this process remains understudied. We use the WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modelling system to innovatively reconstruct the meteorologically-driven trends of PM2.5 pollution in Beijing from 2013 to 2023 by setting up fixed emission scenarios and minimize the interference of anthropogenic emissions. The results show that the heavy pollution frequency (HPF) in Beijing in winter is significantly correlated with the intensity of ENSO (r = 0.72, p &lt; 0.05): the intensity of El Niño events is positively correlated with the HPF, and the intensity of La Niña events is negatively correlated with the HPF. Further analysis reveals that ENSO triggers anomalous 850 hPa southerly winds and 500 hPa northwesterly winds mainly through coupling with the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM), thus altering the low-level warm and humid transport and mid-level diffusion conditions. In addition, the ENSO-driven trans-regional transport also led to the formation of distinct spatial distribution patterns of pollution between Beijing and Tianjin-Tangshan areas.",

          "authors": "Vikrant Jain, Abhishek Dixit, Ajit Singh, S K Tandon",
          "abstract": "A basin-scale sediment budget can reveal distinct contribution of tectonic, geomorphological and climatic domains to sediment dispersal in large river systems. While traditional budgets at the reach- and sub-basin-scale have focused on hinterland sediment supply, the role of alluvial storage in modulating sediment fluxes remains poorly understood, particularly in data-scarce Himalayan rivers. To address this, we compiled sediment load data from existing studies across different sub-basins of the large Ganga River system to construct a basin-scale sediment budget. With this integrated sediment budget, we examined spatial variability in sediment generation, transport and deposition across the Himalayan hinterland and alluvial plains. Our analysis reveals strong regional contrasts in sediment dispersal, driven by differences in uplift rates, precipitation and subsidence. The western Ganga rivers, covering 27% of the basin area, contribute only 9% of the total sediment load (385 Mt/a) due to lower uplift rates and precipitation. This results in a supply-limited system with entrenched rivers and minimal sediment storage in the adjacent low-subsiding plains. In contrast, the Eastern Himalayan Hinterland is the dominant sediment source, generating 51% of the total load from 11% of the basin area; however ~45% of this sediment is trapped in the subsiding alluvial plains, forming aggradational channels. The Transitional Himalayan Hinterland bridges these extremes, contributing 23% of the sediment load from the hinterland covering 9% of basin area due to intermediate uplift and precipitation rate. This increases to 29% in the alluvial plains, where low subsidence—similar to the Western Ganga Plains—facilitates efficient sediment transfer downstream. We propose that transient storage in the Eastern Ganga Plains may become a key control on sediment dispersal over a centennial timescale, as increasing extreme precipitation events could shift the system from transport-limited to supply-limited. Accounting for these shifts is essential for effective sediment management and planning.",

          "authors": "Lukas Brunner, Benjamin Poschlod, Emanuel Dutra, Erich M Fischer, Olivia Martius, Jana Sillmann",
          "abstract": "Weather and climate extremes are rare manifestations of climate variability that can severely impact society and the environment. To investigate their properties and changes on a global scale, observational records are often complemented by climate models such as those from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). However, typical CMIP6 models have a grid spacing of about 100 km and, therefore, do not allow the representation of extremes at local scales important for impacts. Here, we provide a global view on the information lost at such resolutions, focusing on temperature and precipitation extremes. We draw on two next-generation, km-scale global climate models, run with a grid spacing of about 10 km, and regrid them to a range of coarser resolutions. From the regridded data, we then investigate the spatial sub-grid variability hidden at the CMIP6-like 100 km grid spacing to quantify the effect resolution has on the representation of extremes globally. We find clear patterns of such a resolution effect on a diverse set of temperature extremes, particularly in mountainous areas, at coastlines, and along large rivers. For the example of annual maximum temperature, the difference between the 10 km and 100 km grid spacings can exceed 10◦ C. For precipitation, globally aggregated low and high extremes are shown to be underestimated at coarse resolution, with the strongest spatial signals emerging in regions with complex topography and in the tropics. Our results quantify existing knowledge and demonstrate the importance of spatial resolution for the representation of climate extremes, in particular for hotspot regions such as coastlines, which often coincide with densely populated areas. The advent of ever higher resolved global models, hence, allows improved estimates of local climate impacts and related risk assessments with global coverage.",

          "authors": "Tsung-Chen Lee, Ying-Chieh Lee, Jing-Ru Su",
          "abstract": "Confronted by climate change, enterprises are increasingly launching afforestation initiatives to develop carbon sinks and enhance their environmental, social, and governance performance. Due to the limited availability of land in urban areas—where most corporate headquarters are located—many firms rely on rural and overseas regions to implement these projects. This phenomenon reflects a form of urban land teleconnection (ULT), a key concept in urban sustainability that emphasizes the spatial and functional linkages between urban activities and land-use changes in geographically distant areas. This study investigates ULT through the lens of corporate afforestation behavior in Taiwan. A theoretical framework, supported by empirical analysis, is developed to explain how urban-based corporations influence land use beyond their municipal boundaries. The findings indicate that corporates in urban areas, particularly those with substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, actively compensate for local land constraints by investing in afforestation in less urbanized domestic areas and abroad. Notably, Taipei City records the highest level of corporate GHG emissions in 2022, totaling 73.94 MtCO 2 e—equivalent to 42.4% of the total among publicly listed firms (174.39 MtCO 2 e). Given severe land scarcity, Taipei-based enterprises engage in afforestation activities on 256.6 hectares domestically (55% of domestic corporate afforestation) and 29 446 hectares internationally (99% of overseas afforestation). These results underscore the growing reliance of high-emission urban corporations on external land resources and highlight their critical role in reshaping regional and transboundary land-use dynamics under emerging net-zero governance frameworks.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates projected changes in heat stress in a changing climate and their impacts on population exposure, work performance, and mortality in the Arabian Peninsula (AP). The findings demonstrate an intensification in future heat stress across the AP, with a projected increase in extreme caution and danger days under SSP5-8.5, compared to SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios. The coastal cities are projected to experience higher heat stress intensity and more heat stress days than inland cities, making them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. By 2100, population exposure to extreme caution days will increase by 1.38–2.5 and danger days by 0.13–1.0 million person-days under the selected SSPs, relative to the baseline period. Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable, with work performance potentially declining by 6–21%. The heat-related mortality risk ratio will increase by 2.3–35.4 times under the selected SSPs across the entire AP. The implications of these findings might influence the response and mitigation strategies, highlighting the critical necessity for focused policy initiatives aimed at reducing emissions and improving adaptive capacity in the region to address climate change.",

          "authors": "Julie C Aleman, Yannick Garcin, Boris Vannière, Antoine Vullien, David Williamson, Christopher Carcaillet",
          "abstract": "Fire is often assumed to be a key driver in shaping tropical vegetation structure and composition in grass-dominated ecosystems, while forests experience infrequent but impactful fires that influence ecosystem resilience. Although short-term interactions between fire and vegetation are well-documented, long-term dynamics remain underexplored. This study examines fire regimes, vegetation dynamics, and its biodiversity over the past 17 000 years in southwest Tanzania, using sedimentary charcoal and pollen. Major ecological transformations of vegetation and fire regimes were recorded, with vegetation changes consistently preceded shifts in fire regimes. Increased grass pollen correlated with more frequent or larger fires, while high tree cover in Miombo woodland reduced fire activity. Interestingly, pollen evenness was a precursor to major ecological transformations as peaks preceded changes in ecosystem states. Changes in precipitation and moisture seems the major top–down drivers of these changes in vegetation and fire. Fire regimes were indirectly controlled by water availability, and vegetation exhibited resilience to fire at centennial timescales before reaching ecosystem shifts at 12 400 and 1700 cal BP. Our results emphasize the critical role of tree and grass cover in shaping fire regimes and highlight the interplay between climate, vegetation structure, and fire in East African ecosystems.",

          "authors": "Théo Balanza, Nicolas Campion, Mathias Berg Rosendal, Rasmus Bramstoft, Anders Bjørn",
          "abstract": "Planetary Boundaries and other carrying capacities define a safe operating space for humanity. However, current energy system models often address sustainability too narrowly with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions during the operational phase, and neglecting other environmental impacts can lead to suboptimal and unsustainable energy systems. This study integrates environmental impacts and planetary boundaries as constraints into a multi-sectoral energy system model to explore sustainable configurations for the European energy system in 2050. Our results indicate that it will not be possible to stay within all allocated carrying capacities without a combined application of energy demand reduction, large-scale deployment of renewable energies, electrification of heating, and technological improvements. Specifically, with the most permissive allocation principle, European electricity and heat demand must be limited to 3550 TWhe and 4655 TWhth to remain within the planetary boundaries, which represents a 22% and 24% reduction compared to 2050 projected final energy demand for the sectors of electricity and heat, excluding transport and fuels demands. Results show that scenario normally considered \"Net Zero\" would transgress the allocated budget for climate change by 70 %, despite a high deployment of renewable energies, when life cycle impacts are considered. All generated scenarios highly rely on renewable energies and the electrification of heating. The analysis of the different scenarios highlights substantial burden shifts across carrying capacities when only considering climate change and praises a global environmental approach in decision-making. Climate change, land use and particulate matter are identified as the most impacted categories when designing an energy system.",

          "abstract": "Alpine streams supply water to mountains and downstream regions, but their sensitivity to climatic variability is complex. Here we derive streamflow sensitivity regimes from long-term observations in the Swiss Alps and analyze their potential controls. For each week of the year, we estimated absolute and relative sensitivities of streamflow in response to changes in temperature, precipitation, and storage. At high elevations with extensive glacier cover, weekly temperature and precipitation sensitivities peak in spring and summer when melt rates are high. At low elevations with no glacier cover, weekly temperature sensitivities are negative in summer, while precipitation sensitivities are highest under moist winter conditions. The elevation at which temperature sensitivities switch from positive to negative changes over the course of the year, showing that the sensitivities are temperature-dependent and thus non-stationary. Weekly streamflow sensitivities help resolving the seasonally-varying drivers of the streamflow regime and may be used to evaluate hydrological models.",
