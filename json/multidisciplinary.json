          "title": "A Long Battle: Turkey’s Backsliding and Resistance Through Trench Warfare",
          "authors": "Murat Somer",
          "abstract": "Since 2002, governments led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his party have taken Turkey’s political regime from electoral democracy to electoral autocracy. This has been principally accomplished through legislative capture: control, abuse, and weaponization of Parliament to pass democracy-eroding laws, discredit opposition, and legitimize executive authoritarianism. But other tools, such as executive power grabs, were also used against strong state institutions, civil society, and even by Erdoğan against his own party. Democratic backsliding advanced through crises that polarized the electorate and through fierce political warfare between the incumbent government and its opponents. Like other cases on the legislative capture pathway, opposition parties have resisted backsliding predominantly through electoral mobilization, but their partial access to the legislature has, for the most part, limited their capacity to join forces with grassroots contentious politics. The opposition has not developed solutions for programmatic renewal that might heal formative rifts and lead to sustainable recovery.",

          "authors": "Zsolt Enyedi, Bálint Mikola",
          "abstract": "We discuss the case of Hungary’s rapid democratic backsliding under Viktor Orbán as an example of legislative capture. We show that, despite relatively unfavorable conditions for autocratization, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party have supervised a well-crafted project of institutional transformation and a comprehensive regrouping of financial resources, all of which have led to an effective and stable concentration of power. This power concentration has its limits, given the country’s membership in the European Union, resistance by parts of the judiciary, media initiatives focused on corruption, and local opposition victories; but the national government’s room for maneuver has increased every year since 2010. We provide an overview of the changes that facilitated democratic erosion and an inventory of the actors that still retain a capacity to hinder further autocratization.",

          "authors": "Filip Milačić",
          "abstract": "Serbia’s democracy has been in a state of continuous erosion since the Serbian Progressive Party and Aleksandar Vučić came to power in 2012. Vučić exploited his popularity as a self-proclaimed defender of the Serbian nation to gain full control of the party and initiate democratic backsliding through “legislative capture.” Vučić’s capture of the parliament and its appointment powers made possible a subsequent capture of many democratic institutions. The rest, mindful of Vučić’s broad electoral appeal, deferred to the executive. Challenges to Serbia’s democratic backsliding were attempted through popular mobilizations and electoral resistance, but they have not been successful. There are several reasons for such an outcome: the uneven playing field, a fragmented and ideologically heterogeneous opposition, a misguided choice of resistance strategies, the absence of an alternative political platform that addressed the issue of Kosovo—the antecedent condition that precipitated backsliding, and insufficient support from external prodemocracy actors.",

          "authors": "Shelley A. McConnell",
          "abstract": "Nicaragua has followed an unusual path from democracy to authoritarianism. In 2000, despite deep political polarization, outgoing Liberal president Arnoldo Alemán colluded with opposition leader Daniel Ortega to convert politically neutral judicial and electoral institutions into partisan tools. Their pact constrained the party system and lowered the electoral threshold, enabling Ortega to win the presidency in 2006. From a minority position in the legislature, Ortega’s Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party used the politicized judiciary and electoral infrastructure to remove presidential term limits and manipulate elections. After gaining a legislative majority, the FSLN then reformed the constitution to consolidate power. Public resistance to democratic decline came slowly and too late: Initially offset by social spending funded in part by international authoritarian allies, it was ultimately repressed. The Nicaragua case shows that a gradualist pathway toward democratic backsliding may be available to minority parties in poor countries.",

          "abstract": "This case study explores democratic backsliding in Brazil that was accompanied by Jair Bolsonaro’s rise to power and his push for autocratization. Bolsonaro’s presidency was characterized by systematic attacks on democratic institutions, including efforts to undermine the judiciary, the legislature, and electoral integrity. A broad prodemocracy coalition of political parties, state governors, civil society, and the judiciary emerged to resist Bolsonaro’s authoritarian drive. The coalition played a pivotal role in preserving Brazil's democratic framework and preventing further erosion of democratic norms, but structural weaknesses in Brazil’s political system—which include growing affective polarization, ineffective governance, and the creeping influence of organized crime—present significant challenges to sustaining democracy. In the face of these enduring threats, maintaining democratic resilience in Brazil will likely be difficult.",

          "abstract": "Until the 1990s, Venezuela had one of the longest-running democracies in Latin America. Today it is one of the region’s most entrenched authoritarian regimes. I discuss Venezuela’s 25-year autocratization process, focusing on the contingent nature of democratic backsliding. This article is useful to understand how executive power grabs shape the ways in which those who oppose autocrats act to protect a democracy, as well as how the opposition can jeopardize, protect, and open spaces for democratic contestation in both democratic and authoritarian contexts.",

          "title": "Elite Collusion in Indonesia: How It Has Both Enabled and Limited Executive Aggrandizement",
          "authors": "Marcus Mietzner",
          "abstract": "After a largely successful post-authoritarian transition, Indonesia has experienced democratic backsliding since the 2010s. This backsliding accelerated under the presidency of Joko Widodo (2014-2024), but it has not yet pushed the Indonesian polity into a full-blown autocracy. I argue that Indonesia’s specific pathway to democratic backsliding prefigured this outcome. While elites have colluded to share power and allow the president to engage in executive aggrandizement, they have set limits to the latter’s potential authoritarian ambitions. For example, they rejected Widodo’s attempt to extend his time in power beyond the constitutionally allowed two terms. Thus, elites have both produced executive aggrandizement and contained its scope. This pattern has protected Indonesian democracy from a full collapse, but it has produced a gradual decline, reducing the chances of democratic revitalization through formal or contentious politics.",

          "authors": "Manuel Meléndez-Sánchez, Lucas Perelló",
          "abstract": "Guatemala is a case study in democratic backsliding led not by an aggrandized executive, but by a coalition of elites who collude to maximize and protect their collective power. Beginning in the mid-2010s, a decentralized but deeply entrenched network of elites dismantled democracy when anticorruption efforts threatened their common interests. The 2023 election was widely expected to consolidate this authoritarian turn but, instead, delivered an unexpected democratic resurgence when a moderate anticorruption reformer secured a shocking victory and then successfully resisted a “slow-motion coup” aimed at preventing the transfer of power. The Guatemalan case suggests that, under elite collusion, elites can be more prone to splits and strategic errors than in other authoritarian settings. These missteps provide unexpected opportunities to reverse backsliding, but democrats must be prepared to capitalize on regime errors and repel authoritarian counteroffensives by building broad coalitions that work simultaneously across multiple arenas of democratic contestation.",

          "abstract": "“Democratic careening” aptly captures Poland’s recent oscillation between liberal democracy, illiberalism, and efforts toward the recovery of liberal democratic norms. In contrast to the recent experience of Hungary, Poland’s hard right governing party was unable to amend the nation’s constitution as it attempted to consolidate power, so it relied on ordinary legislation and changes of personnel in the judiciary and other state institutions. This analysis shows how Poland’s complex constitutional framework, its elections, and the contentious politics of resistance contributed to the nation’s democratic resilience. I also reflect on the challenges faced by Poland’s new government in undoing illiberal changes while avoiding legal and political instability, highlighting the broader implications of this case for democratic theory and the study of illiberalism.",

          "abstract": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won consecutive parliamentary majorities in India’s 2014 and 2019 elections, ushering in a period of single-party dominance that has replaced a quarter-century of coalition politics. This new era has been marked by a growing concentration of executive power, crackdowns on dissent, and rising Hindu majoritarianism. The roots of India’s democratic backsliding predate the BJP’s resurgence, but the trends have intensified in the past 10 years. While the party’s disappointing performance in the 2024 elections suggests a possible corrective, legislative capture in India will not easily unravel: The BJP remains in a commanding political position and shows little inclination toward moderation; questions about electoral integrity abound; referee institutions are abdicating their authority; and constraints on civil society endure. Given India’s outsize geopolitical importance, foreign pressure is unlikely to be decisive in reversing these trends.",

          "abstract": "We provide an analytical framework that identifies three distinct institutional pathways for democratic backsliding that culminate in executive aggrandizement: legislative capture, plebiscitary override, and executive power grabs. We also identify a fourth pathway of elite collusion that erodes democracy without necessarily concentrating powers in the executive. These four pathways reflect different combinations of ruling and opposition party strength, institutional legitimacy, and levels of popular support and political mobilization. The pathways also open and close different institutional and societal arenas where opposition forces can counter backsliding, and they create different opportunities, challenges, and dilemmas for democratic actors. The 15 case studies featured in this volume illustrate how backsliding occurs along these pathways, and how democratic actors achieved partial reversal in some cases. The cases also suggest focal points of resistance and institutional and programmatic reform that may be helpful to policymakers and advocates working to defend democracy.",

I describe the political resistance to backsliding and why it has failed to date, analyzing the roles of specific institutions and individual actors in that resistance. I argue that two key dynamics explain why efforts to mobilize against Saied’s power grab have failed to slow democratic erosion in Tunisia: top-down regime control of key government institutions and a deep popular frustration with the country’s political class, which limited bottom-up mobilization against Saied’s power grab.",

          "abstract": "Ecuador experienced a dramatic process of democratic backsliding during Rafael Correa’s decade-long administration, which began in 2007. The Correa administration brought plebiscitary overrides and constitutional reengineering that made the government a hyperpresidential one, weakening political institutions and undermining basic civil liberties. When Correa left power in 2017, Ecuador’s democracy recovered; but, even with the promise of an enduring democratic future, the country has not been able to consolidate a functioning representative democratic regime, and new processes of backsliding have occurred. A combination of weak political institutions, poor democratic culture, and major threats to political stability—including the infiltration of organized crime into the political arena—seems to have stagnated Ecuador at the status of a low-quality delegative democracy.",

          "abstract": "After 25 years of successful experience with democracy, Benin entered a phase of democratic backsliding after President Patrice Talon came to power in 2016. According to multiple measures, Benin’s democracy declined continuously between 2016 and 2023. This article highlights how the complacency and weakness of elites in Benin created an environment in which democracy deteriorated. Notably, the influence—or lack of influence—of elites resulted in limited competitiveness of the electoral process and worsening freedom of expression and assembly. Better cooperation of opposition forces in 2023 has helped to halt further backsliding, but it has not reversed the decline.",

After a long history of authoritarian rule, Malawi’s 1994 constitution envisioned a robust separation of powers, yet power remains concentrated in the presidency. Presidents have repeatedly attempted to consolidate power but have been rebuffed at crucial moments. Presidents have attempted to constrain political opposition through personalist ties, the bureaucracy, control over executive appointments, regulation, and coercion. But the courts and civil society have been key actors in countering executive overreach, exemplified by the Constitutional Court’s annulment of the 2019 presidential election. Despite recent legal reforms, Malawi’s parliament, opposition parties, and other political institutions still struggle to check the executive.",

          "authors": "Ion Marandici",
          "abstract": "I examine two pathways of democratic backsliding in Moldova and the ways in which the country was able to reverse the backsliding trends. The first episode (2001–2009) started with a political party gaining a supermajority in Parliament and setting up a semi-authoritarian system of governance. Prodemocracy protests and coercive attempts by the state to suppress them led to an institutional stalemate, culminating in snap elections that brought a victory for the political opposition. The second backsliding episode (2014–2019) was characterized by oligarchic collusion: Major oligarchs funded and controlled the ruling parties while engaging in grand corruption and contributing to a gradual democratic decline. Recovery from this backsliding episode was enabled by cross-ethnic, transideological protests against corruption, strategic institutional changes, and interoligarchic wars. The analysis underscores how contentious politics, electoral processes, and the empowerment of weakened political institutions can help generate democratic recovery.",

An example is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy 3 . Certified randomness has many applications but is impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. Here we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations 4,5 : a client generates quantum ‘challenge’ circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute and verifies the results of the server. We analyse the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of 1.1 × 10 18 floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify 71,313 bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of present-day quantum computers.",

Here we describe the identification of JNJ-9676, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the coronavirus M protein. JNJ-9676 demonstrates in vitro nanomolar antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and sarbecovirus strains from bat and pangolin zoonotic origin. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a binding pocket of JNJ-9676 formed by the transmembrane domains of the M protein dimer. Compound binding stabilized the M protein dimer in an altered conformational state between its long and short forms, preventing the release of infectious virus. In a pre-exposure Syrian golden hamster model, JNJ-9676 (25 mg per kg twice per day) showed excellent efficacy, illustrated by a significant reduction in viral load and infectious virus in the lung by 3.5 and 4 log 10 -transformed RNA copies and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per mg lung, respectively. Histopathology scores at this dose were reduced to the baseline. In a post-exposure hamster model, JNJ-9676 was efficacious at 75 mg per kg twice per day even when added at 48 h after infection, when peak viral loads were observed. The M protein is an attractive antiviral target to block coronavirus replication, and JNJ-9676 represents an interesting chemical series towards identifying clinical candidates addressing the current and future coronavirus pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Cosmic reionization began when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe 1,2 . Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 Myr old 3–5 . Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-α (Ly-α), the principal hydrogen transition 6–9 . However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES 10 ) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveals a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly-α, as well as a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EW Ly-α &gt; 40 Å (rest frame), previously only seen at z &lt; 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium becomes increasingly ionized 11 . Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly-α emission indicates that the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionizing photons. This suggests that massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus have created an early reionized region to prevent complete extinction of Ly-α, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang.",

However, despite decades of research, generalizations on the dimensions and extent of human impacts on biodiversity remain ambiguous. Mixed views persist on the trajectory of biodiversity at the local scale 3 and even more so on the biotic homogenization of biodiversity across space 4,5 . We compiled 2,133 publications covering 97,783 impacted and reference sites, creating an unparallelled dataset of 3,667 independent comparisons of biodiversity impacts across all main organismal groups, habitats and the five most predominant human pressures 1,6 . For all comparisons, we quantified three key measures of biodiversity to assess how these human pressures drive homogenization and shifts in composition of biological communities across space and changes in local diversity, respectively. We show that human pressures distinctly shift community composition and decrease local diversity across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Yet, contrary to long-standing expectations, there is no clear general homogenization of communities. Critically, the direction and magnitude of biodiversity changes vary across pressures, organisms and scales at which they are studied. Our exhaustive global analysis reveals the general impact and key mediating factors of human pressures on biodiversity and can benchmark conservation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Hardware implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs)—the most advanced of which are made of millions of electronic neurons interconnected by hundreds of millions of electronic synapses—have achieved higher energy efficiency than classical computers in some small-scale data-intensive computing tasks 1 . State-of-the-art neuromorphic computers, such as Intel’s Loihi 2 or IBM’s NorthPole 3 , implement ANNs using bio-inspired neuron- and synapse-mimicking circuits made of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, at least 18 per neuron and six per synapse. Simplifying the structure and size of these two building blocks would enable the construction of more sophisticated, larger and more energy-efficient ANNs. Here we show that a single CMOS transistor can exhibit neural and synaptic behaviours if biased in a specific (unconventional) manner. By connecting one additional CMOS transistor in series, we build a versatile 2-transistor-cell that exhibits adjustable neuro-synaptic response (which we named neuro-synaptic random access memory cell, or NS-RAM cell). This electronic performance comes with a yield of 100% and an ultra-low device-to-device variability, owing to the maturity of the silicon CMOS platform used—no materials or devices alien to the CMOS process are required. These results represent a short-term solution for the implementation of efficient ANNs and an opportunity in terms of CMOS circuit design and optimization for artificial intelligence applications.",

Although various technologies have been deployed to degrade PFASs with a focus on non-polymeric functionalized compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) 2–4 , a general PFAS destruction method coupled with fluorine recovery for upcycling is highly desirable. Here we disclose a protocol that converts multiple classes of PFAS, including the fluoroplastics polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride, into high-value fluorochemicals. To achieve this, PFASs were reacted with potassium phosphate salts under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, a mineralization process enabling fluorine recovery as KF and K 2 PO 3 F for fluorination chemistry. The phosphate salts can be recovered for reuse, implying no detrimental impact on the phosphorus cycle. Therefore, PFASs are not only destructible but can now contribute to a sustainable circular fluorine economy.",

          "abstract": "Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals 1 . However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity 2–4 . Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting. This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously 3–7 , but its neurobiological basis remains unclear. We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity. Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour. Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding. Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity.",

          "abstract": "One of the main interpretations of deep-rooted geophysical structures in the mantle 1 is that they stem from the top-down solidification of the primitive basal magma ocean of Earth above the core 2–6 . However, it remains debated whether solids first formed at the bottom of the mantle, solidifying upward, or above the melts, solidifying downward. Here we show that gravitational segregation of dense, iron-rich melts from lighter, iron-poor solids drives mantle evolution, regardless of where melting curves and geotherms intersect. This process results in the accumulation of iron-oxide-rich melts above the core, forming a basal magma ocean. We numerically model mantle solidification using a new multiphase fluid dynamics approach that integrates melting phase relations and geochemical models. This enables estimating the compositional signature and spatial distribution of primordial geochemical reservoirs, which may be directly linked to the isotopic anomalies measured in Archean rocks 7–11 . We find that a substantial amount of solids is produced at the surface of the planet, not at depth, injecting geochemical signatures of shallow silicate fractionation in the deep mantle. This work could serve as a foundation for re-examining the intricate interplay between mantle dynamics, petrology and geochemistry during the first thousand million years of the evolution of rocky planets.",

          "abstract": "Vision provides animals with detailed information about their surroundings and conveys diverse features such as colour, form and movement across the visual scene. Computing these parallel spatial features requires a large and diverse network of neurons. Consequently, from flies to humans, visual regions in the brain constitute half its volume. These visual regions often have marked structure–function relationships, with neurons organized along spatial maps and with shapes that directly relate to their roles in visual processing. More than a century of anatomical studies have catalogued in detail cell types in fly visual systems 1–3 , and parallel behavioural and physiological experiments have examined the visual capabilities of flies. To unravel the diversity of a complex visual system, careful mapping of the neural architecture matched to tools for targeted exploration of this circuitry is essential. Here we present a connectome of the right optic lobe from a male Drosophila melanogaster acquired using focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy. We established a comprehensive inventory of the visual neurons and developed a computational framework to quantify their anatomy. Together, these data establish a basis for interpreting how the shapes of visual neurons relate to spatial vision. By integrating this analysis with connectivity information, neurotransmitter identity and expert curation, we classified the approximately 53,000 neurons into 732 types. These types are systematically described and about half are newly named. Finally, we share an extensive collection of split-GAL4 lines matched to our neuron-type catalogue. Overall, this comprehensive set of tools and data unlocks new possibilities for systematic investigations of vision in Drosophila and provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of sensory processing.",

          "abstract": "The human brain is characterized by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI scans acquired under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain, both with respect to the brains of other individuals and the brains of another species. Using functional connectivity, we report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organized: it co-localizes with the archetypal sensory–association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that anaesthesia shifts the functional connectivity of the human brain closer to the functional connectivity of the macaque brain in a low-dimensional space. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and cognitive brain patterns aggregated from the Neurosynth meta-analytic engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetized human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.",

          "abstract": "In response to the alarming recent decline in US math achievement, we conducted a national megastudy in which 140,461 elementary school teachers who collectively taught 2,992,027 students were randomly assigned to receive a variety of behaviorally informed email nudges aimed at improving students’ progress in math. Specifically, we partnered with the nonprofit educational platform Zearn Math to compare the impact of 15 different interventions with a reminder-only megastudy control condition. All 16 conditions entailed weekly emails delivered to teachers over 4-wk in the fall of 2021. The best-performing intervention, which encouraged teachers to log into Zearn Math for an updated report on how their students were doing that week, produced a 5.06% increase in students’ math progress (3.30% after accounting for the winner’s curse). In exploratory analyses, teachers who received any behaviorally informed email nudge (vs. a reminder-only megastudy control) saw their students’ math progress boosted by an average of 1.89% during the 4-wk intervention period; emails referencing personalized data (i.e., classroom-specific statistics) outperformed emails that did not by 2.26%. While small in size, these intervention effects were consistent across school socioeconomic status and school type (public, private, etc.) and, further, persisted in the 8-wk post-intervention period. Collectively, these findings underscore both how difficult it is to change behavior and the need for large-scale, rigorous, empirical research of the sort undertaken in this megastudy.",

          "authors": "Robert Walter-Terrill, Joan Danielle K. Ongchoco, Brian J. Scholl",
          "abstract": "When talking to other people, we naturally form impressions based not only on what they say but also on how they say it—e.g., how confident they sound. In modern life, however, the sounds of voices are often determined not only by intrinsic qualities (such as vocal anatomy) but also by extrinsic properties (such as videoconferencing microphone quality). Here, we show that such superficial auditory properties can have surprisingly deep consequences for higher-level social judgments. Listeners heard short narrated passages (e.g., from job application essays) and then made various judgments about the speakers. Critically, the recordings were modified to simulate different microphone qualities, while carefully equating listeners’ comprehension of the words. Though the manipulations carried no implications about the speakers themselves, common disfluent auditory signals (as in “tinny” speech) led to decreased judgments of intelligence, hireability, credibility, and romantic desirability. These effects were robust across speaker gender and accent, and they occurred for both human and clearly artificial (computer-synthesized) speech. Thus, just as judgments from written text are influenced by factors such as font fluency, judgments from speech are not only based on its content but also biased by the superficial vehicle through which it is delivered. Such effects may become more relevant as daily communication via videoconferencing becomes increasingly widespread.",

          "authors": "Stylianos Syropoulos, Gregg Sparkman",
          "abstract": "Religious leaders shape the attitudes and beliefs of their congregations. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. religious leaders ( N = 1,600), the majority of which were of a Christian faith, we find that nearly 90% believe in anthropogenic climate change to some degree. From this 90%, a total of 60% believe humans play a major role and an additional 30% believe they play a role, but a more minor one. Yet roughly half have never discussed it with their congregation, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice. In a sample of Christian Americans representative of the proportions of major national denominations ( N = 987), we find that Christians underestimate the prevalence of their leaders who believe in climate change by 39 to 45 percentage points. Conversely, having a religious leader who talks about climate change predicts greater willingness to discuss it with fellow churchgoers and attend climate events. In an experimental intervention on another sample matching major Christian American denomination ( N = 959), we find that providing the actual consensus level of religious leaders’ belief in climate change reduces congregants’ misperception of religious leaders, increases their perception that other church members believe in and are open to discussing climate change, and leads Christians to believe that taking climate action is consistent with their church’s values while voting for politicians who will not take climate action is not.",

          "abstract": "Information search platforms, from Google to AI-assisted search engines, have transformed information access but may fail to promote a shared factual foundation. We demonstrate that the combination of users’ prior beliefs influencing their search terms and the narrow scope of search algorithms can limit belief updating from search. We test this “narrow search effect” across 21 studies (14 preregistered) using various topics (e.g., health, financial, societal, political) and platforms (e.g., Google, ChatGPT, AI-powered Bing, our custom-designed search engine and AI chatbot interfaces). We then test user-based and algorithm-based interventions to counter the “narrow search effect” and promote belief updating. Studies 1 to 5 show that users’ prior beliefs influence the direction of the search terms, thereby generating narrow search results that limit belief updating. This effect persists across various domains (e.g., beliefs related to coronavirus, nuclear energy, gas prices, crime rates, bitcoin, caffeine, and general food or beverage health concerns; Studies 1a to 1b, 2a to 2g, 3, 4), platforms (e.g., Google—Studies 1a to 1b, 2a to 2g, 4, 5; ChatGPT, Study 3), and extends to consequential choices (Study 5). Studies 6 and 7 demonstrate the limited efficacy of prompting users to correct for the impact of narrow searches on their beliefs themselves. Using our custom-designed search engine and AI chatbot interfaces, Studies 8 and 9 show that modifying algorithms to provide broader results can encourage belief updating. These findings highlight the need for a behaviorally informed approach to the design of search algorithms.",

Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm and extend the cryo-EM findings. The ARF6 lattice exhibits features that are distinct from those formed by other membrane-bending proteins. We identify protein contacts critical for lattice assembly and how membrane insertion results in constricted tubules. The lattice structure also enables docking by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) to achieve vesiculation. We have also modeled ARF1 onto the ARF6 lattice, and then pursued vesicle reconstitution by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex to further confirm that the ARF lattice acts in vesicle fission.

          "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly exposed to hemodynamic forces, which play a crucial role in regulating EC functions. Pulsatile laminar shear stress (PS), representing atheroprotective flow, maintains the anti-inflammation and homeostatic phenotype of ECs, but the comprehensive mechanism underlying the PS-repression of inflammatory genes remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated the role of chromatin organization in mediating the effects of PS on inflammatory gene expression in ECs. We demonstrated that PS induced the expression of histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to promote heterochromatin formation via H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) enrichment, a hallmark gene repression mechanism. SUV39H1 interacts with lamin-associated proteins and facilitates the perinuclear localization of the H3K9me3-enrichment. Silencing the lamin-associated protein emerin (EMD) not only led to the reductions of cytoskeletal F-actin formation and perinuclear H3K9me3 enrichment; but also the impairment of PS-induced SUV39H1 expression, H3K9me3 enrichment at E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 loci to revert their PS-repressed expression. Hence, EMD acts as a hub to transmit mechanical cues from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus and recruits SUV39H1, which regulate nuclear organization, chromatin state, and gene expression. These results accentuate the critical role of nuclear architecture in mechanotransduction and EC responses to mechanical stimuli.",

          "abstract": "α-hydroxy acids (αHAs), simple and prebiotically plausible organic monomers, were likely present in various environments on and off Earth and could have played a role in directing the emergence of the first homochiral living systems. Some αHAs, which could have been of varying chirality, can undergo dehydration polymerization into polyesters, which could assemble into membraneless microdroplets upon rehydration; understanding these processes is critical for unraveling how simple prebiotic molecules transitioned into more complex systems capable of supporting selective chemical reactions, a key step toward the origin of life. Here, we focused on tartaric acid (TA), a prebiotically relevant αHA with multiple chiral forms, to probe plausible mechanisms by which primitive αHA and polyester-based systems could have participated in selective homochiral polymer synthesis. Enantiopure solutions of d -TA or l -TA polymerize efficiently via dehydration, while racemic dl -TA polymerization is inhibited due to stereochemical incompatibility. We found that Ca 2+ ions influence this process in two significant ways: 1) regulating TA monomer availability through selective crystallization, removing equal amounts of both enantiomers in racemic proportion and thereby enriching the enantiomeric excess of the remaining nonracemic TA solution; and 2) modulating polymerization by suppressing enantiopure TA polymerization while enabling dl -TA polymerization. These findings suggest that the differential availability of simple inorganic ions, such as Ca 2+ , could have indirectly mediated the selection of simple organic chiral monomers and the emergence of homochirality in primitive protocell-forming polymers, offering a pathway from nonliving to living matter in early Earth environments.",

In this study, we investigated two KS domains in a eukaryotic microalgal DHA synthase, KS A and KS B , which show low similarities to those of prokaryotic marine enzymes, together with almost all the acyl-ACP intermediates. C6-, C12-, and C18-ACPs were exclusively accepted by KS A while KS B utilized C-8. C14- and C20-ACPs. In contrast, both KS A and KS B showed activities against C2-, C4-, and C10-ACPs.

          "abstract": "The Twomey effect brightens clouds by increasing aerosol concentrations, which activates more droplets and decreases cloud supersaturation in response to more competition for water vapor. To quantify this competition response, we used marine low cloud observations in clean and smoky conditions at Ascension Island in the tropical South Atlantic during the Layered Aerosol Smoke Interactions with Cloud (LASIC) campaign. These observations show similar increases in droplet number for increased accumulation-mode particles from surface-based and satellite cloud retrievals, demonstrating the importance of below-cloud aerosol measurements for retrieving aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) in clean and smoky aerosol conditions. Four methods for estimating cloud supersaturation from aerosol–cloud measurements were compared, with cloud scene-based and parcel-based methods showing sufficient variability for a strong dependence on both aerosol accumulation number concentration and cloud-base updraft velocities. Decomposing aerosol-related changes in cloud albedo and optical depth shows the calculated competition response accounts for dampening the activation response by 12 to 35%, explaining the diminished Twomey effect at high aerosol concentrations observed for smoky conditions at LASIC and previously around the world. This result was consistent for independent supersaturation retrievals by cloud scene-based droplet number and cloud condensation nuclei and parcel-based multimode size-resolving Lagrangian methods. Translating aerosol effects to local radiative forcing with clean conditions as a proxy for preindustrial and smoky conditions for present-day showed that the competition response reduces cooling from the Twomey radiative forcing by 12 to 35%, providing an essential process-specific constraint for improving the representation of aerosol competition in climate model simulation of indirect aerosol forcing.",

Emerging evidence suggests these lipid second messengers may be present in membranes beyond the plasma membrane, yet their spatial regulation within other membrane compartments is not well understood. To dissect the spatial regulation of specific 3-PI species, we developed genetically encodable biosensors with selectivity for PIP 3 or PI(3,4)P 2 . Using these biosensors, we showed that PIP 3 significantly accumulated at the lysosome upon growth factor stimulation, in contrast to the conventional view that PIP 3 is exclusively present in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we showed that lysosomal PIP 3 originates from the plasma membrane and relies on dynamin-dependent endocytosis for lipid internalization. Thus, PIP 3 can exploit dynamic trafficking pathways to access subcellular compartments and regulate signaling in a spatially selective manner.",

We found that zebrafish larvae would respond to predator-like visual stimuli with immobility and bradycardia, both hallmarks of freezing, in a head-fixed behavioral paradigm. We then imaged the zebrafish visual system while larvae responded to different visual stimuli with hunting, freezing, and escape behaviors and systematically identified visually driven neurons and behaviorally correlated sensorimotor neurons. Our analyses indicate that within the optic tectum, broadly tuned sensory neurons are functionally correlated with sensorimotor neurons which respond specifically during one behavior, indicating that it contains suitable information for sensorimotor transformation. We also identified sensorimotor neurons in four other areas downstream of the tectum, and these neurons are also specific for one behavior, indicating that the segregation of the pathways continues in other areas. While our findings shed light on how sensorimotor neurons may integrate visual inputs, further investigation will be required to determine how sensorimotor neurons in different regions interact and where the decision to behave is made.",

          "abstract": "Designing the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical for stable, fast-charging, low-temperature Li-ion batteries. Fostering a “fluorinated interphase,” SEI enriched with LiF, has become a popular design strategy. Although LiF possesses low Li-ion conductivity, many studies have reported favorable battery performance with fluorinated SEIs. Such a contradiction suggests that optimizing SEI must extend beyond chemical composition design to consider spatial distributions of different chemical species. In this work, we demonstrate that the impact of a fluorinated SEI on battery performance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Sufficiently passivating the anode surface without impeding Li-ion transport is key. We reveal that a fluorinated SEI containing excessive and dense LiF severely impedes Li-ion transport. In contrast, a fluorinated SEI with well-dispersed LiF (i.e., small LiF aggregates well mixed with other SEI components) is advantageous, presumably due to the enhanced Li-ion transport across heterointerfaces between LiF and other SEI components. An electrolyte, 1 M LiPF 6 in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2MeTHF), yields a fluorinated SEI with dispersed LiF. This electrolyte allows anodes of graphite, μSi/graphite composite, and pure Si to all deliver a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% and excellent rate capability at low temperatures. Pouch cells containing layered cathodes also demonstrate impressive cycling stability over 1,000 cycles and exceptional rate capability down to −20 °C. Through experiments and theoretical modeling, we have identified a balanced SEI-based approach that achieves stable, fast-charging, low-temperature Li-ion batteries.",

Our structure-guided evolution campaign uses the protease from botulinum neurotoxin and showcases the stepwise change of specificity from its native substrate SNAP25 to the selective degradation of α-Synuclein. The protease’s selectivity is further demonstrated in human cells where near complete degradation of overexpressed human α-Synuclein is observed with no significant effects on cell proliferation.

          "abstract": "Mass extinctions are rare but catastrophic events that profoundly disrupt biodiversity. Widely accepted consequences of mass extinctions, such as biodiversity loss and the appearance of temporary “disaster taxa,” imply that species–area relationships (SARs, or how biodiversity scales with area) should change dramatically across these events: Specifically, both the slope (the rate of accumulation of new species with increasing area) and intercept (the density of species at local scales) of the power–law relationship should decrease. However, these hypotheses have not been tested, and the contribution of variation in the SAR to diversity dynamics in deep time has been neglected. We use fossil data to quantify nested SARs in North American terrestrial tetrapods through the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction (Campanian–Ypresian). We show that SARs vary substantially through time and among groups. In the pre-extinction interval (Maastrichtian), unusually shallow SAR slopes (indicating low beta diversity or provinciality) drive low total regional diversity in dinosaurs, mammals, and other tetrapods. In the immediate postextinction interval (Danian), the explosive diversification of mammals drove high regional diversity via a large increase in SAR slope (indicating higher beta diversity or provinciality), and only a limited increase in SAR intercept. This contradicts the expectation that postextinction biotas should be regionally homogenized by the spread of disaster taxa and impoverished by diversity loss. This early postextinction increase in SAR slope was followed in the Thanetian–Selandian ( ∼ 4.4. myr later) by increases in the intercept, indicating that diversity dynamics at local and regional scales did not change in synchrony.",

Single-cell-level experiments further validate the G protein–selective effects of the PTH binding pose by demonstrating the differential, G protein–dependent residence times and affinity of this ligand at the PTH1R binding site.

          "abstract": "During cell division in animal cells, a bipolar spindle assembles to segregate the chromosomes. Various motor proteins with different properties are essential for spindle self-organization. The minimal set of components required to organize dynamic microtubules into a bipolar network remains however unknown. Here, we use computer simulations to explore whether two types of microtubule-crosslinking motors with opposite directionality can organize dynamic microtubules into bipolar spindles in three-dimensional space around a local microtubule nucleation source. We find that two motors are indeed sufficient, provided their properties resemble the main human spindle motors kinesin-5 and dynein, revealing the core mechanism of spindle self-organization. It is based on the synergistic interplay of a slow plus-directed symmetric motor and a fast minus-directed asymmetric motor. A hypothetical symmetric minus-directed motor can also support spindle formation together with kinesin-5, but only in a limited and unphysiological parameter range. In agreement with its accessory role in human cells, a minus motor with human kinesin-14 properties does not assemble stable bipolar spindles together with kinesin-5. These results reveal fundamental principles for the self-organization of dynamic bipolar microtubule architectures and highlight how distinct molecular designs of mitotic motors are optimized for their task.",

          "abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), an aggressive subtype induced by hormone therapy, lacks effective treatments. This study explored the role of E26 transformation-specific variant 5 (ETV5) in NEPC development. Analysis of multiple prostate cancer datasets revealed that NEPC is characterized by significantly elevated ETV5 expression compared to other subtypes. ETV5 expression increased progressively under hormone therapy through epigenetic modifications. ETV5 induced neural stem–like features in prostate cancer cells and facilitated their differentiation into NEPC under hormone treatment conditions, both in vitro and in vivo. Our molecular mechanistic study identified PBX3 and TLL1 as target genes of ETV5 that contribute to ETV5 overexpression–induced castration resistance and stemness. Notably, obeticholic acid, identified as an ETV5 inhibitor in this study, exhibited promising efficacy in suppressing NEPC development. This study highlights ETV5 as a key transcription factor that facilitates NEPC development and underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for this aggressive cancer subtype.",

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been achieved in various cytomimetic (protocell) models, but controlling molecular condensation using noninert crowders to systematically alter protocell function remains challenging. Intracellular ATP levels influence protein–protein interactions, and dysregulation of ATP can alter cellular crowding dynamics, thereby disrupting the normal formation or dissolution of condensates. Here, we develop a membranized protocell model capable of endogenous LLPS and liquid–gel-like phase separation through precise manipulation of intermolecular interactions within semipermeable polysaccharide-based microcapsules (polysaccharidosomes, P-somes), prepared using microtemplate-guided assembly. We demonstrate that intraprotocellular diffusion-mediated LLPS can be extended into the liquid–gel-like domain by the uptake of the biologically active crowder ATP, resulting in a range of modalities dependent on the fine-tuning of molecular condensation. Endogenous enzyme activity in these crowded polysaccharidosomes is enhanced compared to free enzymes in solution, though this enhancement diminishes at higher levels of intraprotocellular condensation. Additionally, increased molecular crowding inhibits intraprotocell DNA strand displacement reactions. Our findings introduce an expedient and optimized approach to the batch construction of membranized protocell models with controllable molecular crowding and functional diversity. Our mix–incubate–wash protocol for inducing endogenous LLPS in membranized protocells offers potential applications in microreactor technology, environmental sensing, and the delivery and sustained release of therapeutics.",

We analyzed de novo mutations (DNMs) and very rare transmitted/unphased damaging variants in 248 prespecified genes in 11,555 CHD probands. The results identified 60 genes with a significant burden of heterozygous damaging variants. Variants in these genes accounted for CHD in 10.1% of probands with similar contributions from de novo and transmitted variants in parent–offspring trios that showed incomplete penetrance. DNMs in these genes accounted for 58% of the signal from DNMs. Thirty-three genes were linked to a single CHD subtype while 12 genes were associated with 2 to 4 subtypes. Seven genes were only associated with isolated CHD, while 37 were associated with 1 or more extracardiac abnormalities. Genes selectively expressed in the cardiomyocyte lineage were associated with isolated CHD, while those widely expressed in the brain were also associated with neurodevelopmental delay (NDD). Missense variants introducing or removing cysteines in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of NOTCH1 were enriched in tetralogy of Fallot and conotruncal defects, unlike the broader CHD spectrum seen with loss of function variants. Transmitted damaging missense variants in MYH6 were enriched in multiple CHD phenotypes and account for ~1% of all probands. Probands with characteristic mutations causing syndromic CHD were frequently not diagnosed clinically, often due to missing cardinal phenotypes. CHD genes that were positively or negatively associated with development of NDD suggest clinical value of genetic testing. These findings expand the understanding of CHD genetics and support the use of molecular diagnostics in CHD.",

When the crowd is isotropic—comprising individuals moving in all different directions—the collective motion is disordered. In contrast, if it is possible to identify two dominant directions of motion, for example in a corridor, the crowd spontaneously organizes into contraflowing lanes or stripes. In this article, we characterize the physics of the transition between these two distinct phases by using a synergy of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and stylized experiments. We develop a hydrodynamic theory for collisional flows of heterogeneous populations, and we analyze the stability of the disordered configuration. We identify an order–disorder transition occurring as population heterogeneity exceeds a theoretical threshold determined by the collision avoidance maneuvers of the crowd. Our prediction for the onset of pedestrian ordering is consistent with results of agent-based simulations and controlled experiments with human crowds.",

UTe 2 , which was found to feature an exceedingly large upper critical field and striking reentrant behavior at low temperatures, is widely believed to possess a spin-triplet pairing symmetry. However, unambiguous evidence for such a pairing symmetry is still lacking, especially at zero and low magnetic fields. The presence of an inversion crystalline symmetry in UTe 2 requires that, if it is indeed a spin-triplet superconductor, the order parameter must be of odd parity. We report here phase-sensitive measurements of the symmetry of the orbital part of the order parameter using the Josephson effect. The selection rule in the orientation dependence of the Josephson coupling between In, an s -wave superconductor, and UTe 2 suggests strongly that UTe 2 possesses the odd-parity pairing state of B 1 u symmetry near zero magnetic field, making it a spin-triplet superconductor.

The antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is crucial for numerous cancers, yet it presents challenges for selective targeting by traditional inhibitors. In this study, we identified a macrocyclic peptide, 5L1, that strongly binds to MCL1, with a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 7.1 nM. This peptide shows the potential to specifically inhibit the function of MCL1, and demonstrates effective antitumor activity against several blood tumor cell lines with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values for cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated 5L1 in the range of 0.6 to 3 μM. Structural analysis revealed that it functions similarly to molecular glue, capable of binding to two MCL1 molecules simultaneously and inducing their homodimerization. This unique mechanism of action distinguishes it from traditional small-molecule MCL1 inhibitors, underscoring the potential of macrocyclic peptides functioning as molecular glues. Moreover, it inspires the development of highly selective inhibitors targeting MCL1 and other related targets with this glue-like mechanism.",

Phase separation is mediated by multivalent interactions of macromolecules including intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs). Despite considerable advances in experiments, theory, and simulations, the prediction of the thermodynamics of IDR phase behavior remains challenging. We combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and active learning to develop a fast and accurate machine learning model to predict the free energy and saturation concentration for phase separation directly from sequence. We validate the model using computational and previously measured experimental data, as well as new experimental data for six proteins. We apply our model to all 27,663 IDRs of chain length up to 800 residues in the human proteome and find that 1,420 of these (5%) are predicted to undergo homotypic phase separation with transfer free energies &lt; −2 k B T . We use our model to understand the relationship between single-chain compaction and phase separation and find that changes from charge- to hydrophobicity-mediated interactions can break the symmetry between intra- and intermolecular interactions. We also provide proof of principle for how the model can be used in force field refinement. Our work refines and quantifies the established rules governing the connection between sequence features and phase-separation propensities, and our prediction models will be useful for interpreting and designing cellular experiments on the role of phase separation, and for the design of IDRs with specific phase-separation propensities.",

Yet there is large individual variation in attentional capacity and response to MP. It is unclear whether this variation is driven by individual differences in relative density of dopamine receptor subtypes, magnitude of dopamine increases induced by MP, or both. Here, we extensively characterized the brain dopamine system with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (including striatal dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor availability and MP-induced dopamine increases) and measured attention task-evoked fMRI brain activity in two separate sessions (placebo and 60 mg oral MP; single-blind, counterbalanced) in 37 healthy adults. A network of lateral frontoparietal and visual cortices was sensitive to increasing attentional (and working memory) load, whose activity positively correlated with performance across individuals (partial r = 0.474, P = 0.008; controlling for age). MP-induced change in activity within this network correlated with MP-induced change in performance (partial r = 0.686, P &lt; 0.001). The ratio of D1-to-D2/3 receptors in dorsomedial caudate positively correlated with baseline attentional network activity and negatively correlated with MP-induced changes in activity (all pFWE &lt; 0.02). MP-induced changes in attentional load network activity mediated the association between D1-to-D2/3 ratio and MP-induced improvements in performance (mediation estimate = 23.20 [95%CI: −153.67 −81.79], P = 0.004). MP attention-boosting effects were not linked to the magnitude of striatal dopamine increases, but rather showed dependence on an individual’s baseline receptor density. Individuals with lower D1-to-D2/3 ratios tended to have lower frontoparietal activity during sustained attention and experienced greater improvement in brain function and task performance with MP.",

On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure t-J model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ( δ = 0.1 to 0.2 ), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping t 2 suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems.

Interestingly, much of this strategy carries over to the Euler equations in Euclidean space, leading to the weaker result that there exist analytic steady solutions on T 3 such that the only analytic steady Euler flows in a C 1 -neighborhood must belong to a certain linear space of dimension six. For comparison, note that in any C k -neighborhood of a shear flow, there are infinitely many linearly independent analytic shears.",

Loss of function of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 causes narrow and light grains, while overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 results in large and heavy grains. OsMED23 physically interacts with OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A. OsMED23, OsJMJ703, and OsWOX3A associate with the common promoter regions of two key grain size genes GW2 and OsLAC and repress their transcription by influencing H3K4me3 levels. Field trials demonstrate that overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 can significantly increase grain yield. Therefore, our findings identify a mechanism by which the transcriptional repressor complex OsJMJ703-OsMED23-OsWOX3A determines grain size and weight by regulating gene expression and influencing H3K4me3 levels in rice, suggesting that this pathway has a great potential for improving grain yield in key crops.",

Here, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle–specific BMAL1-deficient mice exhibit worsened glucose tolerance upon high-fat diet feeding, despite no evidence of increased weight gain. Metabolite profiling from Bmal1 -deficient muscles revealed impaired glucose utilization specifically at early steps in glycolysis that dictate the switch between anabolic and catabolic glucose fate. We provide evidence that this is due to abnormal control of the nutrient stress–responsive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Genetic HIF1α stabilization in muscle Bmal1 -deficient mice restores glucose tolerance and expression of 217/736 dysregulated genes during DIO, including glycolytic enzymes. Together, these data indicate that during DIO, skeletal muscle BMAL1 is an important regulator of HIF-driven glycolysis and metabolic flexibility, which influences the development of high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance.",

We hypothesized that MMP activity induces immediate mechanical alterations in the ECM, which are subsequently detected by cells. We observed that both fibrillar collagen and synthetic degradable matrices exhibit enhanced stress relaxation following MMP exposure. Cells responded to these variations in relaxation by modulating their spreading and focal adhesions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that stress relaxation and cell spreading can be precisely controlled through the rational design of matrix degradability.

Embedding magnetic nanoparticles into a thin matrix of elastic material enables high flexibility while exploiting the magnetic response of the individual particles. However, in the ultrathin limit of such nanocomposite materials, the particles become too small to sustain a permanent dipole moment. This implies that now large magnetic field gradients are required for actuation, which are difficult to achieve with externally applied fields. Here, we demonstrate through experiment and simulation that monolayer sheets of close-packed paramagnetic nanoparticles in a uniform applied field can generate large local field gradients through particle interactions. As a result, a strong collective magnetization is obtained that leads to large deflections of freestanding sheets already in moderate applied fields. Exploiting the vector nature of the applied field, we furthermore find that it is possible to induce more complex curvature and twist the sheets. Finally, we show that paramagnetic nanoparticle monolayers applied as coatings can generate sufficient force to deflect strips of nonmagnetic material that is several orders of magnitude thicker.",

          "abstract": "Neurons display unique shapes and establish intricate networks, which may differ between sexes. In complex organisms, studying sex differences in structure and function of individual neurons is difficult. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites and males present an exceptional model for studying neuronal morphogenesis in a simple, sexually dimorphic system. We focus on the polymodal sensory bilateral neuron pair PVD, which forms a complex but stereotypic dendritic tree composed of multiple subunits that resemble candelabra. PVD is well studied in hermaphrodites, but not in males. We show here that during larval development, male PVD extends a similar architecture to the hermaphrodite utilizing the sexually shared Menorin patterning mechanism. In early adulthood, however, male PVD develops a unique extension into the copulatory tail structure. Alongside established tail ray neurons RnA and RnB, we show PVD is a third, previously unrecognized, neuron within the tail rays. Unlike RnA and RnB, PVD extends anterogradely, branches and turns within the ray hypodermis, and is nonciliated. This PVD sexually dimorphic arborization is absent in mutant backgrounds which perturb the Menorin guidance complex. SAX-7/L1CAM, a hypodermal component of this complex, shows a male-specific expression pattern which precedes PVD extension, and its presence allows PVD to enter the tail rays. Further, our results reveal that genetically altered arborization or ablation of the PVD results in male mating behavioral defects, particularly as males turn around the hermaphrodite. These results uncover an adult-stage sexual dimorphism of dendritic branching and a function for PVD in male sexual behavior.",

The resulting reduction in cAMP concentration, which is independent of carbon source, decreases transcription of CRP-cAMP-activated carbon utilization genes, hinders carbon source uptake, and restricts metabolism, rendering wild-type bacteria phenotypically CRP − . A cAMP-independent allele of CRP overcame the transcriptional, uptake, and metabolic restrictions caused by cytoplasmic Mg 2+ starvation and significantly increased transcription of the glucose uptake gene when S. Typhimurium was inside murine macrophages. The reduced preference for glucose exhibited by S. Typhimurium inside macrophages reflects that transcription of the glucose uptake gene requires higher amounts of active CRP-cAMP than transcription of uptake genes for preferred carbon sources, such as gluconate and glycerol. By reducing CRP-cAMP activity, low cytoplasmic Mg 2+ alters carbon source preference, adjusting metabolism and growth.",

          "abstract": "Silicon-induced responses play a key role in plant defense against herbivory, though the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. In this study, we examined how mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) affect tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) defense against an invasive and highly destructive lepidopteran herbivore, the tomato pinworm (TPW), Phthorimaea absoluta . In tomato plants supplemented with MSN, prior exposure to TPW oviposition shifted subsequent egg-laying from a preference for leaves to an even distribution between stems and leaves. This shift was not observed in nonsilicon-supplemented plants. Prolonged oviposition triggered pigmentation in the basal cells of type I glandular trichomes on the stems of silicon-supplemented plants. Chemical analysis by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the pigmented trichome was rich in soluble sugars (sucrose and l -arabinose) and waxes, dominated by the saturated hydrocarbon tetracosane. Bioassays with the crude extract of the pigmented trichome and a three-component sugar–wax blend replicated the oviposition and caterpillar response observed with the pigmented trichome, while individual components produced variable effects. While l -arabinose alone replicated the oviposition effects of the three-component sugar–wax blend, sucrose increased oviposition and caterpillar feeding and survival, while l -arabinose and tetracosane caused the highest caterpillar mortality. Additionally, these treatments altered caterpillar gut microbiota composition and influenced frass volatiles, which attracted the TPW natural enemies, Nesidiocoris tenuis (predator) and Neochrysocharis formosa (parasitoid). Our findings suggest that silicon supplementation increases tomato defense against TPW through oviposition-induced responses, which promotes recruitment of natural enemies.",

This study uses a high-density, genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to examine the influence of gene-specific transcriptional variation on the growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 under environmental extremes. Surprisingly, many partial knockdowns enhanced fitness under cold monochromatic conditions. Transcriptional repression of genes for core subunits of the NDH-1 complex, which are important for photosynthesis and carbon uptake, improved growth rates under both red and blue light but at distinct, color-specific optima. Most genes with fitness-improving knockdowns were distinct to each light color, and dual-target transcriptional repression produced nonadditive effects. Findings reveal diverse routes to improved acclimation in cyanobacteria (e.g., attenuation of genes involved in CO 2 uptake, light harvesting, translation, and purine metabolism) and provide an approach for using gradients in sgRNA activity to pinpoint biochemically influential transcriptional changes in cells.",

In this study, advanced Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations were used to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of peptide bond formation at air–water interfaces using diglycine, the simplest dipeptide, as a model molecule. The results show that peptide bonds can be rapidly formed via a unique isomerization-then-OH − -elimination pathway. In this mechanism, the diglycine initially isomerizes into its acidic form at the air–water interface, followed by a reaction that releases an OH − anion rather than the previously hypothesized H 2 O. The free-energy barriers for the interfacial pathway with the assistance of an interfacial electric field are much lower than those in the gas phase by &gt;25 kcal/mol. Further calculations suggest that this mechanism can be extended to the formation of some larger peptides, such as tetraglycine. This pathway offers insights into the origin of life and could inform the development of methods for peptide synthesis.",

Here, we introduce a synthetic model designed to measure friction forces between biomimetic membranes and substrates. The model consists of a vesicle with precisely controlled properties, fabricated via microfluidics, encapsulating a single ferromagnetic particle that is magnetically driven to rotate. The rotation of the particle generates a confined rotational flow, setting the vesicle membrane into motion. By adjusting the magnetic field frequency and vesicle size, the rotation frequency of the vesicle can be finely controlled, resulting in a rolling vesicle that functions as an effective tribological tool across a wide frequency range. At low frequencies, molecular contact between the membrane and substrate dominates frictional interactions, which enables determination of the contact friction coefficient. At higher frequencies, lubrication becomes predominant, causing the vesicles to slip rather than roll. Adjusting membrane fluidity and incorporating specific ligand–receptor interactions within this model will enable detailed studies of frictional forces in more complex biomimetic systems, providing key insights into the mechanisms of cell movement and mechanotransduction.",

Different from the mitochondrial and bacterial enzymes, F 1 F O from photosynthetic organisms have evolved diverse structural and mechanistic details to adapt to the light-dependent reactions. Although complete structure of chloroplast F 1 F O has been reported, no high-resolution structure of an F 1 F O from photosynthetic bacteria has been available. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of an intact and functionally competent F 1 F O from Chloroflexus aurantiacus ( Ca F 1 F O ), a filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from the earliest branch of photosynthetic organisms. The structures of Ca F 1 F O in its ADP-free and ADP-bound forms for three rotational states reveal a previously unrecognized architecture of ATP synthases. A pair of peripheral stalks connect to the Ca F 1 head through a dimer of δ-subunits, and associate with two membrane-embedded a-subunits that are asymmetrically positioned outside and clamp Ca F O ’s c 10 -ring. The two a-subunits constitute two proton inlets on the periplasmic side and two proton outlets on the cytoplasmic side, endowing Ca F 1 F O with unique proton translocation pathways that allow more protons being translocated relative to single a-subunit F 1 F O . Our findings deepen understanding of the architecture and proton translocation mechanisms of F 1 F O synthases and suggest innovative strategies for modulating their activities by altering the number of a-subunit.",

          "abstract": "Sponges, the basalmost members of the animal kingdom, exhibit a range of complex architectures in which microfluidic channels connect multitudes of spherical chambers lined with choanocytes, flagellated filter-feeding cells. Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here, we combine direct imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the result that the flow rate and mechanical pumping efficiency reach a maximum at a small outlet opening angle. Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number, and the outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge Ephydatia muelleri , as well as several other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping functions. These results indicate the subtle balances at play during morphogenesis of choanocyte chambers, and give insights into the physiology and body design of sponges.",

We apply this measure to all vetted mitigation scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report and two scenarios that model current policies and pledges, using an illustrative equal per capita allocation of a remaining 1.5 °C carbon budget starting in 1990. The resulting regional carbon debt estimates inform i) the scale and pace of regional carbon drawdown obligations necessary to address budget exceedance and ii) relative regional responsibilities for increased lifetime exposure to extreme heatwaves across age cohorts due to budget exceedance. Our work strengthens intergenerational equity considerations within an international climate equity discourse and informs the implementation of effort-sharing mechanisms that persist beyond the exhaustion of a rapidly dwindling remaining carbon budget.",

Combination antimicrobial therapies may be an important strategy to overcome resistance and broaden the spectrum of existing antibiotics. However, this strategy is limited by the ability to efficiently screen large combinatorial chemical spaces. Here, we deployed a high-throughput combinatorial screening platform, DropArray, to evaluate the interactions of over 30,000 compounds with up to 22 antibiotics and 6 strains of gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, totaling to over 1.3 million unique strain-antibiotic-compound combinations. In this dataset, compounds more frequently exhibited synergy with known antibiotics than single-agent activity. We identified a compound, P2-56, and developed a more potent analog, P2-56-3, which potentiated rifampin (RIF) against antibiotic-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Using phenotypic assays, we showed P2-56-3 disrupts the outer membrane of A. baumannii . To identify pathways involved in the mechanism of synergy between P2-56-3 and RIF, we performed genetic screens in A. baumannii . CRISPRi-induced partial depletion of lipooligosaccharide transport genes ( lptA - D , lptFG ) resulted in hypersensitivity to P2-56-3/RIF treatment, demonstrating the genetic dependency of P2-56-3 activity and RIF sensitization on lpt genes in A. baumannii. Consistent with outer membrane homeostasis being an important determinant of P2-56-3/RIF tolerance, knockout of maintenance of lipid asymmetry complex genes and overexpression of certain resistance-nodulation-division efflux pumps—a phenotype associated with multidrug-resistance—resulted in hypersensitivity to P2-56-3. These findings demonstrate the immense scale of phenotypic antibiotic combination screens using DropArray and the potential for such approaches to discover new small molecule synergies against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE strains.",

Mechanically, FBXW7 inhibits histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (KMT2) methyltransferase activity via retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RbBP5) binding, whereas FBXW7 depletion abrogates the binding to activate KMT2, leading to increased H3K4 methylations and global upregulation of gene expression.

Due to shared stomatal anatomy with the earliest land plants, bryophyte stomatal behavior may provide insights into the evolution of stomatal function, but significant uncertainty remains due to technical limitations of measuring guard cell turgor pressure in situ. Here, we introduce a method for monitoring cell turgor pressure by nucleating microbubbles within the guard cells of intact plant tissue and then examining microbubble growth and dissolution dynamics. First, we show that maximum microbubble radius decreases with increasing pressure as the pressure of the surrounding fluid constrains its growth according to a modified version of the Epstein–Plesset equation. We then apply this method to monitor turgor pressure in dark- vs. light-acclimated guard cells across bryophyte taxa with stomata, where their role in gas-exchange remains ambiguous, and in vascular plants with well-documented light-dependent turgor modulation. Our findings show no light-activated change in turgor in bryophyte guard cells, with pressures not significantly different than neighboring epidermal cells. In contrast, vascular plants show distinct pressure modulation in response to light that drives reversible changes in stomatal aperture. Complete guard cell turgor loss had no effect on bryophyte stomatal aperture but resulted in partial or complete closure in vascular plants. These results suggest that despite conserved stomatal morphology, the sampled bryophytes lack dynamic control over guard cell turgor that is critical for sustaining photosynthesis and inhibiting desiccation.",

We report an atlas of over 700 common or unique phosphorylation events reprogrammed by these different IFNs, revealing both previously known and uncharacterized modifications. While the proteins differentially phosphorylated following IFN stimulation have diverse roles, there is an enrichment of factors involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and RNA splicing. Functional screening and mechanistic studies identify that several proteins modified in response to IFNs contribute to host antiviral responses, either directly or by supporting IFN-stimulated gene or protein production. Among these, phosphorylation of PLEKHG3 at serine-1081 creates a phospho-regulated binding motif for the docking of 14-3-3 proteins, and together these factors contribute to coordinating efficient IFN-stimulated gene expression independent of early Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. Our findings map the global phosphorylation landscapes regulated by IFN types I, II, and III, and provide a key resource to explore their functional consequences.",

Dominant-negative mutations of KCNJ2 encoding the Kir2.1 potassium channel subunit are found in 60% of ATS families. As with most channelopathies, episodic attacks in ATS are frequently triggered by environmental stresses: exercise for periodic paralysis or stress with adrenergic stimulation for arrhythmia. Fluctuations in K + , either low or high, are potent triggers for attacks of weakness in other variants of periodic paralysis (hypokalemic periodic paralysis or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis). For ATS, the [K + ] dependence is less clear; with reports describing weakness in high-K + or low-K + . Patient trials with controlled K + challenges are not possible, due to arrhythmias. We have developed two mouse models (genetic and pharmacologic) with reduced Kir currents, to address the question of K + -sensitive loss of force. These animal models and computational simulations both show K + -dependent weakness occurs only when Kir current is &lt;30% of wildtype. As the Kir deficit becomes more severe, the phenotype shifts from high-K + -induced weakness to a combination where either high-K + or low-K + triggers weakness.

Our method excavates vectors that represent concepts from AlphaZero’s internal representations using convex optimization, and filters the concepts based on teachability (whether the concept is transferable to another AI agent) and novelty (whether the concept contains information not present in human chess games). These steps ensure that the discovered concepts are useful and meaningful. For the resulting set of concepts, prototypes (chess puzzle–solution pairs) are presented to experts for final validation. In a preliminary human study, four top chess grandmasters (all former or current world chess champions) were evaluated on their ability to solve concept prototype positions. All grandmasters showed improvement after the learning phase, suggesting that the concepts are at the frontier of human understanding. Despite the small scale, our result is a proof of concept demonstrating the possibility of leveraging knowledge from a highly capable AI system to advance the frontier of human knowledge; a development that could bear profound implications and shape how we interact with AI systems across many applications.",

          "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes and other cancers are often associated with mutations in the U2 snRNP protein SF3B1. Common SF3B1 mutations, including K700E, disrupt SF3B1 interaction with the protein SUGP1 and induce aberrant activation of alternative 3′ splice sites (ss), presumably resulting from aberrant U2/branch site (BS) recognition by the mutant spliceosome. Here, we apply a method of U2 IP-seq to profile BS binding across the transcriptome of K562 leukemia cells carrying the SF3B1 K700E mutation. For alternative 3′ ss activated by K700E, we identify their associated BSs and show that they are indeed shifted from the WT sites. Unexpectedly, we also identify thousands of additional changes in BS binding in the mutant cells that do not alter splicing. These new BSs are usually very close to the natural sites, occur upstream or downstream, and either exhibit stronger base-pairing potential with U2 snRNA or are adjacent to stronger polypyrimidine tracts than the WT sites. The widespread imprecision in BS recognition induced by K700E with limited changes in 3′ ss selection expands the physiological consequences of this oncogenic mutation.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the role of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in myelin regeneration in the brain. TREM2 is a receptor that activates microglia, which are crucial for clearing myelin debris and promoting remyelination. Previous studies in a mouse model of demyelination induced by the copper-chelating agent Cuprizone (CPZ) have shown that stimulation of TREM2 with a monoclonal antibody reduces demyelination, while deleting the Trem2 gene in mice impairs remyelination. Here, we blocked TREM2 function acutely with an antibody during both the demyelination and remyelination phases of the CPZ model and analyzed the impact of the antibody treatment on myelination and gene expression in single cells. We found that blocking TREM2 depleted a distinct population of microglia with high expression of the transcription factor MAFB during remyelination. The loss of these MAFB-high microglia was linked to impaired generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Importantly, we identified MAFB + microglia in acute and acute-chronic brain lesions from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), but not in inactive lesions. We conclude that TREM2 is essential for maintaining a population of MAFB-high microglia that is associated with myelin repair. This finding has significant implications for understanding demyelinating diseases like MS and suggests that stimulating TREM2 could be a promising therapeutic approach for myelin repair.",

          "abstract": "Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.",

Constructing models to predict, control, and design bacterial motility for these processes remains challenging because bacteria and active swimmers have complex interactions with surfaces and because the precise environment geometry is unknown. Here, we present a method for deriving bacterial diffusion coefficients in disordered media in terms of cell and environmental parameters. The approach abstracts the dynamics in the full geometry to “surface states,” which encode how cells interact with surfaces in the environment. Then, a long-time diffusion equation can be derived analytically from the state model. Applying this method to a run-and-tumble particle in a 2D Lorentz gas environment provides analytical predictions that show good agreement with particle simulations. Like past studies, we observe that the diffusivity depends nonmonotonically on the cell’s run length. Using the analytical expressions, we derive the optimal run length, revealing an intuitive dependence on environmental length scales. Furthermore, we find that rescaling length and time by the average distance and time between trap events collapses all of the diffusivities onto a single curve, which we derive analytically. Thus, our approach extracts interpretable, macroscopic diffusive behavior from complex microscopic dynamics, and provides tools and intuitions for understanding bacterial diffusion in disordered media.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intricately influencing the accumulation of neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) in human food webs, potentially leading to uneven exposure risks across regions. Here, we reveal that climate change will elevate MeHg risks in China, with implications for regional inequalities in Asia through a climate-mercury-food-health nexus. Using a compiled fish mercury dataset from 13,000 samples and machine learning, we find that freshwater wild fish—an essential component of the Asian diet—is an underappreciated MeHg source. Specifically, MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish are 2.9 to 6.2 times higher than in freshwater farmed fish and 1.7 times higher than in marine wild fish. Individual climate factors influence MeHg accumulation differently, while their combined effects significantly increase MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish. Under SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 by 2031 to 2060, national average MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish are projected to increase by about 60%, adding a maximum annual economic loss of US$18 million (2022 USD) from intelligence quotient decrements in Chinese newborns. This loss may vary regionally within China and among Asian countries, disproportionately affecting less developed areas. Coordinating climate action with mercury emission reduction strategies could mitigate these overlooked regional risks, reduce regional inequalities in food safety, and ultimately contribute to sustainable development.",

We deployed brain-penetrant TYK2 inhibitors (cTYK2i) alongside the peripherally restricted TYK2 inhibitor (pTYK2i; BMS-986165) to untangle the contributions of central TYK2 inhibition in diverse models of neuroinflammation. While pTYK2i had little impact, cTYK2i reduced clinical score, lymphoid cell infiltration, and cytokines/chemokines in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Microglial activation was attenuated in cTYK2i-treated EAE spinal cords and circulating neurofilament light (NfL) was reduced in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, cTYK2i was protective in an antibody-mediated mouse model of primary progressive MS (PPMS). Finally, we demonstrate TYK2 inhibition has a robust impact on a unique subset of activated astrocytes termed Interferon-Responsive-Reactive-Astrocytes (IRRA).

This first, taxonomically diverse assessment for mainland North America north of Mexico reveals that 22.6% (20.6 to 29.6%) of the 1,579 species in the best-studied vertebrate and insect pollinator groups have elevated risk of extinction. All three pollinating bat species are at risk and bees are the insect group most at risk (best estimate, 34.7% of 472 species assessed, range 30.3 to 43.0%). Substantial numbers of butterflies (19.5% of 632 species, range 19.1 to 21.0%) and moths (16.1% of 142 species, range 15.5 to 19.0%) are also at risk, with flower flies (14.7% of 295 species, range 11.5 to 32.9%), beetles (12.5% of 18 species, range 11.1 to 22.2%), and hummingbirds (0% of 17 species) more secure. At-risk pollinators are concentrated where diversity is highest, in the southwestern United States. Threats to pollinators vary geographically: climate change in the West and North, agriculture in the Great Plains, and pollution, agriculture, and urban development in the East. Woodland, shrubland/chaparral, and grassland habitats support the greatest numbers of at-risk pollinators. Strategies for improving pollinator habitat are increasingly available, and this study identifies species, habitats, and threats most in need of conservation actions at state, provincial, territorial, national, and continental levels.",

Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.",

This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage.

The thermal stability of the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic % (at %) alloy is attributed to coherent, ordered L1 2 Cu 3 Li precipitates surrounded by a tantalum-rich atomic bilayer phase boundary complexion. Adding 0.5 at % lithium to the immiscible Cu-Ta system changes the morphology of the nanoscale precipitates from spherical to cuboidal while simultaneously tailoring the phase boundary. The resultant complexion-stabilized nanoscale precipitates provide excellent thermal stability, strength, and creep resistance. The underlying alloy design principles may guide the development of next-generation copper alloys for high-temperature applications such as heat exchangers.",

          "abstract": "Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.",

By contrast, non-Hermitian wave systems are characterized by Hamiltonians with poles and zeros at complex frequencies, whose control through precise engineering of material loss and gain can lead to exotic scattering phenomena. Notably, excitation signals that oscillate at complex-valued frequencies can mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to these non-Hermitian responses without material modifications. These findings have been advancing the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interactions and are enabling breakthroughs in metamaterials, imaging, sensing, and computing. This Review examines theoretical advances and experimental discoveries in this emerging field, demonstrating how tailored time-domain excitations offer new opportunities for wave manipulation and control.",

However, our understanding of epigenetic dynamics during preimplantation development at single-cell resolution remains incomplete. Here, we developed scNanoATAC-seq2, a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using long-read sequencing for scarce samples. We present a detailed chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse preimplantation development, revealing distinct chromatin signatures in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm during lineage segregation. Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Single-cell long-read sequencing enables in-depth analysis of chromatin accessibility in noncanonical imprinting, imprinted X chromosome inactivation, and low-mappability genomic regions, such as repetitive elements and paralogs. Our data provide insights into chromatin dynamics during mammalian preimplantation development and lineage differentiation.",

Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.",

To address this, research in quantum optics has explored filtering techniques such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. We introduce an approach to entanglement retrieval that exploits the features of non-Hermitian systems. By designing an anti–parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network and achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels, remaining robust against decoherence during propagation. Our results offer an approach to using non-Hermitian symmetries to address central challenges in quantum technologies.",

The Chang’e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon’s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.",

          "abstract": "For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.",

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.",

We defined the basis of this selectivity using mice in which T reg cells reactive to a single prostate-specific self-peptide were selectively depleted. We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.",

Here, we report a highly robust liquid-particle composite, named a Particle-armored liquid roBot (PB), featuring a liquid blob coated with unusually abundant superhydrophobic particles. The enhanced deformability and structural stability of our millimetric PBs enable a range of versatile robotic functions, such as navigating through complex environments, engulfing and transporting cargoes, merging, and adapting to various environments. We use both theoretical analysis and experimental approaches to develop a framework for predicting the shape evolution, dynamics, and robotic functions of PBs.

          "abstract": "In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T regs ) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T regs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD + with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T regs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T regs , sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD + axis disrupts T regs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.",

This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler’s ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to d -dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path toward the study of competitive events in complex media.",

The synthesis of monazite, LaPO 4 , requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO 4 •nH 2 O, to the LaPO 4 monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure. The pH dependence of this reaction is detailed, and its applicability to the Ln PO 4 ( Ln  = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm-Gd), Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 , and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 systems is discussed. The crystal growth of Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 is described, and their crystal structures were reported.

However, dysfunction and impairment of sensory nerves, accompanied by excessive inflammation impede tissue regeneration. Consequently, specific induction of sensory innervation to mediate immunoregulation becomes a promising therapeutic approach. Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration.",

We used time-of-flight mass cytometry to identify cells enriched in the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with subsequent acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD), a risk factor for CLAD. We show that CD4 + CD57 + PD1 + T cells emerge in stable patients, conferring risks for ALAD, CLAD, and death. These cells are senescent, secrete inflammatory cytokines, and fall into two oligoclonal subsets with putative cytotoxic and follicular helper functions. Last, they are associated with fibrosis in mouse and human lung allografts, where they localize near airway epithelium and B cells.

In this work, we achieve nanosecond-pulsed electroluminescence (EL) from a solution-processed fast-response quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED). By modeling the QLED with a resistor-capacitor equivalent circuit and analyzing the transient current of the circuit, the dynamic of the carrier injection and transport process that fundamentally affects the transient EL of QLED is revealed, which helps to guide the optimization of fast-response QLED. Driven by a high current source, the optimized QLED can output stable and repeatable ultrashort EL with a pulse duration of 20 nanoseconds, a repetition rate of 50 kilohertz, and a high radiant exitance of 5.4 watts per square centimeter. Enabled by the nanosecond-pulsed EL, the developed QLED can be directly used as an instantaneous excitation source for time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.

While these neural processes converge in the temporal cortex, the nature of their interactions remains largely unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the interplay between visual attention and stimulus feature coding by training macaques to perform a free-gaze visual search task with natural stimuli. Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features. Together, our results suggest a complex interplay between visual feature and attention coding in the primate brain, likely driven by interactions between brain areas engaged in these processes.",

A subset of these cancers, which we term as “RBness,” lack RB1 genomic defects and yet phenocopy the transcriptional profile of RB1 -defective cancers. We report RBness as a pan-cancer phenomenon, associated with patient outcome and chemotherapy response in multiple cancer types, and predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor response in estrogen-positive breast cancer. Using RNA interference and a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in isogenic models, we find that RBness cancers also phenocopy synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cells with RB1 genomic defects. In summary, our findings suggest that dysregulation of the RB pathway in cancers lacking RB1 genomic defects provides a molecular rationale for how these cancers could be treated.",

Notably, self-supervised vision-language foundation models can detect a broad spectrum of pathologies without relying on explicit training annotations. However, it is crucial to ensure that these AI models do not mirror or amplify human biases, disadvantaging historically marginalized groups such as females or Black patients. In this study, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models in chest x-ray diagnosis across five globally sourced datasets. Our findings reveal that compared to board-certified radiologists, these foundation models consistently underdiagnose marginalized groups, with even higher rates seen in intersectional subgroups such as Black female patients. Such biases present over a wide range of pathologies and demographic attributes. Further analysis of the model embedding uncovers its substantial encoding of demographic information. Deploying medical AI systems with biases can intensify preexisting care disparities, posing potential challenges to equitable healthcare access and raising ethical questions about their clinical applications.",

The gold standard, 2-[ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, is limited by radioactive exposure and sparse assessment of metabolism beyond glucose uptake and retention. Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) with [6,6- 2 H 2 ]glucose is nonradioactive, achieves tumor metabolic contrast, but can be improved by enriched contrast from deuterated water (HDO) based imaging. Here, we developed a DMRI protocol employing [ 2 H 7 ]glucose. Imaging 2 H-signal and measuring HDO production in tumor-bearing mice detected differential glucose utilization across baseline tumors, tumors treated with vehicle control or anti-glycolytic BRAFi and MEKi therapy, and contralateral healthy tissue. Control tumors generated the most 2 H-signal and HDO. To our knowledge this is the first application of DMRI with [ 2 H 7 ]glucose for tumoral treatment monitoring. This approach demonstrates HDO as a marker of tumor glucose utilization and suggests translational capability in humans due to its safety, noninvasiveness, and suitability for serial monitoring.",

Our previous research revealed that M2 macrophages transfected with magnetotactic bacteria–derived Mms6 gene can resist ferroptosis and enhance SCI recovery. To address the limitations of M2 macrophage transplantation, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating Mms6 mRNA targeting macrophages ( Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs). The targeting efficiency and therapeutic effect of these LNPs in SCI mice were evaluated. Intravenous administration of Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs delivered more Mms6 mRNAs to lesion-site macrophages than those in the Mms6 mRNA-LNP group, which resulted in enhancing motor function recovery, reducing lesion area and scar formation, and promoting neuronal survival and nerve fiber repair. These effects were nullified when macrophages were depleted. These findings suggest that macrophage-targeted delivery of Mms6 mRNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting spinal cord repair and motor function recovery in patients with traumatic SCI.",

Here, we propose a link between lipid metabolism and ERneg BC through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo serine pathway. We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway.

Head-mounted microscopes enable neuroimaging in freely behaving mice; however, investigating neurovascular dynamics remains challenging because of a lack of hemodynamic information, especially blood oxygenation, or insufficient resolution. Here, we report a head-mounted microscope for neurovascular imaging that enables the simultaneous recording of neuronal burst firing and multiparametric hemodynamics such as vascular oxygen saturation at high spatiotemporal resolution. The 1.7-gram lightweight microscope integrates confocal fluorescence and photoacoustic microscopy, allowing recordings at 0.78 hertz with 1.5-micrometer lateral resolution across a field of view of 400 micrometers by 400 micrometers. We identified cell type–specific neurovascular responses to hypoxic challenges, observed active regulation of arterioles during sensory stimuli, and detected abnormal oxygen depletion and vasodilation preceding burst neuronal discharges in epileptic disorders. This technique provides valuable insights into neurovascular coupling and holds potential for studying the pathology of neurological brain diseases.",

          "abstract": "Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN 4–6 GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.",

Our imaging and histopathological studies demonstrated that paramagnetic susceptibility is a sensitive biomarker for iron quantification in epilepsy. This method effectively detects iron abnormality from various causes and highlights that iron alters within epileptogenic zones, indicating the presence of potentially salvageable tissue. Furthermore, iron accumulation was observed to disrupt cortical laminar structures in epileptogenic zones and was associated with the proliferation of central nervous system cells, particularly astrocytes.

Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in &lt;10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.",

Our analysis shows that NAT10-dependent ac 4 C-acetylation is robust in rRNA and specific tRNAs but low/spurious in mRNA. It also revealed an inflammatory signature and mutagenesis at transcriptionally active sites in NAT10-KO cells. This finding led us to explore the role of NAT10 in R-loops, which were recently linked to APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis. Our analysis showed that R-loops are ac 4 C-acetylated in a NAT10-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAT10 restrains the levels of R-loops at a subset of differentially expressed genes in a catalytic activity–dependent manner.

Using automated microinjection into apical progenitors (APs) of embryonic mouse neocortex and electroporation of APs in chimpanzee cerebral organoids, we show that NBPF14 promotes the delamination of AP progeny, by promoting oblique cleavage plane orientation during AP division, leading to increased abundance of the key basal progenitor type, basal radial glia. In contrast, NOTCH2NLB promotes AP proliferation, leading to expansion of the AP pool. When expressed together, NBPF14 and NOTCH2NLB exert coordinated effects, resulting in expansion of basal progenitors while maintaining self-renewal of APs. Hence, these two human-specific genes orchestrate the behavior of APs, and the lineages of their progeny, in a manner essential for the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.",

This “passing-stripe” display reduces the probability of response to predatory expanding stimuli by prey crabs in a lab-based experiment, is modulated according to approach speed during a hunt, and generates a motion pattern that is different from that of looming predators.

In this active state, the PWWP domain most often aligns closely with the catalytic domain, allowing for simultaneous interactions with H3 and DNA to stimulate DNA methylation. The prostate cancer–associated DNMT3B R545C mutant is even more dynamic and susceptible to adopting the active conformation, resulting in aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study suggests the mechanism by which conformational rearrangements in DNMT3B are triggered by histone modifications, ultimately unleashing its activity in DNA methylation.",

          "abstract": "Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent nonequilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a “nonlocal” pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe 2 , several microns away from the illumination spot. We identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons’ linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.",

We compare spatial similarity in community composition among marine invertebrate fossils represented by bivalve and gastropod fossils with predictions from an ecophysiological model of habitat that diagnoses areas in the ocean that can sustain the aerobic requirements of marine invertebrates. Modeled biogeographic responses to climate change yield an increase in global similarity of community composition among surviving ecophysiotypes, consistent with patterns in the fossil record and arguing for a physiological control on earliest Triassic biogeography.",

Climate and anthropogenic factors are identified as major drivers of the global distribution of HPB. Our predictions indicated that by the end of this century, the richness, abundance, and invasion risk of HPB will increase globally, with this upward trend becoming more pronounced as development sustainability declines.

This process has traditionally been explained through the model of long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we demonstrate a donor-to-acceptor short-range energy transfer (SRET) mechanism in OPV blends with non-fullerene acceptors, extending beyond the Förster approximation. This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers. These findings underscore the short-range interactions in regulating the donor-to-acceptor energy transfer in OPV blends, suggesting that SRET should be considered alongside FRET and charge-transfer processes for device optimizations.",

These hydrogels exhibit mechanical properties comparable with biological tissues, reducing adverse immune responses. The hydrogels can be patterned on elastic substrates using a simple, low-cost micromolding technique to fabricate soft and stretchable implantable devices for electrical stimulation and recording. The hydrogel electrodes show much lower electrochemical impedance and higher charge storage and injection capacity compared to platinum electrodes. In addition, the properties of hydrogels and devices remain stable after long-term storage and exposure to extreme conditions.

Here, we train data-driven models using climatic data, satellite images, and geographic factors to reconstruct surface DO and quantify the climatic contribution to DO variations in 15,535 lakes from 2003 to 2023. Our analysis indicates a continuous deoxygenation in 83% of the studied lakes. The mean deoxygenation rate in global lakes (−0.049 milligrams per liter per decade) is faster than that observed in the oceans and in rivers. By decreasing solubility, climatic warming contributes 55% of global lake deoxygenation. Meanwhile, heatwaves exert rapid influences on DO decline, resulting in a 7.7% deoxygenation compared to that observed under climatological mean temperatures. By the end of the century, global lake DO is projected to decrease by 0.41 milligrams per liter (4.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and 0.86 milligrams per liter (8.8%) under SSP5-8.5 scenarios.",

Here, we conducted an in vivo screen for vulnerabilities of brain metastasis and identified N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) as a driver of brain metastasis. Knockdown of NAT10 restrains cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. The poorly characterized RNA helicase domain of NAT10 is critical for cell growth in vitro, while both RNA helicase and NAT domains are essential for primary tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NAT10 promotes the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), two enzymes for serine biosynthesis implicated in brain metastasis. Silencing PHGDH or PSAT1 in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits their growth in the serine/glycine-limited condition, phenocopying the effects of NAT10 depletion.

Here, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the premotor cortex (medial M2) as mice engage in a competitive matching pennies game. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site. Temporally, task-driven NE transients were more synchronized and peaked earlier than ACh transients. To test functional relevance, we stimulated neuromodulatory signals using optogenetics to find that NE, but not ACh, increases the animals’ propensity to explore alternate options.

          "abstract": "The role of canonical autophagy in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), referred to as xenophagy, is understood to involve targeting Mtb to autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Here, we found that Ca 2+ leakage after Mtb phagosome damage in human macrophages is the signal that triggers autophagy-related protein 8/microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (ATG8/LC3) lipidation. Unexpectedly, ATG8/LC3 lipidation did not target Mtb to lysosomes, excluding the canonical xenophagy. Upon Mtb phagosome damage, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation occurred on multiple membranes instead of single or double membranes excluding the noncanonical autophagy pathways. Mechanistically, Ca 2+ leakage from the phagosome triggered the recruitment of the V-ATPase–ATG16L1 complex independently of FIP200, ATG13, and proton gradient disruption. Furthermore, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation limited Mtb phagosome damage and restricted Mtb replication.

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling and targeted in situ detection to identify Reln (encoding the secreted glycoprotein, Reelin) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal populations within the rat NAc. A CRISPR interference approach enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc altered expression of calcium signaling genes, promoted a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and decreased MSN excitability.

MurinecPIIRS models recapitulated this pathway predominance and treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, confirmed a mechanistic requirement for this pathway in disease pathology. Ruxolitinib treatment improved markers of neuronal damage, reduced activated T cell and myeloid cells, and improved weight. On the basis of these findings, we conducted a first-in-human ruxolitinib treatment of patients with cPIIRS (NCT00001352).

Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication in HoxC10 intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in high HoxC expression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, and HoxC misexpression alters feather shapes. The 195-bp sequence is found only in Archelosauria (crocodilians and birds) and not in mammals.

          "abstract": "The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB 6 and YbB 12 . Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U 3 Bi 4 Ni 3 . Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB 6 and YbB 12 . At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U 3 Bi 4 Ni 3 and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.",

Traditionally, wavelength multiplexing holography with high-capacity information channel was only achievable through 3D volume holograms using Bragg diffraction. Here, we demonstrate ultranarrow-linewidth wavelength-vortex multiplexing holography in metasurface holograms. By applying elementary dispersion engineering, we develop a sparse k -vector–filtering aperture array in momentum space, enabling sharp wavelength selectivity combined with orbital angular momentum selectivity. Further leveraging transformer neural networks for the design of phase-only holograms, we showcase the reconstruction of up to 118 independent images from a single hologram, achieving a simulated ultranarrow linewidth of 2 nanometers within the visible range. We apply these developed metasurface holograms for holographic visual cryptography, attaining unprecedented security levels with an information rate over 2500 times higher than traditional methods. Our results open exciting avenues for the application of metasurface holograms in various fields, including 3D displays, holographic encryption, and optical artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Synchronization occurs ubiquitously in nature and science. The synchronization regions generally broaden monotonically with the strength of the forcing, thereby featuring a tongue-like shape in parameter space, known as Arnold’s tongue. Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions. Our work opens the possibility to study intriguing synchronization dynamics using a simple breathing-soliton laser as a test bed.",

OpenCRISPR-1 is a CRISPR system synthesized de novo using large language models (LLMs) but has not yet undergone systematic characterization. Using AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq, we assessed the on-target activity and off-target profiles of these systems across multiple genomic loci. FrCas9 demonstrated higher on-target efficiency and substantially fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. Furthermore, TREX2 fusion with FrCas9 reduced large deletions and translocations, enhancing genomic stability. Through screening of 1903 sgRNAs targeting 21 CGT-relevant genes using sequential AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq analysis, we identified optimal sgRNAs for each gene. Our high-throughput screening platform highlights FrCas9, particularly in its TREX2-fused form, as a highly specific and efficient tool for precise therapeutic genome editing.",

At templated AP sites, cross-links between the DNA and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell–specific (HMCES) regulate replication fork speed, avoiding cytotoxic double-strand breaks. While the role of HMCES at the template DNA strand is well studied, its effects on nascent DNA are not. We provide evidence that HMCES–DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are detrimental to the BER-mediated removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)–derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine from replication forks. HRD cells have heightened HMCES-DPCs, which increase further upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP sites. HMCES depletion substantially suppresses 5hmdC-mediated replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death in HRD cells. This reveals that HMCES-DPCs are a source of BER-initiated single-stranded DNA gaps, which indicates that endogenous DPCs contribute to genomic instability in HRD tumors.",

Despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating this process remain largely elusive. We identify serine-260 (S260) as a critical phosphorylation site in Toc33, a core TOC component. This phosphorylation stabilizes Toc33 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, and its paralog RAF-like kinase are involved in phosphorylating Toc33. Disruption of Toc33 phosphorylation impairs its stability and photosynthetic protein import, consequently affecting chloroplast structural integrity and biogenesis. Our findings underscore the essential role of TOC phosphorylation in chloroplast biogenesis and reveal an unexpected regulatory network involving RAF-like kinases in organelle development.",

Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 milliseconds based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151 Eu 3+ :Y 2 SiO 5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151 Eu 3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides, and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0 ± 0.5% at 1.021 milliseconds, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.",

One aspect of this debate is how Hadean zircons fit into an ultramafic environment. On the basis of experiments, thermodynamic modeling, and elemental partitioning, we show that felsic melts could have been generated by shallow interaction between primordial serpentinized peridotite and basaltic magmas on Earth and Mars. On the basis of the hafnium isotopic evolution of Hadean detrital zircons worldwide, we infer that these interactions allowed for the formation of extensive Hadean felsic crust (4.4 to 4.5 billion years ago), which, in turn, would account for up to 50% of the present continental crustal mass. A similar process may have occurred on Mars. The serpentinized protocrust had a dual role in the primitive planetary environment: to provide ingredients for the continental crust and to enable life to emerge on water-bearing terrestrial planets.",

Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5’s role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning.",

Cross-[4+2] cycloadditions offer greater product diversity than traditional diene-dienophile reactions due to multiple possible pathways. However, precise control over regio- and stereoselectivity for various isomers remains a great challenge. This study reports catalyst-controlled regiodivergent formal cross-cycloadditions of acyclic dienes and enones, significantly enhancing access to diverse pyrazole-fused spirooxindoles. Chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis enables endoselective [4+2] cycloadditions, while Bi(III) with a CPA ligand yields [2+4] products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. A Claisen rearrangement of the [2+4] adduct produces the exo-selective [4+2] product, further increasing stereochemical diversity and enabling the synthesis of six regio- and stereo-isomers from a single substrate set. DFT calculations reveal that Bi(III) reverses regioselectivity by repositioning reactants in the CPA pocket and stabilizing the enone oxygen’s negative charge. In addition, product 3as demonstrates therapeutic potential against triple-negative breast cancer, with an IC 50 of 8.5 μM in MDA-MB-453 cells.",

Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we mapped NGN3-binding sites, confirming the pivotal role of this molecule in regulating chromatin accessibility. The pioneering function of NGN3 involves dose tolerance, and low doses are sufficient. Although NEUROD1 generally acts as a conventional TF, it can assume a pioneering role in the absence of NGN3. The sequential expression of NeuroD1 and Ngn3 predominantly drives α cell generation, which may explain the inefficient β cell induction observed in vitro.

Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota.

          "abstract": "Optical imaging has long been dominated by traditional lens-based systems that, despite their success, are inherently limited by size, weight, and cost. Lensless imaging seeks to overcome these limitations by replacing lenses with thinner, lighter, and cheaper optical modulators and reconstructing images computationally, while facing trade-offs in image quality, artifacts, and flexibility inherent in traditional static modulation. Here, we propose a lensless imaging method with programmable Fresnel zone aperture (FZA), termed LIP. With a commercial liquid crystal display, we designed an integrated LIP module and demonstrated its capability of high-quality artifact-free reconstruction through dynamic modulation and offset-FZA parallel merging. Compared to static-modulation approaches, LIP achieves a 2.5× resolution enhancement and a 3 decibels improvement in signal-to-noise ratio in “static mode” while maintaining an interaction frame rate of 15 frames per second in “dynamic mode.” Experimental results demonstrate LIP’s potential as a miniaturized platform for versatile advanced imaging tasks like virtual reality and human-computer interaction.",

          "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is a deadly viral disease in domestic pigs that has a large global economic impact for the swine industry. It is present in Africa, Europe, Asia, and in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. There are no effective treatments or broadly licensed vaccines to prevent disease. Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9–inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes.",

          "abstract": "Security primitives ensure Internet of Things (IoT) security by generating stable keys from physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and unpredictable bitstreams from true random number generators (TRNGs). Considering the restricted resources on IoT motes, a promising design trend is to unify PUF and TRNG by sharing the same entropy source and multiplexing entropy extractor. Here, we report a unified PUF and TRNG chip based on a 28-nanometer embedded memristor with concealable ability. We use the memristor intrinsic FORMING condition variation and read current variation as entropy sources and design a compact on-chip entropy extractor that achieves a high throughput of 41.7 megabits per second with minimal area overhead of 0.291 MF 2 . To prevent PUF data leakage, we developed a concealment method, protecting data when idle and enabling recovery upon demand. Comprehensive testing shows the chip has excellent performance in randomness, reliability, lifetime, and stability, achieving a 3.82-fold throughput improvement over complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–based designs in authentication tasks.",

          "abstract": "This article sets out to develop a new index capturing advanced capitalist democracies’ transition to the knowledge economy. Reviewing how the notion has evolved in the literature, the article proposes a definition of the knowledge economy based upon two key elements—technology and (high) skills. These are operationalized in six indicators and combined through Bayesian latent variable analysis to produce a new Knowledge Economy Index, covering twenty-two countries from 1995 to 2019. A descriptive exploration of the index provides important insights for the emerging body of work on the knowledge economy in comparative political economy. The index is the first to provide a comprehensive measure of the knowledge economy that accounts for both technology and skills across space and time. As such, it paves the way for future research examining the causes and consequences of the transition to the knowledge economy in advanced capitalist democracies.",

          "authors": "Seong Hun Yoo",
          "abstract": "Gradual declines of democratic regimes characterize the contemporary political landscape. In response to this trend, a burgeoning body of literature has explored the consequences of democratic backsliding in various sectors. This study focuses on the effect of democratic backsliding on financial markets, specifically sovereign bond ratings issued by credit rating agencies. I argue that backsliding countries are more likely to face downgrades in their bond ratings. This is because the erosion of democratic institutions undermines the “democratic advantage”—characterized by electoral accountability, institutional checks and balances, and pro-economic policies—thereby increasing the likelihood of default. Using up to seventy-nine democratic countries from 1995 to 2018, I find robust support for the adverse effects of backsliding on bond ratings. That is, backsliding countries have significantly poorer credit ratings than democratic countries that do not undergo backsliding. These findings deepen our understanding of how democratic backsliding affects the international political economy, emphasizing that democratic practices are crucial for sustaining financial stability.",
