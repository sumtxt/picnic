          "title": "One step from oxides to sustainable bulk alloys",
          "authors": "Shaolou Wei, Yan Ma, Dierk Raabe",
          "abstract": "Metallurgical production traditionally involves three steps: extracting metals from ores, mixing them into alloys by liquid processing and thermomechanical processing to achieve the desired microstructures 1,2 . This sequential approach, practised since the Bronze Age, reaches its limit today because of the urgent demand for a sustainable economy 2–5 : almost 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are because of the use of fossil reductants and high-temperature metallurgical processing. Here we present a H 2 -based redox synthesis and compaction approach that reforms traditional alloy-making by merging metal extraction, alloying and thermomechanical processing into one single solid-state operation. We propose a thermodynamically informed guideline and a general kinetic conception to dissolve the classical boundaries between extractive and physical metallurgy, unlocking tremendous sustainable bulk alloy design opportunities. We exemplify this approach for the case of Fe–Ni invar bulk alloys 6,7 , one of the most appealing ferrous materials but the dirtiest to produce: invar shows uniquely low thermal expansion 6,8,9 , enabling key applications spanning from precision instruments to cryogenic components 10–13 . Yet, it is notoriously eco-unfriendly, with Ni causing more than 10 times higher CO 2 emission than Fe per kilogram production 2,14 , qualifying this alloy class as a perfect demonstrator case. Our sustainable method turns oxides directly into green alloys in bulk forms, with application-worthy properties, all obtained at temperatures far below the bulk melting point, while maintaining a zero CO 2 footprint.",

          "abstract": "Entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics 1–3 , with applications in fields such as metrology, cryptography, quantum information and quantum computation 4–8 . It has been observed in a wide variety of systems and length scales, ranging from the microscopic 9–13 to the macroscopic 14–16 . However, entanglement remains largely unexplored at the highest accessible energy scales. Here we report the highest-energy observation of entanglement, in top–antitop quark events produced at the Large Hadron Collider, using a proton–proton collision dataset with a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 140 inverse femtobarns (fb) −1 recorded with the ATLAS experiment. Spin entanglement is detected from the measurement of a single observable D , inferred from the angle between the charged leptons in their parent top- and antitop-quark rest frames. The observable is measured in a narrow interval around the top–antitop quark production threshold, at which the entanglement detection is expected to be significant. It is reported in a fiducial phase space defined with stable particles to minimize the uncertainties that stem from the limitations of the Monte Carlo event generators and the parton shower model in modelling top-quark pair production. The entanglement marker is measured to be D = −0.537 ± 0.002 (stat.) ± 0.019 (syst.) for $$340\\,{\\rm{GeV}} &lt; {m}_{t\\bar{t}} &lt; 380\\,{\\rm{GeV}}$$ 340 GeV &lt; m t t ¯ &lt; 380 GeV . The observed result is more than five standard deviations from a scenario without entanglement and hence constitutes the first observation of entanglement in a pair of quarks and the highest-energy observation of entanglement so far.",

          "abstract": "The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers 1,2 . As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical 3 . Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, at present, these industrial processes are not optimized to produce high-coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the approaches commonly used to make superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) pilot line using industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times exceeding 100 μs. We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics of coherence, yield, variability and ageing that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, which uses only optical lithography and reactive-ion etching, has a performance and yield in line with conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation and electron-beam writing 4 . Moreover, it offers the potential for further upscaling through three-dimensional integration 5 and more process optimization. This result marks the advent of an alternative and new, large-scale, truly CMOS-compatible fabrication method for superconducting quantum computing processors.",

          "abstract": "Although a ubiquitous natural phenomenon, the onset and subsequent process of surface wave breaking are not fully understood. Breaking affects how steep waves become and drives air–sea exchanges 1 . Most seminal and state-of-the-art research on breaking is underpinned by the assumption of two-dimensionality, although ocean waves are three dimensional. We present experimental results that assess how three-dimensionality affects breaking, without putting limits on the direction of travel of the waves. We show that the breaking-onset steepness of the most directionally spread case is double that of its unidirectional counterpart. We identify three breaking regimes. As directional spreading increases, horizontally overturning ‘travelling-wave breaking’ (I), which forms the basis of two-dimensional breaking, is replaced by vertically jetting ‘standing-wave breaking’ (II). In between, ‘travelling-standing-wave breaking’ (III) is characterized by the formation of vertical jets along a fast-moving crest. The mechanisms in each regime determine how breaking limits steepness and affects subsequent air–sea exchanges. Unlike in two dimensions, three-dimensional wave-breaking onset does not limit how steep waves may become, and we produce directionally spread waves 80% steeper than at breaking onset and four times steeper than equivalent two-dimensional waves at their breaking onset. Our observations challenge the validity of state-of-the-art methods used to calculate energy dissipation and to design offshore structures in highly directionally spread seas.",

          "abstract": "The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway guides the DNA methylation of young, active transposons during germline development in male mice 1 . piRNAs tether the PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4) to the nascent transposon transcript, resulting in DNA methylation through SPOCD1 (refs. 2–5 ). Transposon methylation requires great precision: every copy needs to be methylated but off-target methylation must be avoided. However, the underlying mechanisms that ensure this precision remain unknown. Here, we show that SPOCD1 interacts directly with SPIN1 (SPINDLIN1), a chromatin reader that primarily binds to H3K4me3-K9me3 (ref. 6 ). The prevailing assumption is that all the molecular events required for piRNA-directed DNA methylation occur after the engagement of MIWI2. We find that SPIN1 expression precedes that of both SPOCD1 and MIWI2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that young LINE1 copies, but not old ones, are marked by H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and SPIN1 before the initiation of piRNA-directed DNA methylation. We generated a Spocd1 separation-of-function allele in the mouse that encodes a SPOCD1 variant that no longer interacts with SPIN1. We found that the interaction between SPOCD1 and SPIN1 is essential for spermatogenesis and piRNA-directed DNA methylation of young LINE1 elements. We propose that piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation requires a developmentally timed two-factor authentication process. The first authentication is the recruitment of SPIN1–SPOCD1 to the young LINE1 promoter, and the second is MIWI2 engagement with the nascent transcript. In summary, independent authentication events underpin the precision of piRNA-directed LINE1 DNA methylation.",

Here we isolated and down-selected commensal bacterial consortia from stool samples from healthy humans that could strongly and specifically suppress intestinal Enterobacteriaceae. One of the elaborated consortia, comprising 18 commensal strains, effectively controlled ecological niches by regulating gluconate availability, thereby re-establishing colonization resistance and alleviating Klebsiella - and Escherichia -driven intestinal inflammation in mice.

Previous radiation data are from the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle in low-Earth orbit protected by heavy shielding and Earth’s magnetic field 7,8 and lightly shielded interplanetary robotic probes such as Mars Science Laboratory and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter 9,10 . Limited data from the Apollo missions 11–13 and ground measurements with substantial caveats are also available 14 . Here we report radiation measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft on the uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission. At differing shielding locations inside the vehicle, a fourfold difference in dose rates was observed during proton-belt passes that are similar to large, reference solar-particle events. Interplanetary cosmic-ray dose equivalent rates in Orion were as much as 60% lower than previous observations 9 . Furthermore, a change in orientation of the spacecraft during the proton-belt transit resulted in a reduction of radiation dose rates of around 50%. These measurements validate the Orion for future crewed exploration and inform future human spaceflight mission design.",

          "abstract": "The developing placenta, which in mice originates through the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), is essential for mammalian embryonic development. Yet unbiased characterization of the differentiation dynamics of the ExE and its interactions with the embryo proper remains incomplete. Here we develop a temporal single-cell model of mouse gastrulation that maps continuous and parallel differentiation in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. This is matched with a three-way perturbation approach to target signalling from the embryo proper, the ExE alone, or both. We show that ExE specification involves early spatial and transcriptional bifurcation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and chorion progenitors. Early BMP4 signalling from chorion progenitors is required for proper differentiation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells and later for their specification towards trophoblast giant cells. We also find biphasic regulation by BMP4 in the embryo. The early ExE-originating BMP4 signal is necessary for proper mesoendoderm bifurcation and for allantois and primordial germ cell specification. However, commencing at embryonic day 7.5, embryo-derived BMP4 restricts the primordial germ cell pool size by favouring differentiation of their extraembryonic mesoderm precursors towards an allantois fate. ExE and embryonic tissues are therefore entangled in time, space and signalling axes, highlighting the importance of their integrated understanding and modelling in vivo and in vitro.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between planets and stellar winds can lead to atmospheric loss and is, thus, important for the evolution of planetary atmospheres 1 . The planets in our Solar System typically interact with the solar wind, whose velocity is at a large angle to the embedded stellar magnetic field. For planets without an intrinsic magnetic field, this interaction creates an induced magnetosphere and a bow shock in front of the planet 2 . However, when the angle between the solar wind velocity and the solar wind magnetic field (cone angle) is small, the interaction is very different 3 . Here we show that when the cone angle is small at Mars, the induced magnetosphere degenerates. There is no shock on the dayside, only weak flank shocks. A cross-flow plume appears and the ambipolar field drives planetary ions upstream. Hybrid simulations with a 4° cone angle show agreement with observations by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission 4 and Mars Express 5 . Degenerate, induced magnetospheres are complex and not yet explored objects. It remains to be studied what the secondary effects are on processes like atmospheric loss through ion escape.",

          "authors": "Thomas F. Epper, Ernst Fehr, Claus Thustrup Kreiner, Søren Leth-Petersen, Isabel Skak Olufsen, Peer Ebbesen Skov",
          "abstract": "Rising inequality has brought redistribution back on the political agenda. In theory, inequality aversion drives people’s support for redistribution. People can dislike both advantageous inequality (comparison relative to those worse off) and disadvantageous inequality (comparison relative to those better off). Existing experimental evidence reveals substantial variation across people in these preferences. However, evidence is scarce on the broader role of these two distinct forms of inequality aversion for redistribution in society. We provide evidence by exploiting a unique combination of data. We use an incentivized experiment to measure inequality aversion in a large population sample (≈9,000 among 20- to 64-y-old Danes). We link the elicited inequality aversion to survey information on individuals’ support for public redistribution (policies that reduce income differences) and administrative records revealing their private redistribution (real-life donations to charity). In addition, the link to administrative data enables us to include a large battery of controls in the empirical analysis. Theory predicts that support for public redistribution increases with both types of inequality aversion, while private redistribution should increase with advantageous inequality aversion, but decrease with disadvantageous inequality aversion. A strong dislike for disadvantageous inequality makes people willing to sacrifice own income to reduce the income of people who are better off, thereby reducing the distance to people with more income than themselves. Public redistribution schemes achieve this but private donations to charity do not. Our empirical results provide strong support for these predictions and with quantitatively large effects compared to other predictors.",

          "abstract": "New data sources and AI methods for extracting information are increasingly abundant and relevant to decision-making across societal applications. A notable example is street view imagery, available in over 100 countries, and purported to inform built environment interventions (e.g., adding sidewalks) for community health outcomes. However, biases can arise when decision-making does not account for data robustness or relies on spurious correlations. To investigate this risk, we analyzed 2.02 million Google Street View (GSV) images alongside health, demographic, and socioeconomic data from New York City. Findings demonstrate robustness challenges; built environment characteristics inferred from GSV labels at the intracity level often do not align with ground truth. Moreover, as average individual-level behavior of physical inactivity significantly mediates the impact of built environment features by census tract, intervention on features measured by GSV would be misestimated without proper model specification and consideration of this mediation mechanism. Using a causal framework accounting for these mediators, we determined that intervening by improving 10% of samples in the two lowest tertiles of physical inactivity would lead to a 4.17 (95% CI 3.84–4.55) or 17.2 (95% CI 14.4–21.3) times greater decrease in the prevalence of obesity or diabetes, respectively, compared to the same proportional intervention on the number of crosswalks by census tract. This study highlights critical issues of robustness and model specification in using emergent data sources, showing the data may not measure what is intended, and ignoring mediators can result in biased intervention effect estimates.",

          "abstract": "Liquid-like protein condensates have recently attracted much attention due to their critical roles in biological phenomena. They typically show high fluidity and reversibility for exhibiting biological functions, while occasionally serving as sites for the formation of amyloid fibrils. To comprehend the properties of protein condensates that underlie biological function and pathogenesis, it is crucial to study them at the single-condensate level; however, this is currently challenging due to a lack of applicable methods. Here, we demonstrate that optical trapping is capable of inducing the formation of a single liquid-like condensate of α-synuclein in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. The irradiation of tightly focused near-infrared laser at an air/solution interface formed a condensate under conditions coexisting with polyethylene glycol. The fluorescent dye-labeled imaging showed that the optically induced condensate has a gradient of protein concentration from the center to the edge, suggesting that it is fabricated through optical pumping-up of the α-synuclein clusters and the expansion along the interface. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy and thioflavin T fluorescence analysis revealed that continuous laser irradiation induces structural transition of protein molecules inside the condensate to β-sheet rich structure, ultimately leading to the condensate deformation and furthermore, the formation of amyloid fibrils. These observations indicate that optical trapping is a powerful technique for examining the microscopic mechanisms of condensate appearance and growth, and furthermore, subsequent aging leading to amyloid fibril formation.",

In Arf1, the GDP/GTP switch does not occur spontaneously but requires guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and membranes. Exchange involves massive conformational changes, including disruption of the core β-sheet. The mechanisms by which this energetically costly switch occurs remain to be elucidated. To probe the switch mechanism, we coupled pressure perturbation with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier Transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence, and computation. Pressure induced the formation of a classical molten globule (MG) ensemble. Pressure also favored the GDP to GTP transition, providing strong support for the notion that the MG ensemble plays a functional role in the nucleotide switch. We propose that the MG ensemble allows for switching without the requirement for complete unfolding and may be recognized by GEFs. An MG-based switching mechanism could constitute a pervasive feature in Arfs and Arf-like GTPases, and more generally, the evolutionarily related (Ras-like small GTPases) Rags and Gα GTPases.",

Here, we decomposed a compendium of 300 high-quality RNA sequencing datasets of the model strain PCC 7942 using independent component analysis. We obtained 57 independently modulated gene sets, or iModulons, that explain 67% of the variance in the transcriptional response and 1) accurately reflect the activity of known transcriptional regulations, 2) capture functional components of photosynthesis, 3) provide hypotheses for regulon structures and functional annotations of poorly characterized genes, and 4) describe the transcriptional shifts under dynamic light conditions. This transcriptome-wide analysis of S. elongatus provides a quantitative reconstruction of the TRN and presents a knowledge base that can guide future investigations. Our systems-level analysis also provides a global TRN structure for S. elongatus PCC 7942.",

To better understand this phenomenon, we developed an analytical approach for better characterizing trans-differentiation-associated changes in DNA methylation, a major determinant of long-term cell identity. By examining various models of transdifferentiation both in vitro and in vivo, our studies indicate that despite convincing expression changes, transdifferentiated cells seem unable to alter their original developmentally mandated methylation patterns. We propose that this blockage is due to basic developmental limitations built into the regulatory sequences that govern epigenetic programming of cell identity.

          "abstract": "We consider the refractive lensing effects of ionized cool ( T ∼ 10 4 K ) gas cloudlets in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies. In particular, we discuss the combined effects of lensing from these cloudlets and scintillation from plasma screens in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM). We show that, if the CGM comprises a mist of subparsec cloudlets with column densities of order 10 17 cm − 2 (as predicted by [M. McCourt, S. P. Oh, R. O’Leary, A. M. Madigan, MNRAS 473 , 5407–5431 (2018)]), then fast radio bursts (FRBs) whose sightlines pass within a virial radius of a CGM halo will may be lensed into tens of refractive images with a ∼10 ms scattering timescale. When these images are formed, they will be resolved by scintillating screens in the Milky Way ISM and will suppress the observed scintillation. We illustrate this effect in refractive lensing and argue that positive detections of FRB scintillation may constrain the properties of these cool-gas cloudlets, with current scintillation observation weakly disfavoring the cloudlet model. We propose that sheet-like geometries for the cool gas in the CGM can reconcile quasar absorption measurements (from which we infer the presence of the cool gas with structure on subparsec scales) and the unexpected lack of lensing signals from this gas thus far observed.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that DNA Damage Regulated Autophagy Modulator 1 (DRAM1), a lysosomal protein and a target of p53, participates in autophagy. The cellular functions of DRAM1 beyond autophagy remain elusive. Here, we show p53-dependent upregulation of DRAM1 in mitochondrial damage–induced Parkinson’s disease (PD) models and exacerbation of disease phenotypes by DRAM1. We find that the lysosomal location of DRAM1 relies on its intact structure including the cytosol-facing C-terminal domain. Excess DRAM1 disrupts endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure, triggers ER stress, and induces protective ER-phagy. Mechanistically, DRAM1 interacts with stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) to tether lysosomes to the ER and perturb STIM1 function in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. STIM1 overexpression promotes cellular health by restoring calcium homeostasis, ER stress response, ER-phagy, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) signaling in cells with excess DRAM1. Thus, by promoting organelle contact between lysosomes and the ER, DRAM1 modulates ER structure and function and cell survival under stress. Our results suggest that DRAM1 as a lysosomal protein performs diverse roles in cellular homeostasis and stress response. These findings may have significant implications for our understanding of the role of the p53/DRAM1 axis in human diseases, from cancer to neurodegenerative diseases.",

HCMV strains propagated extensively in vitro in fibroblasts carry UL128, UL130, or UL131 alleles that do not make a functional complex and thus lack Pentamer function. Adding functional Pentamer to such strains decreases virus growth in fibroblasts. Here, we show that the Pentamer inhibits productive HCMV replication in fibroblasts by repressing viral Immediate Early (IE) transcription. We show that ectopic expression of the viral IE1 protein, a target of Pentamer-mediated transcriptional repression, complements the growth defect of a Pentamer-positive virus. Furthermore, we show that the Pentamer also represses viral IE transcription in cell types where HCMV in vitro latency is studied. Finally, we identify UL130 as a functional subunit of the Pentamer for IE transcriptional repression and demonstrate that cyclic AMP Response Element (CRE) and NFkB sites within the Major Immediate Early Promoter that drives IE1 transcription contribute to this repression. We conclude that the HCMV Pentamer represses viral IE transcription.",

          "abstract": "Developmental biology-inspired strategies for tissue-building have extraordinary promise for regenerative medicine, spurring interest in the relationship between cell biophysical properties and morphological transitions. However, mapping gene or protein expression data to cell biophysical properties to physical morphogenesis remains challenging with current techniques. Here, we present m ultiplexed a dhesion and t raction of c ells at h igh y ield (MATCHY). MATCHY advances the multiplexing and throughput capabilities of existing traction force and cell–cell adhesion assays using microfabrication and a semiautomated computation scheme with machine learning–driven cell segmentation. Both biophysical assays are coupled with serial downstream immunofluorescence to extract cell type/signaling state information. MATCHY is especially suited to complex primary tissue-, organoid-, or biopsy-derived cell mixtures since it does not rely on a priori knowledge of cell surface markers, cell sorting, or use of lineage-specific reporter animals. We first validate MATCHY on canine kidney epithelial cells engineered for rearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine kinase expression and quantify a relationship between downstream signaling and cell traction. We then use MATCHY to create a biophysical atlas of mouse embryonic kidney primary cells and identify distinct biophysical states along the nephron differentiation trajectory. Our data complement expression-level knowledge of adhesion molecule changes that accompany nephron differentiation with quantitative biophysical information. These data reveal an “energetic ratchet” that accounts for spatial trends in nephron progenitor cell condensation as they differentiate into early nephron structures, which we validate through agent-based computational simulation.

While androgens have anabolic effects on skeletal muscle, previous studies reported that AR functions in myofibers to regulate skeletal muscle quality, rather than skeletal muscle mass. Therefore, the anabolic effects of androgens are exerted via nonmyofiber cells. In this context, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AR in mesenchymal progenitors, which play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis, remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated expression of AR in mesenchymal progenitors and found that targeted AR ablation in mesenchymal progenitors reduced limb muscle mass in mature adult, but not young or aged, male mice, although fatty infiltration of muscle was not affected. The absence of AR in mesenchymal progenitors led to remarkable perineal muscle hypotrophy, regardless of age, due to abnormal regulation of transcripts associated with cell death and extracellular matrix organization. Additionally, we revealed that AR in mesenchymal progenitors regulates the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) and that IGF1 administration prevents perineal muscle atrophy in a paracrine manner. These findings indicate that the anabolic effects of androgens regulate skeletal muscle mass via, at least in part, AR signaling in mesenchymal progenitors.",

Condensing mesogens form rapidly elongating filaments, rather than spheres, to relieve distortion of an internal smectic mesophase. As filaments densify, they collapse into bulged discs, lowering the elastic free energy. Additional distortion is relieved by retraction of filaments into the discs, which are straightened under tension to form a ramified network.

          "abstract": "Cuprous copper [Cu(I)] is an essential cofactor for enzymes that support many fundamental cellular functions including mitochondrial respiration and suppression of oxidative stress. Neurons are particularly reliant on mitochondrial production of ATP, with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, associated with diminished mitochondrial function. The gene MBLAC1 encodes a ribonuclease that targets pre-mRNA of replication-dependent histones, proteins recently found in yeast to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), and when mutated disrupt ATP production, elevates oxidative stress, and severely impacts cell growth. Whether this process supports neuronal and/or systemic physiology in higher eukaryotes is unknown. Previously, we identified swip-10 , the putative Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of MBLAC1 , establishing a role for glial swip-10 in limiting dopamine (DA) neuron excitability and sustaining DA neuron viability. Here, we provide evidence from computational modeling that SWIP-10 protein structure mirrors that of MBLAC1 and locates a loss of function coding mutation at a site expected to disrupt histone RNA hydrolysis. Moreover, we find through genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological studies that deletion of swip-10 in worms negatively impacts systemic Cu(I) levels, leading to deficits in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. These phenotypes can be offset in swip-10 mutants by the Cu(I) enhancing molecule elesclomol and through glial expression of wildtype swip-10 . Together, these studies reveal a glial-expressed pathway that supports systemic mitochondrial function and neuronal health via regulation of Cu(I) homeostasis, a mechanism that may lend itself to therapeutic strategies to treat devastating neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii , carries variants of A. baumannii resistance islands (AbaR)-type genomic islands conferring multidrug resistance. Their pervasiveness in the species has remained enigmatic. The dissemination of AbaRs is intricately linked to their horizontal transfer via natural transformation, a process through which bacteria can import and recombine exogenous DNA, effecting allelic recombination, genetic acquisition, and deletion. In experimental populations of the closely related pathogenic Acinetobacter nosocomialis , we quantified the rates at which these natural transformation events occur between individuals. When integrated into a model of population dynamics, they lead to the swift removal of AbaRs from the population, contrasting with the high prevalence of AbaRs in genomes. Yet, genomic analyses show that nearly all AbaRs specifically disrupt comM , a gene encoding a helicase critical for natural transformation. We found that such disruption impedes gene acquisition, and deletion, while moderately impacting acquisition of single nucleotide polymorphism. A mathematical evolutionary model demonstrates that AbaRs inserted into comM gain a selective advantage over AbaRs inserted in sites that do not inhibit or completely inhibit transformation, in line with the genomic observations. The persistence of AbaRs can be ascribed to their integration into a specific gene, diminishing the likelihood of their removal from the bacterial genome. This integration preserves the acquisition and elimination of alleles, enabling the host bacterium—and thus its AbaR—to adapt to unpredictable environments and persist over the long term. This work underscores how manipulation of natural transformation by mobile genetic elements can drive the prevalence of multidrug resistance.",

In this study, we showed that lipin1 orchestrates mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and STAT3 signaling pathways to determine axon regeneration. We established an mTOR-lipin1-phosphatidic acid/lysophosphatidic acid-mTOR loop that acts as a positive feedback inhibitory signaling, contributing to the persistent suppression of CNS axon regeneration following injury. In addition, lipin1 knockdown (KD) enhances corticospinal tract (CST) sprouting after unilateral pyramidotomy and promotes CST regeneration following complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, lipin1 KD enhances sensory axon regeneration after SCI. Overall, our research reveals that lipin1 functions as a central regulator to coordinate mTOR and STAT3 signaling pathways in the CNS neurons and highlights the potential of lipin1 as a promising therapeutic target for promoting the regeneration of motor and sensory axons after SCI.",

          "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic and severe disease of the skeletal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in which the effects of neurotransmitters are attenuated, leading to muscle weakness. In the most common forms of autoimmune MG, antibodies attack components of the postsynaptic membrane, including the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). MuSK, a master regulator of NMJ development, associates with the low-density lipoprotein-related receptor 4 (Lrp4) to form the signaling receptor for neuronal Agrin, a nerve-derived synaptic organizer. Pathogenic antibodies to MuSK interfere with binding between MuSK and Lrp4, inhibiting the differentiation and maintenance of the NMJ. MuSK MG can be debilitating and refractory to treatments that are effective for AChR MG. We show here that recombinant antibodies, derived from MuSK MG patients, cause severe neuromuscular disease in mice. The disease can be prevented by a MuSK agonist antibody, presented either prophylactically or after disease onset. These findings suggest a therapeutic alternative to generalized immunosuppression for treating MuSK MG by selectively and directly targeting the disease mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Multispecies microbial communities drive most ecosystems on Earth. Chemical and biological interactions within these communities can affect the survival of individual members and the entire community. However, the prohibitively high number of possible interactions within a microbial community has made the characterization of factors that influence community development challenging. Here, we report a Microbial Community Interaction (µCI) device to advance the systematic study of chemical and biological interactions within a microbial community. The µCI creates a combinatorial landscape made up of an array of triangular wells interconnected with circular wells, which each contains either a different chemical or microbial strain, generating chemical gradients and revealing biological interactions. Bacillus cereus UW85 containing green fluorescent protein provided the “target” readout in the triangular wells, and antibiotics or microorganisms in adjacent circular wells are designated the “variables.” The µCI device revealed that gentamicin and vancomycin are antagonistic to each other in inhibiting the target B. cereus UW85, displaying weaker inhibitory activity when used in combination than alone. We identified three-member communities constructed with isolates from the plant rhizosphere that increased or decreased the growth of B. cereus . The µCI device enables both strain-level and community-level insight. The scalable geometric design of the µCI device enables experiments with high combinatorial efficiency, thereby providing a simple, scalable platform for systematic interrogation of three-factor interactions that influence microorganisms in solitary or community life.",

          "authors": "Saurja DasGupta, Zoe Weiss, Collin Nisler, Jack W. Szostak",
          "abstract": "The acquisition of new RNA functions through evolutionary processes was essential for the diversification of RNA-based primordial biology and its subsequent transition to modern biology. However, the mechanisms by which RNAs access new functions remain unclear. Do RNA enzymes need completely new folds to support new but related functions, or is reoptimization of the active site sufficient? What are the roles of neutral and adaptive mutations in evolutionary innovation? Here, we address these questions experimentally by focusing on the evolution of substrate specificity in RNA-catalyzed RNA assembly. We use directed in vitro evolution to show that a ligase ribozyme that uses prebiotically relevant 5′-phosphorimidazole-activated substrates can be evolved to catalyze ligation with substrates that are 5′-activated with the biologically relevant triphosphate group. Interestingly, despite catalyzing a related reaction, the new ribozyme folds into a completely new structure and exhibits promiscuity by catalyzing RNA ligation with both triphosphate and phosphorimidazole-activated substrates. Although distinct in sequence and structure, the parent phosphorimidazolide ligase and the evolved triphosphate ligase ribozymes can be connected by a series of point mutations where the intermediate sequences retain at least some ligase activity. The existence of a quasi-neutral pathway between these distinct ligase ribozymes suggests that neutral drift is sufficient to enable the acquisition of new substrate specificity, thereby providing opportunities for subsequent adaptive optimization. The transition from RNA-catalyzed RNA assembly using phosphorimidazole-activated substrates to triphosphate-activated substrates may have foreshadowed the later evolution of the protein enzymes that use monomeric triphosphates (nucleoside triphosphates, NTPs) for RNA synthesis.",

          "abstract": "One of the longstanding aims of network neuroscience is to link a connectome’s topological properties—i.e., features defined from connectivity alone–with an organism’s neurobiology. One approach for doing so is to compare connectome properties with annotational maps. This type of analysis is popular at the meso-/macroscale, but is less common at the nano-scale, owing to a paucity of neuron-level connectome data. However, recent methodological advances have made possible the reconstruction of whole-brain connectomes at single-neuron resolution for a select set of organisms. These include the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , and its developing larvae. In addition to fine-scale descriptions of connectivity, these datasets are accompanied by rich annotations. Here, we use a variant of the stochastic blockmodel to detect multilevel communities in the larval Drosophila connectome. We find that communities partition neurons based on function and cell type and that most interact assortatively, reflecting the principle of functional segregation. However, a small number of communities interact nonassortatively, forming form a “rich-club” of interneurons that receive sensory/ascending inputs and deliver outputs along descending pathways. Next, we investigate the role of community structure in shaping communication patterns. We find that polysynaptic signaling follows specific trajectories across modular hierarchies, with interneurons playing a key role in mediating communication routes between modules and hierarchical scales. Our work suggests a relationship between system-level architecture and the biological function and classification of individual neurons. We envision our study as an important step toward bridging the gap between complex systems and neurobiological lines of investigation in brain sciences.",

Its desirable functionality primarily relies on well-controlled conditions such as structural resonance, dispersion, geometry, filling fraction, external actuation, etc. However, its fundamental building blocks—meta-atoms—still rely on naturally occurring substances. Here, we propose and validate the concept of gradient and reversible atomic-engineered metamaterials (GRAM), which represents a platform for continuously tunable solid metaphotonics by atomic manipulation. GRAM consists of an atomic heterogenous interface of amorphous host and noble metals at the bottom, and the top interface was designed to facilitate the reversible movement of foreign atoms. Continuous and reversible changes in GRAM’s refractive index and atomic structures are observed in the presence of a thermal field. We achieve multiple optical states of GRAM at varying temperature and time and demonstrate GRAM-based tunable nanophotonic devices in the visible spectrum. Further, high-efficiency and programmable laser raster-scanning patterns can be locally controlled by adjusting power and speed, without any mask-assisted or complex nanofabrication. Our approach casts a distinct, multilevel, and reversible postfabrication recipe to modify a solid material’s properties at the atomic scale, opening avenues for optical materials engineering, information storage, display, and encryption, as well as advanced thermal optics and photonics.",

Patients exhibit malformations in the head, face, limbs, vertebrae as well as the heart. To uncover the etiology of craniofacial malformations found in SF3B4 -related syndromes, mutant mouse lines with homozygous deletion of Sf3b4 in neural crest cells (NCC) were generated. Like in human patients, these embryos had craniofacial and cardiac malformations with variable expressivity and penetrance. The severity and survival of Sf3b4 NCC mutants was modified by the level of Sf3b4 in neighboring non-NCC. RNA sequencing analysis of heads of embryos prior to morphological abnormalities revealed significant changes in expression of genes forming the NCC regulatory network, as well as an increase in exon skipping. Additionally, several key histone modifiers involved in craniofacial and cardiac development showed increased exon skipping. Increased exon skipping was also associated with use of a more proximal branch point, as well as an enrichment in thymidine bases in the 50 bp around the branch points. We propose that decrease in Sf3b4 causes changes in the expression and splicing of transcripts required for proper craniofacial and cardiac development, leading to abnormalities.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Drosophila Yorkie (Yki) are transcription cofactors of the highly conserved Hippo signaling pathway. It has been long assumed that the YAP/TAZ/Yki signaling drives cell proliferation during organ growth. However, its instructive role in regulating developmentally programmed organ growth, if any, remains elusive. Out-of-context gain of YAP/TAZ/Yki signaling often turns oncogenic. Paradoxically, mechanically strained, and differentiated squamous epithelia display developmentally programmed constitutive nuclear YAP/TAZ/Yki signaling. The unknown, therefore, is how a growth-promoting YAP/TAZ/Yki signaling restricts proliferation in differentiated squamous epithelia. Here, we show that reminiscent of a tumor suppressor, Yki negatively regulates the cell growth–promoting PI3K/Akt/TOR signaling in the squamous epithelia of Drosophila tubular organs. Thus, downregulation of Yki signaling in the squamous epithelium of the adult male accessory gland (MAG) up-regulates PI3K/Akt/TOR signaling, inducing cell hypertrophy, exit from their cell cycle arrest, and, finally, culminating in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Thus, blocking PI3K/Akt/TOR signaling arrests Yki loss-induced MAG-SCC. Further, MAG-SCCs, like other lethal carcinomas, secrete a cachectin, Impl2—the Drosophila homolog of mammalian IGFBP7—inducing cachexia and shortening the lifespan of adult males. Moreover, in the squamous epithelium of other tubular organs, like the dorsal trunk of larval tracheal airways or adult Malpighian tubules, downregulation of Yki signaling triggers PI3K/Akt/TOR-induced cell hypertrophy. Our results reveal that Yki signaling plays an instructive, antiproliferative role in the squamous epithelia of tubular organs.",

          "authors": "Carl Veller, Molly Przeworski, Graham Coop",
          "abstract": "Family-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are often claimed to provide an unbiased estimate of the average causal effects (or average treatment effects; ATEs) of alleles, on the basis of an analogy between the random transmission of alleles from parents to children and a randomized controlled trial. We show that this claim does not hold in general. Because Mendelian segregation only randomizes alleles among children of heterozygotes, the effects of alleles in the children of homozygotes are not observable. This feature will matter if an allele has different average effects in the children of homozygotes and heterozygotes, as can arise in the presence of gene-by-environment interactions, gene-by-gene interactions, or differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns. At a single locus, family-based GWAS can be thought of as providing an unbiased estimate of the average effect in the children of heterozygotes (i.e., a local average treatment effect; LATE). This interpretation does not extend to polygenic scores (PGSs), however, because different sets of SNPs are heterozygous in each family. Therefore, other than under specific conditions, the within-family regression slope of a PGS cannot be assumed to provide an unbiased estimate of the LATE for any subset or weighted average of families. In practice, the potential biases of a family-based GWAS are likely smaller than those that can arise from confounding in a standard, population-based GWAS, and so family studies remain important for the dissection of genetic contributions to phenotypic variation. Nonetheless, their causal interpretation is less straightforward than has been widely appreciated.",

          "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important pathogen causing difficult-to-treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). Over 1.5 million women per year suffer from recurrent UTI, reducing quality of life and causing substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in the hospital setting. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the most prevalent cause of UTI. Like UPEC, K. pneumoniae relies on type 1 pili, tipped with the mannose-binding adhesin FimH, to cause cystitis. However, K. pneumoniae FimH is a poor binder of mannose, despite a mannose-binding pocket identical to UPEC FimH. FimH is composed of two domains that are in an equilibrium between tense (low-affinity) and relaxed (high-affinity) conformations. Substantial interdomain interactions in the tense conformation yield a low-affinity, deformed mannose-binding pocket, while domain–domain interactions are broken in the relaxed state, resulting in a high-affinity binding pocket. Using crystallography, we identified the structural basis by which domain–domain interactions direct the conformational equilibrium of K. pneumoniae FimH, which is strongly shifted toward the low-affinity tense state. Removal of the pilin domain restores mannose binding to the lectin domain, thus showing that poor mannose binding by K. pneumoniae FimH is not an inherent feature of the mannose-binding pocket. Phylogenetic analyses of K. pneumoniae genomes found that FimH sequences are highly conserved. However, we surveyed a collection of K. pneumoniae isolates from patients with long-term indwelling catheters and identified isolates that possessed relaxed higher-binding FimH variants, which increased K. pneumoniae fitness in bladder infection models, suggesting that long-term residence within the urinary tract may select for higher-binding FimH variants.",

Our analysis of 10 6 published connection reports indicates that the adult rat brain interregional connectome has about 76,940 of a possible 623,310 axonal connections between its 790 gray matter regions mapped in a reference atlas, equating to a network density of 12.3%. We examined the sexually dimorphic network using multiresolution consensus clustering that generated a nested hierarchy of interconnected modules/subsystems with three first-order modules and 157 terminal modules in females. Top–down hierarchy analysis suggests a mirror-image primary module pair in the central nervous system’s rostral sector (forebrain–midbrain) associated with behavior control, and a single primary module in the intermediate sector (rhombicbrain) associated with behavior execution; the implications of these results are considered in relation to brain development and evolution. Bottom–up hierarchy analysis reveals known and unfamiliar modules suggesting strong experimentally testable hypotheses. Global network analyses indicate that all hubs are in the rostral module pair, a rich club extends through all three primary modules, and the network exhibits small-world attributes. Simulated lesions of all regions individually enabled ranking their impact on global network organization, and the visual path from the retina was used as a specific example, including the effects of cyclic connection weight changes from the endogenous circadian rhythm generator, suprachiasmatic nucleus. This study elucidates principles of interregional neuronal network architecture for a mammalian brain and suggests a strategy for modeling dynamic structural connectivity.",

The channel has emerged as a therapeutic target for cardiac arrhythmias. Calmodulin (CaM) interacts with the CaM binding domain (CaMBD) of the SK channels, serving as the obligatory Ca 2+ sensor to gate the channels. In heterologous expression systems, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) coordinates with CaM in regulating SK channels. However, the roles and mechanisms of PIP2 in regulating SK channels in cardiomyocytes remain unknown. Here, optogenetics, magnetic nanoparticles, combined with Rosetta structural modeling, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the atomistic mechanisms of how PIP2 works in concert with Ca 2+ -CaM in the SK channel activation. Our computational study affords evidence for the critical role of the amino acid residue R395 in the S6 transmembrane segment, which is localized in propinquity to the intracellular hydrophobic gate. This residue forms a salt bridge with residue E398 in the S6 transmembrane segment from the adjacent subunit. Both R395 and E398 are conserved in all known isoforms of SK channels. Our findings suggest that the binding of PIP2 to R395 residue disrupts the R395:E398 salt bridge, increasing the flexibility of the transmembrane segment S6 and the activation of the channel. Importantly, our findings serve as a platform for testing of structural-based drug designs for therapeutic inhibitors and activators of the SK channel family. The study is timely since inhibitors of SK channels are currently in clinical trials to treat atrial arrhythmias.",

The mechanical force for oocyte expulsion is largely unknown in many species. Our previous work demonstrated that Drosophila ovulation, as in mammals, requires the proteolytic degradation of the posterior follicle wall and follicle rupture to release the mature oocyte from a layer of somatic follicle cells. Here, we identified actomyosin contraction in somatic follicle cells as the major mechanical force for follicle rupture. Filamentous actin (F-actin) and nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) are highly enriched in the cortex of follicle cells upon stimulation with octopamine (OA), a monoamine critical for Drosophila ovulation. Pharmacological disruption of F-actin polymerization prevented follicle rupture without interfering with the follicle wall breakdown. In addition, we demonstrated that OA induces Rho1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP)ase activation in the follicle cell cortex, which activates Ras homolog (Rho) kinase to promote actomyosin contraction and follicle rupture. All these results led us to conclude that OA signaling induces actomyosin cortex enrichment and contractility, which generates the mechanical force for follicle rupture during Drosophila ovulation. Due to the conserved nature of actomyosin contraction, this work could shed light on the mechanical force required for follicle rupture in other species including humans.",

We introduce a multi-method design combining the web-browsing histories and survey responses of more than 7000 participants from six major democracies with supervised text classification to separate political from nonpolitical news exposure. We find that political online news exposure is both substantially less prevalent and subject to stronger ideological self-selection than nonpolitical online news exposure, especially in the United States. By highlighting the peculiar role of political news content, the results improve the understanding of online news exposure and the role of digital media in democracy.",

          "abstract": "Colorful flower patterns are key signals to attract pollinators. To produce such motifs, plants specify boundaries dividing petals into subdomains where cells develop distinctive pigmentations, shapes, and textures. While some transcription factors and biosynthetic pathways behind these characteristics are well studied, the upstream processes restricting their activities to specific petal regions remain enigmatic. Here, we unveil that the petal surface of Hibiscus trionum , an emerging model featuring a bullseye on its corolla, is prepatterned as the bullseye boundary position is specified long before it becomes visible. Using a computational model, we explore how pattern proportions are maintained while petals experience a 100-fold size increase. Exploiting transgenic lines and natural variants, we show that plants can regulate boundary position during the prepatterning phase or modulate growth on either side of this boundary later in development to vary bullseye proportions. Such modifications are functionally relevant, as buff-tailed bumblebees can reliably identify food sources based on bullseye size and prefer certain pattern proportions.",

SPRAY nanoparticles accelerate the self-delivery process in macrophages via lysosomal membrane permeabilization, maintaining anti-inflammatory programming in macrophages with efficacy close to T helper 2 cytokines. By pulmonary deposition, SPRAY nanoparticles effectively suppress inflammatory infiltration and promote alveoli regeneration in murine aseptic acute lung injury. Moreover, SPRAY nanoparticles efficiently eradicate multidrug-resistant GNB in alveoli by disrupting bacterial membrane.

          "abstract": "Frontal cortical circuits undergo prolonged maturation across childhood and adolescence; however, it remains unknown what specific changes are occurring at the circuit level to establish adult cognitive function. With the recent advent of circuit dissection techniques, it is now feasible to examine circuit-specific changes in connectivity, activity, and function in animal models. Here, we propose that the balance of local and long-range inputs onto frontal cognitive circuits is an understudied metric of circuit maturation. This review highlights research on a frontal-sensory attention circuit that undergoes refinement of local/long-range connectivity, regulated by circuit activity and neuromodulatory signaling, and evaluates how this process may occur generally in the frontal cortex to support adult cognitive behavior. Notably, this balance can be bidirectionally disrupted through various mechanisms relevant to psychiatric disorders. Pharmacological or environmental interventions to normalize or reset the local and long-range balance could hold great therapeutic promise to prevent or rescue cognitive deficits.",

Inspired by microorganisms’ resistance to nanotoxicity by secreting extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which can act as electron shuttling media, we design a highly compatible bio-nano interface by modifying nZVI with EPS, markedly improving the performance of a bio-nano system consisting of nZVI and bacteria. EPS modification reduced membrane damage and oxidative stress induced by nZVI. Moreover, EPS alleviated nZVI agglomeration and probably reduced bacterial rejection of nZVI by wrapping camouflage, contributing to the bio-nano interface formation, thereby facilitating nZVI to provide electrons for bacterial reducing pollutant via membrane-anchoring cytochrome c.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mediators of cell-cell communication crucial in shaping tissue microenvironments. Here, we demonstrate that integrin α4β7 on murine HSPC EVs targets uptake into ECs. In BM ECs, HSPC EVs induce up-regulation of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) ligands that synergize with CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling to promote BM homing. In nonirradiated murine models, marrow preconditioning with HSPC EVs or recombinant CCR2 ligands improves homing and early graft occupancy after transplantation. These findings identify a role for HSPC EVs in remodeling ECs, newly define CCR2-dependent graft homing, and inform novel translational conditioning strategies to improve HSPC transplantation.",

Because of its high signal detection sensitivity and low susceptibility to magnetic field inhomogeneities, CEST analyzes heterogeneous botanical samples inaccessible to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The approach provides unprecedented insight into the dynamics and distribution of sugars and amino acids in intact, living plant tissue.

This approach exhibits high chemoselectivity for amines, making the method compatible with a wide range of substrates, including secondary amines, and targets the specific ε-amino group of lysine among the native amino ester’s derivatives. It maintains stereochemistry during amide bond formation and TIPS group removal, allowing a versatile platform for postsynthesis modifications such as click reactions and peptide-drug conjugations.

Still, the mechanisms governing the targeting of selected regions of the genome to nucleolus-associated domains (NADs) remain enigmatic. Here, we reveal the essential role of ZNF274, a SCAN-bearing member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)–containing zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, in sequestering lineage-specific gene clusters within NADs. Ablation of ZNF274 triggers transcriptional activation across entire genomic neighborhoods—encompassing, among others, protocadherin and KZFP-encoding genes—with loss of repressive chromatin marks, altered the 3D genome architecture and de novo CTCF binding. Mechanistically, ZNF274 anchors target DNA sequences at the nucleolus and facilitates their compartmentalization via a previously uncharted function of the SCAN domain. Our findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying NAD organization and suggest that perinucleolar entrapment into repressive hubs constrains the activation of tandemly arrayed genes to enable selective expression and modulate cell differentiation programs during development.",

In Caenorhabditis nematodes, androdioecy, a sexual polymorphism composed of males and hermaphrodites having the ability to self-fertilize, has evolved independently multiple times. While the modification of noncoding regulatory elements likely contributed to the evolution of hermaphroditism, little is known about these changes. Here, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) focusing on the evolution of hermaphroditism in Caenorhabditis nematodes. We found that, in androdioecious nematodes, mutations rapidly accumulated in CNEs’ neighboring genes associated with sexual traits. Expression analysis indicate that the identified CNEs are involved in spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites and associated with the transition of gene expression from dioecious to androdioecious nematodes. Last, genome editing of a CNE neighboring laf-1 resulted in a change in its expression in the gonadal region undergoing spermatogenesis.

In particular, several studies argue that these cross-basin influences may be mere statistical artifacts resulting from the high auto-correlation of ENSO. To clarify this issue, we conduct a series of perfect model hindcast experiments to untangle the individual and synergistic effects of the tropical Indian and Atlantic oceans. Our results clearly demonstrate that without these cross-basin effects, the Pacific warming would rarely reach super El Niño level. Specifically, the individual effect of the Indian Ocean efficiently enhances the development of super El Niño events. In contrast, the Atlantic’s effect is initially limited because it fails to establish the Bjerknes feedback in the Pacific. However, when coupled with the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic’s effect becomes more pronounced as it is amplified by the Bjerknes feedback established by the Indian Ocean.",

These compounds assemble into expected two-dimensional structures, with the pentacene chromophores having both sufficient overlap to cause singlet fission and space for conformational change to facilitate the dissociation of a triplet pair into free triplets, which is not the case for the anthracene analog. Detailed spectroscopic analysis revealed that the pentacene chromophore in the assembly undergoes singlet fission with a quantum yield of 88 ± 5%, giving rise to triplet pairs, from which free triplets are efficiently generated (Φ T = 130 ± 8.8%).

ACSL6 promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion mediated by IL-18, independent of its metabolic enzyme activity. Mechanistically, upon IL-18 stimulation, ACSL6 is phosphorylated by ERK2 at S674 and recruits IL-18RAP to interact with IL-18R1, thereby reinforcing the IL-18R1–IL-18RAP heterodimer and triggering NF-κB–dependent gene expression to facilitate tumor development. Furthermore, the up-regulation of CXCL1 and CXCL5 by ACSL6 promotes tumor-associated neutrophil and tumor-associated macrophage recruitment, thereby inhibiting cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration. Ablation or S674A mutation of ACSL6 potentiated anti–PD-1 therapeutic efficacy by increasing the effector activity of intertumoral CD8 + T cells.

However, this assumption is not generally valid, leading to misleading characterization results. Interfacial evaporators yield larger evaporation rates in dark conditions due to enlarged liquid-vapor surface areas, resulting in increased evaporative cooling and larger environmental temperature differentials. Theoretical and experimental evidence is provided, which shows that these temperature differences invalidate the equal energy input assumption. The results indicate that differences in evaporation rates correspond to energy input variations, without requiring enthalpy to be reduced below theoretical values. These findings offer alternative explanations for previous claims of reduced vaporization enthalpy and contradict enthalpy-related conclusions drawn from differential scanning calorimetry. We conclude that postulating a reduced vaporization enthalpy using the dark environment method is inaccurate and that re-evaluation of vaporization enthalpy reduction is required.",

The calcium defect was recapitulated in Jurkat knock-in. Site-directed mutagenesis displayed the exquisite sensitivity of Arg 2524 to any amino acid change. Despite the fact that all patients had severe immunodeficiency, they also displayed variable multisystemic involvements, including ectodermal dysplasia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, short stature, and bone marrow failure. In conclusion, unlike previously reported ITPR1-3 deficiencies leading to narrow, mainly neurological phenotypes, a recurrent dominant ITPR3 variant leads to a multisystemic disease, defining a unique role for IP3R3 in the tetrameric IP3R complex.",

This study presents the in vivo images of positronium lifetime in a human, for a patient with a glioblastoma brain tumor, by using the dedicated Jagiellonian PET system enabling simultaneous detection of annihilation photons and prompt gamma emitted by a radionuclide. The prompt gamma provides information on the time of positronium formation. The photons from positronium annihilation are used to reconstruct the place and time of its decay.

However, the knowledge of INP sources, concentrations, and their impact on CRE over the Tibetan Plateau (TP)—a highly climate-sensitive region—remains largely hypothetical. Here, we integrated data from multisource satellite observations and snowpack samples collected from five glaciers to demonstrate that dust particles constitute primary INP sources over the TP. The springtime dust influxes lead to seasonally elevated ice concentrations in mixed-phase clouds. Furthermore, the decadal reduction in dustiness from 2007 to 2019 results in decreased springtime dust INPs, thereby amplifying the cooling effect of clouds over the TP, with a 1.98 ± 0.39–watt per square meter reduction in surface net CRE corresponding to a 0.01 decrease in dust optical depth. Our findings elucidate previously unidentified pathways of climate feedback from an atmospheric INP perspective, especially highlighting the crucial role of dust in aerosol-cloud interactions.",

          "abstract": "Fluid flows are intrinsically characterized via the topology and dynamics of underlying vortex lines. Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity.",

Efforts to mitigate TLS impacts have thus far focused on circuit design, material selection, and surface treatments. Our work takes an approach that directly modifies TLS properties. This is achieved by creating an acoustic bandgap that suppresses all microwave-frequency phonons around the operating frequency of a transmon qubit. For embedded TLS strongly coupled to the transmon qubit, we measure a pronounced increase in relaxation time by two orders of magnitude, with the longest T 1 time exceeding 5 milliseconds.

We mimicked the interplay of these proteins using the “comet tail” bead motility assay, where branched actin networks are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex on the surface of beads coated with myosin-I and nucleation-promoting factor. We observed that myosin-I increased bead movement efficiency by thinning actin networks without affecting growth rates. Myosin-I triggered symmetry breaking and comet tail formation in dense networks resistant to spontaneous fracturing. Even with arrested actin assembly, myosin-I alone could break the network. Computational modeling recapitulated these observations, suggesting myosin-I acts as a repulsive force shaping the network’s architecture and boosting its force-generating capacity. We propose that myosin-I leverages its power stroke to amplify the forces generated by Arp2/3 complex–nucleated actin networks.",

The reduced expression of tumor suppressor miRNA let-7 fosters development and progression-related traits such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. We report a series of miRNA-based Lin28A-miRNA proteolysis-targeting chimeras (Lin28A-miRNA-PROTACs) designed to efficiently degrade Lin28A through a ubiquitin-proteasome–dependent mechanism, resulting in up-regulation of mature let-7 family. The augmented levels of matured let-7 miRNAs further exert inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation and migration, and increase its sensitivity to chemotherapy. In a mouse ectopic tumor model, Lin28A-miRNA-PROTAC demonstrates a substantial efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth. When combined with tamoxifen, the tumors exhibit gradual regression.

Increasing the SF concentration results in multilayers that grow either by direct assembly of SF molecules into the lamellae or, at high concentrations, along a two-step pathway beginning with a disordered monolayer that then crystallizes. Scanning Kelvin probe measurements show that these films substantially alter the surface potential; thus, they provide a platform for silk-based electronics on vdW solids.",

This ISV was constructed by encapsulating a chemodrug, SN38, into diselenide bond–bridged organosilica nanoparticles, followed by coating with a Mn 2+ -based metal phenolic network. We show that this ISV can activate the STING pathway through Mn 2+ and SN38 comediated signaling and simultaneously scavenge preexisting H 2 O 2 in the TME and Mn 2+ -catalyzed •OH by leveraging the antioxidant property of diselenide and polyphenol. This ISV effectively activated DCs and protected them from oxidative damage, leading to remarkable downstream T cell activation and systemic antitumor immunity.

Over the past two decades, the SCS has experienced increasing C ANT levels, with notable interannual fluctuations driven by El Niño and La Niña events influencing Kuroshio intrusion, generating anomalously high and low C ANT inventories, respectively.

Our work offers insights into the MATBG-photon interaction and demonstrates pathways to use moiré superconductors as an exciting platform for revolutionary quantum devices and sensors.",

          "abstract": "Dysregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases 1/2 (MNK1/2)–eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) signaling axis promotes breast cancer progression. MNK1 is known to influence cancer stem cells (CSCs); self-renewing populations that support metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapeutic resistance, making them a clinically relevant target. The precise function of MNK1 in regulating CSCs, however, remains unexplored. Here, we generated MNK1 knockout cancer cell lines, resulting in diminished CSC properties in vitro and slowed tumor growth in vivo. Using a multiomics approach, we functionally demonstrated that loss of MNK1 restricts tumor cell metabolic adaptation by reducing glycolysis and increasing dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, MNK1-null breast and pancreatic tumor cells demonstrated suppressed metastasis to the liver, but not the lung. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from breast cancer patients validated the positive correlation between MNK1 and glycolytic enzyme protein expression. This study defines metabolic perturbations as a previously unknown consequence of targeting MNK1/2, which may be therapeutically exploited.",

          "abstract": "Radiogenic heat production is fundamental to the energy budget of planets. Roughly half of the heat that Earth loses through its surface today comes from the three long-lived, heat-producing elements (potassium, thorium, and uranium). These three elements have long been believed to be highly lithophile and thus concentrate in the mantle of rocky planets. However, our study shows that they all become siderophile under the pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the core formation of large rocky planets dubbed super-Earths. Mantle convection in super-Earths is then primarily driven by heating from the core rather than by a mix of internal heating and cooling from above as in Earth. Partitioning these sources of radiogenic heat into the core remarkably increases the core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature and the total heat flow across the CMB in super-Earths. Consequently, super-Earths are likely to host long-lived volcanism and strong magnetic dynamos.",

          "abstract": "The primate hippocampus, crucial for both episodic memory and spatial navigation, remains an enigma regarding whether these functions share the same neural substrates. We investigated how identical hippocampal neurons in macaque monkeys dynamically shifted their representations between tasks. In a recognition memory task, a notable fraction of hippocampal neurons showed that rate modulation strongly correlated with recognition performance. During free navigation in an open arena, spatial view, rather than position, predominantly influenced the spatial selectivity of hippocampal neurons. Neurons selective for recognition memory displayed minimal spatial tuning, while spatially tuned neurons exhibited limited memory-related activity. These neural correlates of recognition memory and space were more pronounced in the anterior and posterior portions of the hippocampus, respectively. These opposing gradients extended further into the anterior and posterior neocortices. Overall, our findings suggest the presence of orthogonal long-axis gradients between recognition memory and spatial navigation in the hippocampal-neocortical networks of macaque monkeys.",

This study presents an innovative approach: the on-demand minimal-gain-printed Si nanolaser. By using a carefully designed minimal III-V optical gain structure and a precise on-demand gain-printing technique, we achieve lasing operation with superior spectral stability under pulsed conditions and observe a strong signature of CW operation at room temperature. These achievements are attributed to addressing both fundamental and technological issues, including carrier diffusion, absorption loss, and inefficient thermal dissipation, through minimal-gain printing in the nanolaser. Moreover, our demonstration of the laser-on-waveguide structure emphasizes the integration benefits of this on-demand gain-printed Si nanolaser, highlighting its potential significance in the fields of Si photonics and photonic integrated circuits.",

          "abstract": "Memristors have emerged as promising devices for enabling efficient multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations in crossbar arrays, crucial for analog in-memory computing (AiMC). However, variations in memristors and associated circuits can affect the accuracy of analog computing. Typically, this is mitigated by on-chip training, which is challenging for memristors with limited endurance. We present a hardware-software codesign using magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)–based AiMC off-chip calibration that achieves software accuracy without costly on-chip training. Hardware-wise, MTJ devices exhibit ultralow cycle-to-cycle variations, as experimentally evaluated over 1 million mass-produced devices. Software-wise, leveraging this, we propose an off-chip training method to adjust deep neural network parameters, achieving accurate AiMC inference. We validate this approach with MAC operations, showing improved transfer curve linearity and reduced errors. By emulating large-scale neural network models, our codesigned MTJ-based AiMC closely matches software baseline accuracy and outperforms existing off-chip training methods, highlighting MTJ’s potential in AI tasks.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.",

          "abstract": "Ectotherms have peculiar relationships with microorganisms. For instance, bacteria are recovered from the blood and internal organs of healthy teleosts. However, the presence of microbial communities in the healthy teleost brain has not been proposed. Here, we report a living bacterial community in the brain of healthy salmonids with bacterial loads comparable to those of the spleen and 1000-fold lower than in the gut. Brain bacterial communities share &gt;50% of their diversity with gut and blood bacterial communities. Using culturomics, we obtained 54 bacterial isolates from the brains of healthy trout. Comparative genomics suggests that brain bacteria may have adaptations for niche colonization and polyamine biosynthesis. In a natural system, Chinook salmon brain microbiomes shift from juveniles to reproductively mature adults. Our study redefines the physiological relationships between the brain and bacteria in teleosts. This symbiosis may endow salmonids with a direct mechanism to sense and respond to environmental microbes.",

          "abstract": "Venture capitalists maximize profits not by ‘squeezing’ efficiencies out of established companies, but instead by promoting ceaseless experimentation aimed at helping startups achieve ‘hypergrowth’. To date, there is limited empirical evidence of both how startups achieve hypergrowth, and the impact of these practices on organizations and workers. This article draws on 19 months of participant-observation research inside a venture-backed startup I call AllDone to trace the links between the institution of venture capital and the organization of work. Although AllDone executives engaged in cost-cutting strategies common to other financialized firms, they also developed distinctive corporate strategies and organizational structures. Each of the company’s three work teams was organized to perform interdependent functions in support of venture capital’s imperative for rapid and exponential asset value inflation. I conclude with a discussion of the article’s implications for research on venture capital, startup work, and the relationship between financialization and work more broadly.",
