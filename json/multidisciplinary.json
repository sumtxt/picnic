          "abstract": "Supported metal catalysts that integrate atomically dispersed species with controlled structures lie at the forefront of catalytic materials design, offering exceptional control over reactivity and high metal utilization, approaching the precision of molecular systems 1–3 . However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure–activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications 1,2 . Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that 195 Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures. Beyond SACs, this approach lays the foundation for studying more complex architectures, such as dual-atom or single-cluster catalysts, containing various NMR-active metals.",

          "abstract": "Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere 1,2 . Until now, CO 2 and CH 4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration 3–6 . Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO 2 and CH 4 . Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO 2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year −1 , similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models.",

          "authors": "Matthew H. England, Zhi Li, Maurice F. Huguenin, Andrew E. Kiss, Alex Sen Gupta, Ryan M. Holmes, Stefan Rahmstorf",
          "abstract": "North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature patterns profoundly influence global and regional climate across all timescales, from synoptic 1 to seasonal 2–4 , decadal 5 , multidecadal 6,7 and beyond 8,9 . During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation 10,11 . Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen.",

          "abstract": "Drought is one of the most common and complex natural hazards affecting the environment, economies and populations globally 1–4 . However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends 4–6 , and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901–2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.",

          "abstract": "How does the brain convert visual input into specific motor actions 1,2 ? In Drosophila , visual projection neurons (VPNs) 3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain 5 . The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6 ), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain 7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm 1–5 . However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited 6–9 . Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes.",

          "abstract": "Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality 1–10 . Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 bce . Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology 11 , not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cell plasticity enables the acquisition of new phenotypic features and is implicated as a major driver of metastatic progression 1,2 . Metastasis occurs mostly in the absence of additional genetic alterations 3–5 , which suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are important 6 . However, they remain poorly defined. Here we identify the chromatin-remodelling enzyme ATRX as a key regulator of colonic lineage fidelity and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Atrx loss promotes tumour invasion and metastasis, concomitant with a loss of colonic epithelial identity and the emergence of highly plastic mesenchymal and squamous-like cell states. Combined analysis of chromatin accessibility and enhancer mapping identified impairment of activity of the colonic lineage-specifying transcription factor HNF4A as a key mediator of these observed phenotypes. We identify squamous-like cells in human patient samples and a squamous-like expression signature that correlates with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis. Collectively, our study defines the epigenetic maintenance of colonic epithelial identity by ATRX and HNF4A as suppressors of lineage plasticity and metastasis in colorectal cancer.",

Yet, since not all academics engage with social media, the sample that does so may have an outsized influence on shaping public perceptions of academia through the set topics they engage with and their style and tone of communication. We describe patterns in academics’ expression online using an international dataset covering nearly 100,000 scholars linking their Twitter content to academic records. We document large and systematic variation in politically salient academic expression concerning climate action, cultural and economic concepts. We show that US academics often diverge from the US Twitter population at large in topic focus and style, although academics are not necessarily more extreme in their beliefs. Future work should examine potential impacts on public trust and the reasons why academics express themselves politically on social media.",

          "authors": "Olivia del Giorgio, Matthias Baumann, Tobias Kuemmerle, Yann le Polain de Waroux",
          "abstract": "The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical and subtropical woodlands degrades ecosystem functionality, biodiversity, and the livelihood base of millions of people. Understanding where and how agricultural frontiers emerge is thus important. Yet, existing monitoring approaches typically focus on mapping deforestation and do not capture the shifts in land access and ownership that lay the ground for agricultural expansion, thereby missing early stages of frontier development. We develop an approach that captures these early dynamics and apply it to the entire 1,1 million km 2 of the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot. Through the detection of linear features indicative of land claims and the analysis of their spatial–temporal dynamics, we reveal that the footprint of agricultural frontiers in the region extends far beyond that of deforestation. Most of the Chaco shows signs of land claiming, and although claiming activity is especially concentrated close to active deforestation, emergent claiming in remote parts of the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco indicates rapidly growing interest in land in these regions. Finally, the strong spatial correlation between land claiming and the disappearance of smallholder homesteads points to the social repercussions of early agricultural frontier expansion in the Chaco.

          "abstract": "Through the industrial era, pollutants have been unevenly distributed in the environment, disproportionately impacting disenfranchised communities. Redressing the unequal distribution of environmental pollution is thus a question of environmental justice and public health that requires policy solutions. However, data on pollutants for many locations and time periods are limited because environmental monitoring is largely reactive—i.e., pollutants are monitored only after they are recognized as harmful and are circulating in the environment at elevated levels. Without comprehensive historical pollution data, it is difficult to understand the full, intergenerational consequences of pollutants on environmental and human health. We assert that biological specimens in natural history collections are an underutilized source of quantitative pollution data for tracking environmental pollutants over two centuries to inform justice-centered policy solutions. Specifically, we: 1) discuss the need for quantitative pollution data in environmental research and its implications for public health and policy, 2) examine the capacity of biological specimens as tools for tracking environmental pollutants through space and time, 3) present a framework for integrating pollution datasets from specimens with spatially and temporally matched human health datasets to inform and evaluate policy, and 4) identify challenges and research directions associated with the use of quantitative pollution datasets. Biological specimens present a unique opportunity to fill critical gaps that address environmental challenges relevant to public health and policy. This work demands interdisciplinary partnerships and inclusive practices to connect data generated from specimens with urgent questions about environmental health and justice.",

          "abstract": "This research paper investigates the prevalence of functional limitations among employed adults in the United States and the association between these limitations and medical conditions. The authors administered a survey adapted from the Dutch Functional Abilities List to a nationally representative sample of US adults ages 22 and older, finding that nearly three-quarters of working adults report at least one functional limitation, with an average of nearly six functional limitations per working adult. The most common limitations were in upper body strength and torso range of motion, and with respect to the ambient environment. The study also found that mental illness, arthritis, and substance use disorder are associated with the greatest number of functional limitations in working adults. The findings have implications for economic performance, workforce planning, and social policies to support displaced and vulnerable workers with significant functional limitations. Identifying the occupations and industries with large numbers of workers with functional limitations is critical to addressing short-term labor supply disruptions (e.g., public health crises) and preparing for longer-term workforce needs (e.g., long-term care workers for an aging population).",

          "abstract": "The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are trained on massive datasets before being adjusted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are n -consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.",

          "abstract": "Life history traits influence marine species dispersal and habitat colonization. Medusozoans (jellyfish and siphonophores) exhibit diverse life cycles, evolved from an ancestral cycle alternating between a benthic polyp and a pelagic medusa. Despite their ecological importance, factors shaping medusozoan distribution remain poorly understood. By integrating metabarcoding and environmental data from the Tara Oceans expedition with life history traits, we provide global evidence supporting the longstanding hypothesis that benthic polyp presence/absence is a key factor influencing the distribution and abundance of planktonic medusozoans in the surface ocean. We inferred on a time-calibrated phylogeny of Medusozoa multiple transitions to a fully planktonic (holoplanktonic) life cycle, either through polyp loss, acquisition of drifting polyps, or development of polyps parasitizing pelagic organisms. We could associate each transition with a shift toward offshore habitats and the emergence of globally dominant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), whose abundance far exceeds that of any nonholoplanktonic medusozoans in the planktonic realm. The prevalence of holoplanktonic medusozoans in terms of abundance and diversity is broadly observed in coastal and offshore environments, peaking over greater bathymetric depths in tropical and subtropical regions. We show that holoplanktonic and nonholoplanktonic groups interact with distinct yet compositionally similar planktonic communities. Holoplanktonic OTUs occupy more peripheral positions in a plankton interactome, suggesting greater flexibility in biotic interactions, an adaptive trait in rapidly changing planktonic ecosystems. These findings highlight how life cycle evolution shaped the global distribution of medusozoans and suggest that variations in life history may significantly influence how medusozoans respond to global environmental changes.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underlie the synchronization of a system’s units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the Caenorhabditis elegans backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal’s motor periphery, providing testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a door to exploring the structure–function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals.",

          "abstract": "Collective cell migration is a key driver of tissue morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Here, we identified the tumor suppressor Ras association domain-containing protein 8 (RASSF8) as a WAVE interactor required for border cell migration. RASSF8 colocalizes with F-actin and cell adhesion molecules at border cell– border cell contacts. Loss of RASSF8 function results in border cell cohesion defects, a phenotype associated with changes in the localization of the Echinoid (Ed) and Coracle (Cora). Cell-type-specific RNA interference (RNAi) experiments suggest that cohesion defects are caused by changes in localization of Ed rather than E-cadherin. Gain-of-function experiments further revealed reciprocal functional interactions between RASSF8 and WAVE controlling collective border cell movement. Thus, we propose a dual function of RASSF8 in coordinating border cell cluster behavior. RASSF8 is thought to regulate the collective movement of border cells by restricting WAVE function, while it controls the epithelial cluster integrity by regulating cell–cell adhesion and septate junction molecules such as Ed and Cora.",

          "abstract": "While symmetry breaking in 2D ferroelectrics is obviously linked to the single-layer structure, layered (van der Waals) ferroelectrics can have a multitude of underlying mechanisms, making their identification nontrivial and often controversial. This complexity is exemplified by tin chalcogenides whose equilibrium structure, the orthorhombic α-phase with space group Pnma , includes an inversion center and which therefore should not be ferroelectric. Yet, recent work demonstrated polarization switching and ferroelectric domains in few-layer SnS and SnSe. Here, we use in situ electron microscopy and diffraction to determine the mechanism and characteristics of ferroelectricity across the SnSe 1-x S x system. We identify two distinct phases of synthetic SnSe 1-x S x : nonpolar (centrosymmetric) equilibrium (α-phase) crystals and metastable crystals adopting a distorted monoclinic structure, which are in-plane ferroelectrics with Curie temperatures of 320 to 420 °C. A surprising structural plasticity of the ferroelectric crystals during heating/cooling indicates a shallow energy landscape. This in turn suggests absence of a pronounced driving force for conversion to the α-phase that can explain the formation of the nonequilibrium crystals and their stability even after transfer to other supports. Our results highlight opportunities for the discovery of novel ferroelectrics among nonequilibrium van der Waals crystals.",

The clinical benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies is usually short-lived, with resistance being driven by tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these limitations, we developed Targeted Apoptotic Immune Modulators (TAIM), a nonviral nanoparticle platform for the targeted delivery of polyinosine:polycytosine (polyIC), to simultaneously induce tumor cell death and activate antitumor immunity. The first TAIM compound, TAR001, was designed as a systemic treatment against metastatic EGFR-positive solid cancers. Here, we present TAR001’s multifaceted mode of action. We demonstrate that TAR001 is selective toward EGFR-overexpressing cancers, provoking a pattern recognition response, apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and antitumor immunity. TAR001 modulates the TME, recruiting and activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Systemic delivery of TAR001 markedly extends survival and inhibits tumor growth in multiple murine tumor models. TAR001 represents an innovative, safe, multimodal treatment approach with the potential to benefit patients with metastatic head and neck, non–small cell lung cancer, colorectal, renal, and triple-negative breast cancers. This unique modality utilizes a broad range of mechanisms to overcome the tumor’s ability to escape apoptosis and immune cell activation.",

          "abstract": "Evolution is often uneven in its pace and outcomes, with long periods of stasis interrupted by abrupt increases in morphological and ecological disparity. With thousands of gene histories, phylogenomics can uncover the genomic signatures of these broad macroevolutionary trends. Diatoms are a species-rich lineage of microeukaryotes that contribute greatly to the global cycling of carbon, oxygen, and silica, which they use to build elaborately structured cell walls. We combined fossil information with newly sequenced transcriptomes from 181 diverse diatom species to reconstruct the pattern, timing, and genomic context of major evolutionary transitions. Diatoms originated 270 Mya, and after &gt;100 My of relative stasis in morphology and ecology, a radiation near the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary led to the diversity of habitats and cell wall architectures characteristic of modern diatoms. This transition was marked by a genome duplication and high levels of gene tree discordance. However, short generation times increase the probability of coalescence between speciation events, minimizing the impacts of incomplete lineage sorting and implicating sequence saturation and gene tree error as the main sources of discordance. Nevertheless, a rigorous tree-based approach to ortholog selection resulted in strongly supported relationships, including some that were uncertain previously. Three pulses of accelerated speciation were detected, two of which were associated with the evolution of novel traits and ecological transitions. The first 100 My of diatom evolution was a slow-burning fuse that led to a burst of innovations in ecology, morphology, and life history that are hallmarks of contemporary diatom assemblages.",

Cryo-electron tomography of EGFR-containing EVs reveals that EGFR forms clusters in both the presence and absence of EGF with a ~3 nm gap between the inner membrane and cytoplasmic density. EGFR extracellular region (ECR) dimers do not form regular arrays in these clusters. Subtomogram averaging of the 150 kDa EGF-bound EGFR ECR dimer yielded a 15 Å map into which the crystal structure of the ligand-bound EGFR ECR dimer fits well.

Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids.

Electroencephalography (EEG), which records electrical brain activity with a high temporal resolution, is well suited to quantify tDCS-induced neuromodulation in humans. However, most studies relying on scalp EEG recordings or event-related potentials showed low reliability and only indirect correlations. Here, we combined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings with a sham-controlled tDCS experiment during fast periodic visual stimulation. Anodal (+2 mA) tDCS was applied over the right occipito-temporal cortex for 20 min using two small ring high-definition electrodes. Through the analysis of iEEG signals of 947 intracerebral contacts in 11 drug-resistant epileptic patients, we quantified the neuromodulation of iEEG cognitive evoked responses during (P2 phase) and after (P3 phase) tDCS by comparison to a control phase before tDCS (P1 phase). Significant neuromodulations of face-selective iEEG activity in anterior &amp; posterior temporal lobe and in the occipital lobe were found, with amplitude increases of 3% and 4%, 16% and 13%, and 36% and 33%, during and after tDCS, respectively. Interestingly, despite a unique tDCS session, the face-selective neuromodulation in the right visual occipito-temporal cortex remained significant ( P = 0.015) after tDCS (P3 vs. P1). This iEEG study demonstrates that using low intensity tDCS and small ring electrodes can induce significant electrophysiological effects on a selective cognitive function in humans.",

The method is based on replacing the promoters of the target genes with native Y. lipolytica promoters of varying strengths or removing the promoters entirely. To demonstrate the method’s capabilities, we created a plasmid library that targets 56 transcription factors (TFs) and changes the expression of each TF to seven different levels.

We identified multiple TFs whose regulatory changes increased thermotolerance, two TFs that eliminated pseudohyphal growth, and several TFs that increased betanin production. Analogous libraries can be designed to target any chosen group of genes and even all the genes.

Here, we report the finding and characterization of M606, a selective small molecule inhibitor of MYCN, which was identified by screening a diverse chemical library. M606 reduced MYCN protein levels in neuroblastoma cell lines and upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A). Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN , c-Myc , or HIF1A in HepG2 and BE(2)-C cells followed by M606 treatment, we demonstrated that Myc downregulation and HIF1A upregulation were two independent effects of M606 treatment. M606 selectively targeted neuroblastoma cell lines expressing higher levels of MYCN protein and delayed neuroblastoma development in the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model. Metabolomic analysis showed that M606 modulated glucose metabolism, consistent with a hypoxic response and iron deprivation. Biochemical characterization of M606 not only confirmed its iron-chelating properties but also revealed its ability to downregulate MYCN promoter activity, which could be rescued by the addition of iron. Luciferase assays identified the minimal MYCN promoter region required for the M606 response, which contained overlapping E2F transcription factor binding sites. Further evaluation defined a key role for E2F3 in the M606-mediated response. The finding of a potent cell-permeable iron chelator that can chelate iron to directly downregulate MYCN transcription via an E2F3-mediated response represents a potentially valuable therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancers overexpressing Myc oncoproteins.",

          "abstract": "A universal response of plants to environmental stresses is the activation of plasma membrane (PM) phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes phosphoinositides to produce soluble inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Because of their conical shape, DAG amounts have to be tightly regulated or they can destabilize membranes. We previously showed that upon stress, Synaptotagmin1 (SYT1) transports DAG from the PM to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ER–PM Contact Sites (CS). Here, we addressed the fate of the incoming DAG in the ER. We show that diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) DGK1 and DGK2 form a module with SYT1 functionally coupling DAG transport and phosphorylation at ER–PM CS. Although SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 do not show exclusive ER–PM CS localization, their interaction occurs specifically at ER–PM CS and the removal of ER–PM CS abolishes the interaction. Lipidomic analysis of a dgk1dgk2 double mutant supports that DGK1 and DGK2 phosphorylate DAG at the ER and transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses indicate that SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 are functionally related. Taken together, our results highlight a mechanism at ER–PM CS that coordinates the transfer of DAG from the PM to the ER by SYT1 upon stress and the concomitant phosphorylation of DAG by DGK1 and DGK2 at the ER. These findings underscore the critical role of spatial coordination in lipid metabolism during stress-induced membrane remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Lineages that have invaded subterranean environments have repeatedly evolved remarkable adaptations to life in darkness. However, observational and experimental studies in additional natural systems are needed to further our understanding of repeated evolution and convergence. In Texas, a radiation of groundwater salamanders (genus Eurycea ), with independent invasions of subterranean karstic environments, offers an opportunity to investigate phenotypic convergence, parallel evolution, and the enhancement and regression of sensory systems. Adaptations to a troglobitic life in this clade include morphological, behavioral, and physiological changes within and among species. Intraspecific and interspecific variation in morphology in response to the selective pressures of life underground allows for detailed examination of physical, behavioral, and physiological changes associated with subterranean adaptation within a comparative phylogenetic framework. We find a correlated change between two sensory systems repeated across multiple subterranean Eurycea lineages: the degeneration of the eye and the expansion of the mechanosensory lateral line. The increase in anterior neuromast organs in subterranean lineages was positively correlated with the expression of pax6 (Paired-box 6), a conserved transcription factor important for vertebrate neurogenesis. Our results show a decreasing trend of PAX6 labeling in the neuromasts of adult surface salamanders ( Eurycea nana ) relative to the maintained labeling in subterranean species ( Eurycea rathbuni ). These lateral line enhancements are correlated with reductions in the development of optic systems in subterranean salamander lineages. Altogether, our findings provide a starting point for future evolutionary developmental investigations examining the genetic underpinnings of adaptive, repeated evolution in a novel system.",

We found that HIV-1 can enter primary CD4 + T cells at both the plasma membrane and internal compartments, while entry into common T cell lines occurred primarily at the plasma membrane. Inhibition of macropinocytosis suppressed HIV-1 internalization into and subsequent fusion with primary CD4 + T cells regardless of the viral coreceptor usage. Microscopic analysis of viral contents exposed to the cytosol confirmed that HIV-1 fusion occurs at the macropinosomal membrane. Finally, the inhibition of macropinocytosis blocked HIV-1 infection of primary CD4 + T cells.

As the oceans warm and acidify, the calcification of coral reefs declines with net calcium carbonate dissolution projected under even moderate emissions trajectories. The impact of this on the global carbon cycle is however yet to be accounted for. Here, we use a synthesis of the sensitivity of coral reef calcification to climate change, alongside reef distribution products to estimate alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes resulting from reductions in reef calcification. Using a global ocean biogeochemical model, we simulate the impact on ocean carbon uptake under different emissions scenarios, accounting for uncertainty in present-day calcification rates. Reductions in net coral reef carbonate production can enhance the ocean carbon sink by up to 1.25 GtCO 2 y −1 by midcentury (0.48 GtCO 2 y −1 median estimate) with cumulative ocean carbon uptake up to 13% greater by 2300 (7% median estimate). Our findings indicate that accounting for the coral reef feedback in projections will increase estimates of the remaining carbon budget associated with global warming thresholds, as well as the likelihood that net zero emissions can be achieved without negative emissions.",

          "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions and major sources of genomic instability. Studies have suggested that DSBs induce local transcriptional silencing that consequently promotes genomic stability. Several factors have been proposed to actively participate in this process, including Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here, we found that disrupting PRC1 clustering disrupts DSB-induced gene silencing. Interactome analysis of PHC2, a PRC1 subunit that promotes the PRC1 clustering, found several nucleoporins found in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Similar to PHC2, depleting the nucleoporins also disrupted the DSB-induced gene silencing. We found that some of these nucleoporins, such as NUP107 and NUP43, which are members of the Y-complex of NPC, localize to DSB sites. The presence of nucleoporins and PHC2 at DSB regions was interdependent, suggesting that they act cooperatively in the DSB-induced gene silencing. We further found two structural components within NUP107 to be necessary for the transcriptional repression at DSBs: ATM/ Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related-mediated phosphorylation at the Serine37 residue within the N-terminal disordered tail and the NUP133-binding surface at the C-terminus. These results provide a functional interplay among nucleoporins, ATM, and the Polycomb proteins in the DSB metabolism and underscore their emerging roles in genome stability maintenance.",

Here, we model the strongly coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wave packets, in a manner distinctively different from tight-binding or discrete hopping-based approaches. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wave packet evolution and the formation of acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables—including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy—over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, and high effective masses. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into nontrivial transport behavior in quantum materials.",

However, the conditions under which this material formed and its subsequent incorporation into growing planetesimals remains a subject of vigorous debate. Here, we show that C isotope variations among these organics in most carbonaceous chondrites are strongly correlated with mass-independent O isotope anomalies exhibited by their host meteorites. As the latter signature has been argued to track abundances of nebular water generated from photochemical processing of CO gas, the C isotope variability of refractory organic solids may relate to this same process. We propose a framework in which CO photolysis simultaneously produces H 2 O and generates a pool of C + ions that serve as precursors for C-rich organic solids, with their C isotope compositions suggesting formation over a relatively narrow and warm range of temperatures in the protoplanetary disk (~200 to 400 K). Two populations of organic precursors with different C isotope compositions became associated with distinct dust reservoirs prior to their delivery to the carbonaceous-chondrite-forming region, which likely resided at lower temperatures (&lt;170 K). This finding places detailed constraints on the location and distribution of chemical reactions that generated both water and organic-rich reservoirs in the early Solar System.",

In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) to investigate the effects of five BPA substitutes [bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol B, bisphenol F (BPF), tetramethyl BPF, and 4,4′-(Perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl)diphenol] at pathophysiologically relevant exposure levels during aging and examined the underlying mechanisms using a mouse model. Our results indicated that, among the five BPA substitutes, exposure to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of BPS (300, 450, and 600 nM) accelerated aging in C. elegans . In mice, exposure to a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of BPS (125 μg/kg/day, from 4 to 20 mo of age) similarly reduces the life and health span and accelerates aging phenotypes in multiple tissues. Further investigations demonstrated that long-term BPS exposure resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of BPS in brown adipose tissue (BAT) than in other organs. RNA sequencing analysis of BAT revealed that BPS accelerates BAT aging through multiple pathways. Importantly, transplantation of BAT from BPS-exposed mice into BPS-naive mice accelerated aging in recipients. Conversely, transplantation of BAT from unexposed mice into BPS-exposed mice significantly improved their metabolic status and delayed aging. These findings elucidate the impact of pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of BPS on the aging process and suggest that these effects are likely mediated through the disruption of BAT function.",

          "abstract": "The eukaryotic leading-strand DNA polymerase ε (Polε) is a dual-function enzyme with a proofreading 3′-5′ exonuclease ( exo ) site located 40 Å from the DNA synthesizing pol site. Errors in Polε proofreading can cause various mutations, including C-to-G transversions, the most prevalent mutation in cancers and genetic diseases. Polε interacts with all three subunits of the PCNA ring to assemble a functional holoenzyme. Despite previous studies on proofreading of several Pol’s, how Polε—or any Pol complexed with its sliding clamp—proofreads a mismatch generated in situ has been unknown. We show here by cryo-EM that a template/primer DNA substrate with a preexisting mismatch cannot enter the exo site of Polε–PCNA holoenzyme, but a mismatch generated in situ in the pol site yields three bona fide proofreading intermediates of Polε–PCNA holoenzyme. These intermediates reveal how the mismatch is dislodged from the pol site, how the DNA unwinds six base pairs, and how the unpaired primer 3′-end is inserted into the exo site for cleavage. These results unexpectedly demonstrate that PCNA imposes strong steric constraints that extend unwinding and direct the trajectory of mismatched DNA and that this trajectory is dramatically different than for Polε in the absence of PCNA. These findings suggest a physiologically relevant proofreading mechanism for the human Polε holoenzyme.",

Here, we characterize regional variation in structure–function coupling, capturing the degree to which a cortical region’s structural connections relate to patterns of coordinated neural activity in healthy, term-born neonates ( n = 239). Regional structure–function coupling is heterogeneously patterned across the cortex, with higher coupling in the auditory, lateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices. Average structure–function coupling is negatively associated with age during the first month of life, with age-associated decreases seen in primary sensory systems, specifically in auditory and somatomotor regions. Age-associated “decoupling” of structure and function reflects increasingly segregated patterns of functional connectivity and increasingly integrated patterns of white matter connectivity with age. Notably, higher structure–function coupling after accounting for age in the dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, and visual systems at birth is associated with faster visuospatial attention to faces at one year of age. These results yield valuable insight into the development of structural and functional connectivity across the cortex, including how interregional variation in structure–function coupling during the first month of life might shape later attention.",

We provide a comprehensive framework that elucidates how different evolutionary forces interact to influence genotypic robustness and localization within haploid and diploid populations. We demonstrate that in haploid populations, high mutation rates relative to recombination typically drive the population toward regions of increased eigencentrality, a graph-theoretic measure of centrality which is correlated while not identical to mutational robustness. On the other hand, recombination increases the localization of the population to a smaller region of genotypic space, while high values of recombination relative to mutation can introduce shifts in distribution away from regions of high eigencentrality and toward attractors of the recombination dynamics. Diploid dynamics further complicate these interactions, showing reduced alignment with eigencentrality under both high mutation and recombination rates, with the exception of structured diploid landscapes where dynamics are still aligned with increasing eigencentrality. Our findings underscore the nuanced dependencies of evolutionary outcomes on both local and global landscape structures as well as evolutionary parameters.",

          "abstract": "Natural ice plays salient roles in making the Earth habitable and sustainable. Previously overlooked, its role in chemical processes is now of emerging interest, particularly due to the freeze concentration effect, which can substantially promote chemical reactions during ice formation. We demonstrate here that ice formation can serve as a dynamic and unique pathway for mineral genesis. Freezing solutions containing dissolved manganese and carbonates produced rhodochrosite (Mn II CO 3 ) even under slightly undersaturated conditions. At room temperature, by contrast, this occurred when the solution saturation level was increased by ca. 30,000 times. The cryogenic rhodochrosite formed spherical aggregates of nano-polycrystallites, distinctly different from the cubic monocrystalline particles observed at room temperature. The distinct feature likely resulted from the combined effects of the intensified supersaturation induced by the freeze concentration effect and the low temperatures within liquid-like layers, conditions that make liquid-like layers an exceptional environment for mineral genesis, unlike typical natural water systems. The cryogenic rhodochrosite formation was successfully demonstrated using in situ, real-time X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), enabling direct observation of freeze-induced solid formation. Our findings reveal that freeze-induced crystallization may be an active mineralization pathway, potentially influencing elemental cycles within the cryosphere and contributing to minerals with distinguishing properties and reactivities in the environment.",

A single-point “off-board” measurement of Var(Δ Q 0.2C-1C (V) ) indicates whether a particular cell is experiencing self-limiting or accelerating degradation and is thus near a knee point in its cycle life.

Active conservation management to reduce extinction risk includes increasing habitat connectivity, translocations from captive populations, or intensive surveillance of highly protected closed populations. Advances in sequencing technology mean that it is now possible to consider the genomic impacts of such strategies, as a proxy for variation in individual fitness. Using whole genome sequences from critically endangered eastern black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis michaeli ), we compare the consequences of different types of conservation efforts, based on cohorts of offspring resulting from parents from different sources. Based on the fraction of the genome in runs of homozygosity (ROH) of different lengths, we found lower inbreeding in offspring of individuals that had either been translocated from ex-situ populations (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.047) or dispersed between proximate native populations (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.065) compared to the intensively managed closed population from which the migrant moved (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.112). However, the benefit of such movement was removed after only a few generations of closed breeding (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.149). Although sample size restricted power to detect significance of differences, the relative abundance of highly deleterious mutations was higher for offspring resulting from translocation compared to the other cohorts and this load was sheltered by higher heterozygosity, which could increase risks of inbreeding depression if inbreeding subsequently occurs. In contrast, native dispersers reduced the negative effects of inbreeding without compromising the benefits of past purging of deleterious mutations. Our study highlights the importance of natural dispersal and reiterates the importance of maintaining habitat corridors between populations.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering attenuates widespread sensory and motor processing, both of which are mediated by phase coherence. However, it remains unclear i) whether mind wandering impacts both sensory input and motor output processing by modulating ii) neural entrainment to external stimuli, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), and specifically iii) whether task difficulty with different degrees of attentional demands moderates the impact of mind wandering on phase coherence. Using the thought-probe method, we assessed participants’ attentional states during different sensory and motor tasks with varying task difficulty. We found that mind wandering decreased ITPC exclusively in less demanding tasks but not in difficult ones, regardless of whether the tasks involved visual input or motor output processing. Our results suggest that external task difficulty may modulate the balance between external and internal cognitive processing (e.g., mind wandering), with simpler tasks facilitating internally oriented cognition and increasing mind wandering. This balance between internal mind wandering and external task difficulty is mediated, in part, by phase coherence, which serves as an underlying neural mechanism. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that phase coherence and its dynamics (ITPC) play a key role in mediating the reciprocal balance of internal and external cognition—this suggests their partly shared cognitive-executive resources as entailed by the recently proposed Baseline model of cognition.",

          "abstract": "Plasma membrane-localized autoinhibited Ca 2+ pumps are essential for maintaining basal cytosolic Ca 2+ levels for regulating growth processes and environmental responses. These pumps are known to be activated by calmodulins to maintain Ca 2+ homeostasis in plants and animals. Here, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved copine protein BON1 is critical for maintaining low cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations by directly regulating two plasma membrane-localized Ca 2+ pumps ACA8 and ACA10 in Arabidopsis . BON1 interacts with a region within the N-terminal domain of ACA8 and ACA10, preceding the calmodulin binding sites, and stimulates ACA8 activity. This activation can occur without calmodulin binding, indicating that BON1 and calmodulin independently regulate the Ca 2+ pump. Loss of BON1 function results in elevated basal cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations, which can be partially rescued by overexpressing hyperactive ACA8 or ACA10. Furthermore, we show that BON1 has one high-affinity Ca 2+ binding site in the VWA domain that is critical for activation of ACA8 as well as for BON1 function, suggesting a feedback mechanism for Ca 2+ homeostasis at resting concentrations. Our findings suggest that this Ca 2+ responsive regulatory mechanism extends beyond Arabidopsis , as we show interactions between ACA and BON proteins from algae to flowering plants, pointing to an ancient regulatory mechanism for maintaining low basal cytosolic Ca 2+ . Notably, a human plasma membrane-localized autoinhibited Ca 2+ pump can also be activated by a human BON protein in a yeast functional assay system, suggesting evolutionary conservation in Ca 2+ regulation across species.",

High-throughput studies showed interconnection between ATP8B1 and phosphoinositide (PIPs), but the mechanism linking ATP8B1, lipid metabolism, and inflammation remains unclear. Atp8b1 G308V/G308V mouse model, unbiased RNAseq, high-resolution-stimulation emission depltion (STED)-microscopy, and Crispr-Cas9 generated ATP8B1 −/− knockouts in hepatocytes/monocytes/macrophages were used to determine role of ATP8B1 in phosphatidylinositol,4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) trafficking and inflammation. Human ATP8B1, purified from Sf9 insect cells and reconstituted in proteoliposomes, was used to test cell-free PIP2 flip. Various in-vitro techniques were used for testing direct interaction between PIP2 and ATP8B1. ATP8B1 maintains PIP2 at the inner leaflet of plasma membrane (PM). ATP8B1 flips PIP2 in cells, without altering flip of PE or bulk-endocytosis. ATP8b1 flips PIP2 in a cell-free system. ATP8B1 deletion promotes bile-salt-mediated cholesterol extraction from hepatocytes in a PIP2-dependent manner. PIP2 directly binds to the P-loop of ATP8B1. Unbiased RNAseq showed upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in ATP8b1 −/− immune cells. ATP8B1 −/− monocytes/macrophages showed aberrant lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cleavage of GSDMD, formation of GSDMD pores, and interleukin-1beta (IL1β) release. Inflammation-resolving efferocytosis was impaired in ATP8B1 −/− macrophages. Biophysical properties of PM were altered in ATP8b1 −/− cells, with the mechanism being disrupted localization of PIP2. Atp8b1 G308V/G308V mice exposed to LPS showed higher plasma IL1β and lower survival rates vs. WT mice. ATP8B1 maintains PIP2 at the inner leaflet of PM. ATP8b1 directly flips and binds PIP2.

          "abstract": "Characterizing the conformational ensemble of biomolecular systems is key to understand their functions. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) captures two-dimensional snapshots of biomolecular ensembles, giving in principle access to thermodynamics. However, these images are very noisy and show projections of the molecule in unknown orientations, making it very difficult to identify the biomolecule’s conformation in each individual image. Here, we introduce cryo-EM simulation-based inference (cryoSBI) to infer the conformations of biomolecules and the uncertainties associated with the inference from individual cryo-EM images. CryoSBI builds on simulation-based inference, a merger of physics-based simulations and probabilistic deep learning, allowing us to use Bayesian inference even when likelihoods are too expensive to calculate. We begin with an ensemble of conformations, templates from experiments, and molecular modeling, serving as structural hypotheses. We train a neural network approximating the Bayesian posterior using simulated images from these templates and then use it to accurately infer the conformation of the biomolecule from each experimental image. Training is only done once on simulations, and after that, it takes just a few milliseconds to make inference on an image, making cryoSBI suitable for arbitrarily large datasets and direct analysis on micrographs. CryoSBI eliminates the need to estimate particle pose and imaging parameters, significantly enhancing the computational speed compared to explicit likelihood methods. Importantly, we obtain interpretable machine learning models by integrating physics-based approaches with deep neural networks, ensuring that our results are transparent and reliable. We illustrate and benchmark cryoSBI on synthetic data and showcase its promise on experimental single-particle cryo-EM data.",

These quinone antioxidants function as radical scavenging agents that prevent the propagation of lipid peroxidation and the induction of ferroptosis. Although several small-molecule inhibitors of FSP1 have been developed and found to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis, our understanding of their molecular mechanisms remains limited and no structures of FSP1 in complex with its inhibitors have been solved. Here, we solve the cocrystal structure of FSP1 in complex with the FSP1 inhibitor FSEN1, revealing that FSEN1 binds within the FSP1 substrate-binding pocket. FSEN1 makes key interactions with a critical phenylalanine, which is absent in mouse FSP1, providing an explanation for the selectivity of FSEN1 for human FSP1. These conclusions are supported by mutagenesis of FSP1 and biochemical and cellular assays of FSP1 function. Our findings provide the first cocrystal structure of FSP1 in complex with an inhibitor, enhancing our understanding of the mechanism of FSP1 inhibition and enabling future rational medicinal chemistry efforts to advance FSP1 inhibitors as therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (“wormhole”) connecting the two sides of an anti-de Sitter “eternal” black hole. Here, we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides an alternative perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length—an important problem in cryptography—as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with “gases of gates.” This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity theory to its first level.",

          "abstract": "Maintenance of pH within membranous organelles is crucial for cellular processes such as posttranslational modifications, ligand–receptor interactions, and proteostasis. The precise mechanisms that determine the luminal pH of each organelle are not fully understood. This study investigated the mechanisms that regulate luminal pH to ensure optimal enzymatic activity. We identified Oxr1 and its paralog Ncoa7, which regulate the vacuolar-type proton pump ATPase (V-ATPase) at the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network (TGN). Oxr1 and Ncoa7 were predominantly localized at the Golgi and TGN membranes, dependent on their binding to various GTP-bound Rab proteins. In vitro experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicated that Oxr1 and Ncoa7 directly bind to the catalytic subunit of V-ATPase, inhibiting its ATP hydrolytic activity via their TLDc domains. We observed significant acidification of the Golgi/TGN lumen in Oxr1- and Ncoa7-depleted cells. Lectin blot analysis demonstrated that depletion of Oxr1 and Ncoa7 led to a defect in protein glycosylation, a major enzymatic posttranslational modification in the Golgi and TGN. Furthermore, depletion of Oxr1 and Ncoa7, along with drug-induced inhibition of glycosylation, increased lysosomal pH and sensitivity to silicon dioxide-induced membrane damage. This apparent lysosomal dysfunction suggested that, in addition to the Golgi and TGN, Oxr1 and Ncoa7 also contribute to the integrity of other organelles. Our findings indicate that Oxr1 and Ncoa7 protect the Golgi and TGN lumen from excess acidification by inhibiting V-ATPase activity and providing an optimal environment for enzymatic activity in the Golgi and TGN.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell—functions that are inherently linked to their physical properties at different scales. A notable aspect of such membraneless organelles is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here, we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation of highly charged disordered proteins and polypeptides that span about two orders of magnitude in bulk viscosity. We find that their viscosity is highly correlated with protein translational diffusion and nano- to microsecond chain dynamics. Remarkably, analytical relations from polymer physics can predict condensate viscosity from diffusivity and chain dynamics, and vice versa, even for more hydrophobic disordered proteins and for synthetic polyelectrolytes, indicating a mechanistic link across several decades of length- and timescales. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction—a key quantity underlying these relations—reflect differences in interresidue contact lifetimes as a function of arginine content and salt concentration, leading to the vastly different dynamics among condensates. The rapid exchange of interresidue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.",

DMS is biologically produced in seawater and emitted into the atmosphere, where its oxidation products contribute to aerosol formation with consequences for cloud albedo and the Earth’s radiative budget and climate. Climate model projections of how DMS emissions change with global warming are largely uncertain, even contradictory. Here, we use machine-learning models trained with biome-resolved global observations to simulate seawater DMS concentrations (1850 to 2100) using physico-chemical and biological predictors from eight CMIP6 models. The scatter in current projections is largely reduced, and globally averaged seawater DMS concentrations are predicted to decrease in the coming decades. However, global DMS emissions will increase due to rising surface wind speeds and sea surface temperatures which contradicts the current AR6 assessment that the DMS flux will reduce in the future. Concurrence of increasing DMS emissions and declining anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions suggests an increase in the relative importance of DMS to sulfate aerosol formation and its climate cooling impact.",

Patients exhibit short stature, dysmorphic bones, and severe growth plate abnormalities, as well as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia, and reduced plasma PTH levels. Humanized PTH1R (hPTH1R) mice expressing the H223R-hPTH1R JMC mutation die early without breeding. We therefore generated and characterized a stable mouse line expressing the T410R-hPTH1R allele, which confers a milder disease phenotype in patients. Mutant mice show near-normal longevity and reproductive capacity yet exhibit a profound skeletal phenotype characteristic of the disease. The long bones of T410R mice are markedly misshapen and have expanded metaphyses with disarrayed chondrocyte zones in growth plates and reduced primary spongiosa. PET/CT scanning revealed diminished uptake of [ 18 F]-sodium fluoride in the growth plate area, consistent with reduced mineralization and vascularization. Genetic ablation of Hdac4 rescued the growth plate abnormalities in T410R mice, thereby establishing the PTH1R-Gαs-cAMP-PKA-SIK3-HDAC4/5 pathway as the main mediator of growth plate abnormalities in JMC. Serum calcium was elevated and endogenous PTH was suppressed in T410R mice, and both parameters could be normalized by acute injection of an optimized PTH inverse agonist peptide. The T410R mouse thus represents a stable animal model of JMC that recapitulates the abnormalities in skeletal development and mineral ion homeostasis which characterize this disease. The mice should help efforts to further define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the JMC phenotype and to develop a potential mode of therapy.",

Regnase-1 was identified as one of the frequently mutated genes in the inflamed colorectal epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis; however, its significance in intestinal epithelial cells during the tumorigenic process remains unknown. Therefore, we developed an Apc Min/+ mouse model lacking Regnase-1 in intestinal epithelia. Regnase-1 deletion significantly enhanced colon tumor growth accompanied by elevated levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in tumor tissues. Transcriptome analysis of the tumor tissues revealed that Nfkbiz , a mediator of the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, was the primary degradative target of Regnase-1 in enterocytes and that Regnase-1 deficiency enhanced IL-17 signaling. The treatment with antibiotics or IL-17-neutralizing antibody canceled the proliferative effect of colon tumors due to Regnase-1 deletion, suggesting the protective role of Regnase-1 against colon tumor growth was dependent on IL-17 signaling triggered by gut microbes. Analysis of the Nfkbiz knockout mouse model demonstrated that the tumor-suppressive effect of Regnase-1 depended on Nfkbiz expression. Remarkably, oral treatment of dimethyl fumarate, a potential inhibitor of Regnase-1 protein inactivation, suppressed tumor growth, downregulated Nfkbiz , and suppressed ERK activation. Furthermore, TCGA data analysis revealed that low Regnase-1 expression in colorectal cancer tissue was related to poor prognosis. Therefore, Regnase-1 represses colon tumor growth by regulating IL-17 signaling via Nfkbiz mRNA degradation. Regnase-1 could be a potential therapeutic target in colon tumors.",

Here, we demonstrate that XA21 is cleaved by the rhomboid-like protease OsRBL3b, likely within its transmembrane domain. OsRBL3b mRNA transcripts are preferentially expressed in rice spikelets. Rice plants expressing Xa21 but lacking a functional OsRBL3b displayed impaired anther dehiscence and pollen viability, resulting in male sterility and yield reduction with high levels of XA21 protein present in spikelets during anthesis. In leaves, osrbl3b mutants expressing XA21 had normal levels of this resistance protein and disease immunity. This balance between reproduction and disease resistance through the specific expression of a rhomboid protease may be key to limiting the detrimental effects of an active immune response and may be useful in future for genetic improvement of crops.",

How the geographic breadth of a sample impacts observations of rare, deleterious variants is unclear, even though such variants are of particular interest for biomedical and evolutionary applications. Here, in order to gain insight into the effects of sample design on ascertained genetic variants, we formulate a stochastic model of dispersal, genetic drift, selection, mutation, and geographically concentrated sampling. We use this model to understand the effects of the geographic breadth of sampling effort on the discovery of negatively selected variants. We find that samples which are more geographically broad will discover a greater number of variants as compared to geographically narrow samples (an effect we label “discovery”); though the variants will be detected at lower average frequency than in narrow samples (e.g., as singletons, an effect we label “dilution”). Importantly, these effects are amplified for larger sample sizes and fitness effects. We validate these results using both population genetic simulations and empirical analyses in the UK Biobank. Our results are particularly important in two contexts: the association of large-effect rare variants with particular phenotypes and the inference of negative selection from allele frequency data. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of considering geographic breadth when designing and carrying out genetic studies, especially at biobank scale.",

Understanding population-level diversity is also essential for tracking sources and revealing detailed pathways of transmission and spread. For bacteria, culturing, isolating, and sequencing the large number of individual colonies required to adequately sample diversity can be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. While sequencing directly from a mixed population will show variants among reads, they cannot be linked to reveal allele combinations associated with phylogenetic inheritance patterns. Here, we describe the theory and method for using population sequencing directly from a mixed sample, along with a minimal number of individually sequenced colonies, to describe the phylogenetic diversity of a population without haplotype reconstruction. To demonstrate the utility of population sequencing in capturing phylogenetic diversity, we compared isogenic clones to population sequences of Burkholderia pseudomallei from sputum of a single patient. Our results point to the pathogen population being highly structured, suggesting that for some pathogens, sputum sampling may preserve structuring in the lungs and thus present a noninvasive alternative to understanding colonization, movement, and pathogen/host interactions. We also analyzed population sequences of Staphylococcus aureus derived from different people and different body sites to reveal directionality of transmission between hosts and across body sites, demonstrating the power and utility for characterizing the spread of disease and identification of reservoirs at the finest levels. We anticipate that population sequencing and analysis can be broadly applied to accelerate research in a wide range of fields reliant on a foundational understanding of population phylogenetic diversity.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated calcium (Ca V ) channels are pivotal in cellular signaling due to their selective calcium ion permeation upon membrane depolarization. While previous studies have established the highly selective permeability of Ca V channels, the detailed molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we use extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanisms governing ion permeation and valence selectivity in Ca V 1 channels. Employing the electronic continuum correction method, we simulated a calcium conductance of approximately 9 to 11 pS, aligning closely with experimental measurement. Our simulations uncovered a three-ion knock-on mechanism critical for efficient calcium ion permeation, necessitating the binding of at least two calcium ions within the selectivity filter (SF) and the subsequent entry of a third ion. In silico mutation simulations further validated the importance of multi-ion coordination in the SF for efficient ion permeation, identifying two critical residues, D706 and E1101, that are essential for the binding of two calcium ions in the SF. Moreover, we explored the competitive permeation of calcium and sodium ions and obtained a valence selectivity favoring calcium over sodium at a ratio of approximately 35:1 under the bication condition. This selectivity arises from the strong electrostatic interactions of calcium ions in the confined SF and the three-ion knock-on mechanism. Our findings provide quantitative insights into the molecular underpinnings of Ca V channel function, with implications for understanding calcium-dependent cellular processes.",

This superior trait arises from global remolding of transcriptomes, including enhanced carbon metabolism, reduced intracellular NADPH synthesis rates, and increased triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis.

In this study, we used machine-learning potential molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the initial stage of polyhydride formation in calcium hydrides. Upon contact with high-pressure H 2 , the surface of CaH 2 melts, leading to CaH 4 formation. This surface melting proceeds via CaH 4 liquid phase as an intermediate state. High pressure reduces not only the hydrogenation (CaH 2 (s) + H 2 (l) ↔ CaH 4 (s)) enthalpy but also the enthalpy for liquid polyhydride formation (CaH 2 (s) + H 2 (l) ↔ CaH 4 (l)). Consequently, this surface melting process becomes more favorable than the fusion of the polyhydride bulk. Thus, high pressure not only shifts the equilibrium toward the polyhydride product but also lowers the activation energy, thereby promoting the hydrogenation reaction. From these thermodynamic insights, we propose structure-search criteria for polyhydride synthesis that are both computationally effective and experimentally relevant. These criteria are based on bulk properties, such as polyhydride (product) melting temperature and pressure-dependent hydrogenation enthalpy, readily determined through supplementary calculations during structure prediction workflows.",

While substantial progress has been made, current magnetic programming techniques are inherently tied to template-based and sequential fabrication processes. These processes limit scalability, precision, and programmability. Here, we present a template-free, integrative strategy that leverages interlayer stress-induced 3D shape morphing in xerogel-PDMS bilayer materials triggered by temperature variations. This process induces preprogrammed deformation and fixes the 3D structure via interlayer stress and solid–liquid phase transition. It is akin to an insect encased in amber, resulting in a soft machine with precisely tailored magnetic domains upon saturated magnetization. The approach eliminates the need for predesigned molds, which offers scalable, template-free programmable magnetization, reducing time and labor costs. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through reconfigurable mechanical behavior in kirigami metamaterial structures, information encryption, and multilegged millirobots. Moreover, by incorporating a nonmagnetic PDMS layer, laser-based engraving and ablation allow simultaneous control of interlayer stress and material properties. This facilitates precise regulation of stress-induced deformation and magnetically responsive regions with 20 μm resolution and over 1.8 T magnetization strength. This template-free 3D magnetization strategy significantly enhances design flexibility, machining precision, and mass production.

          "abstract": "In eukaryotic genomes, DNA is packaged into nucleosomes to form chromatin. The incorporation of canonical or variant histones into nucleosomes confers different properties and influences chromatin structure to regulate cellular processes, including recombination. During meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed and repaired as interhomolog crossovers. Nucleosome occupancy is generally associated with low crossover frequency, but it remains unclear which histone variants are involved in this process. In Arabidopsis , three variants of H2A coexist: H2A.X, H2A.Z, and H2A.W. Here, we show that H2A.W7 has a suppressive role on meiotic recombination. Genome-wide mapping of the crossover landscape revealed increased centromere-proximal recombination in h2a.w7 . Moreover, H2A.W7 can be recruited to the 3a crossover hotspot via 21-24-nucleotide siRNAs during RNA-directed DNA methylation, causing increased nucleosome occupancy and decreased crossover frequency. Cytological analysis reveals that H2A.W7 restricts heterochromatin clustering during meiosis, which can form a mechanism to limit interhomolog recombination. Conversely, the linker histone H1, of which its loading is known to be restricted by H2A.W, promotes heterochromatin clustering and crossover on a heterochromatic genetic interval. Our study reveals a role for H2A.W7 in repressing crossover formation in Arabidopsis .",

While the steady-state size of the nucleolus is quantitatively accounted for by the thermodynamics of phase separation, we show that experimental measurements of the assembly dynamics are inconsistent with a simple model of a phase-separating system relaxing to its equilibrium state. Instead, we show that the dynamics are well described by a model in which the transcription of ribosomal RNA actively drives nucleolar assembly. We find that our model of active transcription-templated assembly quantitatively accounts for the rapid kinetics observed in early embryos at different developmental stages, and for different RNA interference (RNAi) perturbations of embryo size. Our model predicts a scaling of the time to assembly with the volume of the nucleus to the one-third power, which is confirmed by experimental data.

          "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that add and lose tubulin dimers at their ends. Microtubule growth, shortening, and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryoelectron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to the straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intracluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to forming a straight microtubule lattice and accommodating new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is the key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.",

          "abstract": "T cells display the remarkable ability to detect single foreign peptides displayed on target cells, while ignoring highly abundant self-peptides. This selectivity has been explained by kinetic proofreading in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, which prevents responses to short-lived binding events regardless of their abundance. However, the biochemical mechanisms that drive kinetic proofreading have remained unclear. Here, using computational modeling, we show that these key signaling properties of the TCR pathway can emerge from the dynamics of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) phosphorylation, diffusion, and condensation following TCR–peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) binding. In this model, time delays in LAT condensate nucleation underlie kinetic proofreading, enabling selective signaling responses to high-affinity pMHC ligands. The cooperativity in the nucleation and growth of LAT condensates also provides a mechanism to amplify weak signals from single high-affinity peptides and for condensates to grow with increasing antigen numbers. In contrast to other models, condensate-nucleation proofreading predicts a dependence of signal strength on pMHC spacing at fixed number, a prediction we validated experimentally using a protein scaffold to present pMHCs at defined intervals. Our results suggest that nucleation-condensation proofreading underlies the remarkable antigen detection capabilities of the TCR signaling pathway.",

By creating a marine bacteria–mediated RNA interference approach, we show that myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), a critical immune adaptor for Toll-like receptor and interleukin pathways, is necessary for the stimulation of metamorphosis in response to bacteria. In addition to a developmental role, we show that MyD88 is necessary for survival during exposure to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , showing that Hydroides utilizes MyD88 during both development and an immune response.

          "abstract": "Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, and several key GA deactivation enzymes have been identified. In rice, non-13-hydroxylated GAs have been shown to be deactivated via 16α,17-epoxidation by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE (EUI/CYP714D1). Although 16,17-dihydro-16α,17-epoxyGA 4 (16α,17-epoxyGA 4 ), the product of EUI from bioactive GA 4 , has shown weak bioactivity on rice seedlings, how 16α,17-epoxyGAs are further deactivated remains elusive. Here, we identify the EUI2 gene, which regulates internode elongation in rice, using a map-based cloning strategy. EUI2 encodes an epoxide hydrolase that hydrolyzes 16α,17-epoxyGAs to 16,17-dihydro-16α,17-dihydroxyGAs. The eui2 mutants are taller than wild-type plants but are shorter than the eui mutants. However, the levels of known bioactive GAs in the uppermost internodes are not significantly increased in the eui2 mutants. Instead, we show that the eui2 mutants accumulate 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 to high levels. We also show that exogenously applied 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 is significantly active in elongating the uppermost internode, although not as potent as GA 4 . Furthermore, we demonstrate that 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 can directly interact with the rice GA receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1, in vitro. Taken together, the sequential action of EUI and EUI2 results in the stepwise deactivation of GAs during internode elongation in rice. Our data also suggest that the accumulation of a weakly active GA contributes to the mildly tall phenotype of the eui2 mutants.",

The very end of the Heinrich stadial (HS) characterizing Termination IV (T-IV, ca. 343 to 333 ka ago) shows a 250-y-long jump in greenhouse gas concentrations, followed by a 1.3 ka gradual decline back to the initial concentration. During this so-called overshoot, CO 2 and CH 4 reach their highest levels (about 303 ppm and 800 ppb, respectively) over the past 800 ka prior to industrialization. The jump in CO 2 is not accompanied by a change in δ 13 C–CO 2, suggesting that multiple mechanisms contributed to the exceptionally elevated CO 2 values. Following the jump, a slow 0.2‰ enrichment in δ 13 C–CO 2 occurs. We propose that during the jump, the sudden resumption of deepwater formation in the North Atlantic (NA) triggered an amplified release of CO 2 from the Southern Ocean (SO) by a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the SO westerlies, potentially in combination with a rapid land carbon release. The latter is expected from temporally enhanced wildfire activity related to higher fuel load and regionally changing weather conditions in connection to the ITCZ shift. A combination of marine proxy records and box model simulation suggests that the δ 13 C–CO 2 decrease expected from these processes is compensated by a net temperature increase in global sea surface temperature (SST) at the time of the AMOC resumption.",

However, the environmental cues that activate EnvZ/OmpR to trigger pathogenicity have remained unclear, limiting our understanding of host–pathogen interactions. Here, we demonstrate that in Vibrio parahaemolyticus , a major etiological agent of seafood-associated gastroenteritis, EnvZ functions as a direct ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) sensor governing virulence programs. Fe 3+ -EnvZ interaction triggers kinase phosphorylation and activation, enabling transcriptional control of biofilm formation, swarming motility, and type 3/6 secretion systems. An iron-binding-deficient EnvZ mutant (EnvZ Q103A ) abrogated Fe 3+ responsiveness and downstream signaling pathways. In an infant rabbit infection model, Fe 3+ enhanced V. parahaemolyticus intestinal colonization and virulence through EnvZ/OmpR signaling.

Due to a worldwide rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), phages have been proposed as a promising alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacterial infections. Up to this point in history, phage use in preclinical animal studies, clinical trials, and emergency-use compassionate care cases has centered around the original observation from 1915 showing phage as lytic agent, and thus a treatment that kills bacteria. Here, we describe an activity associated with phage therapy that extends beyond lytic activity that results in long-term protection against reinfection. This activity is potent, providing almost complete protection against a second lethal infection for animals treated with phage therapy. The activity also reduced infection burden an astounding billion-fold over the control. Reinfection protection requires phage lytic killing of its target bacterium but is independent of additional phage therapy. The effect is not driven by phage alone, lingering phage resistors, or a sublethal inoculum. In vitro phage-lysed bacteria provide partial protection, suggesting a combination of phage-induced lytic activity and immune stimulation by phage treatment is responsible for the effect.

A mouse model of the E427K variant has a normal circadian period under constant darkness but displays altered phase shifts in response to light in the subjective night at circadian time (CT) 16 and CT22.

Close membrane-to-membrane contact (≤13 nm) has been proposed as a key mechanism of TcE function. To investigate this and identify potential additional mechanisms, we compared four immunoglobulin G1-based (IgG1) TcE Formats (A–D) targeting CD3ε and Her2, designed to create varying intermembrane distances (A &lt; B &lt; C &lt; D). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and modeling of the conformational states of isolated TcEs and TcE–antigen complexes predicted close contacts (≤13 nm) for Formats A and B and far contacts (≥18 nm) for Formats C and D. In supported lipid bilayer (SLB) model interfaces, Formats A and B recruited, whereas Formats C and D repelled, CD2–CD58 interactions. Formats A and B also excluded bulky Quantum dots more effectively. SAXS also revealed that TcE–antigen complexes formed by Formats A and C were less flexible than complexes formed by Formats B and D. Functional data with Her2-expressing tumor cells showed cytotoxicity, surface marker expression, and cytokine release following the order A &gt; B = C &gt; D. In a minimal system for IS formation on SLBs, TcE performance followed the trend A = B = C &gt; D. Addition of close contact requiring CD58 costimulation revealed phospholipase C-γ activation matching cytotoxicity with A &gt; B = C &gt; D. Our findings suggest that when adhesion is equivalent, TcE potency is determined by two parameters: contact distance and flexibility. Both the close/far-contact formation axis and the low/high flexibility axis significantly impact TcE potency, explaining the similar potency of Format B (close contact/high flexibility) and C (far contact/low flexibility).",

Here, a uniquely comprehensive geochronological and geochemical dataset shows that partial melting of metaigneous rocks in the eastern Himalaya produced peraluminous leucogranites—these supposed S-type leucogranites have I-type (igneous) sources. Inherited magmatic zircons from leucogranites and metaigneous rocks have indistinguishable ages, trace element compositions, and Hf isotope compositions, distinct from zircons in metasedimentary rocks. Experimentally, partial melting of metagranitic rocks rather than metapelites predicts alkali major element chemistry of these leucogranites better. High δ 18 O, high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and low ε Nd (t) for Himalayan leucogranites have been used to argue for a metasedimentary rock source, but overlapping values occur in metaigneous rocks. Although sediment-sourced leucogranites also occur, igneous-sourced leucogranites are likely common in large hot orogens. A survey of leucogranite geochemistry across the Himalaya suggests that ~20% might be I-type, with no apparent spatial or temporal bias. I-type leucogranites appear to be rare-metal poor, however. Unlike prior assertions that I-type granites represent juvenile additions to orogens, metaigneous-sourced Himalayan granites more likely represent crustal reworking.",

          "abstract": "Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule, can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study decoherence in a sequence of analogous organic molecules of increasing size and find, surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down decoherence and prolongs charge migration. To elucidate this observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from individual vibrational modes and show that: 1) The initial decay of electronic coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces. 2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing position separation in the low-frequency modes. 3) In agreement with another study, we observe that only normal modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a combination of increased hole-mixing and the disappearance of decoherence contributions from specific vibrational modes—CO stretching in butynal and various H rockings in pentynal.",

          "abstract": "Recent approvals of polymeric adenosine diphosphate ribose (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for BRCA-mutant metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer necessitate an understanding of the factors that shape sensitivity and resistance. Reversion mutations that restore homologous recombination (HR) repair are detected in ~50 to 80% of BRCA-mutant patients who respond but subsequently relapse, but there is currently little insight into why only ~50% of BRCA-mutant patients display upfront resistance. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genomic determinants of PARPi resistance in murine Brca2 Δ/Δ prostate organoids genetically engineered in a manner that precludes the development of reversion mutations. Remarkably, we recovered multiple independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting three different members ( Cdt1, Cdc6, and Dbf4 ) of the DNA prereplication complex (pre-RC), each of which independently conferred resistance to olaparib and the next-generation PARP-1 selective inhibitor AZD5305. Moreover, sensitivity to PARP inhibition was restored in Brca2 Δ/Δ , Cdc6-depleted prostate cells by knockdown of geminin, a negative regulator of Cdt1, further implicating the critical role of a functional pre-RC complex in PARPi sensitivity. Furthermore, ~50% of CRPC tumors have copy number loss of pre-RC complex genes, particularly CDT1 . Mechanistically, prostate cells with impaired pre-RC activity displayed rapid resolution of olaparib-induced DNA damage as well as protection from replication fork degradation caused by Brca2 loss, providing insight into how Brca2-mutant cancer cells can escape cell death from replication stress induced by PARP inhibition in the absence of HR repair. Of note, a pharmacologic inhibitor that targets the CDT1/geminin complex (AF615) restored sensitivity to AZD5305, providing a potential translational avenue to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition.",

Here, we show that pallidocortical neurons project to diverse motor and nonmotor cortical regions, are organized topographically in the GPe, and segregate into at least two distinct electrophysiological and molecular phenotypes. In addition, we find that the GPe receives direct synaptic input from deep layers of diverse motor and nonmotor cortical regions, some of which form reciprocal connections onto pallidocortical neurons.

Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons. It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in naïve and inflamed rats. We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (Na V ) 1.8 and 1.7 via the local anesthetic binding site. The Na V 1.8 and 1.7 inhibition was specific for AM404 and not observed with other metabolites of paracetamol. Our findings suggest that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is mediated mainly by direct AM404-induced inhibition of nociceptive sodium channels at the peripheral nociceptor neurons.

Surprisingly, although the expression of synaptic scaling and IHP was dependent on overlapping signaling pathways, they could be independently recruited by manipulating spiking activity or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, respectively. Further, we found that changes in visual experience that affect NMDAR activation but not mean firing selectively trigger IHP, without recruiting synaptic scaling.

Expression of iron-stress genes in metatranscriptomes, and evidence for colimitation of ecosystem productivity by iron and nitrogen, indicates that enhanced iron supply should spur spring phytoplankton blooms, accelerating the seasonal drawdown of nitrate delivered by winter mixing. This effect is consistent with regional trends in satellite ocean color, which show a shorter, more intense spring bloom period, followed by an earlier arrival of oligotrophic conditions in summer. Continued iron emissions may contribute to poleward shifts in transitional marine ecosystems, compounding the anticipated impacts from ocean warming and stratification.",

Exploring tessellation at the molecular scale is pivotal for gaining profound insights into the effects of tessellation on materials and elucidating the essential design principles for supramolecular tessellation. In this study, we develop a dynamic fullerene host ( 1 ) with three consecutive heptagons, which promotes diverse supramolecular tessellation via hierarchical assembly. In the solid state, molecule 1 arranges itself into a layered square-shaped tessellation in the crystal superstructure. Interestingly, the co-crystal structures of 1 with C 60 and C 70 exhibit highly ordered triangular and rhombic tessellation patterns, respectively, due to the adaptive regulation of heptagons with different curved guests, demonstrating the first series of layered tessellated framework in supramolecular fullerene chemistry.

We performed a Bayesian genome-wide association study and selection analyses in this naturally occurring canine model to elucidate underlying genetic risk factors for gastric cancer and identified 15 associated loci. Variant filtering revealed germline putative regulatory variants for the EPAS1 ( HIF2A ) and PTEN genes and a coding variant in CD101 . Two loci are overrepresented among cases of intestinal tumor subtype. Although closely related to Tervuren and Sheepdogs, Belgian Malinois rarely develop gastric cancer.

Among Tervuren and Sheepdogs, HDAC2 putative regulatory variants were present at comparatively high frequency and were associated with risk of gastric cancer.

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism distinguished by its dependence on iron-mediated lipid oxidation. Cancer cells highly resistant to conventional therapies often demonstrate lipid metabolic and redox vulnerabilities that sensitize them to cell death by ferroptosis. These include a unique dependency on the lipid antioxidant selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), that acts as a ferroptosis inhibitor. Synthetic high-density lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (HDL NP) targets the high-affinity HDL receptor scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) and regulates cell and cell membrane lipid metabolism. Recently, we reported that targeting cancer cell SR-B1 with HDL NP depleted cell GPx4, which is accompanied by increased cell membrane lipid peroxidation and cancer cell death. These data suggest that HDL NP may induce ferroptosis. Thus, we conducted an unbiased CRISPR-based positive selection screen and target validation studies in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cell lines to ascertain the mechanism through which HDL NP regulates GPx4 and kills cancer cells. The screen revealed two genes, acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), whose loss conferred resistance to HDL NP. Validation of ACSL4 supports that HDL NP induces ferroptosis as the predominant mechanism of cell death, while validation of TXNRD1 revealed that HDL NP reduces cellular selenium and selenoprotein production, most notably, GPx4. Accordingly, we define cancer cell metabolic targets that can be simultaneously actuated by a multifunctional, synthetic HDL NP ligand of SR-B1 to kill cancer cells by ferroptosis.",

          "abstract": "Biomass burning can affect climate via the emission of aerosols and their subsequent impact on radiation, cloud microphysics, and surface and atmospheric albedo. Biomass burning emissions (BBEs) over the boreal region have strongly increased during the last decade and are expected to continue increasing as the climate warms. Climate models simulate aerosol processes, yet historical and future Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) simulations have no active fire component, and BBEs are prescribed as external forcings. Here, we show that CMIP6 used future boreal BBEs scenarios with unrealistic near-zero trends that have a large impact on climate trends. By running sensitivity experiments with ramped up boreal emissions based on observed trends, we find that increasing boreal BBEs reduces global warming by 12% and Arctic warming by 38%, reducing the loss of sea ice. Tropical precipitation shifts southward as a result of the hemispheric difference in boreal aerosol forcing and subsequent temperature response. These changes stem from the impact of aerosols on clouds, increasing cloud droplet number concentration, cloud optical depth, and low cloud cover, ultimately reducing surface shortwave flux over northern latitudes. Our results highlight the importance of realistic boreal BBEs in climate model simulations and the need for improved understanding of boreal emission trends and aerosol–climate interactions.",

          "abstract": "Historically, endocrine cells were perceived to coordinate their output in a uniform manner. Recently however, single-cell technologies have uncovered heterogeneity within these populations, indicating that individual cells may operate as independently regulated units. Using high-resolution tools such as single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (sm-FISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we investigated the contributions of individual and the collective of fetal Leydig cells to androgen production over time during mouse testis development. Temporal profiles of intratesticular androgens alongside the expression of steroidogenic pathway genes ( Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd3b1 ) from prenatal to perinatal testes demonstrated that the peak in gene expression preceded the peak in androgen production. Spatially, steroidogenic cells were initially observed to be concentrated toward the anterior–posterior poles along the center of the dorsal–ventral axis of the fetal testis at embryonic day (E) 13 and then expanded to a uniform distribution by E16. Next, sm-FISH using probes for individual steroidogenic pathway genes exposed the following findings: gene transcription and processing of individual and combinations of steroidogenic pathway genes are not synchronized among fetal Leydig cells; and some fetal Leydig cells express incomplete sets of genes. Further, sm-FISH and scRNA-seq data corroborated the presence of fetal Leydig and other interstitial cell types harboring incomplete sets of steroidogenic pathway genes throughout developmental stages. Taken together, these findings highlight that fetal steroidogenic gene expression is tightly regulated and that transcript presence among interstitial cell types promotes the possibility that optimal androgen biosynthesis results from a cooperative effort among neighboring steroidogenic cells.",

          "abstract": "The protein α-syn adopts a wide variety of conformations including an intrinsically disordered monomeric form and an α-helical-rich membrane-associated form that is thought to play an important role in cellular membrane processes. However, despite the high affinity of α-syn for membranes, evidence that the α-helical form is adopted inside cells has been indirect. DNP-assisted solid-state NMR on frozen cellular samples can report directly on the entire conformational ensemble. By controlling the distribution of the DNP agent throughout the cellular biomass, such experiments can provide quantitative information upon the entire structural ensemble or provide information about spatially resolved subpopulations. When the polarization agent is dispersed homogeneously throughout the cell, a minority of the α-syn inside HEK293 cells adopts a highly α-helical-rich conformation. When the polarization agent is peripherally localized, the α-helical-rich conformation predominates, indicating that it is preferentially adopted near the cellular periphery. This demonstrates how selectively altering the spatial distribution of the DNP agent can be a powerful tool to observe spatially distinct structural ensembles. This approach paves the way for more nuanced investigations into the conformations that proteins adopt in different areas of the cell.",

          "abstract": "The Earth system model CLIMBER-2 has been used in past work to successfully reproduce the glacial/interglacial cycles of the Plio–Pleistocene and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) from predominantly 40 to 100 ky timescale oscillatory behavior as a function of declining volcanic outgassing and regolith removal. In this study, we further examine the sensitivity of this previous work to varying prescribed levels of volcanic outgassing and regolith extent and the long-term dynamics of the global carbon cycle, affecting the exchange and partitioning of carbon between different Earth system reservoirs and therefore global atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. As volcanic outgassing decreases, CO 2 and land carbon storage decrease, while ocean carbon storage, including CaCO 3 sediment, increases. At volcanic outgassing levels below a threshold value of roughly 5.7 Tmol C yr −1 , sea level decreases due to land ice formation, leading to increased carbon accumulation in the ocean and decreased carbon in the CaCO 3 sediment reservoir. Our previous finding of strong hysteresis and path dependence in the glacial/interglacial alternation history [J. Carrillo et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2322926121 (2024)] appears to be a tenuous climate feature, dependent on the precise representation of carbon cycle processes and, specifically, the numerical precision used in the calculation of certain key state variables in the model’s carbon cycle.",

          "abstract": "What is the neural substrate that enables the cerebral cortex to control a single mystacial vibrissa and orchestrate its movement? To answer this question, we injected rabies virus into the intrinsic muscle that protracts the rat C3 vibrissa and used retrograde transneuronal transport to identify the cortical neurons that influence the muscle. A surprisingly diverse set of cortical areas is the origin of disynaptic control over the motoneurons that influence the C3 protractor. More than two thirds of these layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) are dispersed in frontal and parietal areas outside the primary motor cortex (vM1). This observation emphasizes the importance of descending motor commands from non-primary motor areas. More than a third of the L5PNs originate from somatosensory areas, such as the barrel field (vS1). The barrel field has been long considered a prototypic model system for studying sensory processing at the level of the cerebral cortex. Even so, we find that the number of L5PNs in vS1, and even their peak density, rivals the number and peak density of L5PNs in vM1. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of the barrel field in processing motor output. The distribution of L5PNs in vM1 and vS1 leads us to propose a model of vibrissa protraction in which vM1 output results in protraction, and vS1 output results in reciprocal inhibition (suppression) of protraction. This paired initiation and suppression of complementary movements may be a general feature of the descending output from the rodent M1 and S1.",

          "abstract": "Ethanol rapidly stimulates the liver to synthesize the hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which then acts on the brain to elicit a multifaceted protective response. We show that in mice, this induction of FGF21 occurs at the level of gene transcription and is regulated by two byproducts of ethanol metabolism, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and acetyl-CoA. Using cell-based reporter and thermal shift binding assays, we show that G3P binds to a conserved domain and activates the transcription factor carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), which regulates the Fgf21 gene promoter. The stimulation of Fgf21 gene transcription by ethanol also requires its metabolism to acetyl-CoA and correlates with histone acetylation. Accordingly, a p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase inhibitor blocks histone acetylation, ChREBP recruitment, and transcriptional activation at the Fgf21 promoter. Together, these findings reveal a dual regulatory mechanism driven by both G3P and acetyl-CoA that explains ethanol’s robust stimulatory effect on Fgf21 and possibly other ChREBP target genes in the liver.",

          "abstract": "Many remarkable phenotypes have repeatedly occurred across vast evolutionary distances. When convergent traits emerge on the tree of life, they are sometimes driven by the same underlying gene families, while other times, many different gene families are involved. Conversely, a gene family may be repeatedly recruited for a single trait or many different traits. To understand the general rules governing convergence at both genomic and phenotypic levels, we systematically tested associations between 56 binary metabolic traits and gene count in 14,785 gene families from 993 Saccharomycotina yeasts. Using a recently developed phylogenetic approach that reduces spurious correlations, we found that gene family expansion and contraction were significantly linked to trait gain and loss in 45/56 (80%) traits. While 595/739 (81%) significant gene families were associated with only one trait, we also identified several “keystone” gene families that were significantly associated with up to 13/56 (23%) of all traits. Strikingly, most of these families are known to encode metabolic enzymes and transporters, including all members of the industrially relevant MAL tose fermentation loci in the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These results indicate that convergent evolution on the gene family level may be more widespread across deeper timescales than previously believed.",

By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation.

          "abstract": "Diapause is a common seasonal adaptive strategy that regulates annual timing in insects. Very few causal loci underlying diapause variation have yet been identified. By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years. Our study proposes a model that explains how adaptive phenotypes can evolve rapidly without affecting related essential functions.",

However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, thereby ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.",

We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution ( VaPAP1 for loss of mottled black and VaANR1 for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication.",

Bacteriophage resistance integron cassettes (BRiCs) can be combined and mixed with resistance cassettes to produce multiphage or drug and phage resistance. The fitness costs of BRiCs are variable and dependent on the genetic context and can be modulated by changing the order of cassettes in the array.

Approximately 30% of ncHLAp exhibited cancer-restricted translation, and a substantial subset were shared among patients. Cancer-restricted ncHLAp displayed robust immunogenic potential in a sensitive ex vivo T cell priming platform. ncHLAp-reactive, T cell receptor–redirected T cells exhibited tumoricidal activity against patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids.

          "abstract": "Influenza viruses replicate and transcribe their genome in the context of a conserved ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. By integrating cryo–electron microscopy single-particle analysis and cryo–electron tomography, we define the influenza RNP as a right-handed, antiparallel double helix with the viral RNA encapsidated in the minor groove. Individual nucleoprotein subunits are connected by a flexible tail loop that inserts into a conserved pocket in its neighbor. We visualize the viral polymerase in RNP at different functional states, revealing how it accesses the RNA template while maintaining the double-helical architecture of RNP by strand sliding. Targeting the tail loop binding interface, we identify lead compounds as potential anti-influenza inhibitors. These findings elucidate the molecular determinants underpinning influenza virus replication and highlight a promising target for antiviral development.",

We designed a method to aid the crystallization process by generating well-defined three-dimensional (3D) laminar airflow over square meter–sized perovskite films using a customized 3D-printed structure. The resultant perovskite solar modules with areas of 0.7906 square meters had a certified power conversion efficiency of 15.0% and achieved compliance with three sets of solar cell standards. Our metrics for a 1-year operational study from a 0.5–megawatt peak power perovskite solar farm indicate a 29% higher energy yield per kilowatt of installed capacity compared with that of silicon modules at the same facility that primarily resulted from their temperature-dependent operational characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Microscopy and genomics are used to characterize cell function, but approaches to connect the two types of information are lacking, particularly at subnuclear resolution. Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and superresolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. Applying ExIGS to progeria-derived fibroblasts revealed that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant chromatin regulation that may erode cell identity. Lamin was found to generally repress transcription, suggesting variation in nuclear morphology may affect gene regulation across tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform to link nuclear abnormalities to gene regulation, offering insights into disease mechanisms.",

Depletion in the copy number of the plasmid-encoded virulence gene pla occurred in later-dated strains of the first and second pandemics, yet the biological relevance of the pla deletion has been difficult to test. We identified modern Y. pestis strains that independently acquired the same pla depletion as ancient strains and herein show that excision of pla from the multicopy pPCP1 plasmid is accompanied by the integration of a separate full pPCP1 harboring pla into the single-copy pCD1 plasmid, reducing pla dosage. Moreover, we demonstrate that this depletion decreases the mortality of mice in models of bubonic plague but not in the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the disease. We hypothesize that pla depletion may have been selectively advantageous in bubonic plague, owing to rodent fragmentation after pandemic-induced mortality.",

We hypothesized that principles governing the emergence of emotion from sensation might be discoverable through their conservation across the mammalian lineage. We therefore designed a cross-species neural activity screen, applicable to humans and mice, combining precise affective behavioral measurements, clinical medication administration, and brain-wide intracranial electrophysiology. This screen revealed conserved biphasic dynamics in which emotionally salient sensory signals are swiftly broadcast throughout the brain and followed by a characteristic persistent activity pattern. Medication-based interventions that selectively blocked persistent dynamics while preserving fast broadcast selectively inhibited emotional responses in humans and mice. Mammalian emotion appears to emerge as a specifically distributed neural context, driven by persistent dynamics and shaped by a global intrinsic timescale.",

In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band, which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor and also distinguish a chiral from a nonchiral Δ k through enhanced s-wave proximity. In this study, we used s-wave superconductive scan tips and detected intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe 2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging revealed subgap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a -axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity signifies that Δ k of UTe 2 is a nonchiral state: B 1 u , B 2 u , or B 3 u . However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a axis is internodal, then a nonchiral B 3 u state is the most consistent for UTe 2 .",

We found that the shifts in cell morphology that shape tissues could concomitantly act as conserved instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct core identity decisions underpinning tissue building. We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly.",

Using eight glacier models, we simulated global glacier evolution over multicentennial timescales, allowing glaciers to equilibrate with climate under various constant global temperature scenarios. We estimate that glaciers globally will lose 39 (range, 15 to 55)% of their mass relative to 2020, corresponding to a global mean sea-level rise of 113 (range, 43 to 204) mm even if temperatures stabilized at present-day conditions. Under the +1.5°C Paris Agreement goal, more than twice as much global glacier mass remains at equilibration (53% versus 24%) compared with the warming level resulting from current policies (+2.7°C by 2100 above preindustrial). Our findings stress the need for stringent mitigation policies to ensure the long-term preservation of glaciers.",

However, the timing and tempo of the LOME remain uncertain, which hinders our understanding of the feedback between the LOME and paleoclimatic change. Here, we present high-precision radioisotopic dates for the Ordovician-Silurian transition in South China that reveal the LOME began at 442.76 + 0.35/−0.22 million years ago, with the two phases lasting for 0.34 + 0.46/−0.34 and 0.06 + 0.31/−0.06 million years, respectively. The rapid switch from icehouse to greenhouse conditions, along with the higher mean rate of temperature change during LOME II, resulted in a much higher mean extinction rate during LOME II than I (71.6% versus 8.4% species loss per 100 thousand years, respectively), implying that the rate of climate change was a primary control on the tempo of the LOME.",

          "abstract": "Davemaoite (CaSiO 3 perovskite) is an essential mineral in Earth’s lower mantle, thought to be solidified directly from an early magma ocean. Despite its abundance, the impact of defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, on davemaoite’s properties under mantle conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we use machine learning molecular dynamic simulations to examine the behavior of oxygen-deficient davemaoite structures under high pressures and temperatures. Our simulations reveal its superionic transition driven by oxygen’s diffusion, enhancing electrical conductivities. Our predicted phase diagrams demonstrate that higher oxygen vacancy concentrations expand the superionic phase region. This superionic behavior implies that defective davemaoite could play a critical role in early mantle oxidation and deep-Earth oxygen cycling, providing a potential major source of mobile oxygen in the deep mantle. These findings offer fresh insights into the geodynamic processes in Earth’s early mantle and suggest that oxygen-deficient davemaoite could primarily contribute to the electrical conductivity and oxidation state of the deep lower mantle.",

Nevertheless, drug resistance to existing therapeutics is a serious and immediate concern. Using structure-based and scaffold-hopping approaches, we designed evolved diarylpyrimidine analogs targeting reverse transcriptase (RT), exploiting chemical space surrounding the NNRTI-binding pocket. We identified compounds 5i3 and 5e2 , with robust antiviral efficacy against wild-type HIV-1 and rilpivirine-resistant strains. Encouragingly, in vitro selection of mutant strains with 5i3 took 39 passages to select resistance, with no phenotypic cross-resistance observed with known RT drugs. Co-crystal structures of wild-type and mutant RT with 5i3 and 5e2 revealed their resilience toward resistance mutations due to enhanced conformational flexibility and positional adaptability. 5i3 exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties and favorable safety profiles, without substantial cytochrome P450 inhibition, and excellent oral bioavailability. These derivatives represent a promising scaffold for the development of anti-HIV drugs.",

          "abstract": "Secondary eggshell units, though rarely observed in modern avian eggshells, are marked structures in non-avian dinosaur eggshells that offer valuable paleobiological insights. Despite their significance, the origins of secondary eggshell units remain understudied, leading to debates in paleontology, including the hypothesis of an abiogenic origin for these structures. Here, we demonstrate that secondary eggshell units in non-avian dinosaur eggshells are biogenic in nature, based on analyses using advanced microscopic techniques. The structural characteristics of these units suggest a formation mechanism similar to that of turtle and crocodile eggshells, with matrix fibers likely initiating their development. Furthermore, a diminishing presence of secondary eggshell units in non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs points to the evolution of a more refined physiological process for eggshell formation in this lineage. These findings shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of eggshell biomineralization in dinosaurs and their close relatives.",

We found that normal and high-fat diet–fed L cell–specific Piezo1 knockout ( IntL-Piezo1 −/− ) mice exhibited reduced circulating GLP-1 levels, increased hepatic lipid accumulation, decreased β-catenin expression, and elevated lipogenesis-related genes and proteins, including SREBP1c, PPARγ, FASN, and ACC. Treatment with exendin-4 improved fatty liver in IntL-Piezo1 −/− mice by stimulating β-catenin and inhibiting de novo lipogenesis. Intestinal bead implantation stimulated GLP-1 release and inhibited lipid synthesis in livers of diet-induced obese mice but not in IntL-Piezo1 −/− mice. In primary hepatocytes derived from IntL-Piezo1 −/− mice, lipid accumulation and enhanced fatty acid synthesis were associated with reduced β-catenin expression and impaired nuclear translocation. Exendin-4 treatment alleviated lipid accumulation, which was blocked by the β-catenin inhibitor nitazoxanide. L-cell mechanoreception is vital for regulating hepatic lipid metabolism through GLP-1.",

However, common signals must be extracted from geographically sparse records. Here, by applying low-frequency component analysis (LFCA) to tide gauge records and surface climate reconstructions, we isolate three coherent modes of Pacific Ocean variability that we ascribe to: a secular, greenhouse gas–driven climate change (LFC1); a nonlinear mode of variability with a reversal around 1980, potentially linked to aerosols (LFC2); and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (LFC3). Although sea level trend patterns reflect the superimposed contribution of all modes, satellite-era trends are dominated by an increasing phase of LFC2: They are thus potentially unrepresentative of both longer-term historical patterns and those expected in the future.",

          "abstract": "In spring, global warming exhibits prominent zonal asymmetry at continental scales, with Eurasia warming three times faster than North America during 1979–2021. Meanwhile, snow loss is also highly asymmetric. These changes are critical for regional agriculture and water management, yet the roles of specific forcings behind them remain unclear. Based on hierarchical large-ensemble climate model simulations, ~32 ± 28% of the surface air temperature (SAT) asymmetric trend and 16 ± 13% of the snow cover asymmetric trend between Eurasia and North America are attributable to tropical Pacific variability. Single-forcing experiments reveal that anthropogenic aerosols can induce a comparable asymmetry, accounting for 34 ± 23% (24 ± 17%) of observed SAT (snow cover) asymmetric trends. However, their effects are largely masked by the greenhouse gas forcing. As anthropogenic aerosol emissions are expected to decline, the current warming asymmetry may reverse in the future.",

          "abstract": "Deciphering the structure-property relationship between cluster stacking and high-efficiency luminescence of metal nanoclusters is crucial for designing and synthesizing high-performance light-emitting materials and devices. Here, we successfully synthesized two polymorphic gold nanoclusters (Au 8 -C and Au 8 -P) and investigated their stacking-dependent piezoluminescence based on hydrostatic pressure. Under compression, Au 8 -C exhibits notable piezoluminescence enhancement. However, Au 8 -P presents monotonic piezoluminescence quenching. High-pressure structural characterizations confirm the existence of stacking-dependent anisotropic compression in Au 8 -C and Au 8 -P. Under high pressure, the columnar-stacked Au 8 -C shrinks faster along the a axis, increasing the aspect ratio (AR) of the fusiform Au 8 core. However, the layered Au 8 -P is compressed faster along the c axis, reducing the AR and leading to a flatter Au 8 core. High-pressure femtosecond transient absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence, and Raman spectra collaboratively confirm that differentiated anisotropic compression notably suppresses nonradiative loss caused by low-frequency vibrations of the Au 8 core, which is responsible for the piezoluminescence enhancement in Au 8 -C.",

Decades of evidence from surgical and endoscopic procedures bypassing the duodenum underscore the duodenum’s critical role in regulating glycemia and body weight. Although metabolic surgeries and endoscopic procedures are effective, their invasiveness, cost, and scalability limit patient access. We developed an orally administered mucin complexing polymeric (MCP) drug, designed to replicate duodenal exclusion physiology. MCPs, intended to have electrostatic and covalent cross-linkages with mucin glycoproteins, form extended network structures with resulting alteration of mucus barrier properties. Selective targeting of the duodenum is achieved via pH-based activation chemistry. Following screening for physiochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy, GLY-200 emerged as the lead drug candidate replicating duodenal exclusion physiology with improved glycemia, reduced body weight, and modulation of gut hormones in rodent models. This targeted oral therapy holds promise for treatment of T2D and obesity by mimicking duodenal exclusion without the invasiveness of surgery or endoscopic procedures.",

TAC-C reveals a strong association between chromatin interaction frequency and gene expression, particularly emphasizing the conserved roles of chromatin interaction hub anchors and hub genes across crop species. Integrating chromatin structure with population genetics data highlights that chromatin loops connect distal regulatory elements to phenotypic variation. In addition, asymmetrical open chromatin interactions among subgenomes, driven by transposon insertions and sequence variations, contribute to biased homoeolog expression. Furthermore, TaSPL7/15 regulate photosynthesis-related genes through chromatin interactions, with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and starch content in Taspl7&amp;15 mutant.

The carrier dynamics were characterized by ultrafast measurement, thus verifying the mechanism of response amplification. By analyzing multiplication with different trap states energy levels under charge injection, it is shown that dopants have a wide selection space, providing a feasible path for high-performance narrowband photodetectors.

Its synergy with topology may yield an exotic topological phase unique to a certain magnetic order, termed antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs). A hallmark signature of AF TIs is the presence of a single surface Dirac cone—a feature typically associated with strong three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators but lacking direct observation. Here, we theoretically and experimentally discover a 3D photonic AF TI protected by the combined symmetry of time reversal and half-lattice translation. By measuring both bulk and surface states, we directly observe the symmetry-protected single-Dirac-cone surface states and their remarkable robustness against random magnetic disorders.

However, the central tenet of this hypothesis, that PN runs forward simulations to predict future states, remains untested. In this preregistered study, we first show that PN abstractly represents whether two objects are in contact with each other, a physical scene property critical for prediction (because objects’ fates are intertwined when they are in contact). We then show that PN (but not other visual areas) carries abstract information about predicted future contact events (i.e., collisions).

Clr4 is the sole known methyltransferase catalyzing H3K9 methylation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Clr4 K455/K472 automethylation and H3K14 ubiquitination (H3K14Ub) are vital activators of Clr4, ensuring appropriate heterochromatin deposition and preventing deleterious silencing. While automethylation’s activation mechanism is uncovered, the mechanism of H3K14Ub’s significantly stronger stimulation on Clr4 remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Clr4 bound to ubiquitinated and unmodified H3 peptides at 2.60 and 2.39 angstrom, which revealed a synergistic mechanism underlying the pronounced stimulatory effect: H3K14Ub increases substrate affinity through multivalent interactions and facilitates the allosteric transition of Clr4 from an inactive apo conformation to a hyperactive “catalyzing state,” including conformational changes in the αC-SET-insertion region, autoregulatory loop, and the β9/10 loop. We finally propose a multilevel structural model for the Clr4 catalytic-regulatory cycle.

APC/C FZR-1 facilitates the degradation of MES-4 and MES-3 when GSCs transition toward differentiating into oocytes. The activity of APC/C FZR-1 is restricted by the Notch signaling pathway provided by the distal tip cell, which is responsible for maintaining the stemness of the GSC pool.

Potential target genes regulated by heSTRs, identified by incorporating distal regulations, are enriched with neuronal development–related functions and disorders, displaying neuron-specific expression enhancement in humans. Moreover, heSTRs are associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility specifically in human neurons. In addition, heSTRs show substantial association with pathogenic STR loci exhibiting abnormal copy number variations, as reported by cohort studies on schizophrenia and autism.

We report the experimental validation of a quantum fluctuation theorem (QFT) in a photonic system, applicable to general quantum processes with nonclassical characteristics, including quasi-probabilistic descriptions of entropy production and multiple time-reversal processes. Our experiment confirms that the ratio between the quasi-probabilities of the time-forward and any multiple time-reversal processes obeys a generalized Crooks QFT. Moreover, coherence induced by a quantum process leads to the imaginary components of quantum entropy production, governing the phase factor in the QFT. These findings underscore the fundamental symmetry between a general quantum process and its time reversal, providing an elementary toolkit to explore noisy quantum information processing.",

Taking advantage of the long lifetimes, the as-synthesized radicals are directly characterized in the real space at the single-chemical-bond scale by means of bond-resolving scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. Accompanied by the excellent stability, the radicals exhibit high chemical reactivities and facilitate the intermolecular radical transfer reactions at extreme low temperature.

Exopolysaccharide (EPS), a major virulence factor of R. solanacearum , elicits pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in tomato, but the means by which EPS is recognized in the plant remain poorly understood. We found that tomato non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) receptor kinase SlLYK4 mediates the perception of R. solanacearum EPS and positively regulates resistance to bacterial wilt. The RD receptor kinases SlLYK1 and SlLYK13 are required for EPS-triggered immune responses and form complexes with SlLYK4. These receptor kinase complexes have dual functions in recognizing bacterial EPS and fungal chitin. Phosphorylation of serine-320 in the juxtamembrane domain of SlLYK4 is essential in EPS- and chitin-mediated signaling, whereas phosphorylation of serine-334 or serine-634 in the C-terminal domain is required for chitin or EPS signaling, respectively.

Here, we show that PqqU binds PQQ with high affinity and determine the high-resolution structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex, revealing that PqqU undergoes conformational changes in PQQ binding to capture the cofactor in an internal cavity. We show that these conformational changes preclude the binding of a bacteriophage, which targets PqqU as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ structure, we identify amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla occupying diverse habitats, indicating that PQQ is an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.",

We demonstrated that HDAC1-3 catalyze sorbylation upon sorbate uptake and desorbylation in the absence of sorbate both in vitro and in cells. Sorbate uptake in mice livers significantly induced histone Ksor, correlating with decreased expressions of inflammation-response genes. Accordingly, sorbate treatment in macrophage RAW264.7 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation dose-dependently down-regulated proinflammatory gene expressions and nitric oxide production. Proteomic profiling identified RelA, a component of the NF-κB complex, and its interacting proteins as bona fide Ksor targets and sorbate treatment significantly decreased NF-κB transcriptional activities in response to LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells.

However, the organization of the whole-brain input-output networks of these subtypes remains unclear. Here, we identified two distinct BFCN subtypes—BFCN →ACA and BFCN →BLA —innervating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) and BLA, each with unique distributions, electrophysiological properties, and projection patterns. Combining rabies-virus–assisted mapping and triple-plex RNAscope hybridization, we characterized their whole-brain input networks, identifying unique excitatory and shared inhibitory inputs for these subtypes. Moreover, our results reveal a long-range reciprocal input-output loop: BFCN →ACA neurons target the isocortex, their shared excitatory-input source, whereas BFCN →BLA neurons target shared inhibitory-input sources such as the striatum and pallidum, thus enabling dynamic interactions among these BFCN subtypes. Our study deepens understanding of cholinergic modulation in cognition and emotion and provides insights into their functional interactions.",

          "abstract": "Indoles represent one of the most robust and synthetically versatile classes of heteroaromatic compounds. However, the stereoselective conversion of planar indole rings into three-dimensional indoline skeletons bearing multiple stereogenic centers remains a persistent challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe an intermolecular catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of simple indoles via a palladium-catalyzed three-component cross-coupling reaction. By using readily accessible diazonium salts and aromatic boronic acids as arylative reagents under a ligand-swap strategy, this method enables the efficient construction of 2,3-diarylated indolines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral BiOx ligand governs the highly stereoselective migratory insertion of the aryl-palladium intermediate into the indole’s C═C double bond with complete diastereo- and regioselectivity, whereas the achiral fumarate ligand facilitates the reductive elimination step, as corroborated by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, this protocol is extended to the dearomative diarylation of benzofurans, affording chiral 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran derivatives with high stereocontrol.",

          "abstract": "Highly salient events activate neurons across various brain regions. During subsequent rest or sleep, the activity patterns of these neurons often correlate with those observed during the preceding experience. Growing evidence suggests that these reactivations play a crucial role in memory consolidation, the process by which experiences are solidified in cortical networks for long-term storage. Here, we use longitudinal two-photon Ca 2+ imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, to show that targeted manipulation of PV + inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuates cue-specific reactivations and learning, with only minute effects on spontaneous activity and no apparent effect on normal function such as visual cue–elicited responses during training. In control mice, reactivations were biased toward salient cues, persisted for hours after training had ended, and the prevalence of reactivations was aligned with the learning process. Overall, our results underscore a crucial role for cortical reactivations in memory consolidation.",

          "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster , olfactory encoding in the mushroom body (MB) involves thousands of Kenyon cells (KCs) processing inputs from hundreds of projection neurons (PNs). Recent data challenge the notion of random PN-to-KC connectivity, revealing preferential connections between food-related PNs and specific KCs. Our study further uncovers a broader picture—an L-shaped hybrid network, supported by spatial patterning: Food-related PNs diverge across KC classes, whereas pheromone-sensitive PNs converge on γ KCs. α/β KCs specialize in food odors, whereas γ KCs integrate diverse inputs. Such spatial arrangement extends further to the antennal lobe (AL) and lateral horn (LH), shaping a systematic olfactory landscape. Moreover, our functional validations align with computational predictions of KC odor encoding based on the hybrid connectivity, correlating PN-KC activity with behavioral preferences. In addition, our simulations showcase the network’s augmented sensitivity and precise discrimination abilities, underscoring the computational benefits of this hybrid architecture in olfactory processing.",

          "abstract": "This article proposes a new conceptualisation of skill formation within growth regimes that integrates a transnational dimension. Drawing on insights from global value chain and managed migration scholarships, skill formation can become a transnational effort coordinated by a dominant growth coalition sourcing skills for economic growth. Focusing on Germany as a least-likely case, this article finds an increase in policies and practices to transfer vocational education and training and manage labour migration, as part of a growth strategy to sustain export-led growth. A coalition of the state and employers supports this strategy, called ‘externalisation’, which unions, political parties, and foreign governments do not oppose. Through the study of externalisation, we advocate for a departure from methodological nationalism when studying growth in 21st-century political economies.",

          "abstract": "Bilateral central bank swap agreements have become the most significant source of emergency liquidity since 2008. The US and China play a key role in the emergent swap networks. Does the rise of China and bilateral swaps signal the emergence of a post-neoliberal global financial order? Based on public texts, data, and interviews in Turkey—one of China’s swap partners—this article explores how the rise of swap lines has influenced the policy space of developing economies. This article shows that swap lines have enabled Turkey to evade IMF conditionality, at least for some time. Despite optimism in scholarship that the emergent policy space can be deployed for developmentalist goals that reverse decades of neoliberal restructuring, this article shows that it can also prolong authoritarian political regimes, deepening inequality and poverty. The paper discusses other dilemmas faced by China’s swap partners surrounding the potential limits of local currency swaps and their long-term sustainability.",
