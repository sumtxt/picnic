          "abstract": "The unification of gravity and quantum mechanics remains one of the most profound open questions in science. With recent advances in quantum technology, an experimental idea first proposed by Richard Feynman 1 is now regarded as a promising route to testing this unification for the first time. The experiment involves placing a massive object in a quantum superposition of two locations and letting it gravitationally interact with another mass. If the two objects subsequently become entangled, this is considered unambiguous evidence that gravity obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This conclusion derives from theorems that treat a classical gravitational interaction as a local interaction capable of transmitting only classical, not quantum, information 2–8 . Here we extend the description of matter used in these theorems to the full framework of quantum field theory, finding that theories with classical gravity can then transmit quantum information and, thus, generate entanglement through physical, local processes. The effect scales differently to that predicted by theories of quantum gravity, and so it gives information on the parameters and form of the experiment required to robustly provide evidence for the quantum nature of gravity.",

          "abstract": "The landmark discovery that neutrinos have mass and can change type (or flavour) as they propagate—a process called neutrino oscillation 1–6 —has opened up a rich array of theoretical and experimental questions being actively pursued today. Neutrino oscillation remains the most powerful experimental tool for addressing many of these questions, including whether neutrinos violate charge-parity (CP) symmetry, which has possible connections to the unexplained preponderance of matter over antimatter in the Universe 7–11 . Oscillation measurements also probe the mass-squared differences between the different neutrino mass states (Δ m 2 ), whether there are two light states and a heavier one (normal ordering) or vice versa (inverted ordering), and the structure of neutrino mass and flavour mixing 12 . Here we carry out the first joint analysis of datasets from NOvA 13 and T2K 14 , the two currently operating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments (hundreds of kilometres of neutrino travel distance), taking advantage of our complementary experimental designs and setting new constraints on several neutrino sector parameters. This analysis provides new precision on the $$\\Delta {m}_{32}^{2}$$ Δ m 32 2 mass difference, finding $$2.4{3}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\,{{\\rm{eV}}}^{2}$$ 2.4 3 − 0.03 + 0.04 × 1 0 − 3 eV 2 in the normal ordering and $$-2.4{8}_{-0.04}^{+0.03}\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\,{{\\rm{eV}}}^{2}$$ − 2.4 8 − 0.04 + 0.03 × 1 0 − 3 eV 2 in the inverted ordering, as well as a 3 σ interval on δ CP of [−1.38π, 0.30π] in the normal ordering and [−0.92π, −0.04π] in the inverted ordering. The data show no strong preference for either mass ordering, but notably, if inverted ordering were assumed true within the three-flavour mixing model, then our results would provide evidence of CP symmetry violation in the lepton sector.",

          "abstract": "The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , relies exclusively on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission. Once ingested during blood feeding, most parasites die in the mosquito midgut lumen or during epithelium traversal 1 . How surviving ookinetes interact with midgut cells and form oocysts remains poorly understood, yet these steps are essential to initiate a remarkable growth process culminating in the production of thousands of infectious sporozoites 2 . Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of both parasites and mosquito cells across different developmental stages and metabolic conditions, we unveil key transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions that occur in the midgut. Functional analyses uncover processes that regulate oocyst growth and identify the Plasmodium transcription factor PfSIP2 as essential for sporozoite infection of human hepatocytes. Combining shared mosquito–parasite barcode analysis with confocal microscopy, we reveal that parasites preferentially interact with midgut progenitor cells during epithelial crossing, potentially using their basal location as an exit landmark. Additionally, we show tight connections between extracellular late oocysts and surrounding muscle cells that may ensure parasite adherence to the midgut. We confirm our major findings in several mosquito–parasite combinations, including field-derived parasites. Our study provides fundamental insight into the molecular events that characterize previously inaccessible biological transitions and mosquito–parasite interactions, and identifies candidates for transmission-blocking strategies.",

          "abstract": "As demand for immersive experiences grows, displays with smaller sizes and higher resolutions are being viewed increasingly closer to the human eye 1 . As the size of emitting pixels shrinks, the intensity and uniformity of their emission are degraded while colour cross-talk and fabrication complexity increase, making ultra-high-resolution imaging challenging 2–4 . By contrast, electronic paper, which uses ambient light for visibility, can maintain high optical contrast regardless of pixel size, but cannot achieve high resolution 5,6 . Here we demonstrate electronic paper with electrically tunable metapixels down to ~560 nm in size (&gt;25,000 pixels per inch) consisting of WO 3 nanodisks, which undergo a reversible insulator-to-metal transition on electrochemical reduction. This transition enables dynamic modulation of the refractive index and optical absorption, allowing precise control over reflectance and contrast at the nanoscale. By using this effect, the metapixels can achieve pixel densities approaching the visual resolution limit when the display size matches the pupil diameter, which we refer to as retina electronic paper. Our technology also demonstrates full-colour video capability (&gt;25 Hz), high reflectance (~80%), strong optical contrast (~50%), low energy consumption (~0.5–1.7 mW cm – 2 ) and support for anaglyph 3D display, highlighting its potential as a next-generation solution for immersive virtual reality systems.",

          "abstract": "Social behaviour is substantially shaped by internal physiological states. Although progress has been made in understanding how individual states such as hunger, stress or arousal modulate behaviour 1–9 , animals experience multiple states at any given time 10 . The neural mechanisms that integrate such orthogonal states—and how this integration affects behaviour—remain poorly understood. Here we report how hunger and oestrous state converge on neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) to shape infant-directed behaviour. We find that hunger promotes pup-directed aggression in normally non-aggressive virgin female mice. This behavioural switch occurs through the inhibition of MPOA neurons, driven by the release of neuropeptide Y from Agouti-related peptide-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc AgRP neurons). The propensity for hunger-induced aggression is set by reproductive state, with MPOA neurons detecting changes in the progesterone to oestradiol ratio across the oestrous cycle. Hunger and oestrous state converge on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which sets the baseline activity and excitability of MPOA neurons. Using microendoscopy imaging, we confirm these findings in vivo, revealing that MPOA neurons encode a state for pup-directed aggression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how multiple physiological states are integrated to flexibly control social behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Achieving sustainability goals requires that humans change their behavior not just once but persistently. Yet despite decades of research on the adoption of conservation and climate-smart agricultural practices, little is known about the extent to which these practices persist over time. One key reason is the lack of longitudinal, field-level data. Using ground-verified, longitudinal data on cover cropping across thousands of farm parcels in Indiana (USA), we find that persistence is low and contrasts sharply with the predictions made by Indiana conservation experts. We also find low persistence in a new national dataset of self-reported cover cropping by farm operators. The potential for low behavioral persistence in sustainable agricultural practices raises essential questions about the design of conservation programs and the modeling and valuation of ecosystem services.",

          "abstract": "Although studies of Americans’ general discussant networks have been repeated over time, research that assesses change in the nature of Americans’ political discussion networks has yet to be conducted in nationally representative probability surveys. In this study I answer two questions about the quality of the American public sphere that have generated widespread speculation, but little evidence to date. First, how have Americans’ political discussion networks changed over the past 25 y? Second, are the consequences of these changes what one would expect based on previous theory linking Americans’ interpersonal information environments to political tolerance and political participation? I resolve competing claims suggesting that people feel less free to discuss politics, with claims suggesting instead that political discussion now permeates everyday life to a greater extent than in the past. Findings suggest widespread increases in political discussion, changes driven almost entirely by increases in like-minded political discussion partners. Surprisingly, Americans are no more or less likely to engage in conversations across lines of political difference. The predicted consequences of these fluctuations confirm an intrinsic tension between characteristics valued in democratic citizens. Political tolerance has declined significantly, along with decreased awareness of rationales for others’ relative to one’s own views. Political participation is significantly higher on average than 25 y ago. Few people reported engaging with online political discussants, despite efforts to make sure they were included in network measures.",

          "abstract": "Although seminal studies from the early 1960s suggested quality preschool can have lasting positive effects, agreement is lacking on the efficacy of different preschool models. The Montessori model is longstanding but lacks rigorous impact studies; prior random lottery studies included just one or two schools, among other compromises. Here, we report on end-of-kindergarten (age 5 to 6) impacts from a national study of public Montessori preschool. We compared children offered a Montessori seat via competitive lottery admission processes at one of 24 public Montessori schools at age 3 ( n = 242 ) to children not offered a seat ( n = 346 ), estimating Montessori impacts with intention-to-treat and complier average causal effect models. Roughly half of the treatment sample still attended Montessori for kindergarten. Although there were no notable impacts at the end of PK3 or PK4, at the end of kindergarten, controlling for baseline scores and demographics, Montessori children had significantly higher reading, short-term memory, theory of mind, and executive function scores. Intention-to-treat effect sizes exceeded a fifth of a SD, considered large in field-based school research [M. A. Kraft, Educ. Res. 49 , 241–253 (2020)]. This contrasts sharply with the more typical finding, where impacts of preschool are observed immediately following the program but disappear by the end of kindergarten. Further, a cost analysis suggested three years of public Montessori preschool costs less per child than traditional programs, largely due to Montessori having higher child:teacher ratios in PK3 and PK4. Although sensitivity and robustness analyses yielded similar results, important limitations of the study should be noted.",

          "abstract": "Myeloid-biased differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) occurs with aging or exhaustion. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this fate bias remain unclear. Here, we report that linker histone regulates HSPC fate choice at the lymphoid versus myeloid bifurcation. Linker histones package nucleosomes and compact chromatin. HSPCs expressing a doxycycline (dox)-inducible H1.0 transgene favor the lymphoid fate, display strengthened nucleosome organization, and reduced chromatin accessibility at subsets of genomic regions. The genomic regions showing reduced chromatin accessibility host many known marker genes of myeloid-biased HSCs. The transcription factor Hlf is located in one of the most differentially closed regions, whose chromatin accessibility and gene expression are reduced in H1.0 high HSPCs. Failure to reduce Hlf expression in multipotential HSPCs abrogates the H1.0-endowed lymphoid potential. Furthermore, HSPCs display aspartyl protease–dependent H1.0 decreases, especially in response to interferon alpha (IFNα). Aspartyl protease inhibitors preserve endogenous H1.0 levels and promote the lymphoid fate of wild type HSPCs. Thus, our work elucidates a molecular scenario of how myeloid bias arises and uncovers a point of intervention for correcting myeloid skewed hematopoiesis.",

          "abstract": "Highly polymorphic allorecognition systems have been characterized in numerous invertebrate species, and exhibit discriminatory capabilities reminiscent of vertebrate adaptive immunity. As these systems utilize germline encoded receptors, the mechanisms underlying allelic discrimination are unknown. The invertebrate chordate, Botryllus schlosseri, undergoes a natural transplantation reaction controlled by a highly polymorphic, polygenic locus (called the fuhc) with over 1,000 allelic haplotypes found worldwide. Two individuals are compatible if they share one or both fuhc alleles, and we had found that polymorphic discrimination is due to the integration of signals from two allorecognition receptors encoded within the fuhc locus, called fester and uncle fester. Here we show that these two receptors are members of an extended family consisting of &gt;35 genes, now called the Fester family ( FF ), and coexpressed with members of another diverse gene family, the fester coreceptors ( FcoR ). Both FF and FcoR are Immunoglobulin superfamily members and each FcoR encodes conserved tyrosine signal transduction motifs, including ITIMs or hemITAMs. FF and FcoR are expressed and encoded as cognate pairs in two polymorphic haplotypes: one within the fuhc locus, and another on a separate chromosome, and remarkably, copy number variation between haplotypes is of gene pairs. Furthermore, two FcoR genes can swap ITIMs and hemITAMs by alternative splicing, suggesting that dynamic tuning of activating and inhibitory signaling is required for allelic discrimination. These results indicate that conserved signal processing mechanisms are the foundation of both allelic discrimination in Botryllus , and recurring convergent evolution of allorecognition receptors observed from invertebrates to mammals.",

          "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to physical and mental disorders lifelong. How ELA affects brain functions, leading to these vulnerabilities, is a mystery. To understand ELA’s impacts, investigations into neural activity affected by ELA must go beyond localized areas toward simultaneous recordings from multiple widely distributed regions over time. Such studies will expose relative activity between regions and discover shifts in regional activity in response to different experiences. Here, we performed longitudinal manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to measure degrees of brain-wide neural activity in ELA-exposed mice across a series of experiences in adulthood. To ascertain whether ELA resulted in atypical brain activity, results were compared to those of the standard mouse (Std). MEMRI captured activity in the freely moving home cage condition, and short- and long-term after exposure to TMT, a naturalistic predator threat. Images were normalized and aligned then analyzed with statistical mapping and automated segmentation. We found that neural activity in the home cage was greater in ELA compared to Std in multiple striatal-pallidal and hypothalamic regions. Upon acute threat, neural activity in Std increased in these regions to become more similar to that in ELA, while new hyperactive responses in ELA emerged in the midbrain and hindbrain. Nine days after acute threat, heightened neural activity in ELA persisted within locus coeruleus and increased within the posterior amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus. These results reveal functional imbalances that arise between multiple brain-systems after ELA, which are dependent upon context and cumulative experiences into adulthood.",

          "abstract": "The emerging electrocatalytic C–N coupling reaction provides an attractive route toward green urea synthesis, but a lack of in-depth insight into the catalytic mechanism and the geometric/electronic configurations that determine the key C- and N-coupling intermediates formation hampers the exploration of efficient catalysts. Herein, we design a bimetallic oxide (Fe-Mo-O) with dual active sites of Fe and Mo for the adsorption and activation of NO 2 − and CO 2 , respectively. Constructing dual-metal catalyst leads to an upshift of the d-band center and the generation of an intermediate-spin Fe center, which not only favors the selective conversion of *CO 2 into the key intermediate *CO on Mo sites, but also facilitates the adsorption and reduction of NO 2 − on Fe sites. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations together elucidate that urea generation is associated with the formation of *CONH 2 intermediate by coupling *CO and *NH 2 on the alternating Mo and intermediate-spin Fe active sites, ultimately synergistically lowering the C–N coupling energy barrier. Specifically, the Fe-Mo-O catalyst delivers a high urea yield rate of 681.8 μg h −1 mg −1 cat. and an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 60% at −0.5 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, a C–N coupling paired with a glycerol oxidation system allows for energy-saving electrochemical coproduction of urea and formic acid. Our findings offer a feasible strategy to develop cutting-edge electrocatalysts for urea synthesis by active site design and electronic structure regulation.",

          "abstract": "Temperature has strong impacts on all biological and ecological processes, and thermal performance curves (TPCs) have been employed recurrently to assess them. TPCs almost always take a particular asymmetric shape across the biological hierarchy, with many different competing mechanisms and models doing a similarly good job of trying to explain the TPC phenomenon. Here, we reveal that the ubiquitous exponential scaling of biological processes with temperature creates a mechanistic tendency for TPC data and models to collapse onto a single curve (which we call the Universal TPC, UTPC), explaining mathematically why biological systems respond to temperature in such a consistent way. We illustrate that many seemingly different TPCs actually approximate rescaled versions of the same curve, even when thermal performance estimates vary widely across organisms, systems, and contexts. We demonstrate remarkable UTPC collapse across the tree of life, with diverse datasets spanning microbes to vertebrates, and individual physiology to population growth. UTPC phenomena also provide a strong theoretical basis for predicting performance of warm-adapted organisms will be more sensitive to- and less tolerant of- temperature fluctuations; an important consideration in the context of climate change.",

This interhemispheric exchange of information critically depends upon the corpus callosum. Classical anatomical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient from front to back, such that specific transcallosal fibers support distinct aspects of integrated brain function. Here, we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult corpus callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show that full interhemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion of posterior callosal fibers. Partial callosotomy patients with spared callosal fibers retained widespread patterns of interhemispheric functional connectivity and showed no signs of behavioral disconnection, even with only 1 cm of the splenium intact. Conversely, only complete callosotomy patients demonstrated sweeping disruptions of interhemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate an evolving mechanistic understanding of synchronized interhemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior.",

We achieved this by spraying picoliter volume droplets at speeds of hundreds of meters per second into a thin layer of liquid ethane coating the surface of a precooled specimen support. The droplets simultaneously collapsed and froze in microseconds into the amorphous phase as they landed on the surface. The atomic structure of the proteins was preserved and tomographic reconstructions of the vitrified specimens indicated adhesion to the interfaces was eliminated. Improved control of the final thickness of the specimen and the orientation distribution of the particles are now the limiting factors.

          "abstract": "Primary production in the ocean is a fundamental process that supports marine food webs and global carbon sequestration. This process depends on nutrients that are often limited in surface waters. Whales are known to release essential elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron, yet the extent of their contribution to ocean primary production remains unclear. Here, we present daily estimates of nutrient input by baleen whales in high-latitude feeding grounds (Nordic and Barents Seas), based on multielement analyses of feces and urine. We then used end-to-end ecosystem models to assess the impact of these nutrients on primary production. We found that nitrogen is primarily excreted via urine, whereas phosphorus and trace elements are mainly released through feces. Ecosystem models indicate that baleen whales, including minke, fin, sei, humpback, blue, and bowhead whales, support annual and seasonal net primary production, with varying impacts across space and time. While the annual effects are modest (&lt;2%) in most areas, the greatest impacts (up to 10%) occur during summer stratification and in offshore areas far from other nutrient sources. These increases in primary production have cascading effects on the food web, driving rises in mesozooplankton biomass. This study highlights the ecological significance of nutrient cycling by whales and underscores the value of integrating whale nutrient data into ecosystem modeling to assess the broader impacts of whales on marine productivity.",

The model relies solely on simulated data rather than well-registered real data pairs, and is trained to descatter and restore hidden spatial information at greater depths. Quantitative evaluations on simulated fluorescent beads and vasculature show significant performance improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (23 to 29 dB) and structural similarity index (23×) compared to the raw data. We also apply the framework to various ex vivo and in vivo experiments, achieving clear visualization of lipid droplets up to a depth of 1,300 μm and of vascular structure and astrocytes up to 950 μm and 500 μm, respectively, in live mouse brains at lower excitation powers.",

While treatments targeting AChR autoantibodies benefit many, some patients remain refractory, highlighting the need for personalized therapies. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of S-1117, a pan-IgG-specific protease, in AChR autoantibody-mediated pathology. Using live cell-based assays, we examined AChR-specific monoclonal IgG autoantibodies (mAbs) and patient-derived serum samples for their effects on receptor binding, blockade, internalization, and complement activation, before and after treatment with S-1117. S-1117 effectively removed the crystallizable fragment (Fc)γ from both mAbs and serum IgG, impairing Fcγ-mediated complement activation in both soluble and antigen-bound forms. In cases with partial complement reduction, AChR-specific IgM contributed to complement deposition. AChR-IgM acted in concert with IgG in some patients to enhance complement deposition, while acting as main complement driver in others. An IgM-specific protease completely suppressed the pathogenic effects of AChR-IgM in two independent patient cohorts. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of S-1117 in neutralizing AChR-IgG Fcγ-mediated effector functions and reveal an MG subset driven by IgM pathology. Our study shows that targeting both IgG- and IgM-mediated mechanisms with therapeutic proteases provides an approach to MG treatment and establishes a framework for patient stratification based on disease mechanisms, advancing precision medicine in MG.",

The genetic basis of hybrid male incompatibility has long remained elusive. Here, we show that crosses of Caenorhabditis nigoni males with C. briggsae females result in insufficient expression of Cbr-xol-1 , an X-linked master switch responsible for intimately linked sex determination and dosage compensation pathways, consequently triggering aberrant X-chromosome repression in males, and ultimately leading to embryonic inviability. In contrast, male embryos from the reciprocal cross maintain normal expression level of C. nigoni xol-1 genes, consistent with their viability.

          "abstract": "Despite extensive genetic heterogeneity, 72% of pathogenic alleles for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) arise from coding and regulatory variants in genes of the RET and EDNRB gene regulatory network (GRN) in the enteric nervous system (ENS). To elucidate the mechanisms leading to enteric neuronal loss from these genetic defects, we generated four strains of mice carrying reduced function alleles at Ret or Ednrb or both, along with their wild-type alleles. ENS tissue- and single-cell gene expression profiling of the developing and postnatal gastrointestinal tract in these five mouse models revealed three major insights: i) Ret and Ednrb deficiency, rather than complete loss, is sufficient to induce HSCR, ii) Ret and Ednrb demonstrate strong trans interactions, and iii) disruption of this interaction leads to cellular fate changes to compensate for neuronal loss. Critically, we show the combined reduction of signaling of these two receptors below a threshold in enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs) leads to a molecular tipping point at which otherwise lesser cellular defects result in aganglionosis. This study of targeted mouse models of a multifactorial disorder reveals how increasing dosage of genetic defects within a GRN leads to quantifiably increasing dysregulation from genotype to gene expression to cellular identity to function. Importantly, our studies establish that aganglionosis results only with severely reduced gene expression at both receptor genes and their consequent disruption of normal and compensatory cell fate trajectories.",

          "abstract": "The role of HIF2α, encoded by EPAS1 , in neuroblastoma remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that induction of high levels of HIF2α in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells results in a rapid and profound reduction of the oncoprotein MYCN. This is followed by an upregulation of genes characteristic of noradrenergic cells in the adrenal medulla. Additionally, upon induction of HIF2α, the proliferation rate drops substantially, and cells develop elongated neurite-like protrusions, indicative of differentiation. In vivo HIF2α induction in established xenografts significantly attenuates tumor growth. Notably, analysis of sequenced neuroblastoma patient samples, revealed a negative correlation between EPAS1 and MYCN expression and a strong positive correlation between EPAS1 expression, high expression levels of noradrenergic markers, and improved patient outcome. This was paralleled by analysis of human developing adrenal medulla datasets wherein EPAS1 expression was prominent in populations with high expression levels of genes characteristic of noradrenergic chromaffin cells. Our findings show that high levels of HIF2α in neuroblastoma, leads to drastically reduced MYCN protein levels, cell cycle exit, and noradrenergic cell differentiation. Taken together, our results challenge the dogma that HIF2α acts as an oncogene in neuroblastoma.",

          "abstract": "For many families severely affected with breast cancer, no inherited causal allele has been detected in any tumor suppressor gene. In an effort to understand the genetics underlying breast cancer in these families, we evaluated 136 such families for coinheritance of breast cancer with each of 79 common variants reported as high-confidence “risk alleles” for breast cancer by meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. Simulations based on allele frequencies and family structures revealed one (and only one) of these 79 variants to cosegregate with breast cancer in the families significantly more frequently than expected by chance. This variant (rs2046210) is located 180 kb proximal to ESR1 , encoding the estrogen receptor alpha. Reporter assays in MCF7 cells revealed enhancement by the genomic segment at this site of activity of ESR1 promoters, but no difference in effect among alternative haplotypes. In contrast, the 600 kb genomic region including ESR1 and rs2046210 harbored 11 rare variants, each of which cosegregated with breast cancer in one or a few families. For 9 of these 11 variants, reporter assays indicated significant allele-specific effects on ESR1 promoters, with the breast-cancer-linked allele of each variant yielding higher promoter activity. At the site with the most striking effect, the breast-cancer-linked allele was associated with increased binding by transcription factor AP2-gamma TFAP2C in both MCF7 and T47D cells. These results demonstrate coinheritance with breast cancer of rare alleles that increase activity of ESR1 promoters, and suggest that rare ESR1 regulatory alleles may contribute to inherited predisposition to breast cancer.",

Mechanistically, LMNA deficiency disrupts nuclear pore complex organization, specifically reducing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporin incorporation, resulting in impaired RNA export and nuclear retention of RNA. LMNA expression is repressed by EZH2 and reexpressed during SCLC differentiation from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE states, and low LMNA levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes. These findings establish LMNA as a key regulator of nuclear transport and genome integrity, linking nuclear architecture to SCLC progression and therapeutic vulnerability.",

Here, we report a nascent RNA-dependent PHF19-YTHDC1 condensate capable of switching EZH2-mediated gene suppression to activation during prostate cancer progression. We found that the long isoform of PRC2 accessory subunit PHF19, PHF19L, was highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer that promoted the tumor progression and hormonal therapy resistance. Mechanistically, PHF19L was recruited to the m 6 A modified nascent RNA through YTHDC1 and formed a liquid-like YTHDC1-PHF19L condensate that pulled the EZH2 away from chromatin, resulting in reduced H3K27me3 deposition and the activated expression of EZH2-repressed genes.

Here, we reveal that pHi plays a key role in regulating the stability of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3). Intracellular acidification markedly increases the half-life of ERK3, whereas alkalinization accelerates its degradation. The pH-dependent regulation of ERK3 is rapid, reversible, and consistent across cell types. Mechanistically, we identified a region in the C-terminus of ERK3 that contains pH-sensing motifs. We further show by quantitative proteomics that short-term acidification or alkalinization globally affects the cellular proteome. Our findings underscore the critical role of pHi in ERK3 turnover and suggest a broader role for pH in regulating protein stability and cell signaling.",

          "abstract": "In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), hyperactivated microglia produce inflammatory mediators that contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein expressed in many cell types, including neurons and microglia, plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis via its secretase-mediated processing to release the C-terminal 99-residue transmembrane fragment (C99) that is further cleaved to yield amyloid-β peptides. Voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1) have been implicated in microglial activation and release of inflammatory mediators, but the potential role of these channels in human microglia and AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia (iMG) express native Hv1 channels with biophysical and pharmacological attributes determined by their coassembly with APP and that APP knockdown decreases Hv1 currents, suppressing cytokine and reactive oxygen species release. In HEK293T cells, APP is shown to increase current by favoring channel opening at more negative membrane potentials. C99 is sufficient to assemble with Hv1 and alters channel function even more significantly than APP. Coimmunoprecipitation, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and altered pharmacology further demonstrate that C99 forms stable complexes with Hv1 in the plasma membrane. In addition, we find that two early-onset AD mutations in APP (E682K and D694N) that reside within C99 significantly increase voltage-dependent channel activity beyond that induced by wild type C99, rationalizing their enhanced mediation of neuroinflammation.",

Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization via increasing mevalonate pathway–dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent proinvasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product. Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell–ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with a context-dependent invasive cellular phenotype.",

In contrast, attractive suspensions show complex behaviors, including shear banding, delayed yielding, and resolidification, governed by transient dynamics at shear band interfaces.

In a thin thread of PE solution sustained between two disks—whether wettable or nonwettable—these dipoles are reoriented by an axial electric field, aligning themselves with the field direction. This alignment causes significant axial elastic stresses and affects capillary self-thinning dynamics of the thread, slowing the process and potentially arresting it entirely, and even leading to oscillatory regimes. Accordingly, the evolution of the thread radius deviates significantly from the exponential decay characteristic of solutions of flexible polymer macromolecules and the linear decay characteristic of Newtonian fluids. At relatively high electric field strengths, in a thread where elastic stresses become dominant, an oscillatory regime emerges. Here, the cross-sectional radius not only decreases but also increases and oscillates in time—a behavior rooted in an ill-posedness of the problem reducing to the Laplace equation in case of strong electric fields. This indicates a manifestation of Hadamard instability. The theory is supported by experimental data acquired in this work.",

However, diffusible antibacterial proteins (ABPs) that share this broad-spectrum activity are not known to exist.

Upon entering susceptible cells, these ABPs enzymatically degrade essential cellular components including DNA, transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), and ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). Unlike previously characterized bactericidal proteins, which require a specific cell surface receptor and therefore display a narrow spectrum of activity, we find that ABPs act in a receptor-independent manner and consequently kill bacteria spanning multiple phyla. Target cell entry by ABPs requires proteolytic activation by a cognate, coexported serine protease, and the liberated toxin component of the cleaved ABP is driven across the target cell membrane by the proton motive force. By examining representative ABPs from diverse pathogenic, commensal, and environmental bacteria, we show that broad-spectrum antibacterial activity is a conserved property of this protein family. Collectively, our work demonstrates that secreted proteins can act as broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that ABPs represent one of potentially many such families produced in nature.",

Building upon a computational model of reading, we used 7T functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1–V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the visual word form area, transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60 to 200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220 to 450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured prelexical representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.",

We report elevated cytosolic levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in neutrophils from patients with severe and critical COVID-19, correlating with enhanced NADPH oxidase–dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Using T2AA, a small-molecule inhibitor of the PCNA scaffold, we demonstrate potent suppression of NADPH oxidase activation and NET release, particularly in response to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Mechanistically, we identify a previously unrecognized interaction between PCNA and the heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin), predominantly enriched in CD16 high CD62L low neutrophils expanded during COVID-19. PCNA binds the dimeric S100A8/S100A9 complex mediated via S100A8 subunit with micromolar affinity, and this interaction is abrogated by tetramerization, suggesting regulation by intracellular calcium. Disruption of this complex by T2AA inhibited ROS production in an S100A8/S100A9-dependent manner, implicating calprotectin as a functional regulator of neutrophil activation. In a betacoronavirus mouse model, T2AA treatment attenuated lung inflammation, reduced NET and calprotectin levels, and shifted pulmonary neutrophils away from hyperactivated and immunosuppressive phenotypes, consistent with immune reprogramming toward resolution. These findings establish cytosolic PCNA as a central scaffold in neutrophil hyperactivation during COVID-19 and highlight its pharmacological disruption as a promising host-directed strategy to limit inflammation and prevent organ damage.",

          "abstract": "The impact history of the Moon provides the opportunity to better understand mass transfer in the Solar System. While Earth’s meteorite collection serves as a key reference for material flux in the Earth–Moon system, it suffers from profound biases arising from Earth’s orbital dynamics and atmospheric filtering. Systematic identification and classification of meteorites on the airless Moon thus provide additional critical constraints for reconstructing the primordial accretion history and impactor population of the inner Solar System. However, identifying impactors on the Moon remains challenging due to their vaporization upon colliding at high velocities with the lunar surface. In situ remote sensing has previously detected chondritic impactor materials in the South-Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin of the far side of the Moon. The first opportunity to measure materials from the SPA basin has come via the Chang’e-6 (CE-6) mission, which returned samples from the Apollo basin inside the SPA basin. In this study, we screened seven olivine-porphyritic clasts as potential impactor relics in regolith returned by the CE-6 mission. These clasts were identified, via textural characterization, olivine Fe–Mn–Zn systematics, and in-situ triple oxygen isotopes, as impact relics solidified from melted chondritic parent bodies. Intriguingly, the parent body of all the identified impactor relics in this study resemble CI-like chondrites, a volatile-rich meteorite group that is relatively rare in Earth’s meteorite collection. The detection and classification of these impactor relics impose significant constraints on the proportions of meteoritic materials in the Earth–Moon system and their potential contributions to water inventories on the lunar surface.",

Reconstructing pollinator historic demographies provides an evolutionary perspective to understand contemporary population declines. The Franklin bumble bee ( Bombus franklini ), once endemic to Oregon and California and last observed alive in 2006, is emblematic of this phenomenon. We collected whole-genome sequence data from museum specimens spanning four decades to elucidate the genetic and demographic history of this potentially extinct species. Heterozygosity estimates of 25 individuals were remarkably low, and runs of homozygosity (ROH) patterns identified short segments suggestive of historical inbreeding, with some individuals having almost entire chromosomes in ROH. Demographic reconstructions revealed a marked decline in effective population size beginning in the late Pleistocene, with further declines in the last 400 y, which may have been influenced by fire and drought stressors. We found little to no genomic evidence implicating pathogens in the species’ decline and used coalescent simulations to show that we would be able to detect recently reduced heterozygosity only when colony-level survival rates are 15 to 30%. We conclude that a combination of historically low effective population size and genetic diversity along with environmental stochasticity heightened this species’ extinction vulnerability prior to recent anthropogenic stressors. This study demonstrates the utility of museum collections for clarifying genetic and demographic dynamics of rare species and suggests that B. franklini may have already been on a trajectory of decline prior to human impacts.",

          "abstract": "Low-frequency sound absorption has traditionally relied on air-resonant structures, such as Helmholtz resonators, which are made of stiff materials that undergo negligible deformation. In these systems, energy dissipation arises primarily from air motion and thermal–viscous effects, resulting in inherently narrowband performance and bulky, complex designs for broadband absorption. Here, we presented a composite acoustic metamaterial that replaces the high-stiffness neck of a Helmholtz resonator with a soft, viscoelastic cylindrical shell. This structural modification enables material deformation and shifts the dominant energy dissipation mechanism from air resonance to intrinsic viscoelastic damping. A single unit achieves over 97% absorption across a broad low-frequency range (227 to 329 Hz) with deep-subwavelength thickness (λ/15 at 227 Hz). We developed a discretized impedance model that quantitatively links material properties and geometry to absorption behavior. Our results established a materials-centered design paradigm in which both material selection and geometry serve as coequal, tunable parameters for compact, broadband low-frequency sound control.",

O -Glucose glycans are transferred to serine residues located between the first and second conserved cysteines within the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in the Notch extracellular domain. Previously, O -glucose glycans were shown to be extended to a trisaccharide structure with two xyloses via α1-3 linkages. Our recent studies, however, indicated that the O -glucose glycan on NOTCH1 EGF10 can be extended by hexose and Neu5Ac. Here, we demonstrated that this hexose- and Neu5Ac-extended glycan has a 3’-sialyllactose-like structure synthesized by specific members of two isoenzyme families, B4GALT1 and ST3GAL4. Using mass spectrometry, we identified this modification exclusively on NOTCH1 EGF10 and the analogous NOTCH3 EGF9 domain, with no detection in any other EGF domains in NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3. Sequence comparison and mutagenesis experiments identified one amino acid at position -2 of the fourth cysteine (C 4 -2) in the EGF domain as crucial for the galactose elongation of O -glucose glycans. We further demonstrated that this site-specific elongation of O -glucose on NOTCH1 EGF10 significantly impacts ligand binding and signal transduction of NOTCH1. In the context of early T cell development, the C 4 -2 mutants NOTCH1 A396Y and A396F enhance T cell differentiation through DLL1- and DLL4-dependent NOTCH1 signaling. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanisms of Notch receptor function mediated by distinct positions and structures of O -glycans.",

          "abstract": "Agonist-induced activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] to diacylglycerol (DAG) at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). DAG can be enzymatically transformed into phosphatidic acid (PA) and accumulated at the PM. PYK2 N-terminal domain-interacting receptor 2 (Nir2) mediates the formation of ER–PM membrane contact sites (MCSs) by specifically recognizing PA at the PM and directly interacting with ER membrane protein vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs). The N-terminal phosphatidylinositol transfer protein domain of Nir2 facilitates PI/PA exchange at ER–PM MCSs to maintain PI and PA levels. Here, we reveal the mechanisms by which Nir2 senses phosphatidic acid (PA) and associates with membranes, based on three crystal structures of its C-terminal Lipin/Ned1/Smp2 (LNS2) domain bound to PA, the diphenylalanine [FF]–containing acidic tract (FFAT) motif complexed with vesicle-associated membrane protein–associated protein B/C (VAPB), and the Asp-Asp-His-Asp (DDHD) domain. The C-terminal LNS2 domain of Nir2 directly interacts with the phosphate in the headgroup of PA via hydrogen bonds involving S1025, T1065, K1103, and K1126. Formation of a salt bridge between E355 in Nir2 and R55 in VAPB is essential for Nir2 FFAT–VAPB interaction. The central DDHD domain of Nir2 forms a twofold symmetric dimer, and this self-association contributes to stable and tight membrane association. These findings reveal how Nir2-mediated ER–PM MCS formation maintains continued PI(4,5)P 2 -dependent PLC signaling.",

Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.",

Here, we use six decades of continuous chemical and hydrologic data from three adjacent headwater catchments in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire—one deforested (W5), one CaSiO 3 -enriched (W1), and one reference (W6)—to quantify long-term nutrient and mineral fluxes. Acid deposition since 1900 drove pronounced depletion and export of base cations, particularly calcium, across all watersheds. Experimental deforestation of W5 intensified loss of biomass and nutrient cations and triggered sustained increases in streamwater pH, Ca 2+ , and SiO 2 exports over nearly four decades, greatly exceeding the effects of direct CaSiO 3 enrichment in both duration and magnitude. We detect no long-term changes in water yield or water flow paths in the experimental watersheds, and we attribute this multidecadal increase in weathering rates following deforestation to biological responses to severe nutrient limitation. Our evidence suggests that in the regrowing forest, plants are investing photosynthate into belowground processes that amplify mineral weathering to access phosphorus and micronutrients, consequently elevating the export of less limiting elements present in silicate parent material. Throughout decades of forest regrowth, enhanced biotic weathering has continued to deplete the acid buffering capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem while the export of weathering products has elevated the pH of the receiving stream.",

In our cryo-EM data at pH 4.0, we identified and segregated asymmetric particles, which we precisely aligned to resolve high-resolution structures of several previously unresolved asymmetric intermediate states, in addition to symmetric closed and open states. Detailed structural analysis revealed systematic conformational changes at individual subunits driving the channel opening. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to assign the functional states. We further examined the roles of the F116 and Y251 residues, located at the domain interface, playing a central role in interdomain communication. In addition, patch-clamp experiments on GLIC I240A and L241A mutants, located in the M2 helix, demonstrated their importance in channel gating. Together, these results shed light on the sequential and asymmetric conformational transitions that occur during GLIC activation, offering a deeper mechanistic understanding of asymmetric gating in pLGICs.",

          "abstract": "Animals respond to sensory stimuli with motor actions, which in turn generate new sensory inputs. This sensorimotor loop is constrained by time delays that impose a trade-off between responsiveness and stability. Additionally, as the relationship between a motor command and the corresponding sensory feedback is context-dependent, the response must be adapted in real time. It is generally believed that this adaptation process relies on an internal model that is continuously updated through prediction error minimization. Here, we experimentally reveal an alternative strategy based on a simpler feedback mechanism that does not require any internal model. We developed a virtual reality system for the miniature transparent fish Danionella cerebrum that enables in vivo brain-wide imaging during fictive navigation. By systematically manipulating the feedback parameters, we dissected the motor control process that allows the animal to stabilize its position using optic flow. The sensorimotor loop can be fully described by a single delay differential equation, whose solutions quantitatively capture the observed behavior across all experimental conditions. Both behavioral and neural data indicate that the observed adaptive response arises from logarithmic nonlinearities at the sensory (Weber–Fechner law) and motor (Henneman’s size principle) ends. These fundamental properties of the nervous system, conserved across species and sensory modalities, have traditionally been interpreted in terms of efficient coding. Our findings unveil a distinct functional role for such nonlinear transformations: ensuring stability in sensorimotor control despite inherent delays and sensory uncertainty.",

At puberty, hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons release kisspeptin, stimulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release and activating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. Here, we show that Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus ( Kiss1 ARC ) of female mice undergo profound intrinsic plasticity at puberty. Kiss1 ARC neurons in brain slices from 3-wk-old mice, when depolarized, typically fire a short high-frequency burst of action potentials before falling silent. This would make them unsuitable for the sustained activity that is required to activate pulsatile GnRH secretion and the HPG axis. At 4 wk of age and after puberty, Kiss1 ARC neurons can fire a sustained train of action potentials. There is a concomitant hyperpolarization in action potential threshold and postspike minimum voltage and larger medium after-hyperpolarizations (mAHP) and hyperpolarization-induced voltage sags. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant changes in ion channel expression after puberty. Using quantitative PCR, we confirmed changes in genes encoding voltage-gated sodium, calcium, potassium, and cation channels. Blocking hyperpolarization-induced cation channels caused Kiss1 ARC neurons from postpuberty mice to fire less sustained trains of action potentials. Recordings from Kiss1 ARC neurons in mice after ovariectomy and 17β-estradiol replacement revealed a critical window of estrogen-dependent plasticity between 3 and 6 wk, which is essential for the maturation of Kiss1 ARC neurons and the development of their adult electrophysiological activity. This represents an example of sex steroid–dependent plasticity in the mammalian brain at puberty.",

A cullin serves as the scaffold protein that recruits E3 ligases and substrate receptors in a CRL complex, whose activity requires cullin neddylation, a posttranslational modification that can be pharmacologically targeted by neddylation inhibitors. Elevated neddylation activity has been observed in the liver and adipose tissue of obese mice, implicating a pathogenic link between altered CRL activity and the development of metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence has also shown that neddylation inhibitors possess antiobesity and hypoglycemic property. However, the roles of cullin proteins in regulating adipocyte biology are still incompletely defined. Here, we report that pan neddylation inhibitor TAS4464 treatment reversed obesity and adipose inflammation, resulting in improved hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity in obese mice. Among all mammalian cullin proteins that were targeted by TAS4464, we identified that cullin 3 (Cul3) was required for adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy. A complete absence of Cul3 in adipocytes caused severely inhibited adipose expansion associated with ectopic fat accumulation in the liver and brown adipose tissue and insulin resistance, while adipocyte-specific Cul3 haploinsufficiency attenuated obesity and improved overall metabolic homeostasis, which recapitulated the metabolic benefits of TAS4464. Mechanistically, we found that Cul3 inhibition caused adipose nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) stabilization, which contributed to impaired adipogenesis by inhibiting lipogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that Cul3 is required during adipogenesis and acts as a downstream mediator of the antiobesity effect of pan neddylation inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "The squamous cell carcinoma antigen SerpinB3 is a serum-circulating biomarker of epithelial cancers associated with high metastasis, treatment resistance, and poor prognosis. Despite its clinical significance, the endogenous role of SerpinB3 has remained undefined. Here, we identify SerpinB3 as a mediator of epithelial wound healing. Injury induces SerpinB3 expression in vitro and in vivo in the migrating epidermal tongue; overexpression of the protein promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition–like changes. Recombinant Serpinb3a, the mouse ortholog, enhances re-epithelialization in vitro and accelerates wound closure and collagen remodeling in vivo. These findings reveal a physiological function for SerpinB3 in epithelial repair and suggest that its expression in cancer, chronic wounds, and inflammatory diseases may reflect reactivation of a conserved wound response program—positioning SerpinB3 as a compelling therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection causes encephalitis in humans and animals. Following intradermal infection, JEV crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and reaches target cells in the brain parenchyma. However, the cellular dynamics and pathological niches involved in JEV neuroinvasion remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the early stages of JEV infection in the mouse brain employing a highly multiplexed spatial transcriptomics platform to map viral RNA and host gene expressions in intact brain sections at a single-cell resolution. Although JEV RNA was undetectable in brain sections at 1-day postinfection (dpi), innate immune responses were transiently activated across the brain. At 4 dpi, we detected limited viral RNA and mapped its spatial distribution, identifying glial cells surrounding microvessels as early targets of brain infection. We further characterized transcriptional changes in infected and surrounding bystander cells, revealing cell-type–specific antiviral responses. Notably, JEV neuroinvasion led to the downregulation of endothelial tight junction genes, indicative of an early event that precedes BBB impairment during subsequent disease progression. Our spatial transcriptomic analysis provides insights into cell-type– and region-specific responses to JEV infection, and highlights the early role of glial cells in shaping the immune response landscape of the brain. These findings greatly improve our understanding of JEV pathogenesis before the onset of clinical encephalitis.",

          "abstract": "Bone pain is a presenting feature of bone cancers such as osteosarcoma (OS), relayed by skeletal-innervating peripheral afferent neurons. Potential functions of tumor-associated sensory neurons in bone cancers beyond pain sensation are unknown. To uncover neural regulatory functions, a chemical-genetic approach in mice with a knock-in allele for TrkA was used to functionally perturb sensory nerve innervation during OS growth and disease progression. TrkA inhibition in transgenic mice led to significant reductions in sarcoma-associated sensory innervation and vascularization, skewed tumor associated macrophage polarization, reduced tumor growth and metastasis, and prolonged overall survival. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that sarcoma denervation was associated with phenotypic alterations in both OS tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment, and with reduced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. Multimodal and multiomics analyses of human OS bone samples further implicated peripheral innervation and neurotrophin signaling in OS tumor biology. Next and in two parallel approaches to inhibit nerve ingrowth, we repurposed FDA-approved bupivacaine liposomes and separately blocked CGRP signaling using FDA-approved Rimegepant. Both strategies led to significant reductions in sarcoma growth, vascularity, and sarcoma-induced hyperalgesia. In sum, TrkA-expressing peripheral neurons positively regulate key aspects of OS progression and sensory neural inhibition disrupts CGRP signaling within the sarcoma microenvironment leading to significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival. These data suggest that interventions to prevent pathological innervation of OS represent an adjunctive therapy to improve clinical outcomes and survival.",

          "abstract": "Animals navigate their environment stably without inefficient course corrections despite unavoidable errors. In humans, this stability is achieved by modulating the placement of the foot on each step such that recent errors are corrected. However, it is unknown whether animals with diverse nervous systems and body mechanics use such foot placement control; foot trajectories of many-legged animals are considered to be stereotypical velocity-driven patterns, as opposed to error-driven. Here, we put forth a unified “feedforward-feedback” control structure for stable locomotion that combines velocity-driven and body state error-driven foot placement. We provide empirical support for this control structure across flies, mice, and humans by mining their natural locomotor variability, finding that a competing control structure with purely velocity-driven foot placement is not supported by the data. This work finds shared behavioral signatures of foot placement control in flies, mice, and humans. We find that key characteristics of these signatures, such as their urgency and centralization, vary with neuromechanical embodiment across species. For example, more inherently stable multilegged animals exhibit less urgent control with a lower control magnitude and a slower correction timescale compared to humans. Furthermore, many-legged animals display modular, direction-, and leg-specific control signatures, whereas humans exhibit common signatures across both legs. Overall, our findings provide insight into stable locomotion across species, revealing how species with diverse neuromechanics achieve a shared functional goal: foot placement control.",

          "abstract": "Signaling pathways induce stereotyped transcriptional changes as stem cells progress into mature cell types during embryogenesis. Signaling perturbations are necessary to discover which genes are responsive or insensitive to pathway activity. However, gene regulation is additionally dependent on cell state-specific factors like chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding. Thus, transcriptional profiles need to be assayed in single cells to identify potentially multiple, distinct perturbation responses among heterogeneous cell states in an embryo. In perturbation studies, comparing heterogeneous transcriptional states among experimental conditions often requires samples to be collected over multiple independent experiments, which can introduce confounding batch effects. We present Design-Aware Integration of Single Cell ExpEriments (DAISEE), a new algorithm that models perturbation responses in single-cell datasets collected according to complex experimental designs. We demonstrate that DAISEE improves upon a previously available integrative nonnegative matrix factorization framework, more efficiently separating perturbation responses from confounding variation. We use DAISEE to integrate newly collected single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 5-h-old zebrafish embryos expressing optimized photoswitchable MEK (psMEK), which globally activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule involved in many cell specification events. psMEK drives some cells that are normally not exposed to ERK signals toward other wild type states and induces novel states expressing early-acting endothelial genes. Overactive signaling is therefore capable of producing unexpected gene expression states in developing embryos.",

However, efficiently exciting, manipulating, and detecting magnons remains a critical need. We show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization through their spin and orbital moments. This effect is governed by system symmetry, magnon band hybridization, and interactions with other quasiparticles. We calculate the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional collinear honeycomb and noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), showing that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction yields a finite net electric polarization. In NiPSe 3 , a collinear honeycomb AFM with Zigzag order, the induced net electric polarization is about three orders of magnitude greater than in MnPS 3 , a collinear honeycomb AFM with Néel phase. In the noncollinear AFM KFe 3 (OH) 6 (SO 4 ) 2 , the net electric polarization can be tuned via magnon hybridization, which can be controlled by external magnetic fields. These findings reveal that electric fields could be used to both detect and manipulate magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment. They also suggest that the discovery or engineering of materials with substantial magnon orbital moments could enhance practical uses of magnons for future computing and information transmission applications.",

          "abstract": "RNAs are major drivers of phase separation in the formation of biomolecular condensates and can undergo protein-free phase separation in the presence of divalent ions or crowding agents. Much remains to be understood regarding how the complex interplay of base stacking, base pairing, electrostatics, ion interactions, and particularly structural propensities governs RNA phase behavior. Here, we develop an intermediate resolution model for condensates of RNAs (iConRNA) that can capture key local and long-range structural features of dynamic RNAs and simulate their spontaneous phase transitions with Mg 2+ . Representing each nucleotide using 6 to 7 beads, iConRNA accurately captures base stacking and pairing and includes explicit Mg 2+ . The model not only reproduces major conformational properties of poly(rA) and poly(rU) but also correctly folds small structured RNAs and predicts their melting temperatures. With an effective model of explicit Mg 2+ , iConRNA successfully recapitulates experimentally observed lower critical solution temperature phase separation of poly(rA) and triplet repeats, and critically, the nontrivial dependence of phase transitions on RNA sequence, length, concentration, and Mg 2+ level. Further mechanistic analysis reveals a key role of RNA folding in modulating phase separation as well as its temperature and ion dependence, besides other driving forces such as Mg 2+ –phosphate interactions, base stacking, and base pairing. These studies also support iConRNA as a powerful tool for direct simulation of RNA-driven phase transitions, enabling molecular studies of how RNA conformational dynamics and its response to complex condensate environments control the phase behavior and condensate material properties.",

          "abstract": "Speech comprehension involves transforming an acoustic waveform into meaning. To do so, the human brain generates a hierarchy of features that converts the sensory input into increasingly abstract language properties. However, little is known about how rapid incoming sequences of hierarchical features are continuously coordinated. Here, we propose that each language feature is supported by a dynamic neural code, which represents the sequence history of hierarchical features in parallel. To test this “hierarchical dynamic coding” (HDC) hypothesis, we use time-resolved decoding of brain activity to track the construction, maintenance, and update of a comprehensive hierarchy of language features spanning phonetic, word form, lexical–syntactic, syntactic, and semantic representations. For this, we recorded 21 native English participants with magnetoencephalography (MEG), while they listened to two hours of short stories in English. Our analyses reveal three main findings. First, the brain represents and simultaneously maintains a sequence of hierarchical features. Second, the duration of these representations depends on their level in the language hierarchy. Third, each representation is maintained by a dynamic neural code, which evolves at a speed commensurate with its corresponding linguistic level. This HDC preserves the maintenance of information over time while limiting destructive interference between successive features. Overall, HDC reveals how the human brain maintains and updates the continuously unfolding language hierarchy during natural speech comprehension, thereby anchoring linguistic theories to their biological implementations.",

These enrichments are recorded in water desorbed from mineral surfaces and evolved from poorly crystalline phases, hydrated salts, jarosite, and clays. All evolved waters are deuterium-enriched relative to common terrestrial waters, reflecting hydrogen loss to space. Because oxygen in structurally bound hydroxyl groups is least likely to exchange with other sources over geologic timescales, we focus on oxygen in water evolved during dehydroxylation of smectite clays. Several samples have 18 O/ 16 O ratios commensurate with precipitation from, or near-complete equilibration with, water moderately 18 O-enriched relative to terrestrial meteoric waters—consistent with other evidence that Mars’s hydrosphere is basically like Earth’s in terms of oxygen isotopes. Unlike hydrogen, oxygen atmospheric escape did not lead to extreme 18 O enrichments on Mars. Locally, however, most Gale smectites’ 18 O/ 16 O values require a pronounced 18 O-enrichment of their parental waters. On Earth, the most extreme 18 O enrichments in surface waters are found in closed basins having undergone significant evaporative loss into a low-humidity atmosphere, and the 18 O/ 16 O of authigenic clay minerals formed in these environs reflect those enrichments. A similar process acting on the hydrologic reservoir local to Gale at the time of clay formation and early diagenesis is a plausible explanation for the distinctive oxygen isotopic compositions of these clays.",

Despite the recognized importance of TGOs in navigation, their precise functional roles remain unclear. By building a biologically plausible spiking neuronal network model and reproducing experimental results, we leverage SFC properties-length and separation-to reveal that the positive correlation between theta frequency and motion velocity optimally balances planning for predictable events and staying alert to unexpected ones. Based on this adaptive mechanism, we further explain the distinct functional contributions of TGOs consistent with experimental findings: Theta oscillations facilitate self-location awareness, gamma oscillations enhance predictive capabilities, and their coupling ensures sufficient time windows for prediction. Our study provides insights into the functional roles of TGOs in the hippocampus, highlighting their importance in achieving both planning and vigilance during goal-directed navigation.",

Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here, we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimized to maximize the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biological systems.",

Using 2-photon in vivo imaging, we tracked the spatial distribution and anatomical properties of HVC neurons over several weeks of testosterone-induced song development. Surprisingly, despite ultrastructural changes of HVC neurons, testosterone did neither alter neuronal spacing nor HVC size. Instead, spatial transcriptomics revealed that testosterone modulates gene networks throughout HVC, aligning transcriptomic profiles between its peripheral and central HVC regions in singing birds, thereby mimicking the histological appearance of an enlarging HVC. Our results demonstrate that changes in HVC size in adults reflect phenotypic changes in neurons within a stable framework.

Perception of environmental stressors like food scarcity often leads to physiological changes that promote survival and slow aging. However, recent work shows that perception of attractive food smells can block the health benefits of dietary restriction in multiple model organisms. While it is known that sensory perception and cell nonautonomous signaling can modulate health and longevity, our knowledge of the specific sensory cues and mechanistic pathways that define this signaling is still limited. Here we find that the sense of touch interacts with nutritional state to modulate lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans . Worms subjected to dietary restriction are shorter-lived when they perceive tactile stimuli that mimic bacterial food and/or protective soil. Touch modulation of dietary restriction requires putative mechanoreceptor proteins, the neurotransmitters dopamine and tyramine/adrenaline, and the neuropeptides INS-11 and GnRH. Ultimately, the touch circuit regulates the longevity effectors DAF-2/IGF1R and FMO-2/FMO5. These results establish a physiological touch circuit and connect neural reward pathways to the growth and reproductive axes. Finding that texture mechanosensation can modulate longevity suggests a role for touch in lifespan.",

In Aedes aegypti , CO 2 is detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in the sensory hairs (sensilla) on the maxillary palp. While the molecular mechanism and behavioral significance of CO 2 sensing have been well studied in mosquitoes, the nanoscale three-dimensional structures of their CO 2 -sensing ORNs and associated cells have remained unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we characterize the CO 2 -sensing cpA neuron and its odor-sensitive neighbors, cpB and cpC, within the capitate sensilla of A. aegypti. Notably, cpA neurons are significantly larger, with an outer dendritic surface area 8 to 12 times greater than that of cpB and cpC neurons. This expanded CO 2 -sensing surface arises from its unique architecture, consisting of numerous flattened dendritic sheets folded into intricate lamellae. In contrast, cpB and cpC dendrites exhibit sparse, narrow cylindrical branches. Moreover, the cpA axon displays a prominent pearls-on-a-string morphology, with numerous mitochondria-rich, nonsynaptic varicosities connected by thin cables. Remarkably, a glial cell and an auxiliary cell together ensheathe the cpA soma but not cpB or cpC, suggesting a specialized role in supporting cpA function. Compared to Drosophila CO 2 -sensitive ORNs, a larger portion of the cpA outer dendrite is embedded within the sensillum cuticle, potentially improving access to environmental CO 2 . These findings reveal key morphological specializations of cpA neurons, thereby advancing our understanding of mosquito sensory biology and laying the groundwork for future studies on the molecular basis and functional ramifications of these anatomical adaptations.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthesis is essential for ecosystem survival, but while plants require light, excessive exposure can damage cells. Chloroplasts, photosynthetic organelles, respond via self-organized motion within cells to optimize light absorption. These disk-shaped organelles must balance two competing needs: dense packing to enhance absorption under dim light and rapid spatial rearrangement to avoid damage from excess light. Using microscopy, we show that plant cell shape and chloroplast size achieve both goals: dense monolayer packing for optimal absorption in low light and sidewall packing for light avoidance. We present a theoretical model using random close packing simulations of polydispersed hard disks in rectangular boxes and find optimal cell shapes that match plant cell measurements. Our findings highlight how particle packing principles under confinement enable light adaptation in plants, offering insights into organelle organization under confinement, a physical challenge relevant across biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers (COs) are needed to produce genetically balanced gametes. In mammals, CO formation is mediated by a conserved set of pro-CO proteins via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we characterize a mammalian pro-CO factor HEIP1. In mouse HEIP1 is essential for crossover and fertility of both sexes. HEIP1 promotes crossover by orchestrating the recruitment of other pro-CO proteins, including the MutSγ complex (MSH4-MSH5) and E3 ligases (HEI10, RNF212, and RNF212B), that are required to mature CO sites and recruit the CO-specific resolution complex MutLγ. Moreover, HEIP1 directly interacts with HEI10, suggesting a direct role in controlling the recruitment of pro-CO E3 ligases. During early stages of meiotic prophase I, HEIP1 interacts with the chromosome axes, independently of recombination, before relocalizing to the central region of the synaptonemal complex. We propose that HEIP1 is a conserved master regulator of CO proteins that controls different CO maturation steps.",

          "abstract": "Body size variation in vertebrates is a complex polygenic trait, tightly correlated with numerous aspects of a species’ biology, ecology, and physiology. Miniaturization, the extreme reduction of adult body size, is a common phenomenon across the Tree of Life, yet the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of body size evolution in goby fishes, a clade encompassing some of the smallest vertebrates on Earth. We generate a genome-wide phylogeny for 162 Gobioidei species and perform comparative transcriptomics across three clades with repeated instances of miniaturization and large-bodied forms. We identified 54 differentially expressed one-to-one orthologs between miniature and large-bodied species. These genes reveal distinct functional profiles, suggesting that regulation of cell numbers is a key mechanism governing body size control. Miniature species consistently overexpress growth inhibitors like CDKN1B and ING2 , associated with tighter cell cycle regulation and decreased proliferation rates, while large-bodied species upregulate growth-promoting genes such as TGFB3 , linked to tissue development and growth signaling. These enriched functional pathways, conserved since the Eocene (50 Ma), suggest macroevolutionary convergence in size regulation over deep time. Our findings provide insights into how size determination is governed at a genetic level and highlights the importance of exploring these factors in nonmodel organisms to uncover the fundamental processes regulating vertebrate body size evolution.",

We use a reconstruction of changes in δ 18 O of seawater to reconstruct GMSL since 4.5 million years ago (Ma) that accounts for temperature-driven changes in the δ 18 O of global ice sheets. Between 4.5 and 3 Ma, sea level highstands remained up to 20 m above present whereas the first lowstands below present suggest onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 4 Ma. Intensification of global glaciation occurred from 3 Ma to 2.5 Ma, culminating in lowstands similar to the Last Glacial Maximum lowstand at 21,000 years ago and that reoccurred throughout much of the Pleistocene. We attribute the middle Pleistocene transition in ice sheet variability (1.2 Ma to 0.62 Ma) to modulation of 41-thousand-year (kyr) obliquity forcing by an increase in ~100-kyr CO 2 variability.",

In the modern pelagic ocean, almost all CaCO 3 is produced by three groups of calcifying planktonic organisms: coccolithophores, foraminifers, and shelled pteropods. In this Review, we examine the differences in functional traits that define each group’s distinctive role in the global carbon cycle and their sensitivity to climate change and ocean acidification. This synthesis reveals that a single representation of CaCO 3 in climate models is unlikely to accurately reflect system dynamics or their impacts on biogeochemical cycling under climate change. We argue that understanding past and future CaCO 3 cycle requires a better delineation of the traits that make up the diversity of calcifying plankton groups.",

Using a cognitive bias paradigm we demonstrate positive affective contagion in bumble bees. After being trained on colored flowers with different reinforcements, bees that interacted with a conspecific in a positive affective state were quicker and more likely than controls to land on ambiguous colored flowers, indicating the transfer of a positive judgment bias between bees. Additional observations and experiments showed that affect could be transmitted between bees without physical contact, i.e., through visual modality alone. Our findings suggest that affective contagion may be an evolutionarily widespread mechanism present in both social vertebrates and social insects.",

Introgression of a new transposable element insertion and linked protein-coding variation underpin a transspecific throat color polymorphism, which stable isotopes suggest is associated with alternative foraging niches. Cointrogression of linked regulatory ASIP variation resulted in mantle color convergence in one species, whereas convergent color evolution at the genus level required new variation.

Within 4 milliseconds of synaptic activation, SVs transiently “kiss” the plasma membrane, forming a ~4-nanometer lipidic fusion pore flanked by putative soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes and then rapidly “shrink” to approximately half of their original surface area. By 70 milliseconds, most shrunken SVs recycle via a “run-away” pathway, whereas others collapse into the presynaptic membrane.

We report an experimental realization of an electrically controlled interlayer trion fluid in van der Waals heterostructures. In strongly coupled e-h bilayers, electrons and holes spontaneously form three-particle trion bound states. The interlayer trions can assume 1e-2h and 2e-1h configurations. We show that the two holes in 1e-2h trions form a spin-singlet with a spin gap of approximately one milli–electron volt. By electrostatic gating, the equilibrium state can be continuously tuned into an exciton fluid, a trion fluid, an exciton-trion mixture, or a trion-charge mixture. Our work demonstrates a platform to study correlated phases of tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures.",

In this study, we report room-temperature, switchable charge localization in high-quality bilayer transistors that comprise a monolayer of molecular crystal on top of a monolayer semiconductor. By using an ion gate, we selectively populated either localized molecular states or semiconductor band states, achieving complete localization from mobile charges at densities up to 3 × 10 13 per square centimeter. This transition was energetically stabilized by the formation of coupled electron-ion dipoles, which could be tuned through Coulomb engineering. These properties further enabled single-band ambipolar transistor operation without substitutional dopants, demonstrating the potential of electron-ion correlations for practical electronic applications.",

          "abstract": "Biological invasions can alter ecosystems, yet their impacts vary across ecological contexts. Using a global meta-analysis of 775 studies (2223 effect sizes) in terrestrial systems, we show that the most consistent negative impacts are reductions in native plant diversity caused by invasive plants and increases in greenhouse gas emissions driven by both invasive plants and animals. However, evidence of publication bias suggests the latter should be interpreted with caution. Invader residence time emerged as a key predictor: Longer residence times intensified the negative effects of invasive plants on native diversity, whereas impacts on soil abiotic properties tended to weaken over time. Our synthesis reveals that some properties, such as native plant diversity, remain persistently sensitive to invasion, whereas others are more variable as invasions persist.",

Caloric refrigeration cycles offer a path forward but most rely on solid-state materials with limited temperature lift, low performance, and poor fluidity, which hinder scalability. We introduce a liquid-phase dipolarcaloric refrigeration cycle utilizing endothermic dissolution of nitrate-based salts regenerated via electrodialysis. This cycle achieves large adiabatic temperature changes and high coefficients of performance. We identify effective salt-water pairs and validate the cycle experimentally, supported by thermodynamic modeling. Among these, ammonium nitrate is suited for refrigeration, while potassium nitrate is appropriate for air conditioning. The system uses abundant, low-cost materials, and its fluidic nature ensures efficient heat transfer and scalability.

          "abstract": "As droughts become longer and more intense, impacts on terrestrial primary productivity are expected to increase progressively. Yet, some ecosystems appear to acclimate to multiyear drought, with constant or diminishing reductions in productivity as drought duration increases. We quantified the combined effects of drought duration and intensity on aboveground productivity in 74 grasslands and shrublands distributed globally. Ecosystem acclimation with multiyear drought was observed overall, except when droughts were extreme (i.e., ≤1-in-100-year likelihood of occurrence). Productivity losses after four consecutive years of extreme drought increased by ~2.5-fold compared with those of the first year. These results portend a foundational shift in ecosystem behavior if drought duration and intensity increase, from maintenance of reduced functioning over time to progressive and profound losses of productivity when droughts are extreme.",

Active modifications to the spatial environment could therefore be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing control- or pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis. Pathogen exposure led to architectural changes, including faster nest growth, increased interentrance distance, transmission-inhibitory changes in nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced transmission and highlighted a synergy between architectural and behavioral responses to disease. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organization can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.",

In the root parasitic plant Phtheirospermum japonicum , prehaustorium formation is triggered by host-secreted haustorium-inducing factors (HIFs), but it is unresponsive to its own exudates. Here we report the identification of the spontaneous prehaustorium 1 ( spoh1 ) mutant, which forms prehaustoria without external host signals. spoh1 harbors a point mutation in the gene encoding uridine diphosphate–glucosyltransferase UGT72B1, an enzyme that glucosylates and thereby inactivates phenolic HIFs. PjUGT72B1 has a different substrate specificity than its ortholog of the host Arabidopsis . Introduction of PjUGT72B1 into Arabidopsis reduced prehaustorium induction activity, indicating that UGT72B1 regulates haustorium induction by hosts.

In this work, we investigate a widely cited example of urban adaptation, Culex pipiens form molestus , also known as the London Underground mosquito. Population genomic analysis of ~350 contemporary and historical samples counters the popular hypothesis that molestus originated belowground in London &lt;200 years ago. Instead, we show that molestus first adapted to human environments aboveground in the Mediterranean or Middle East over the course of more than 1000 years, possibly in association with ancient agricultural civilizations of the Middle East. Our results highlight the role of early human society in priming taxa for contemporary urban evolution.

PER2-S662 phosphorylation correlated with genome-wide expression pathways that regulate polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) conversion into oxylipins in the hypothalamus. Partial hydrogenation of dietary PUFAs increased hypothalamic PER2-S662 phosphorylation and entrainment to a summer photoperiod in control mice, but not in mice for which PER2-S662 could not be phosphorylated. PER2-S662 phosphorylation is influenced by, and alters the regulation of, unsaturated fat to control circadian phase shifting across the seasons.",

          "abstract": "Phenotypic drug screening remains constrained by the vastness of chemical space and technical challenges scaling experimental workflows. To overcome these barriers, computational methods have been developed to prioritize compounds, but they rely on either single-task models lacking generalizability or heuristic-based genomic proxies that resist optimization. We designed an active deep-learning framework that leverages omics to enable scalable, optimizable identification of compounds that induce complex phenotypes. Our generalizable algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art models on classical recall, translating to a 13-17x increase in phenotypic hit-rate across two hematological discovery campaigns. Combining this algorithm with a lab-in-the-loop signature refinement step, we achieved an additional two-fold increase in hit-rate and molecular insights. In sum, our framework enables efficient phenotypic hit identification campaigns, with broad potential to accelerate drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "It has long been debated whether non-avian dinosaurs went extinct abruptly or gradually at the end-Cretaceous (66 million years ago), because their fossil record at this time is mostly limited to northern North America. We constrain a dinosaur-rich unit to the south, the Naashoibito Member in New Mexico, to the very latest Cretaceous (~66.4 to 66.0 million years), preserving some of the last-known non-avian dinosaurs. Ecological modeling shows that North American terrestrial vertebrates maintained high diversity and endemism in the latest Cretaceous and early Paleogene, with bioprovinces shaped by temperature and geography. This counters the notion of a low-diversity cross-continental fauna and suggests that dinosaurs were diverse and partitioned into regionally distinct assemblages during the final few hundred thousand years before the end-Cretaceous asteroid impact.",

We examined spatial patterns of heat exposure along the ~560-kilometer length of FCR and the mortality of two ecologically important, critically endangered reef-building corals. Sea surface temperatures were ≥31°C for an average of 40.7 days, leading to heat exposures 2.2- to fourfold higher than all prior years on record. In the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas, 97.8 to 100% of the Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis colonies died. Mortality was lower offshore southeast Florida (37.9%), reflecting cooler temperatures in this region. Since the late 1970s, multiple stressors had already reduced the ecological relevance of Acropora in Florida, but the 2023 heat wave marks their functional extinction from FCR.",

One promising approach to overcoming resistance is using small molecules that resensitize MRSA to existing drugs. Here, we report the enantioselective total synthesis of one such promising candidate, (−)-spiroaspertrione A, a complex meroterpenoid of the andiconin family. This natural product has long eluded synthesis because of its densely functionalized polycyclic backbone. Our route features a stereoselective Diels-Alder cycloaddition, followed by a key divinylcyclopropane rearrangement forming the spirobicyclo[3.2.2]nonane core, which proved to be reversible and was further investigated by density functional theory calculations. Strategic late-stage functionalization of the compact cage architecture enabled access to the natural product and provided evidence for a plausible biosynthetic relationship with (−)-aspermerodione.",

However, existing high-resolution fluorescence microscopes are physically limited by objective-to-specimen distance, which prevents the study of whole-mount specimens without physical sectioning. To address this challenge, we developed a photochemical strategy for spatially precise sectioning of specimens. By combining serial photochemical sectioning with lattice light-sheet imaging and petabyte-scale computation, we imaged and reconstructed axons and myelin sheaths across entire mouse olfactory bulbs at nanoscale resolution. An olfactory bulb–wide analysis of myelinated and unmyelinated axons revealed distinctive patterns of axon degeneration and de-/dysmyelination in the neurodegenerative brain, highlighting the potential for peta- to exabyte-scale super-resolution studies using this approach.",

          "abstract": "Metal ions are essential in regulating protein functions through interactions with residues such as cysteine, but comprehensive mapping of metal-specific metalloproteomes in mammals remains limited. Here, we introduce CysMP, a cysteine-centered metalloprotein profiling strategy to profile the metalloproteomes of 11 key metal ions. CysMP identified 8895 metal-binding sites across 4150 proteins, enabling quantitative comparisons between different metals and revealing both their binding promiscuity and preferences. Notably, zinc and copper ions exhibit the broadest protein interaction profiles. CysMP uncovers numerous potential metalloproteins. We demonstrate that copper and zinc bind to and inhibit 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, resulting in the accumulation of 5′-methylthioadenosine. Furthermore, copper binding suppresses phosphoglycerate kinase 1 activity, leading to a down-regulation of glycolysis. Our work not only establishes a valuable resource for a dual-specific metalloproteome database but also paves the way for understanding the molecular insights of metalloprotein functions.",

In contrast, the mycobiome and resident viruses showed no significant coevolution with host immunity. By 1 year, infants who previously wheezed displayed an upper airway microbiota enriched in Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella , accompanied by a distinct local and systemic immune gene signature featuring elevated classical monocyte-related genes.

On the basis of Earth’s core mass fraction and oxygen fugacity during core formation, a self-consistent hydrous core-mantle differentiation model yields a bulk Earth water content of ~0.23 weight % (equivalently ~10 ocean masses), a bulk Earth magnesium/silicon ratio of 1.16 ± 0.01, and a mantle magnesium/silicon ratio of 1.25 to 1.28. The initial core would contain 3.5 to 4.1 weight % silicon, 2.9 to 3.1 weight % oxygen, 0.11 to 0.14 weight % magnesium, and 0.04 to 0.10 weight % hydrogen, along with sulfur and carbon.

We reconstituted the V/A-ATPase into liposomes and performed structural analysis using cryo-EM under conditions where the proton motive force was applied in the presence of ADP and Pi. ATP molecules were bound at two of the three catalytic sites of V/A-ATPase, confirming that the structure represents a state adopted during ATP synthesis. In this structure, the catalytic site closes upon binding of ADP and Pi through an induced fit mechanism. Multiple structures were obtained where the membrane-embedded rotor ring was in a different position relative to the stator. By comparing these structures, we found that torsion occurs in both the central rotor and the peripheral stator during 31° rotation of rotor ring. These structural snapshots of V/A-ATPase provide crucial insights into the mechanism of rotary catalysis of ATP synthesis.",

          "abstract": "A common developmental response to resource competition is an inducible offense, the facultative predation of competitors. At its extreme, this response involves the development of alternative phenotypic morphs, or polyphenism. However, how polyphenism evolves to meet ecological challenges, such as competitor species, is unknown. Using replicated experimental evolution, during which starved nematodes could consume heterospecific competitors, we investigated whether induction of a predatory morph could evolve and how generalizable this change’s genetic basis is. Fifty generations of evolution across multiple populations resulted in parallel changes in higher morph-induction and parallel genomic responses, including repeated selection for a specific transcription-factor binding-site variant. In tandem, we artificially selected directly for tooth morphology and drove the predatory morph near to fixation. That trait-specific selection promoted greater changes in predatory morph induction than experimental evolution indicates that polyphenism evolution is balanced by selection for whole-organism performance. Our results thus describe the predictability by which a resource polyphenism evolves amid scarce resources.",

          "abstract": "Two decades after the initial report on increased micronuclei in human chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), their role in HCC development is still poorly understood. Here, we show that micronuclei in hepatocytes trigger a hepatic immune response and promote HCC development via an increased level of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). Livers of a CLD model ( Mcl1 Δhep mice) show increased micronuclei and eccDNA levels. Circular sequencing confirms higher eccDNA levels in micronuclei compared to primary nuclei. The nuclei-segregated DNA fiber (NuSeF) assay we developed demonstrates that micronuclei are more susceptible to replication stress, exhibiting increased replication fork slowing. Comparing different murine liver disease models reveals that high eccDNA correlates with an increased tumor incidence. eccDNA is a strong immunostimulant and promotes a cross-talk between hepatocytes and immune cells through the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of Sting1 in Mcl1 Δhep mice reduces immune cell chemotaxis and tumor incidence. Our findings suggest that eccDNA from micronuclei mediates inflammation-driven liver carcinogenesis in CLD.",

Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells from patients with glioma, NR4A family genes were identified as closely associated with T cell exhaustion and were coexpressed with dysfunctional genes HAVCR2 and TIGIT . Notably, CAR T cells with NR4A3 knockdown exhibited enhanced cytotoxic activity against tumors, leading to improved tumor clearance and prolonged survival in vivo. However, the promoted antiexhausted phenotype diminished with prolonged tumor burden. This decline in T cell function correlates with the compensatory down-regulation of FOS induced by chronic antigen exposure following NR4A3 knockdown. Overexpressing FOS alongside NR4A3 knockdown robustly boosted the antitumor responses of CAR T cells by skewing their phenotypes and transcriptional profiles away from exhaustion and toward increased effector function. These findings offer a promising strategy for the clinical modification of CAR T cell therapy.",

          "abstract": "Spermiogenesis, the final phrase of spermatogenesis, involves replacing histones by protamines, a process known as histone-to-protamine exchange, which is crucial for chromatin condensation. While this exchange is essential, the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we discovered that the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC19 functions as a key regulator of mouse spermiogenesis. Loss of Zdhhc19 leads to male infertility and abnormal sperm morphology. Zdhhc19 -deficient sperm exhibit impaired histone-to-protamine exchange, leading to retention of histones and misdistribution of protamines. Similarly, the palmitoyltransferase catalytic site mutant Zdhhc19 C142S knock-in mice show reduced fertility, sperm abnormalities, and histone retention. Mechanistically, ZDHHC19 mediates histone H3 palmitoylation at cysteine-110, weakening H3-H4 interactions and increasing chromatin accessibility. Palmitoylation of H3 facilitates histone-to-protamine exchange. This study highlights the essential role of ZDHHC19’s palmitoyl-transferase activity in histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis and underscores the broader role of histone palmitoylation in chromatin remodeling.",

Here, we present a multistep screening platform to optimize LNP formulations for gene-editing protein delivery, focusing on in vivo T cell targeting. Through in vitro screening of a composition library, we identified top-performing candidates. In vivo screening in Ai9 mice revealed a spleen-tropic LNP formulation that preferentially targets T cells, enabling efficient gene editing in vivo. Using this LNP formulation, we achieved targeted knockout of CCR5 and PD-1 in splenic T cells, supporting potential applications in HIV resistance and cancer immunotherapy.

          "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa exploits host-derived phosphatidylcholine (PC) to establish persistent lung infections, yet the mechanistic link between metabolic adaptation and pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that choline (Cho)–induced regulator (CodR), a GcvA-type transcriptional regulator, serves as a master regulator integrating virulence, antibiotic resistance, and PC catabolism during pulmonary infection. CodR directly binds Cho, the key metabolite of PC degradation, to activate pchP and norA , facilitating exogenous PC/Cho utilization. Genome-wide profiling reveals that CodR targets conserved motifs in promoters of mexA , pslA , and amrZ , synchronizing virulence and tolerance pathways. codR deletion attenuated biofilm formation, type III secretion system activity, siderophore production, and PC catabolism, reducing bacterial pathogenicity in a murine pneumonia model. Notably, Cho/PC pretreatment potentiates CodR-dependent transcriptional activation of antibiotic resistance genes, elevating tolerance to ciprofloxacin and meropenem. Our findings elucidate a paradigm wherein P. aeruginosa co-opts host-derived Cho via CodR to simultaneously potentiate virulence and antibiotic resilience, exposing CodR as a druggable node to break infection-resistance synergies.",

          "abstract": "The shift from sprawling to erect limb postures in archosaurs during the Triassic represents a major evolutionary transformation in vertebrates. One unresolved question regarding the limb posture transition is its association with body size evolution. If adopting more erect limb postures reduces mass-specific muscle forces and bone stresses, it would enable the evolution of larger body sizes. We tested this prediction using computational modeling and simulation of hindlimb muscle activations and femoral stresses across limb postures and body sizes in juvenile to adult American alligators and a scaled model of the extinct giant alligatoroid Deinosuchus riograndensis . We showed that larger alligators and D. riograndensis encounter challenges in generating sufficient muscle forces to support their bodies and maintain bone stresses, whereas adopting more erect hindlimb postures helps mitigate bone stresses among individuals of similar sizes. These results show how the shift from sprawling to erect limb posture relaxed biomechanical constraints, potentially facilitating the evolution of larger body sizes in terrestrial tetrapods.",

A versatile strategy is proposed to synthesize fully transparent precursors with metal salt loading of up to 70%, which allows for high-resolution optical nanofabrication. Combining two-photon polymerization with a two-step sintering process, we fabricate fully dense and high-fidelity HEC 3D architectures. The high-entropy effect promotes the generation of high-density dislocations, thus enhancing both the strength and ductility of HEC nanolattices.

          "abstract": "The cellular programs that mediate therapy resistance are often important drivers of metastasis, a phenomenon that needs to be understood better to improve screening and treatment options for patients with cancer. Although this issue has been studied extensively for chemotherapy, less is known about a causal link between resistance to radiation therapy and metastasis. We investigated this problem in triple-negative breast cancer and established that radiation-resistant tumor cells have enhanced metastatic capacity. Resistance to radiation increases the expression of integrin β3 ( ITGB3 ), which promotes enhanced migration and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experimentation revealed an enrichment of RNA metabolism pathways that stabilize ITGB3 transcripts. Specifically, the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L ( HNRNPL ), whose expression is regulated by Nrf2, mediates the formation of circular RNAs that sponge the family of let-7 microRNAs that target ITGB3 . Collectively, our findings identify a mechanism of radiation-induced metastasis that is driven by alterations in RNA metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Accretion ages of the first planetesimals—parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites—suggest that they formed within the first 0.5 to 1 million years of Solar System history. Yet, planetesimal formation appears to have occurred in at least two distinct phases. A temporal offset separates early-forming bodies from later-forming chondrite parent bodies, which accreted 2 to 3 million years after the Solar System onset—an unresolved aspect of Solar System formation. Here, we use numerical simulations to show that Jupiter’s early formation reshaped its natal protoplanetary disk. Jupiter’s rapid growth depleted the inner disk gas and generated pressure bumps and dust traps that manifested as rings. These structures caused dust to accumulate and led to a second-generation planetesimal population, with ages matching those of noncarbonaceous chondrites. Meanwhile, the evolving gas structure suppressed terrestrial embryos’ inward migration, preventing them from reaching the innermost regions. Jupiter likely played a key role in shaping the inner Solar System, consistent with structures observed in class II and transition disks.",

However, how these chaperones mitigate protein-folding stress remains unclear. Here, using correlated cryo–electron tomography, we show that folding stress triggers marked mitochondrial morphological changes, including the accumulation of amorphous protein aggregates and increased abundance and spatial clustering of the mitochondrial heat shock protein 60-heat shock protein 10 (mtHsp60-Hsp10) complex. Subtomogram analysis revealed the in situ architecture and conformational heterogeneity of mtHsp60-Hsp10 under stress, which retains its canonical double-ring structure while adopting distinct football, half-football, and bullet-like states. Notably, the mtHsp60-Hsp10 complex encapsulates unstructured substrates through conserved hydrophobic interactions. We further demonstrate that knockdown of the mtHsp60-Hsp10 complex exacerbates folding stress, as evidenced by elevated cellular stress responses and activation of mitophagy. Our study defines the in situ structural properties of the mtHsp60-Hsp10 complex and provides mechanistic insight into how it safeguards mitochondrial proteostasis under folding stress.",

Current gene therapy approaches aim to restore a shortened form of dystrophin (microdystrophin) via adeno-associated vector delivery. While recent clinical studies show promise, therapeutic efficacy remains incomplete, emphasizing the need for improved approaches. Here, we identified lysosomal perturbations in myofibers of patients with DMD and animal models, an overlooked mechanism of cellular damage in muscular dystrophies. These were notably marked by the up-regulation and recruitment of Galectin-3, a biomarker of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, to lysosomes, alongside alterations in lysosome number, morphology, and function. Microdystrophin therapy in Dmd mdx mice fails to fully correct these damages. However, combining it with trehalose, a lysosome-protective disaccharide, substantially improves the outcome, enhancing muscle function, myopathology, and transcriptome. These findings highlight lysosomal damage as an important pathomechanism in DMD and suggest that combining trehalose with gene therapy could enhance therapeutic efficacy.",

This activity mode had important functional consequences to sound processing during task performance. We show that the slow firing rate modulations caused the ongoing activity just before sound presentations to be higher during task performance than during passive listening. Concurrently, during task performance, the responses to target stimuli were weaker but more informative about the task-relevant sounds. In a model, higher ongoing activity caused more synaptic depression of the cortico-cortical synapses, reducing the tendency of the network to produce population spikes and resulting in weaker but more informative responses to sounds.",

Vasa vasorum, microvessels supplying arterial walls, are conjectured to induce inflammation and leakage in IAs that drive adverse remodeling. Using scanning immunofluorescent multiphoton imaging and micro–computed tomography to visualize intact IA specimens, we identified an extensive vasa vasorum plexus in the IA wall. Our quantitative analyses show significant colocalization of vasa vasorum with calcifications, a strong correlation with increased wall thickness ( R 2  = 0.96, P  &lt; 0.001), and associations with well-defined multiaxially oriented collagen fibers. These findings highlight a more nuanced role for vasa vasorum, suggesting both adverse and protective remodeling influences, which may critically affect IA rupture risk. Contrary to the prevailing view of vasa vasorum as solely adverse, this study underscores the contribution to IA wall stability and the need to elucidate their functional impact on IA pathophysiology.

          "abstract": "Time-resolved spectroscopy has long served as a cornerstone technique for investigating the photophysics of materials. However, conventional methods based on intense optical pulses and ensemble measurements often fail to resolve quantum dynamics due to spectral overlap, coherent artifacts, and multiphoton effects. To overcome these limitations, single-photon transient stimulated emission (SP-TSE) has been proposed as a femtosecond spectroscopy technique using quantum light and detection principles. Here, we theoretically demonstrate frequency-resolved SP-TSE. Unlike semiclassical techniques, SP-TSE reveals a strong dependence of the time-resolved spectrum on the frequency-resolving method. With a tunable optical filter, the observed spectrum reflects a quantum double-slit interference in the time-frequency domain. In contrast, interferometric detection produces spectra resembling semiclassical results, but the signal emerges specifically from the second harmonic frequency window due to quantum interference. This framework provides insight into ultrafast quantum processes and suggests a foundation for future applications in quantum spectroscopy and technologies.",

The N m -binding protein candidates exhibit enriched binding at known N m sites. Some candidates display nuclear localization and functions. We focused on the splicing factor FUBP1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay validated preference of FUBP1 to N m -modified RNA. As FUBP1 predominantly binds intronic regions, we profiled N m sites in chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) and found N m enrichment within introns. Depletion of N m led to skipped exons, suggesting N m -dependent splicing regulation. The caRNA N m sites overlap with FUBP1-binding sites, and N m depletion reduced FUBP1 occupancy on modified regions. Furthermore, FUBP1 depletion induced exon skipping in N m -modified genes, supporting its role in mediating N m -dependent splicing regulation. Overall, our findings identify FUBP1 as an N m -binding protein and uncover previously unrecognized nuclear functions for RNA N m modification.",

However, most existing fluorescent probes are prone to background interference and limited renal targeting.

In AKI kidneys, RP-SC was hydrolyzed and slowly released encapsulated Hcy-BOH and Cy-Dopa. The H 2 O 2 level was semi-quantitatively analyzed by fluorescence ratio ( F Hcy-BOH / F Cy-Dopa ). RP-SC exhibited prominent renal fluorescence in AKI mice, making it possible to accurately diagnose AKI and dynamically monitor renal function for up to 60 hours. RP-SC could monitor the process of AKI in vivo and provide an earlier warning of AKI than traditional strategies, subsequently evaluating the recovery of renal function after N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment. Our study confirmed the ability of RP-SC for longitudinal monitoring of renal function in vivo by dual-targeting capacity, providing an effective tool for accurate diagnosis of early AKI while tracking the dynamic process of AKI treatment.",

We successfully demonstrated the extraction of mitochondria from living cells, which is validated through fluorescence labeling before and after extraction. Subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that the extracted sample contained mitochondria.

Using a delayed-response task in mice, we identified distinct cortical contributions to impulse control during waiting. Optogenetic inhibition revealed that the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC) promotes patience, the anterior insular cortex (AIC) drives impulsivity, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) regulates temporal precision in waiting. Calcium imaging uncovered region-specific computations: PPC neurons predominantly encoded absolute elapsed time through time cell-like activity, tiling the waiting period independently of patience levels. Their activity predicted the waiting precision. Meanwhile, dmFC and AIC neurons exhibited opposing lick-related activity—dmFC neurons preferentially decreasing and AIC neurons increasing activity during licking. Furthermore, their activity changes during waiting predicted patience. These findings reveal distinct yet complementary mechanisms underlying impulse control during waiting: The PPC encodes temporal information crucial for regulating waiting behavior, while the dmFC-AIC circuit orchestrates a push-pull dynamic to regulate patience.",

          "abstract": "Tamm plasmon polariton (TPP) has unique localization and manipulability but cannot be excited with ultrathin metal films. We propose a strategy to realize generalized TPP (GTPP) in an ultrathin metal film as metainterface by introducing a low-loss dielectric Bragg reflector compensation layer, enabling effectively excitation of GTPP at its interface and achieving near-perfect absorption (~99.1%) at the resonant wavelength of 532 nanometers. This excitation has topological robustness, which fundamentally stems from its intrinsic tolerance to fabrication imperfections. A 14-channel narrowband absorbers chip based on GTPP has been fabricated. Compared to conventional structures without GTPP excitation, this device can lower the reverse saturable absorption threshold (~7.7 × 10 −5 nanojoules per square micrometer) and increase the fluorescence intensity above the residual laser intensity to enhance the extinction capability by two orders of magnitude. These findings provide both evidence for applications of micro-nano photonic devices in fields such as laser elimination and offer insights for other scenarios.",

However, it remains uncertain whether the emission is related to flare-like activity similar to the Sun or magnetospheric process akin to magnetized planets. Using observations (1.0 to 1.5 gigahertz) taken by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we found a type of millisecond-scale radio bursts with exceptionally high-frequency drift rates (~8 gigahertz per second) from an active M dwarf, AD Leo. The ultrafast drift rates point to a source region with a notably low magnetic scale height (&lt;0.15 r ⋆ , r ⋆ as the stellar radius), a feature not expected in a commonly assumed dipole-like global field but highly possible in localized strong-field structures, i.e., starspots. Our findings suggest that a concentrated magnetic field above starspots could be responsible for some of the most intense radio bursts from M dwarfs, supporting a solar-like electron acceleration mechanism.",

Here, we report the remolding of bacterial laccase, catalyzing conversions of dopamine and O 2 to o -quinone and H 2 O, into a biocatalytic neuromodulator by reactive oxygen species–free dopamine catabolism. Given the poor activity of native laccase in the physiological context because of OH − inhibition of its geometrically constrained O 2 -reducing center, we designed a highly dynamic Ru-Cu binuclear center to counteract the inhibition effect. Structural and computational investigations unravel a self-adaptive catalytic mechanism by reversive Ru-Cu active site reconfiguration that lowers the kinetic barriers for O 2 -to-H 2 O conversion in neutral solution. The remolded laccase exhibits substantial enhancement of physiological activity (up to one order of magnitude) and improved catecholamine substrate specificity, enabling whole-cell down-regulation of vesicular dopamine and extracellular erasure of evoked dopamine signals in intact brains.

How HPV enters the nucleus after exiting the Golgi is unclear, although mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) appears important. Here, we show that importin-7 (IPO7), a nuclear pore import receptor, is present at the Golgi and promotes HPV infection. IPO7 knockdown inhibits infection and causes HPV to accumulate in the Golgi without reaching mitotic chromosomes, demonstrating that IPO7 promotes Golgi-to-nucleus transport of HPV. Golgi-to-nucleus transport of a cellular cargo also requires IPO7, suggesting that HPV hijacks a preexisting pathway for nuclear entry. Furthermore, the C-terminal nuclear localization sequence of HPV L2 protein, which overlaps its cell-penetrating peptide sequence, binds IPO7 directly in a COPI-dependent virus trafficking step. Together, these data identify a role for an importin in HPV infection and suggest that the canonical nuclear pore import machinery plays an unanticipated role in NEB-dependent nuclear entry.",

Here, we examine this hazard by combining a unique inventory of debris flows from the Wenchuan earthquake with numerical modeling to constrain their magnitude and frequency. We show that large debris flows occur more frequently than expected, on the basis of magnitude-frequency relationships for all debris flows, when high volumes of sediment are deposited in channels. These findings are consistent with other large sediment-generating events globally, such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo where multiple large debris flows were triggered following volcanic eruptions that produced several cubic kilometers of sediment.",

Disease progression was blunted in Lyn kinase-dead mice indicating a contribution for kinase-independent Lyn functions in restraining autoantibody production, glomerulonephritis, Toll-like receptor signaling, and splenomegaly. Further comparative analyses identified an exclusive role for the kinase-dependent functions of Lyn in regulating B cell receptor signaling, dendritic cell phenotype, and type I interferon production.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 report explores scenarios using an updated carbon budget approach—the net-zero pathways—designed to avoid temporary overshoot of the 1.5°C temperature limit. We assess whether net-zero pathways consistently improve air pollution outcomes using a global source-receptor air pollution model to estimate concentrations, health impacts, and economic damages.

It identifies optimal procedures for the amounts of overlap that would maintain its predictions’ correctness and shows that these procedures could yield a sequence of tables that would anticipate every solar eclipse observable in the Mayan territory from a century or two after the first evidence of the Mayan lunar calendar to at least the era of the extant eclipse table, 700 years later.",

We furthermore evaluate the therapeutic potential of neutralizing leptin with this antibody across distinct mouse models of fibrosis affecting the kidney, liver, lung, heart, and blood vessels. Leptin neutralization markedly inhibited fibrosis progression in all models.

          "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) demonstrate immense potential as naturally derived carriers of active therapeutics. To maximize their capacity, it is crucial to develop effective methods for manipulating cargo and ensuring scalability. To address this challenge, we propose that protein-free mRNA granule-like structures, named gene-encoded nanoparticle RNA for inducing superior EVs (GENRISE), can function as active translational sponge and as transient subcellular compartments. The overexpression of proteins in proximity to RNA assemblies stimulates parental cells to release excess exogenous proteins in induced superior EVs (iSEVs). The iSEV system enables the single-module–based enrichment of exogenous cargo in EVs with scalable manufacturing. By harnessing mass-produced iSEVs induced by GENRISEs, encoding an antigenic peptide, we have successfully demonstrated target-specific in vivo cancer immunotherapy. These findings suggest that the emerging iSEV platform shows considerable potential for biomedical applications by enabling the controlled production of cargo-specific EVs.",

          "abstract": "The oxygen isotope composition (δ 18 O) of Phanerozoic seawater has been widely investigated, but the δ 18 O values of Precambrian seawater remain poorly constrained, with ongoing debate over whether they were substantially lower than those of Phanerozoic seawater. To address this question, we analyzed the clumped isotopes of limestones from the North China Craton to reconstruct Mesoproterozoic seawater temperature and δ 18 O values. Our results indicate that the Mesoproterozoic seawater had a temperature of 26.9° ± 0.4°C and a δ 18 O value of −6.3 ± 0.2 per mil (relative to standard mean ocean water). This δ 18 O estimate aligns with previous inferences from geochemical modeling, marine iron oxides, and oxygen isotope ensembles, supporting the hypothesis that Mesoproterozoic seawater was isotopically lighter than its Phanerozoic counterpart. These findings provide insights into the Earth’s paleoclimate and the evolution of seawater composition during the Mesoproterozoic era.",

Here, we report a mechanism to include photon-electron-phonon interactions, demonstrating the excitation of mode-locked optomechanical microcombs in a graphene-deposited silica microresonator, determined by the synergy of optomechanical back action and graphene saturable absorption. The circulating optical field induces mechanical oscillations that modulate the light wave, while Pauli blocking in graphene locks a single optomechanical mode, forming a localized coherent optical wave packet within a single microcavity. In addition, using frequency division techniques, the mode-locked optomechanical microcomb achieves repetition stability with phase noise reduced to −110.5 decibels relative to the carrier per hertz at a 1-hertz offset and an Allan deviation as low as 3 × 10 −12 @ 20 seconds, comparable to a standard rubidium clock.",

Using a pyrazinacene-based probe ( TEG 8 -N14 ), we unexpectedly achieved discrimination of multiple cell states, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and senescence, based on RNA/DNA changes. Specifically, TEG 8 -N14 selectively stains necrotic cells in live samples, while after fixation, it allows detection of ultraearly senescence in UV-vis–sensitive cells, providing approximately twofold greater informational content than existing RNA or DNA fluorophores. These findings break current imaging barriers by enabling comprehensive visualization of single-cell fate histories without being affected by UV-vis or genetic manipulation.",

To overcome this limitation, we present a magnetically controlled microrobot that integrates two functional modules: a magnetic actuation (MA) module for agile navigation and an ultrasound-responsive self-expanding stent module (ST module) for lesion-specific dilation. The system uses a dynamically tunable assembly mechanism governed by rotational direction enabling integrated locomotion (clockwise) and on-demand module separation (counterclockwise) at stenotic sites. The platform is compatible with intraoperative ultrasound, allowing real-time navigation and thermally triggered expansion in physiological environments. By synergizing programmable magnetic actuation, ultrasound-mediated expansion, and clinical workflow compatibility, the robot can navigate tortuous phantom ducts, achieving controlled stent deployment within 3 seconds and complete expansion within 30 seconds, permitting minimally invasive treatment of biliary strictures. This work advances microrobotic stent delivery by overcoming key barriers to clinical translation in endoluminal interventions.",

          "abstract": "Microglial functions rely on their morphodynamic versatility and inflammatory response, yet the molecular determinants, particularly ion channels and receptors, remain poorly understood. Here, we identify chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1), a protein known to exist in both soluble and membrane-associated forms, as highly enriched in human and murine microglia, with minimal expression in other brain cells. Acute blockade or genetic deletion of CLIC1 markedly attenuates microglial surveillance by reducing ramification and motility, without affecting chemotaxis. This phenotype is recapitulated in xenografted human microglia and human brain tissue. Mechanistically, CLIC1 effects involve interactions with actin-binding ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins, suggesting a role in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Contrary to its name, CLIC1 functions are chloride-independent and thus unlikely to reflect ion channel activity. This is supported by patch-clamp electrophysiology revealing lack of chloride conductance in surveillant microglia. Following ATP–evoked activation, CLIC1 blockade strongly suppresses NLRP3–dependent interleukin-1β release, suggesting therapeutic potential against neuroinflammation.",

While advances have been made in identifying individual genes regulating synapse development, the molecular programs orchestrating their action during circuit integration of neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we take a multiomic approach to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs), comprising transcription factors (TFs), regulatory regions, and predicted target genes, in hippocampal granule cells (GCs). We find a dynamic gene regulatory code, with early and late postnatal GRNs regulating cell morphogenesis and synapse organization and plasticity, respectively. Our results predict sequential regulations, with early-active TFs delaying the activation of later GRNs and their putative synaptic targets. Using a loss-of-function approach, we identify Bcl6 as a regulator of pre- and postsynaptic structural maturation and synaptic transmission and Smad3 as a modulator of inhibitory synaptic transmission in GCs. Together, these findings highlight the networks of key TFs and target genes orchestrating GC synapse development.",

While fibrosis has been proposed to drive progressive organ damage, antifibrotic therapies have failed in clinical trials. Here, we reveal that tubular vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) expression precedes nephron loss, fibrosis, and long-term kidney dysfunction. Using serial intravital microscopy in transgenic mice, we track tubulointerstitial remodeling between injured and intact tissue over 3 weeks. VCAM1 is rapidly induced in a distinct subset of injured tubules, preceding atrophy with sustained fibroblast recruitment. However, fibroblasts remain confined to injury sites and do not cause secondary damage in uninjured tubules. Last, in human kidney transplant biopsies, tubular VCAM1 expression, but not kidney injury molecule 1, correlates negatively with early and 12-month graft function, underscoring its potential as a biomarker of adverse outcomes. These findings position VCAM1 as an early indicator of tubular fate and nephron loss.",

          "abstract": "When reducing pixel size below the wavelength of light, the conventional stacked geometry of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is dominated by sharp nanoelectrode contours. This causes spatially imbalanced charge carrier transport and recombination resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and filament formation accelerating device failure. Here, we circumvent these limitations by selectively passivating nanoelectrode edges with an insulating layer, while simultaneously defining a nanoaperture in flat areas. We thereby ensure controlled charge carrier recombination and suppress filament growth. After demonstrating efficient hole injection by gold nanoelectrodes, we realize individually addressable subwavelength OLED pixels (300 nanometers by 300 nanometers) based on plasmonic gold patch antennas for light extraction. We achieve an EQE of 1%, a maximum luminance of 3000 candela per square meter, and fast response times exceeding video rates.

To facilitate efficient DC migration, constant cross-talk between actin and microtubules is required to coordinate cytoskeletal networks and actomyosin contractility, but the related mechanisms have not been extensively characterized. We show that mouse DCs lacking Kif5b (the heavy chain of kinesin-1) exhibit a major impairment in cell migration in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, kinesin-1 coordinates cytoskeletal cross-talk between actin and microtubules during DC migration by modulating negatively RhoA activity through its interaction with GEF-H1, thereby limiting GEF-H1’s availability in the cytosol. The same mechanism operates in human primary monocyte–derived DCs and regulates efficient migration in a confined environment. Thus, our results highlight kinesin-1 as a key regulator of DC migration, through its coordinated control of cytoskeletal dynamics.",

RRM2 was identified as a critical driver of poor prognosis and Osi resistance in NSCLC. The 124 I/Cy5.5-sO@FCLs enabled real-time tracking of tumor targeting and biodistribution, and CRISPR-Cas9–mediated RRM2 disruption efficiently reversed Osi resistance and potentiated synergistic anticancer effects, which was attributed to counteracting TGF-β/Smad2/3–mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and amplifying cGAS/STING-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, the nanovesicles triggered STING-dependent immunogenic cell death (ICD), stimulating tumor infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells; combination with anti–PD-L1 therapy augmented NSCLC regression.

We develop a distributed carbon nanofiber (CNF)–based DAC air filter capable of adsorbing CO 2 downstream in ventilation systems. The DAC air filter not only has the potential to remove 596 MtCO 2 year −1 globally but can also decrease energy consumption in existing building systems. The CNF-based adsorbent has a capacity of 4 mmol/g and can be regenerated via solar thermal or electrothermal methods with low carbon footprints. Through life cycle assessment, the CNF air filter shows a carbon removal efficiency of 92.1% from cradle to grave. Additionally, techno-economic analysis estimates a cost of $209 to 668 in capturing and storing 1 tonne of CO 2 from direct air.",

Proton transfer reactions can mediate this coupling, as in proton-coupled electron transfer and excited-state proton transfer. Additional mechanisms involving proton dislocations may exist but remain undiscovered. Here, we present a femtosecond crystallographic movie of the phytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans . The structures reveal a space-conserving mechanism for rotation of the D-ring in the excited state. We observe rearrangement of a conserved hydrogen bond network within 300 fs, which precedes the isomerization reaction of the chromophore. Aided by molecular modeling and independently confirmed by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we attribute these changes to a protonation shift of the strictly conserved histidine-260. Although this histidine lies close to the photoexcited π-orbitals of the chromophore, it is not directly part of them. We propose that this “remote-controlled” proton transfer relays photoexcitation near-instantaneously to the protein matrix.

We generated an ocean chlorophyll a dataset (2001 to 2023) across low to mid-latitudes (45°N to 45°S) using multisource data and a deep learning approach. Our analysis suggests widespread decline in ocean greenness, with chlorophyll a concentrations decreasing at a rate of (−0.35 ± 0.10) × 10 −3 milligrams per cubic meter per year (mg m −3  year −1 ). The decline is steeper in coastal regions [(−0.73 ± 0.22) × 10 −3 mg m −3  year −1 ]. The frequency of high chlorophyll a concentration events in coastal waters has decreased at a relative rate of −1.78% per year. These trends are predominantly driven by rising sea surface temperatures, which enhance ocean stratification, suppress nutrient upwelling, and limit phytoplankton growth.
