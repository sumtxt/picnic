          "authors": "Nusrat Shahin Qureshi, Olivier Duss",
          "abstract": "A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled 1–4 . Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome–RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process 5–10 , we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription–translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression.",

          "abstract": "New particle formation (NPF) in the tropical upper troposphere is a globally important source of atmospheric aerosols 1–4 . It is known to occur over the Amazon basin, but the nucleation mechanism and chemical precursors have yet to be identified 2 . Here we present comprehensive in situ aircraft measurements showing that extremely low-volatile oxidation products of isoprene, particularly certain organonitrates, drive NPF in the Amazonian upper troposphere. The organonitrates originate from OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene from forest emissions in the presence of nitrogen oxides from lightning. Nucleation bursts start about 2 h after sunrise in the outflow of nocturnal deep convection, producing high aerosol concentrations of more than 50,000 particles cm − 3 . We report measurements of characteristic diurnal cycles of precursor gases and particles. Our observations show that the interplay between biogenic isoprene, deep tropical convection with associated lightning, oxidation photochemistry and the low ambient temperature uniquely promotes NPF. The particles grow over time, undergo long-range transport and descend through subsidence to the lower troposphere, in which they can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that influence the Earth’s hydrological cycle, radiation budget and climate 1,4–8 .",

          "abstract": "The stretch reflex is a fundamental component of the motor system that orchestrates the coordinated muscle contractions underlying movement. At the heart of this process lie the muscle spindles (MS), specialized receptors finely attuned to fluctuations in tension within intrafusal muscle fibres. The tension variation in the MS triggers a series of neuronal events including an initial depolarization of sensory type Ia afferents that subsequently causes the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord 1,2 . This neuronal cascade culminates in the execution of muscle contraction, underscoring a presumed closed-loop mechanism between the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. By contrast, here we report the discovery of a new population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures within the MS that express the machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate. Using mouse intersectional genetics with optogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that activation of MS macrophages (MSMP) drives proprioceptive sensory neuron firing on a millisecond timescale. MSMP activate spinal circuits, motor neurons and muscles by means of a glutamate-dependent mechanism that excites the MS. Furthermore, MSMP respond to neural and muscle activation by increasing the expression of glutaminase, enabling them to convert the uptaken glutamine released by myocytes during muscle contraction into glutamate. Selective silencing or depletion of MSMP in hindlimb muscles disrupted the modulation of the stretch reflex for force generation and sensory feedback correction, impairing locomotor strategies in mice. Our results have identified a new cellular component, the MSMP, that directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction. The glutamate-mediated signalling of MSMP and their dynamic response to sensory cues introduce a new dimension to our understanding of sensation and motor action, potentially offering innovative therapeutic approaches in conditions that affect sensorimotor function.",

          "abstract": "Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) 1 , which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations 2,3 . However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 4 . GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, the diminished drive to seek, value, and learn about rewards, is a core feature of major depressive disorder 1–3 . The neural underpinnings of anhedonia and how this emotional state drives behaviour remain unclear. Here we investigated the neural code of anhedonia by taking advantage of the fact that when mice are exposed to traumatic social stress, susceptible animals become socially withdrawn and anhedonic, whereas others remain resilient. By performing high-density electrophysiology to record neural activity patterns in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), we identified neural signatures of susceptibility and resilience. When mice actively sought rewards, BLA activity in resilient mice showed robust discrimination between reward choices. By contrast, susceptible mice exhibited a rumination-like signature, in which BLA neurons encoded the intention to switch or stay on a previously chosen reward. Manipulation of vCA1 inputs to the BLA in susceptible mice rescued dysfunctional neural dynamics, amplified dynamics associated with resilience, and reversed anhedonic behaviour. Finally, when animals were at rest, the spontaneous BLA activity of susceptible mice showed a greater number of distinct neural population states. This spontaneous activity allowed us to decode group identity and to infer whether a mouse had a history of stress better than behavioural outcomes alone. This work reveals population-level neural dynamics that explain individual differences in responses to traumatic stress, and suggests that modulating vCA1–BLA inputs can enhance resilience by regulating these dynamics.",

          "abstract": "During reproduction, multiple species such as insects and all mammals undergo extensive physiological and morphological adaptions to ensure health and survival of the mother and optimal development of the offspring. Here we report that the intestinal epithelium undergoes expansion during pregnancy and lactation in mammals. This enlargement of the intestinal surface area results in a novel geometry of expanded villi. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ (RANK, encoded by TNFRSF11A ) and its ligand RANKL were identified as a molecular pathway involved in this villous expansion of the small intestine in vivo in mice and in intestinal mouse and human organoids. Mechanistically, RANK–RANKL protects gut epithelial cells from cell death and controls the intestinal stem cell niche through BMP receptor signalling, resulting in the elongation of villi and a prominent increase in the intestinal surface. As a transgenerational consequence, babies born to female mice that lack Rank in the intestinal epithelium show reduced weight and develop glucose intolerance after metabolic stress. Whereas gut epithelial remodelling in pregnancy/lactation is reversible, constitutive expression of an active form of RANK is sufficient to drive intestinal expansion followed by loss of villi and stem cells, and prevents the formation of Apc min -driven small intestinal stem cell tumours. These data identify RANK–RANKL as a pathway that drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy/lactation, one of the most elusive and fundamental tissue remodelling events in mammalian life history and evolution.",

          "abstract": "Patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) 1,2 , partly because there are immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumours 3,4 . However, the heterogeneity of myeloid cells has made them difficult to target, making blockade of the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) clinically ineffective. Here we use single-cell profiling on patient biopsies across the disease continuum and find that a distinct population of tumour-associated macrophages with elevated levels of SPP1 transcripts ( SPP1 hi -TAMs) becomes enriched with the progression of prostate cancer to mCRPC. In syngeneic mouse modelling, an analogous macrophage population suppresses CD8 + T cell activity in vitro and promotes ICI resistance in vivo. Furthermore, Spp1 hi -TAMs are not responsive to anti-CSF1R antibody treatment. Pathway analysis identifies adenosine signalling as a potential mechanism for SPP1 hi -TAM-mediated immunotherapeutic resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) significantly reverses Spp1 hi -TAM-mediated immunosuppression in CD8 + T cells in vitro and enhances CRPC responsiveness to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in vivo. Consistent with preclinical results, inhibition of A2ARs using ciforadenant in combination with programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade using atezolizumab induces clinical responses in patients with mCRPC. Moreover, inhibiting A2ARs results in a significant decrease in SPP1 hi -TAM abundance in CRPC, indicating that this pathway is involved in both induction and downstream immunosuppression. Collectively, these findings establish SPP1 hi -TAMs as key mediators of ICI resistance in mCRPC through adenosine signalling, emphasizing their importance as both a therapeutic target and a potential biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Aircraft observations have revealed ubiquitous new particle formation in the tropical upper troposphere over the Amazon 1,2 and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 3,4 . Although the vapours involved remain unknown, recent satellite observations have revealed surprisingly high night-time isoprene mixing ratios of up to 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv) in the tropical upper troposphere 5 . Here, in experiments performed with the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber, we report new particle formation initiated by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with isoprene at upper-tropospheric temperatures of −30 °C and −50 °C. We find that isoprene-oxygenated organic molecules (IP-OOM) nucleate at concentrations found in the upper troposphere, without requiring any more vapours. Moreover, the nucleation rates are enhanced 100-fold by extremely low concentrations of sulfuric acid or iodine oxoacids above 10 5 cm −3 , reaching rates around 30 cm −3 s −1 at acid concentrations of 10 6 cm −3 . Our measurements show that nucleation involves sequential addition of IP-OOM, together with zero or one acid molecule in the embryonic molecular clusters. IP-OOM also drive rapid particle growth at 3–60 nm h −1 . We find that rapid nucleation and growth rates persist in the presence of NO x at upper-tropospheric concentrations from lightning. Our laboratory measurements show that isoprene emitted by rainforests may drive rapid new particle formation in extensive regions of the tropical upper troposphere 1,2 , resulting in tens of thousands of particles per cubic centimetre.",

          "abstract": "Childhood exposure to social disadvantage is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders and poor developmental, educational, and occupational outcomes, presumably because adverse exposures alter the neurodevelopmental processes that contribute to risk trajectories. Yet, given the limited social mobility in the United States and other countries, childhood social disadvantage is frequently preceded by maternal social disadvantage during pregnancy, potentially altering fetal brain development during a period of high neuroplasticity through hormonal, microbiome, epigenetic, and immune factors that cross the placenta and fetal blood–brain barrier. The current study examines prenatal social disadvantage to determine whether these exposures in utero are associated with alterations in functional brain networks as early as birth. As part of the Early Life Adversity and Biological Embedding study, mothers were recruited during pregnancy, prenatal social disadvantage was assessed across trimesters, and their healthy, full-term offspring were imaged using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging during the first weeks of life. Multivariate machine learning methods revealed that neonatal functional connectivity (FC) varied as a function of prenatal exposure to social disadvantage (n = 261, R = 0.43, R 2 = 0.18), with validation in an independent sample. Alterations in FC associated with prenatal social disadvantage occurred brain-wide and were most pronounced in association networks (fronto-parietal, ventral attention, dorsal attention) and the somatomotor network. Amygdala FC was altered at birth, with a pattern shared across subcortical structures. These findings provide critical insights into how early in development functional networks begin to diverge in the context of social disadvantage and elucidate the functional networks that are most impacted.",

          "abstract": "Reduced consumption of animal-sourced food (ASF) has been recommended for environmental and human health objectives; however, ASF can be important for food security and diet affordability. We explored country-level relationships among various metrics of food supply, socioeconomic context, food security, diet affordability, and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) to characterize how optimal inclusion ranges for ASF vary with socioeconomic factors and food system goals. Data from 2015 to 2022 for 153 countries were sourced to generate Bayesian Networks representing relationships among the studied food system metrics. Networks were used in simulations to characterize optimal ASF inclusion to achieve environmental, food security, or diet affordability goals based on individual country data. Results are most appropriately interpreted in aggregate rather than as representations of specific countries due in large part to data limitations. Across countries simulated, median total ASF inclusion in the food supply to support food security, GHGe, or affordability objectives was 18.2% ± 12.1%, 11.9% ± 6.8%, and 17.6% ± 8.5%, respectively. Joint optimization for these goals resulted in median ASF inclusion of 15.1% ± 7.2%, with notable regional differences. Although ASF increases were supported in most developing regions, decreases were supported in developed countries. The reported SD in optimal ASF inclusion were considerable, and represented between-country variation. Empirical relationships of food categories to goals consistently favored dairy and egg products over meats. These results support previous literature highlighting the environmental intensity of ASF, but also indicate that moderate ASF supplies contribute to multiple food system goals simultaneously.",

          "authors": "Steffen Jahn, Daniel Guhl, Ainslee Erhard",
          "abstract": "Efforts to promote sustainable resource use through reduced meat consumption face challenges as global meat consumption persists. The resistance may be attributed to the lower sales price of meat compared to most plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs). Addressing this, our research delves into the pivotal question of which PBMAs resonate most with consumers and how pricing affects demand. In a hypothetical restaurant context, we conducted 2 representative studies among 2,126 individuals in the United States to scrutinize preferences for meat, analog, semi-analog, and non-analog burgers. First, in a survey, we assessed rankings of the four burgers, alongside evaluating participants’ genuine consideration of these choices to discern a diverse preference distribution. Subsequently, in an experiment, we examined the influence of prices on participants’ consideration and choice of PBMAs, thereby capturing both phases of the decision-making process. Our survey shows that meat has considerably higher utility and consumer preference than all PBMAs on average, but we also find substantial heterogeneity (i.e., some consumers prefer PBMAs over meat). In the experiment, we establish that there is a negative association between the consideration of meat and PBMA burgers, though consideration of any one PBMA is positively associated with considering other PBMAs. A noteworthy increase in consideration and choice is observed when prices of PBMAs are reduced, while changing the price of the meat burger only has minimal effect on demand. Such findings underscore the importance of affordability beyond price parity in catalyzing the shift toward plant-based diets.",

          "abstract": "A large body of research documents the barriers faced by first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students as “hidden minorities” on elite college campuses. Although existing studies show brief psychological interventions can help mitigate some of these obstacles, universities are investing in more intensive interventions that try to both shift mindsets and mitigate structural disadvantages in FGLI students’ academic preparation. In collaboration with the administrators at a highly selective university, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of a summer bridge program targeted at FGLI students. During summers between 2017 and 2019, we randomly selected 232 out of 418 first-generation or low-income students and invited them to attend an intensive, six-week-long residential summer program featuring courses for academic credit. Students randomized to the control group either interacted with online content offering no academic credit or had no summer intervention. Our preregistered analysis shows that the program encouraged FGLI students to pursue a more ambitious first-year program, increasing the proportion of nonintroductory courses by 7 percentage points. The program also increased the proportion of courses taken for a grade rather than as pass-fail by 6 percentage points. These improvements were accompanied by no discernible impact on first-year grade point averages (GPAs) and academic withdrawal. The findings show the potential to academically integrate FGLI students into selective university communities.",

          "abstract": "In fighting infectious diseases posing a global health threat, ranging from influenza to Zika, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social distancing and face covering, remain mitigation measures public health can resort to. However, the success of NPI lies in sufficiently high levels of collective compliance, otherwise giving rise to recurrent infections that are not only driven by pathogen evolution but also changing vigilance in the population. Here, we show that compliance with each NPI measure can be highly dynamic and context-dependent during an ongoing epidemic, where individuals may prefer one to another or even do nothing, leading to intricate temporal switching behavior of NPI adoptions. By characterizing dynamic regimes through the perceived costs of NPI measures and their effectiveness in particular regarding face covering and social distancing, our work offers insights into overcoming barriers in NPI adoptions.",

          "abstract": "Encouraging consumption of plant-based food products can help mitigate the impact of dietary choices on climate change. Research suggests that modifying environments in which people make purchasing decisions has the potential to achieve behavioral changes toward sustainable consumption. We examine the impact of two behavioral interventions, carbon footprint labeling, and product categorization, to promote sustainable food selection in an online grocery shopping environment. Online grocery shopping data collected from 2,359 US participants show that carbon footprint labels increased the selection of plant-based food products by 37% and categorization increased it by 25%. A combination of both nudges increased plant-based food selection by 32%. Participants underestimated the environmental impact of different types of foods despite exposure to carbon footprint information. As the global market for online grocery shopping continues to grow, this study presents a potential for simple and scalable interventions in online shopping environments to encourage sustainable choices.",

          "authors": "Matthew R. DeVerna, Harry Yaojun Yan, Kai-Cheng Yang, Filippo Menczer",
          "abstract": "Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information online. Recent AI language models have shown impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of fact-checking information generated by a popular large language model (LLM) on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news headlines in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the LLM accurately identifies most false headlines (90%), we find that this information does not significantly improve participants’ ability to discern headline accuracy or share accurate news. In contrast, viewing human-generated fact checks enhances discernment in both cases. Subsequent analysis reveals that the AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: It decreases beliefs in true headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs in false headlines that it is unsure about. On the positive side, AI fact-checking information increases the sharing intent for correctly labeled true headlines. When participants are given the option to view LLM fact checks and choose to do so, they are significantly more likely to share both true and false news but only more likely to believe false headlines.

          "abstract": "The Planetary Health Diet (PHD), also known as the EAT-Lancet reference diet, was developed to optimize global dietary quality while keeping the environmental impacts of food production within sustainable planetary boundaries. We calculated current national and global adherence to the PHD using the Planetary Health Dietary Index (PHDI). In addition, we used data on diet and mortality from three large US cohorts (n = 206,404 men and women, 54,536 deaths) to estimate the total and cause-specific mortality among adults 20 y of age and older that could be prevented by shifting from current diets to the reference PHD. The PHDI varied substantially across countries, although adherence was universally far from optimal (mean PHDI = 85 out of 140). By improving the global PHDI to 120, approximately 15 million deaths (27% of total deaths) could be prevented annually. Estimates of preventable deaths due to this shift ranged from 2.5 million for cardiovascular diseases to 0.7 million for neurodegenerative diseases. Our analysis suggests that adopting healthy and sustainable diets would have major direct health benefits by reducing mortality due to multiple diseases and could contribute substantially to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These numbers of preventable deaths are based on evidence that human biology is similar across racial and ethnic groups, but the exact numerical estimates should be interpreted with caution because some assumptions used for the calculations build on limited data. Refinement of these estimates will be possible when additional regional data on diet and mortality become available.",

          "abstract": "Arctic shorelines are vulnerable to climate change impacts as sea level rises, permafrost thaws, storms intensify, and sea ice thins. Seventy-five years of aerial and satellite observations have established coastal erosion as an increasing Arctic hazard. However, other hazards at play—for instance, the cumulative impact that sea-level rise and permafrost thaw subsidence will have on permafrost shorelines—have received less attention, preventing assessments of these processes’ impacts compared to and combined with coastal erosion. Alaska’s Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) is ideal for such assessments because of the high-density observations of topography, coastal retreat rates, and permafrost characteristics, and importance to Indigenous communities and oilfield infrastructure. Here, we produce 21st-century projections of Arctic shoreline position that include erosion, permafrost subsidence, and sea-level rise. Focusing on the ACP, we merge 5 m topography, satellite-derived coastal lake depth estimates, and empirical assessments of land subsidence due to permafrost thaw with projections of coastal erosion and sea-level rise for medium and high emissions scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s AR6 Report. We find that by 2100, erosion and inundation will together transform the ACP, leading to 6-8x more land loss than coastal erosion alone and disturbing 8-11x more organic carbon. Without mitigating measures, by 2100, coastal change could damage 40 to 65% of infrastructure in present-day ACP coastal villages and 10 to 20% of oilfield infrastructure. Our findings highlight the risks that compounding climate hazards pose to coastal communities and underscore the need for adaptive planning for Arctic coastlines in the 21st century.",

          "abstract": "Circadian clocks respond to temperature changes over the calendar year, allowing organisms to adjust their daily biological rhythms to optimize health and fitness. In Drosophila , seasonal adaptations are regulated by temperature-sensitive alternative splicing (AS) of period ( per ) and timeless ( tim ) genes that encode key transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression. Although Clock ( Clk ) gene encodes the critical activator of circadian gene expression, AS of its transcripts and its potential role in temperature regulation of clock function have not been explored. Here, we observed that Clk transcripts undergo temperature-sensitive AS. Specifically, cold temperature leads to the production of an alternative Clk transcript, hereinafter termed Clk -cold, which encodes a CLK isoform with an in-frame deletion of four amino acids proximal to the DNA binding domain. Notably, serine 13 (S13), which we found to be a CK1α-dependent phosphorylation site, is deleted in CLK-cold protein. We demonstrated that upon phosphorylation at CLK(S13), CLK-DNA interaction is reduced, thus decreasing transcriptional activity of CLK. This is in agreement with our findings that CLK occupancy at clock genes and transcriptional output are elevated at cold temperature likely due to higher amounts of CLK-cold isoforms that lack S13 residue. Finally, we showed that PER promotes CK1α-dependent phosphorylation of CLK(S13), supporting kinase-scaffolding role of repressor proteins as a conserved feature in the regulation of eukaryotic circadian clocks. This study provides insights into the complex collaboration between AS and phospho-regulation in shaping temperature responses of the circadian clock.",

          "abstract": "Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs), which exploit the reversible redox reactions of water-soluble organic electrolytes to store electricity, have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology. Organic electrolytes possess fast electron-transfer rates that are two or three orders of magnitude faster than those of their inorganic or organometallic counterparts; therefore, their performance at the electrode is limited by mass transport. Direct adoption of conventional cell stacks with flow fields designed for inorganic electrolytes may compromise AORFB performance owing to severe cell polarization. Here, we report the design of a flow field for flow-through type AORFBs based on three-dimensional multiphysics simulation, to realize the uniform distribution of electrolyte flow and flow enhancements within a porous electrode. The electrolyte flow is visualized by operando imaging. Our results show that multistep distributive flow channels at the inlet and point-contact blocks at the outlet are crucial geometrical merits of the flow field, significantly reducing local concentration overpotentials. The prototype pH-neutral TEMPTMA/MV cell at 1.5 M assembled with the optimized flow field exhibits a peak power density of 267.3 mW cm −2 . The flow field design enables charging of the cell at current densities up to 300 mA cm −2 , which is unachievable with the conventional serpentine flow field, where immediate voltage cutoff of the cell occurs. Our results highlight the importance of AORFB cell stack engineering and provide a method to visualize electrolyte flow, which will be appealing to the field of aqueous flow batteries.",

          "abstract": "Dirac fluids—interacting systems obeying particle–hole symmetry and Lorentz invariance—are among the simplest hydrodynamic systems; they have also been studied as effective descriptions of transport in strongly interacting Dirac semimetals. Direct experimental signatures of the Dirac fluid are elusive, as its charge transport is diffusive as in conventional metals. In this paper, we point out a striking consequence of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics: The full counting statistics (FCS) of charge transport is highly non-Gaussian. We predict the exact asymptotic form of the FCS, which generalizes a result previously derived for certain interacting integrable systems. A consequence is that, starting from quasi-one-dimensional nonequilibrium initial conditions, charge noise in the hydrodynamic regime is parametrically enhanced relative to that in conventional diffusive metals.",

Functionalized hydrogels are ideal candidates for such materials since they are highly responsive to their environment and can be operated in water. In this work, we investigate a hybrid bonding hydrogel composed of peptide amphiphile supramolecular nanofibers covalently attached to a photoresponsive network, in which high-aspect-ratio ferromagnetic nanowires are aligned along the length of the sample, designed to swim under oscillating magnetic fields. This hybrid hydrogel swimmer can autonomously swim toward a light source by utilizing photoinduced interactions between supramolecular and covalent networks reminiscent of phototactic swimming in living systems. Using a combination of experimental techniques and a continuum model incorporating photochemistry, magnetoelasticity, and hydrodynamics, we explain the swimming mechanism and predict phototactic behavior. Our work highlights the potential role of hybrid bonding polymers, which leverage the interplay between supramolecular assemblies and covalent networks. We demonstrate how these polymers can be tailored to react dynamically to their environment, paving the way for developing intelligent and autonomous robotic systems.",

          "abstract": "The toxic effects of C9orf72-derived arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (R-DPRs) on cellular stress granules in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia remain unclear at the molecular level. Stress granules are formed through the switch of Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) by RNA from a closed inactive state to an open activated state, driving the formation of the organelle by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). We show that R-DPRs bind G3BP1 a thousand times stronger than RNA and initiate LLPS much more effectively. Their pathogenic effect is underscored by the slow transition of R-DPR–G3BP1 droplets to aggregated, ThS-positive states that can recruit ALS-linked proteins hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, and TDP-43. Deletion constructs and molecular simulations show that R-DPR binding and LLPS are mediated via the negatively charged intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of the protein, allosterically regulated by its positively charged IDR3. Bioinformatic analyses point to the strong mechanistic parallels of these effects with the interaction of R-DPRs with nucleolar nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and underscore that R-DPRs interact with many other similar nucleolar and stress-granule proteins, extending the underlying mechanism of R-DPR toxicity in cells. Our results also highlight characteristic differences between the two R-DPRs, poly-GR and poly-PR, and suggest that the primary pathological target of poly-GR is not NPM1 in nucleoli, but G3BP1 in stress granules in affected cells.",

          "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria have evolved the remarkable capacity to biomineralize chains of magnetite [Fe(II)Fe(III) 2 O 4 ] nanoparticles that align along the geomagnetic field and optimize their navigation in the environment. Mechanisms enabling magnetite formation require the complex action of numerous proteins for iron acquisition, sequestration in dedicated magnetosome organelles, and precipitation into magnetite. The MamP protein contains c-type cytochromes called magnetochrome domains that are found exclusively in magnetotactic bacteria. Ablation of magnetochromes in MamP prevents bacteria from aligning with external magnetic fields, showing their importance to maintain this biological function. MamP has been proposed, mostly from in vitro experimentations, to regulate iron redox state and maintain an Fe(II)/Fe(III) balance compatible with magnetite formation via the iron oxidase activity of magnetochromes. To test the proposed function for MamP in vivo in the magnetotactic strain Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB)-1, we characterized the iron species in chemical MamP-mediated magnetite syntheses as well as in bacteria unable to produce MamP using a combination of physicochemical methodologies. We show that MamP has no apparent control on the speciation and oxidation state of intracellular iron or on the Fe(II)/Fe(III) balance in magnetite. We propose that MamP promotes magnetite growth by incorporating Fe(III) into preexisting magnetite seeds and that magnetite structure and stoichiometry is maintained by further equilibration with dissolved Fe(II) in magnetosome organelles.",

          "abstract": "Reducing meat and dairy intake has been identified as a necessary strategy for mitigating the high environmental impacts food systems are currently having on climate change, biodiversity loss associated with land-use changes, and freshwater use. Having a choice of dedicated meat and milk replacements available to consumers can help in the transition toward more plant-based diets, but concerns about nutritional and health impacts and high costs can impede uptake. Here, we conduct a multicriteria assessment of 24 meat and milk alternatives that integrates nutritional, health, environmental, and cost analyses with a focus on high-income countries. Unprocessed plant-based foods such as peas, soybeans, and beans performed best in our assessment across all domains. In comparison, processed plant-based products such as veggie burgers, traditional meat replacements such as tempeh, and plant milks were associated with less climate benefits and greater costs than unprocessed foods but still offered substantial environmental, health, and nutritional benefits compared to animal products. Our findings suggest that a range of food products exist that when replacing meat and dairy in current diets would have multiple benefits, including reductions in nutritional imbalances, dietary risks and mortality, environmental resource use and pollution, and when choosing unprocessed foods over processed ones also diet costs. The findings provide support for public policies and business initiatives aimed at increasing their uptake.",

Homologous with ATP synthases, these multisubunit enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V 1 subcomplex and a membrane-embedded proton-translocating V O subcomplex. The V 1 and V O subcomplexes can undergo reversible dissociation to regulate proton pumping, with reassociation of V 1 and V O requiring the protein complex known as RAVE (regulator of the ATPase of vacuoles and endosomes). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , RAVE consists of subunits Rav1p, Rav2p, and Skp1p. We used electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a structure of yeast RAVE bound to V 1 . In the structure, RAVE is an L-shaped complex with Rav2p pointing toward the membrane and Skp1p distant from both the membrane and V 1 . Only Rav1p interacts with V 1 , binding to a region of subunit A not found in the corresponding ATP synthase subunit. When bound to RAVE, V 1 is in a rotational state suitable for binding the free V O complex, but in the structure, it is partially disrupted, missing five of its 16 subunits. Other than these missing subunits and the conformation of the inhibitory subunit H, the V 1 complex with RAVE appears poised for reassembly with V O .",

Although inactivating mutations in CASP8 are frequently found in human OSCC their role in the disease is unknown. To investigate this, we deleted Casp8 in the oral epithelium of adult mice. Loss of Caspase-8 resulted in defects in the tongue epithelial barrier and triggered a neutrophil-rich immune infiltrate distinct from that observed on epidermal Casp8 deletion. Oral Casp8 deletion led to activation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy partially rescued epithelial integrity in Casp8 −/− mice, while induction of autophagy in wild type mice resulted in oral barrier defects and excessive neutrophil infiltration. On treatment with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide Casp8 −/− mice showed increased susceptibility to developing oral tumors. Depletion of neutrophils reduced tumor incidence, which correlated with a reduction in reactive oxygen species and decreased epithelial DNA damage. Our findings establish a functional link between epithelial integrity, autophagy, and the tumor immune microenvironment, placing Caspase-8 at the center of these processes.",

How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets—cDC1s and cDC2s, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased the proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses.",

This paper introduces an innovative strategy using the commercially available and cost-effective hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodobenzene (HTIB) as a radical initiator, enabling clean and bidirectional disulfide metathesis under biocompatible conditions. Our method facilitates efficient forward reactions by utilizing an excess of one disulfide to shift the equilibrium toward unsymmetrical disulfides, while also ensuring clean reverse reactions by the removal of low boiling point dimethyl disulfide. Furthermore, an alternative intramolecular approach using a cyclic five- or eight-membered disulfide avoids the need for an excess of one disulfide, effectively yielding unsymmetrical disulfide molecules. The radical mechanism of this approach, validated through various control experiments and EPR analysis, enables selective and biocompatible modifications of carbohydrates, drugs, native amino acids, and proteins.

In contrast to external fields, embedding a small fraction of active particles within a disordered material generates nonequilibrium internal fields, which can help to circumvent kinetic barriers and modulate the free energy landscape. In this work, we investigate through computer simulations how the activity of active particles alters the mechanical response of deeply annealed polydisperse colloidal gels. We show that the “swim force” generated by the embedded active particles is responsible for determining the mode of mechanical failure, i.e., brittle vs. ductile. We find, and theoretically justify, that at a critical swim force the mechanical properties of the gel decrease abruptly, signaling a change in the mode of mechanical failure. The weakening of the elastic modulus above the critical swim force results from the change in gel porosity and distribution of attractive forces among gel particles, while below the critical swim force, the ductility enhancement is caused by an increase of gel structural disorder. Above the critical swim force, the gel develops a pronounced heterogeneous structure characterized by multiple pore spaces, and the mechanical response is controlled by dynamical heterogeneities. We contrast these results with those of a simulated monodisperse gel that exhibits a nonmonotonic trend of ductility modulation with increasing swim force, revealing a complex interplay between the gel energy landscape and embedded activity.",

In this study, we proposed a strategy using iron single-atom catalysts (Fe-SAC) to selectively reduce NO 3 − -N to NH 4 + -N from the real paddy field irrigating water to provide sustainable NH 4 + -N supplies for rice uptakes, thereby highlighting decreasing N fertilizer applications and mitigating NO 3 − -N pollution. Then, we constructed a solar-energy-driven electrochemical reactor for NO 3 − -N reduction, with the Fe single atom as the core catalyst, and achieved an average NH 4 + -N selectivity of 80.2 ± 2.6% with no additional energy input. Sustainable NH 4 + -N supplies resulted in a 30.4 % increase in the 100-grain weight of the cultivated rice and a 50% decrease of fertilizer application than those of the fertilization group in the pot experiment, which were one of the best values ever reported. Furthermore, the 15 N isotope tracing results indicated a N use efficiency (NUE) from 15 NO 3 − -N of 71.2 ± 3.2%. Sustainable NH 4 + -N supplies played a key role in promoting rice root development which contributed to the high NUE. Our study shares unique insights in increasing grain yield, reducing fertilizer applications, and preventing nitrate leaching into groundwater.",

However, despite more than 50 y of research, the molecular basis for the role of OmpA has remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that OmpA organizes the OM protein lattice and mechanically connects it to the cell wall (CW). Using gene fusions, atomic force microscopy, simulations, and microfluidics, we show that the β-barrel domain of OmpA is critical for maintaining the permeability barrier, but both the β-barrel and CW–binding domains are necessary to enhance the cell envelope’s strength. OmpA integrates the compressive properties of the OM protein lattice with the tensile strength of the CW, forming a mechanically robust composite that increases overall integrity. This coupling likely underpins the ability of the entire envelope to function as a cohesive, resilient structure, critical for the survival of bacteria.",

This is due to its genetic similarity to humans, its evolutionary position between rodents and humans, and its primate-like features encapsulated within a rodent-sized brain. Despite its potential, the absence of a comprehensive reference brain atlas impedes the progress of research endeavors in this species, particularly at the microscopic level. Existing references have largely been confined to the macroscopic scale, lacking detailed anatomical information. Here, we present eLemur, a unique resource, comprising a repository of high-resolution brain-wide images immunostained with multiple cell type and structural markers, elucidating the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the mouse lemur brain. Additionally, it encompasses a segmented two-dimensional reference and 3D anatomical brain atlas delineated into cortical, subcortical, and other vital regions. Furthermore, eLemur includes a comprehensive 3D cell atlas, providing densities and spatial distributions of non-neuronal and neuronal cells across the mouse lemur brain. Accessible via a web-based viewer ( https://eeum-brain.com/#/lemurdatasets ), the eLemur resource streamlines data sharing and integration, fostering the exploration of different hypotheses and experimental designs using the mouse lemur as a model organism. Moreover, in conjunction with the growing 3D datasets for rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans, our eLemur 3D digital framework enhances the potential for comparative analysis and translation research, facilitating the integration of extensive rodent study data into human studies.",

          "abstract": "The brain has evolved mechanisms to dynamically modify blood flow, enabling the timely delivery of energy substrates in response to local metabolic demands. Several such neurovascular coupling (NVC) mechanisms have been identified, but the vascular signal transduction and transmission mechanisms that enable dilation of penetrating arterioles (PAs) remote from sites of increased neuronal activity are unclear. Given the exponential relationship between vessel diameter and blood flow, tight control of arteriole membrane potential and diameter is a crucial aspect of NVC. Recent evidence suggests that capillaries play a major role in sensing neural activity and transmitting signals to modify the diameter of upstream vessels. Thin-strand pericyte cell bodies and processes cover around 90% of the capillary bed, and here we show that these cells play a central role in sensing neural activity and generating and relaying electrical signals to arterioles. We identify a K ATP channel–dependent neurovascular signaling pathway that is explained by the recruitment of thin-strand pericytes and we deploy vascular optogenetics to show that currents generated in individual thin-strand pericytes are sent over long distances to upstream arterioles to cause dilations in vivo. Genetic disruption of vascular K ATP channels reduces the arteriole diameter response to neural activity and laser ablation of thin-strand pericytes eliminates the K ATP -dependent component of NVC. Together, our findings indicate that thin-strand pericytes sense neural activity and transform this into K ATP channel–dependent electrometabolic signals that inform upstream arterioles of local energy needs, promoting spatiotemporally precise energy distribution.",

          "abstract": "The regulation of heart function is attributed to a dual filament mechanism: i) the Ca 2+ -dependent structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin, actin-containing filament making actin available for myosin motor attachment, and ii) the release of motors from their folded (OFF) state on the surface of the thick filament allowing them to attach and pull the actin filament. Thick filament mechanosensing is thought to control the number of motors switching ON in relation to the systolic performance, but its molecular basis is still controversial. Here, we use high spatial resolution X-ray diffraction data from electrically paced rat trabeculae and papillary muscles to provide a molecular explanation of the modulation of heart performance that calls for a revision of the mechanosensing hypothesis. We find that upon stimulation, titin-mediated structural changes in the thick filament switch motors ON throughout the filament within ~½ the maximum systolic force. These structural changes also drive Myosin Binding Protein-C (MyBP-C) to promote first motor attachments to actin from the central 1/3 of the half-thick filament. Progression of attachments toward the periphery of half-thick filament with increase in systolic force is carried on by near-neighbor cooperative thin filament activation by attached motors. The identification of the roles of MyBP-C, titin, thin and thick filaments in heart regulation enables their targeting for potential therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Climate warming can alleviate temperature and nutrient constraints on tree growth in boreal regions, potentially enhancing boreal productivity. However, in permafrost environments, warming also disrupts the physical foundation on which trees grow, leading to leaning trees or “drunken” forests. Tree leaning might reduce radial growth, undermining potential benefits of warming. Here, we found widespread radial growth reductions in southern latitude boreal forests since the 1980s. At mid latitudes, radial growth increased from ~1980 to ~2000 but showed recent signs of decline afterward. Increased growth was evident since the 1980 s at higher latitudes, where radial growth appears to be temperature limited. However, recent changes in permafrost stability, and the associated increased frequency of tree leaning events, emerged as a significant stressor, leading to reduced radial growth in boreal trees at the highest latitudes, where permafrost is extensive. We showed that trees growing in unstable permafrost sites allocated more nonstructural carbohydrate reserves to offset leaning which compromised radial growth and potential carbon uptake benefits of warming. This higher allocation of resources in drunken trees is needed to build the high-density reaction wood, rich in lignin, that is required to maintain a vertical position. With continued climate warming, we anticipate widespread reductions in radial growth in boreal forests, leading to lower carbon sequestration. These findings enhance our understanding of how climate warming and indirect effects, such as ground instability caused by warming permafrost, will affect boreal forest productivity in the future.",

Despite the expanding utility of ultrasound neuromodulation in the neuroscience research field and clinical applications, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ultrasound impacts neural activity in the brain are still largely unknown. Here, we report that transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6), a mechanosensitive nonselective cation channel, is essential for ultrasound neuromodulation of mammalian neurons in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that ultrasound irradiation elicited rapid and robust Ca 2+ transients mediated via extracellular Ca 2+ influx in cultured mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons. Ultrasound-induced neuronal responses were massively diminished by blocking either the generation of action potential or synaptic transmission. Importantly, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deficiency of TRPC6 almost completely abolished neuronal responses to ultrasound. Furthermore, we found that intracerebroventricular administration of a TRPC6 blocker significantly attenuated the number of neuronal firings in the cerebral cortex evoked by transcranial ultrasound irradiation in mice. Our findings indicate that TRPC6 is an indispensable molecule of ultrasound neuromodulation in intact mammalian brains, providing fundamental understanding of biophysical molecular mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation as well as insight into its future feasibility in neuroscience and translational research in humans.",

          "abstract": "Phase transition between ordered phases has garnered attention from the viewpoint of materials science as well as statistical physics. One interesting example is martensitic transformation and the resulting formation of twin structures, in which atoms or molecules that form one crystalline phase move in a concerted and diffusionless manner toward another crystalline phase. Recently martensitic transformation has been observed experimentally also in various soft materials. However, the complex internal structures involving many molecules have eluded direct investigation of the dynamical processes of martensitic transformation. Here, we carry out a direct simulation of mesoscale structural transition of a liquid crystalline blue phase (BP) of cubic symmetry, known as BP II. The dynamics is simulated by a Langevin-type equation for the orientational order parameter with thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that machine-learning-aided analysis of local structures successfully unravels the transformation process from a perfect lattice of BP II to a twinned lattice of another BP (BP I). The nucleation of BP I is initiated by the breakup of junctions of line defects (disclinations), followed by the deformation of disclination network. We further show that twinned BP I is reversibly transformed to a perfect lattice of BP II by temperature variation. Order-parameter-based simulations with machine-learning-aided local structure identification provide valuable insights into not only the martensitic transformation of soft materials but also a wider class of complex structural transitions between ordered phases.",

          "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumor and are often associated with severe neurological deficits and mortality. Unlike many cancers, gliomas rarely metastasize outside the brain, indicating a possible dependency on unique features of brain microenvironment. Synapses between neurons and glioma cells exist, suggesting that glioma cells rely on neuronal inputs and synaptic signaling for proliferation. Yet, the locations and properties of neurons that innervate gliomas have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized transsynaptic tracing with an EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus to specifically infect TVA and glycoprotein-expressing human glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, allowing us to identify the neurons that form synapses onto the gliomas. Comprehensive whole-brain mapping revealed that these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) from brain regions, including diverse neuromodulatory centers and specific cortical layers, known to project to the glioma locations. Molecular profiling revealed that long-range cortical GINs are predominantly glutamatergic, and subsets express both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, whereas local striatal GINs are largely GABAergic. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that while GINs share passive intrinsic properties with cortex-innervating neurons, their action potential waveforms are altered. Our study introduces a method for identifying and mapping GINs and reveals their consistent integration into existing location-dependent neuronal networks involving diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The observed intrinsic electrophysiological differences in GINs lay the groundwork for future investigations into how these alterations relate to the postsynaptic characteristics of glioma cells.",

Here, using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR experiments and a comprehensive four-state kinetic model of the folding trajectory of a 71 residue four-helix bundle FF domain from human HYPA/FBP11 we present an atomic resolution structure of a transiently formed intermediate, I2, that along with the structure of a second intermediate, I1, provides a description of the FF domain folding trajectory. By recording CEST profiles as a function of urea concentration the extent of compaction along the folding pathway is evaluated. Our data establish that unlike the partially disordered I1 state, the I2 intermediate that is also formed before the rate-limiting folding barrier is well ordered and compact like the native conformer, while retaining nonnative interactions similar to those found in I1. The slow-interconversion from I2 to F, involving changes in secondary structure and the breaking of nonnative interactions, proceeds via a compact transition-state. Interestingly, the native state of the FF1 domain from human p190-A Rho GAP resembles the I2 conformation, suggesting that well-ordered folding intermediates can be repurposed by nature in structurally related proteins to assume functional roles. It is anticipated that the strategy for elucidation of sparsely populated and transiently formed structures of intermediates along kinetic pathways described here will be of use in other studies of protein dynamics.",

However, the current state-of-the-art industrial FTS employing Fe-based catalysts is still challenged by the low carbon efficiency (&lt;50%), mainly attributed to the prominent formation of CO 2 and CH 4 resulting from the nonregulated side water gas shift reaction. Herein, we describe a shielding strategy involving the encapsulation of the active Hägg carbide (χ-Fe 5 C 2 ) by a graphene layer, exhibiting excellent resilience under reaction conditions and exposure to air, thereby eliminating the need for reduction or activation before the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction. The graphene layer helps to stabilize the Hägg carbide active phase, and more importantly, greatly suppresses the side water gas shift reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that graphene shielding inhibits the water gas shift reaction by reducing the absorption strength of OH x species. Remarkably, the optimum χ-Fe 5 C 2 @Graphene catalyst demonstrates a minimized CO 2 and CH 4 formation of only 4.6% and 5.9%, resulting in a high carbon efficiency (ca. 90%) for value-added products.

The size and geometry of the stacking domains depend on the interplay between strain, solitons crossing, and shape of the three-layer regions. Interestingly, we demonstrate the growth of three-layer regions in which the ABA/ABC stacking domains self-organize in stable stripes of a few tens of nanometers. The growth-controlled production of isolated and stripe-shaped ABA/ABC domains open the path to fabricate quantum devices on these domains.

          "abstract": "There are three distinct forms of autophagy, namely, macroautophagy, microautophagy, and HSPA8 chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). While macroautophagy is widely recognized as a regulator of chromosomal instability (CIN) through various pathways, the contributions of CMA and microautophagy to CIN remain uncertain. TTC28 , a conserved gene in vertebrates, is frequently mutated and down-regulated in numerous human cancers. This study presents findings demonstrating the interaction between human tetratricopeptide repeat domain 28 (TTC28) and heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8) and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A proteins. The tetratricopeptide repeat domains of TTC28 bind to the C-terminal motif (PTIEEVD) in HSPA8, resulting in the subsequent degradation of TTC28 via CMA/microautophagy. Notably, the baseline frequency of micronuclei (FMN) in human cancer cells with TTC28 knockout cells was three times greater than that in cells with wild-type TTC28 (7.7% vs. 2.3%, P = 4.86E−09). Furthermore, the overexpression of Ttc28 mitigated the impact of TTC28 knockout on FMN (11.9% vs. 4.8%, P = 2.83E−11). Our findings also demonstrate that CMA has a protective effect on genome stability and that TTC28 plays an essential role in the effect of CMA. These results were further supported by the quantification of γH2AX and comet analyses and the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data via bioinformatics. Mechanistically, TTC28 regulates mitosis and cytokinesis, which are involved in the maintenance of genome integrity by CMA. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TTC28 is not only an HSPA8-mediated CMA/microautophagy substrate but also essential for maintaining chromosomal stability via CMA. Comprehensive TTC28 downregulation may lead to CIN in cancer cells.",

In the cuprate family, fluctuating short-range charge correlations can coalesce into a longer-range charge density wave (CDW) order which is thought to intertwine with superconductivity, yet the nature of the interaction is still poorly understood. Here, by measuring subtle lattice fluctuations in underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ y on quasi-static timescales (thousands of seconds) through X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, we report sensitivity to both superconductivity and CDW. The atomic lattice shows remarkably faster relaxational dynamics upon approaching the superconducting transition at T c ≈ 65 K. By tracking the momentum dependence, we show that the intermediate scattering function almost monotonically scales with the relaxation distance of atoms away from their average positions above T c and in the presence of the CDW state, while this peculiar trend is reversed for other temperatures. These observations are consistent with an incipient CDW stabilized by local strain. This work provides insights into the crucial role of relaxational atomic fluctuations for understanding the electronic physics cuprates, which are inherently disordered due to carrier doping.",

The data were fitted to determine quantitative populations, f(t)’s, of individual antiparallel registries indexed by t, the number of residues in the registry. Both wild-type (WT) and fusion-defective V2E Fp sheets have broad but very different registry distributions, each with at least eight populated registries with f(t) &gt; 0.02, and t WT = 16.1 and ⟨t⟩ V2E = 18.5. The broad WT distribution likely improves mutational robustness for HIV, as Fp is a neutralization epitope of the immune system, and Fp mutations are required for immune evasion during chronic HIV infection. V2E fusion is reduced because longer Fp sheets increase separation between initially apposed membranes. The f(t) WT were well-fitted to free energies that were sums of contributions from sheet length, aligned leucines, and sidechain membrane insertion. The f(t) V2E ’s were similarly well-fitted except there wasn’t the insertion contribution. Relative to V2E, WT fusion is enhanced by deeper membrane insertion of Fp with accompanying greater dislocation of neighboring lipids. This study provides a rare quantitative determination of broad molecular structural distributions by experiment.",

          "abstract": "The ruminant livestock sector considerably contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the effectiveness of pelleted bromoform-containing seaweed ( Asparagopsis taxiformis ) (Brominata) as an enteric methane (CH 4 ) inhibitor in grazing beef cattle. The primary objective was to assess the impact of this antimethanogenic additive on enteric CH 4 emissions under real-world farm conditions. Twenty-four beef steers, crossbreeds of Wagyu and Angus, with an average liveweight of 399 ± 21.7 kg, were allocated to two treatment groups: Control and Brominata. These animals underwent regular weigh-ins every 14 d, and measurements of CH 4 , carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and hydrogen (H 2 ) emissions were conducted using the GreenFeed system. Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4, wherein the model incorporated fixed effects for treatment, time, their interaction, and a covariate, while accounting for animal variations as a random effect within each phase. Three phases of bromoform intake were identified: a 3-wk ramp-up phase, a 3-wk optimal phase, and a 2-wk decreasing phase. No differences were observed between the weekly initial and final liveweight, average daily gain, and predicted dry matter intake. During optimal and decreasing phases, average enteric CH 4 emissions were significantly reduced in steers that received Brominata supplementation compared to those without supplementation (115 vs. 185 g/d, respectively). Additionally, both groups had similar CO 2 emissions (6.8 vs. 7.2 kg/d), while H 2 emissions were lower in the control group (3.4 vs. 1.8 g/d). The findings suggest that pelleted bromoform-containing feed additive has the potential to reduce enteric CH 4 emissions from grazing beef cattle.",

Here, we studied a recently discovered bifunctional Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cryptochrome (CraCRY) with focus on its repair of UV-induced pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct (6-4PP). We used femtosecond spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to map out the critical elementary steps by following the dynamics of initial reactants, various intermediates, and final products. We observed initial direct ultrafast electron tunneling from the hydroquinone flavin cofactor to 6-4PP in 300 ps through an intervening adenine as a mediator, minimizing the electron bifurcation of a two-step hopping pathway bridged also by the adenine as an intermediate. The subsequent proton transfer (PT) from the neighboring histidine to anionic 6-4PP in 2 ns is critical and competes with the futile back electron transfer in 151 ps. Mutations of either of two histidines in the active site nearly abolish repair, indicating their essential role on repair reactivity and structural integrity. These results elucidate the electron-coupled PT mechanism and the repair photocycle of this bifunctional cryptochrome at the molecular level, further supporting that the hydroquinone flavin is the active state in vivo for dual functions or one of the two functions is excessive.",

To characterize the gene regulatory state underlying T cell dysregulation in ME, we performed multiomic analysis across T cell subsets by integrating single-cell RNA-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq and further analyzed CD8+ T cell subpopulations following symptom provocation. Specific subsets of CD8+ T cells, as well as certain innate T cells, displayed the most pronounced dysregulation in ME. We observed upregulation of key transcription factors associated with T cell exhaustion in CD8+ T cell effector memory subsets, as well as an altered chromatin landscape and metabolic reprogramming consistent with an exhausted immune cell state. To validate these observations, we analyzed expression of exhaustion markers using flow cytometry, detecting a higher frequency of exhaustion-associated factors. Together, these data identify T cell exhaustion as a component of ME, a finding which may provide a basis for future therapies, such as checkpoint blockade, metabolic interventions, or drugs that target chronic viral infections.",

          "abstract": "Plant-based proteins are promoted as nutritious, environmentally safe, and a key element for food security. Numerous studies using environmental life cycle assessments confirmed plant-based meat alternatives are more environmentally favorable than animal-derived meat. However, most missed other factors from protein extraction and concentration that contribute to environmental impact (both positive and negative). Furthermore, few studies examined the entire environmental impact because they overlooked social and nutritional life cycle assessments. Many publications assumed most environmental impact occurred in crop cultivation before high protein products are manufactured. However, industrial plant-based protein extraction, concentration, and purification require large amounts of natural resources, energy, chemicals, and highly specialized equipment seldom accurately assessed from an environmental, social, and nutritional perspective. This paper presents opinions and perspectives on additional information to consider to fully realize environmental benefits of highly proteinaceous plant-based food ingredients. Elements are also discussed we perceive as “hot spots” for future assessments in presenting a complete picture for minimizing environmental impact and how the numerous actors in this supply chain can transform our food system and secure protein availability for future generations.",

We used neurofeedback from closed-loop real-time functional MRI to create new categories of visual objects in the brain, without the participants’ explicit awareness. After neural sculpting, participants exhibited behavioral and neural biases for the learned, but not for the control categories. The ability to sculpt new perceptual distinctions into the human brain offers a noninvasive research paradigm for causal testing of the link between neural representations and behavior.

          "abstract": "Motile organisms can expand into new territories and increase their fitness, while nonmotile viruses usually depend on host migration to spread across long distances. In general, faster host motility facilitates virus transmission. However, recent ecological studies have also shown that animal host migration can reduce viral prevalence by removing infected individuals from the migratory group. Here, we use a bacteria-bacteriophage copropagation system to investigate how host motility affects viral spread during range expansion. We find that phage spread during chemotaxis-driven navigated range expansion decreases as bacterial migration speed increases. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the navigated migration leads to a spatial sorting of infected and uninfected hosts in the copropagating front of bacteria-bacteriophage, with implications for the number of cells left behind. The preferential loss of infected cells in the copropagating front inhibits viral spread. Further increase in host migration speed leads to a phase transition that eliminates the phage completely. These results illustrate that navigated range expansion of the host can promote the migratory culling of infectious diseases in the migration group.",

We found that the π -bond ring formed within the LiMn 6 structure could participate in stable redox reactions as one unit, but Co could disrupt its symmetry. We thus designed and synthesized Co-free concentration-gradient LLOs (CF-CG-LLOs) materials. The combination of concentration gradient and Co removal leads to exceptional capacity retention without any fading over 100 cycles of the pouch cell. More importantly, it exhibits an extraordinarily low voltage decay of 0.15 mV/cycle, accompanied by a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.86%. This concept and demonstration of CF-CG-LLO cathodes reveal a viable avenue toward low-cost, high-energy-density battery cathodes.",

          "abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a widespread public health problem in the Global South, especially in Africa. Childhood stunting—meaning linear growth retardation—is a comprehensive and commonly used indicator of chronic child undernutrition and is mostly the result of insufficient nutrient intake, among other factors. Previous research showed that the consumption of animal-sourced foods (ASF), including meat, dairy, eggs, and fish, is associated with lower rates of child stunting, but reliable evidence for Africa is scant. In Africa, average ASF consumption is low. We use representative panel data from five African countries—Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda—with over 32,000 observations from children aged 0 to 5 y to show that ASF consumption increases mean child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) by 0.30 ( P &lt; 0.01) and reduces the likelihood of stunting by 6.8 percentage points ( P &lt; 0.01), after controlling for confounding factors. The child nutritional benefits of diets containing ASF are larger than those of purely plant-based diets. Nutritious plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes, can provide most of the nutrients required and also have positive effects on HAZ, but they are sometimes not available and accessible in sufficient quantities all year round, especially in rural areas. Given the large environmental footprints of livestock farming, initiatives to make food systems more sustainable often call for a strong reduction in ASF consumption. While ASF consumption should be reduced where consumption quantities are high, our results suggest that poor households’ access to ASF in Africa should be further improved to help reduce child undernutrition.",

This study explores the potential for green hydrogen in Texas as a substitute for current development, underscoring numerous advantages such as ample renewables, established demand, and operational infrastructure. We present an hourly-resolution, cross-sector assessment framework to optimize grid-integrated green hydrogen supply paths from managing local applications to meeting potential export opportunities. The analysis indicates that by 2030, Texas could have over 50 million tons of green hydrogen available at $1.5/kg. Even with the incrementality, deliverability, and temporal matching requirements of 45 V, green hydrogen remains more competitive than blue hydrogen. On the supply side, the grid-electrolysis integration results in synergetic benefits, including overall cost reductions, less curtailment of renewables, and enhanced operational flexibility and reliability. On the demand side, this cost-competitive hydrogen could bring the cost of hydrogen fueling and ammonia production down to $4/kg and $350/ton respectively, with a significant impact in replacing fossil fuels in transport and industry. For most of the states, green hydrogen and ammonia imported from Texas could become an affordable alternative to local supplies. Through both onshore pipelines and offshore shipments, Texas has the potential to develop as a major green fuel supplier, aiding in decarbonization efforts not only for the United States but also beyond.",

Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to explore their origin, particularly focusing on EuCd 2 P 2 . While the low-energy spectral weight royally tracks that of the resistivity anomaly near the temperature with maximum magnetoresistance ( T MR ) as expected from transport-spectroscopy correspondence, the spectra are completely incoherent and strongly suppressed with no hint of a Landau quasiparticle. Using systematic material and temperature dependence investigation complemented by theory, we attribute this nonquasiparticle caricature to the strong presence of entangled magnetic and lattice interactions, a characteristic enabled by the p - f mixing. Given the known presence of ferromagnetic clusters, this naturally points to the origin of CMR being the scattering of spin-polarized polarons at the boundaries of ferromagnetic clusters. These results are not only illuminating to investigate the strong correlations and topology in EuCd 2 X 2 family, but, in a broader view, exemplify how multiple cooperative interactions can give rise to extraordinary behaviors in condensed matter systems.",

Here, we propose a sequential leaching strategy to utilize the dynamic restructuring and enhance the chemical bond strength for highly active and stable OER. Modeling on nickel-iron sulfides (NiFe-S), we introduced and utilized foreign Mo dopant preleaching as the sacrificial agent to alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial M─S bonds. Operando spectroscopic reveal that foreign Mo dopant leach from the matrix and then adsorb on the surface of NiFe O(S)OH as molybdate at lower OER potential. The crystal occupation hamiltonian population analysis uncovers that the charge transfer from molybdate into NiFe O(S)OH will enhance bond energy of M─S, thus preventing further S and Fe/Ni leaching. By manipulating ion leaching, the resulting active phase achieves an ultralow overpotential of 250 mV at 400 mA cm −2 and high stability of more than 3,700 h at 100 mA cm −2 . An industrial water electrolysis equipment using our catalysts delivered ultralow energy consumption of 4.30 kWh m −3 H2 and record stability over 250 h (2,300 h lifetime by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) under a high working current of 8,000 mA.

However, the mechanisms that drive the onset of cortical condensate formation near membranes remain unexplored. Here, using a reconstituted phase separation assay of cortical condensate proteins, we demonstrate that the key component, N-WASP, can collectively undergo surface condensation on supported lipid bilayers via a prewetting transition. Actin partitions into the condensates, where it polymerizes and counteracts the N-WASP prewetting transition. Taken together, the dynamics of condensate-assisted cortex formation appear to be controlled by a balance between surface-assisted condensate formation and polymer-driven condensate dissolution.

We investigated 61 commercially available protein ingredients from various sources, categorizing them based on their protein content into protein-rich flours (protein content less than 50%), protein concentrates (protein content between 50% and 80%), and protein isolates (protein content higher than 80%). Methionine, cysteine, and lysine were decisive for the amino acid score, which even varied between ingredients produced from the same raw material. Such differences were also observed in the protein solubility profiles, characterized by their raw material–specific protein pattern. By focusing on soy, pea, and fava bean ingredients, the broad spectra of emulsifying and foaming properties were illustrated. These ranged from non–emulsifying and non–foaming to high emulsifying capacities of 737 mL/g ingredient and foaming activities of 2,278%, accompanied by a foam stability of 100%. Additionally, we demonstrated that the functionality of ingredients obtained from different batches could vary by up to 24% relative SD. Protein solubility, powder wettability, color, and particle size were determined as key properties for the differentiation of soy, pea, and fava bean protein ingredients by principal component analysis. In our study conclusion, we propose essential measures for overcoming challenges in protein ingredient production and utilization to realize their full potential in fostering sustainable and innovative plant-based food production.",

          "abstract": "RAD51 is related to the bacterial RecA protein and is best known for its role in homologous recombination-mediated repair of DNA damage. Here, we report an unexpected function of RAD51 in the maintenance methylation of genomic DNA, a function that is separable from its role in homologous recombination. First, it acts as an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1. Deficiency in RAD51 causes excessive ubiquitination and degradation of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, leading to the loss of global DNA methylation. Second, RAD51 helps UHRF1 to monoubiquitinate histone H3 to generate DNMT1 recruiting signal. It binds H3 directly, enabling UHRF1 to bind and ubiquitinate H3 more readily. Disrupting the interaction between RAD51 and H3 diminishes DNMT1 recruitment and the failure of maintenance methylation of genomic DNA. Thus, RAD51 dually regulates UHRF1. These results establish RAD51 as a guardian of the integrity of both the genome and the epigenome.",

          "authors": "Alison L. Van Eenennaam",
          "abstract": "The high emissions intensity of terrestrial animal source food (TASF) and projected increasing demand in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have spurred interest in the development of animal-free alternatives and manufactured food items that aim to substitute for meat, milk, and eggs with the promise of reduced environmental impact of producing food. The developing world is the source of 75% of global emissions from ruminants and will house 86% of the world’s human population by 2050. The adoption of cost-effective, genetic, feed and nutrition practices, and improving livestock health in LMIC are seen as the most promising interventions to reduce emissions resulting from projected increased TASF demand though 2050. Genetic improvement is a particularly attractive approach to productivity enhancements, as such improvements are permanent and cumulative. Alternative proteins may play a role in addressing demand for affordable sources of nutrient-dense foods, however, price will be a major factor influencing adoption given 3.1 billion people globally (42%) were currently unable to afford a healthy diet in 2021. Additionally, there is currently a mismatch between the location of alternative protein companies, and both projected increased TASF demand and emissions. To date, the vast majority (&gt;81%) of these companies are based in high-income countries. The sustainability implications of replacing TASF with alternative proteins at scale needs to consider not only environmental metrics but also the wider economic and social sustainability impacts, given the essential role that livestock play in the livelihoods and food security of approximately 1.3 billion people.",

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began. In utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one-third of the risk reduction.",

In an AD-related mouse model expressing APOE4, XY sex chromosomes heightened interferon (IFN) response and tau-induced demyelination. The X-linked gene, Toll-like receptor 7 ( Tlr7 ), regulated sex-specific IFN response to myelin. Deletion of Tlr7 dampened sex differences while protecting against demyelination.

The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability.

To develop new small-molecule approaches, we investigated the state of BCL11A protein in erythroid cells. We report that tetramer formation mediated by a single zinc finger (ZnF0) is required for production of steady-state protein. Beyond its role in protein stability, the tetramer state is necessary for γ-globin gene repression, because an engineered monomer fails to engage a critical co-repressor complex.

We found that TMEM208 can engage the substrate binding domain of SRP to accelerate release of its bound cargo. Without TMEM208, slow cargo release resulted in excessive synthesis of downstream polypeptide before engaging translocation factors. Delayed access to translocation machinery caused progressive loss of insertion competence, particularly for multipass membrane proteins, resulting in their impaired biogenesis. Thus, TMEM208 facilitates prompt cargo handover from the targeting to translocation machinery to minimize biogenesis errors and maintain protein homeostasis.",

Thirteen-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues.

In this work, we report the use of surfactant-supported assembly of freestanding microscale hydrogel droplets to construct various iontronic modules, circuits, and biointerfaces. Chemical modifications of silk fibroin produced a pair of oppositely charged hydrogels. Microscale assembly of various combinations of hydrogel droplets produced iontronic diodes, npn- and pnp-type transistors, and diverse reconfigurable logic gates. Through the incorporation of poly(amino acid)s, we have demonstrated a droplet-based synthetic synapse with ionic polymer–mediated long-term plasticity. Further, our iontronic transistor can serve as a biocompatible sensor to record electrophysiological signals from sheets of human cardiomyocytes, paving a way to the building of miniature bioiontronic systems.",

These artificially structured layers have largely been used to passively manipulate the flow of light by controlling its phase, amplitude, and polarization. However, they can also dynamically modulate these quantities and manipulate fundamental light absorption and emission processes. These valuable traits can extend their application domain to chipscale optoelectronics and conceptually new optical sources, displays, spatial light modulators, photodetectors, solar cells, and imaging systems. New opportunities and challenges have also emerged in the materials and device integration with existing technologies. This Review aims to consolidate the current research landscape and provide perspectives on metasurface capabilities specific to optoelectronic devices, giving new direction to future research and development efforts in academia and industry.",

          "abstract": "Inferring the intentions and emotions of others from behavior is crucial for social cognition. While neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions involved in social inference, it remains unknown whether performing social inference is an abstract computation that generalizes across different stimulus categories or is specific to certain stimulus domain. We recorded single-neuron activity from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in neurosurgical patients performing different types of inferences from images of faces, hands, and natural scenes. Our findings indicate distinct neuron populations in both regions encoding inference type for social (faces, hands) and nonsocial (scenes) stimuli, while stimulus category was itself represented in a task-general manner. Uniquely in the MTL, social inference type was represented by separate subsets of neurons for faces and hands, suggesting a domain-specific representation. These results reveal evidence for specialized social inference processes in the MTL, in which inference representations were entangled with stimulus type as expected from a domain-specific process.",

          "abstract": "Most homicides in the United States are committed using a handgun, but little research examines gun carrying over critical stages of the life course and changing contexts of violence. Notably, although most of the handgun homicides are committed by adults, most research on concealed gun carrying focuses on adolescents in single cohort studies. Using more than 25 years of longitudinal multicohort data from Chicago, 1994–2021, we show that pathways of concealed gun carrying are distinct between adolescence and adulthood. Adolescent carrying is often age-limited and responsive to direct exposure to gun violence (witnessing and victimization), while adult carrying is a persistent behavior that is less tied to direct exposure. The onset of concealed carry is also a strong predictor of later gun use (shooting or brandishing), and we find distinct patterns of gun use between individuals who first carry in adolescence versus adulthood. We discuss the implications of these dual pathways for research and policies on firearm use.",

          "abstract": "Microplastic remediation in aquatic bodies is essential for the entire ecosystem, but is challenging to achieve with a universal and efficient strategy. Here, we developed a sustainable and environmentally adaptable adsorbent through supramolecular self-assembly of chitin and cellulose. This biomass fibrous framework (Ct-Cel) showcases an excellent adsorption performance for polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The affinity for diverse microplastics is attributed to the transformation of multiple intermolecular interactions between different microplastics and Ct-Cel. Meanwhile, the strong resistance of Ct-Cel to multiple pollutants in water enables an enhanced adsorption when coexisting with microorganisms and Pb 2+ . Moreover, Ct-Cel can remove 98.0 to 99.9% of microplastics in four types of real water and maintains a high removal efficiency of up to 95.1 to 98.1% after five adsorption cycles. This work may open up prospects for functional biomass materials for cost-efficient remediation of microplastics in complex aquatic environments.",

These Al-RHEAs achieve remarkable mechanical properties, including compressive yield strengths up to 1.7 gigapascals, fracture strains exceeding 50%, and notable high-temperature strength retention. They also demonstrate a tensile yield strength of 1.0 gigapascals with a ductility of 9%, albeit with B2 ordering. Furthermore, we identify valence electron count domains for alloy ductility and brittleness with the explanation from density functional theory and provide crucial insights into elemental influence on atomic ordering and mechanical performance.

Cu-based catalysts, with their diverse surface states, offer the potential to control reaction pathways and generate reactive H* species. However, a major challenge lies in oxidizing active Cu 0 species by water generated during the catalytic process. While nonreducible metal oxides are beneficial in stabilizing metallic states, their limited capability to generate surface oxygen vacancies (O V ) hinders CO 2 activation. Herein, we present a strategy by doping Nd into a La 2 O 2 CO 3 (LOC) support, enhancing O V formation by disrupting its lattice dyadicity. This leads to higher Cu 0 concentration and improved CO 2 activation. The resulting Cu/LOC:Nd catalyst notably outperforms Cu/LOC and CuZnAl catalysts, achieving a methanol yield of 9.9 moles of methanol per hour per mole of Cu. Our approach opens up possibilities for enhancing Cu-based catalysts in CO 2 conversion.",

The global emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria-transmitting Anophelines has become an impediment and has created an urgent need for novel mosquito control approaches. Here, we show that a biopesticide derived from the soil-dwelling bacterium Chromobacterium sp. Panama ( Csp_P ) kills insecticide-resistant Anopheles mosquitoes, regardless of their resistance mechanisms. In addition, sublethal dose of Csp_P acts as a synergist to now used chemical insecticides across multiple classes. Moreover, Csp_P reduces host-seeking behavior and malaria parasite infection in vector mosquitoes in ways that further decrease transmission. Mosquito glutathione S -transferases are essential for Csp_P ’s mosquito-killing mechanism. Enclosed field trials in Burkina Faso, conducted in diverse ecological settings and supported by a mathematical model, have now demonstrated its potential for malaria control in settings with widespread insecticide resistance.",

While previous studies defined MP cells as a heterogeneous population that comprises T helper 1 (T H 1)/17–like subsets, functional significance of the T-bet − Rorγt − subpopulation remains unknown. Here we show that MP lymphocytes as a whole population can differentiate into T H 1/17/regulatory T (T reg ) cells to mediate mild and persistent inflammation in lymphopenic environments, whereas naïve cells exhibit strong, T H 1-dominated responses. Moreover, we demonstrate that MP lymphocytes comprise not only T H 1/17-differentiated subsets but a polyclonal, transcriptomically immature “undifferentiated” subpopulation at homeostasis. Furthermore, our data argue that while the T-bet + Rorγt − MP subset is terminally T H 1-differentiated, its undifferentiated counterpart retains the capacity to rapidly proliferate to differentiate into T H 1/17/T reg cells, with the latter response tonically constrained by preexisting T reg cells. Together, our results identify undifferentiated MP CD4 + T lymphocytes as a unique precursor that has a diverse differentiation potential to generate T H 1/17/T reg cells to contribute to pathogenesis of inflammation.",

However, it remains a daunting challenge to develop an artificial ion channel similar to biological ion channels due to ion-ion competitive transport and lack of ion-gating ability of channels. Here, we report a conductive MXene membrane with polydopamine-confined angstrom-scale channels and propose a voltage gating and ion charge comediation strategy to concurrently achieve gated and selective mono/monovalent cation separation. The membrane shows a highly switchable “on-off” ratio of ∼9.9 for K + transport and an excellent K + /Li + selectivity of 40.9, outperforming the ion selectivity of reported membranes with electrical gating (typically 1.5 to 6). Theoretical simulations reveal that the introduced high-charge cations such as Mg 2+ enable the preferential distribution of target K + over competing Li + at the channel entrance, and the surface potential reduces the ionic transport energy barrier for allowing K + to pass quickly through the channel.",

To this end, we curated a large T cell atlas from 12 prominent human studies, containing in total 500,000 T cells spanning multiple diseases, including melanoma, head and neck cancer, blood cancer, and lung transplantation. Here, we identified severe limitations in cell-type annotation using unsupervised approaches and propose a more robust standard using a semi-supervised method or the TCR arrangement. We showcase the utility of a TCR-first approach through application of the STEGO.R tool for the identification of treatment-related dynamics and previously unknown public T cell clusters with potential antigen-specific properties. Thus, the paradigm shift to a TCR-first can highlight overlooked key T cell features that have the potential for improvements in immunotherapy and diagnostics.",

          "abstract": "The conventional molecular immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers suffer from poor biocompatibility and unsatisfactory efficacy. Here, a biocompatible nanosized covalent organic framework (nCOF)–based pyroelectric catalyst (denoted as TPAD-COF NPs) is designed for pyroelectric catalysis-activated in situ immunotherapy. TPAD-COF NPs confine organic pyroelectric molecules to rigid TPAD-COF NPs to substantially reduce aggregation and enhance biocompatibility, thus improving pyroelectrocatalytic efficiency. After tumor internalization, TPAD-COF NPs facilitate photothermal tumor ablation under near-infrared (NIR) laser exposure, resulting in effective ICD induction. In addition, TPAD-COF NPs effectively catalyze the conversion of temperature changes to pyroelectric changes, which subsequently react with adjacent O 2 to generate reactive oxygen species, thus triggering robust ICD activation. In vivo evaluation using mouse models confirmed that TPAD-COF NPs evidently inhibited the proliferation of primary and distant tumors and prevented lung metastasis under NIR laser illumination. Therefore, this study opens an avenue for designing nCOF-based catalysts for pyroelectric catalysis-activated in situ immunotherapy.",

Modeling and satellite observations show that climate refugia are created by the upwelling of cooler water to the surface through the interactions of tides and currents with dense reef structures. Here, we use a high-resolution nested regional ocean model to investigate the future status of two relatively large refugia. On the basis of model projections under a high-emission scenario, we find that the upwelling mechanisms will stay active in a warming climate, and these regions are likely to remain approximately more than 1°C cooler than surrounding waters until at least into the 2080s, providing thermal relief to corals. Identification and protection of these refugia may help facilitate reef survival and related biodiversity preservation by allowing their corals time to acclimatize and adapt and ultimately provide source populations to replenish the rest of the reef.",

We investigate the effect of rising temperatures on a biomarker of nonspecific immune performance in a wild population of capuchin monkeys and provide compelling evidence that immune performance is associated with ambient temperature. Critically, we found that immune performance in young individuals is more sensitive to high temperatures compared to other age groups. Coupled with evidence of rising temperatures in the region, our results offer insight into how climate change will affect the immune system of wild mammals.",

In comparison with its known pathway in Coptis species, its biosynthesis in Phellodendron species remains elusive. Using chromosome-level genome assembly, coexpression matrix, and biochemical assays, we identified six key steps in berberine biosynthesis from Phellodendron amurense , including methylation, hydroxylation, and berberine bridge formation. Notably, we discovered a specific class of O -methyltransferases (NOMT) responsible for N -methylation. Structural analysis and mutagenesis of PaNOMT9 revealed its unique substrate-binding conformation. In addition, unlike the classical FAD-dependent berberine bridge formation in Ranunculales, Phellodendron uses a NAD(P)H-dependent monooxygenase (PaCYP71BG29) for berberine bridge formation, originating from the neofunctionalization of tryptamine 5-hydroxylase. Together, these findings reveal the convergence of berberine biosynthesis between Coptis and Phellodendron and signify the role of the convergent evolution in plant specialized metabolisms.",

Damaging mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, such as SMARCA4 (BRG1), are associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We found that SMARCA4 loss in OC models resulted in increased cancer cell–intrinsic immunogenicity, characterized by up-regulation of long-terminal RNA repeats, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes, and up-regulation of antigen presentation machinery. Notably, this response was dependent on STING, MAVS, and IRF3 signaling but was independent of the type I interferon receptor. Mouse ovarian and melanoma tumors with SMARCA4 loss demonstrated increased infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. These results were recapitulated in BRG1 inhibitor–treated SMARCA4- proficient tumor models, suggesting that modulation of chromatin remodeling through targeting SMARCA4 may serve as a strategy to overcome cancer immune evasion.",

However, mimicking such halogenation process is rarely explored for practical use in organic synthesis. Here, we report the development of a nonheme iron catalyst that mimics the heme-iron–dependent haloperoxidases to catalyze the generation of HOBr from H 2 O 2 /Br − with high efficiency. We discovered that a tridentate terpyridine (TPY) ligand designed for Fenton chemistry was optimal for FeBr 3 to form a stable nonheme iron catalyst [Fe(TPY)Br 3 ], which catalyzed arene bromination, Hunsdiecker-type decarboxylative bromination, bromolactonization, and oxidation of sulfides and thiols. Mechanistic studies revealed that Fenton chemistry ([Fe]/H 2 O 2 ) might operate to generate hydroxyl radical (HO • ), which oxidize bromide ion [Br − ] into reactive HOBr.

Here, we use a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy called PIE-FCCS to resolve EGFR and EphA2 interactions in live cells. We tested the role of ligands and found that EGF, but not ephrin A1 (EA1), stimulated heteromultimerization between the receptors. To determine the effect of anionic lipids, we targeted phospholipase C (PLC) activity to alter the abundance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ). We found that higher PIP 2 levels increased homomultimerization of both EGFR and EphA2, as well as heteromultimerization. This study provides a direct characterization of EGFR and EphA2 interactions in live cells and shows that PIP 2 can have a substantial effect on the spatial organization of RTKs.",

Here, we report a strategy to obtain FCC materials with outstanding mechanical properties in both ambient and cryogenic environments, via exploiting dynamic development of the interstitial-driven local chemical order (LCO). Dense laths composed of the multiscaled LCO domains evolve from planar-slip bands that form in the prior thermomechanical processing, contributing to ultrahigh yield strengths over a wide temperature range. During cryogenic tensile deformation, LCO further develops and promotes remarkable dislocation cross-slip. Together with the deformation-driven transformation and twinning, these factors lead to satisfactory work hardening.

These effects are driven by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) within the VTA, as VTA CB1R conditional knockout counteracts JZL184’s effects. Using fiber photometry with fluorescent sensors for calcium and dopamine (DA), we find that enhancing 2-AG levels diminishes opioid reward–related nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity and DA neurotransmission.

When one end of an actively reptative polymer is anchored, it undergoes continual self-knotting as a result of intermittent giant conformation fluctuations and the outward reptative motion. Once a knot is formed, it migrates to the anchoring point due to a nonequilibrium ratchet effect. Moreover, when the active polymer is grafted on a passive polymer, it can function as a self-propelling soft needle to either transfer its own knots or directly braid knots on the passive polymer. We further show that these active needles can create intermolecular bridging knots between two passive polymers. Our finding highlights the nonequilibrium effects in modifying the dynamic pathways of polymer systems, which have potential applications in macromolecular topology engineering.",

          "abstract": "Ancient Native American ancestors (Clovis) have been interpreted as either specialized megafauna hunters or generalist foragers. Supporting data are typically indirect (toolkits, associated fauna) or speculative (models, actualistic experiments). Here, we present stable isotope analyses of the only known Clovis individual, the 18-month-old Anzick child, to directly infer maternal protein diet. Using comparative fauna from this region and period, we find that mammoth was the largest contributor to Clovis diet, followed by elk and bison/camel, while the contribution of small mammals was negligible, broadly consistent with the Clovis zooarchaeological record. When compared with second-order consumers, the Anzick-1 maternal diet is closest to that of scimitar cat, a mammoth specialist. Our findings are consistent with the Clovis megafaunal specialist model, using sophisticated technology and high residential mobility to subsist on the highest ranked prey, an adaptation allowing them to rapidly expand across the Americas south of the Pleistocene ice sheets.",

          "abstract": "Sensitivity is often the Achilles’ heel of liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. This problem is perhaps most pressing at the lowest fields (e.g., 80-MHz 1 H frequency), with rapidly increasing access to NMR through benchtop systems, but also sometimes for higher-field NMR systems from 300 MHz to 1.2 GHz. Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) can address this sensitivity limitation. However, dDNP implies massive and complex cryogenic and high-field instrumentation, which cannot be installed on the bench. We introduce here a compact helium-free 1-T tabletop polarizer as a simple and low-cost alternative. After freezing and polarizing the frozen analyte solutions at 77 K, we demonstrate 1 H signal enhancement factors of 100, with rapid 1-s buildup times. The high polarization is subsequently transferred by 1 H→ 13 C cross polarization (CP) to 13 C spins. Such a simple benchtop polarizer, in combination with hyperpolarizing solid matrices (HYPSOs), may open the way to replenishable hyperpolarization throughout multiple liquid-state NMR experiments.",

Conversely, mechanical metamaterials have fixed interunit connections that restrict adaptability and reconfiguration. This study introduces granular metamaterials composed of discrete bimaterial structured particles that transition between assembled and unassembled states through mechanical compression and thermal stimuli. These materials enable dynamic bond reconfiguration, allowing reversible bond breaking and formation, similar to natural systems. Leveraging their discrete nature, these materials can adaptively reconfigure their shape and respond dynamically to varying conditions. Our investigations reveal that these granular metamaterials can substantially alter their mechanical properties, like compression, shearing, and bending, offering tunable mechanical characteristics across different states. Furthermore, they exhibit collective behaviors like directional movement, object capture, transportation, and gap crossing, showcasing their potential for reprogrammable functionalities. This work highlights the dynamic reconfigurability and robust adaptability of granular metamaterials, expanding their potential in responsive architecture and autonomous robotics.",

Inspired by the desert ants’ compound eyes, we developed a single-shot pol-PD based on four-directional grating arrays capped perovskite single-crystal thin film without other standard polarization optics. Our pol-PD has a high detectivity, two orders of magnitude greater than that of commercial photodetectors, and exhibits high polarization sensitivity. The high performance of our pol-PD is due to the highly crystalline perovskite single-crystal thin film and regular nanograting structure, made by a nanoimprinting crystallization method.

We compile original and existing genomic, isotopic, and osteological canid data from archaeological, paleontological, and modern sites. Results show that in contrast to canids recovered in non-anthropic contexts, canids recovered in association with human occupations are markedly diverse.

This variation is expressed along both geographic and temporal gradients, starting in the terminal Pleistocene with canids showing high marine dietary estimates.

A key effector of these changes is exaggerated airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell contraction to spasmogens. No drugs in clinical use effectively prevent ASM hyperresponsiveness in asthma across all severities. We find that N-cadherin, a membrane cell-cell adhesion protein up-regulated in ASM from patients with severe asthma, is required for the development of airway obstruction induced by allergic airway inflammation in mice. Inhibition of N-cadherin by ADH-1 reduced airway hyperresponsiveness independent of allergic inflammation, prevented bronchoconstriction, and actively promoted bronchodilation of airways ex vivo. ADH-1 inhibited ASM contraction by disrupting N-cadherin–δ-catenin interactions, which decreased intracellular actin remodeling. These data provide evidence for an intercellular communication pathway mediating ASM contraction and identify N-cadherin as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting bronchoconstriction in asthma.",

Achieving 70 to 80% of the designed strain requires only 5 seconds of heating. A thermal strain of around 30% is achieved for the assembled metamaterials, surpassing other bimetallic metamaterials by a magnitude of 100 to 200.

Here, we report leveraging spontaneous snapping stroke in the monostable flapping wing of a manta-like soft swimmer to address the challenge. The monostable wing is pneumatically actuated to instantaneously snap through to stroke down, and upon deflation, it will spontaneously stroke up by snapping back to its initial state, driven by elastic restoring force, without consuming additional energy.

The transition between these two states leads to various response modes in the metasurface and notably increases the diversity of the spectrum transformation, resulting in a multivalued relationship in which each output corresponds to more than one input signal, thus establishing the logical modulation.

This approximately 2°C rise in summer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) likely resulted in higher carbonate production rates, which were crucial for the formation of the Great Barrier Reef.

The protective effect observed in ANGPTL4 mutant mice is correlated with a reduction in stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, lessened mitochondrial damage, and increased fatty acid oxidation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that podocyte- or tubule-secreted Angptl4 interacts with Integrin β1 and influences the association between dipeptidyl-4 with Integrin β1. We demonstrate the utility of a targeted pharmacologic therapy that specifically inhibits Angptl4 gene expression in the kidneys and protects diabetic kidneys from proteinuria and fibrosis.

Conventional direct faradaic detection based on electron transfers at solid electrode/solution interfaces has been proven ineffective due to the electrochemically inactive nature of Cl − . Here, we present an approach involving molecularly tailored liquid/liquid interfacial ultramicro iontronics (L/L-UIs) supported at ultramicropipettes filled with organic gel containing lipophilic bis-thioureas ionophores, which represents the first application of amperometric methodology based on electrochemical facilitated ion transfers reactions at a soft L/L ultramicrointerface to achieve in vivo sensing of electrochemically inactive ions, and dynamically tracking cerebral Cl − in vivo. Furthermore, evidence of dynamic neuronal Cl − regulation via KCC2 modulated through GABA B receptors was provided, further substantiating GABA B receptor–mediated Cl − -related neuronal inhibition. The proposed L/L-UIs have notable potential for in situ tracking of other crucial electrochemically inactive ions or ionized biomolecules in vivo, thereby facilitating the study of brain diseases and the diagnosis and treatment of related disorders.",

An example is the carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment for CO 2 fixation. The carboxysome uses a polyhedral protein shell made of hexamers, pentamers, and trimers to encapsulate Rubisco, increasing CO 2 levels near Rubisco to enhance carboxylation. Despite their role in the global carbon cycle, the molecular mechanisms behind carboxysome shell assembly remain unclear. Here, we present a structural characterization of α-carboxysome shells generated from recombinant systems, which contain all shell proteins and the scaffolding protein CsoS2. Atomic-resolution cryo–electron microscopy of the shell assemblies, with a maximal size of 54 nm, unveil diverse assembly interfaces between shell proteins, detailed interactions of CsoS2 with shell proteins to drive shell assembly, and the formation of heterohexamers and heteropentamers by different shell protein paralogs, facilitating the assembly of larger empty shells. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the construction principles of α-carboxysome shells and the role of CsoS2 in governing α-carboxysome assembly and functionality.",

By combining in vivo 19 F-MR molecular imaging, we investigate the immunological effects of a single low-dose PFCE-C25 NEs in multiple murine lung cancer models, including human immune system (HIS) mouse models, and validated its immunological effects in human TDLNs. The nebulization therapy with PFCE-C25 NEs demonstrated a notable and enduring maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, leading to systemic immune responses, prolonged survival, the establishment of immune memory, and resistance to tumor rechallenge.

For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to be essential in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz, is challenging because of limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO 3 and SrTiO 3 by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO 3 , the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 terahertz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO 3 broadens substantially below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub–milli–electron volt phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface collective excitations.",

Under salt stress, cortical microtubules undergo a depolymerization-reassembly process to promote the biosynthesis of stress-adaptive cellulose, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process are still largely unknown. In this study, we reveal that FERONIA (FER), a potential cell wall sensor, interacts with COMPANION OF CELLULOSE SYNTHASE1 (CC1) and its closest homolog, CC2, two proteins that are required for cortical microtubule reassembly under salt stress. Biochemical data indicate that FER phosphorylates CC1 on multiple residues in its second and third hydrophobic microtubule-binding regions and that these phosphorylations modulate CC1 trafficking and affect the ability of CC1 to engage with microtubules. Furthermore, CC1 phosphorylation level is altered upon exposure to salt stress, which coincides with the changes of microtubule organization. Together, our study outlines an important intracellular mechanism that maintains microtubule arrays during salt exposure in plant cells.",

Nowadays, the most accurate wave models are based on numerical methods, which primarily concern the wave spectrum evolution by solving wave action balance partial differential equations. These methods are computationally expensive and limited by incomplete physical representations of wave spectral evolution. Here, we present a deep learning–based wave model trained using observation-merged wave hindcasts. Guided by the physics knowledge that waves are either generated by local current winds or by remote historical winds, this method can directly model significant wave height, bypassing the need for wave spectral information. This feature engineering effectively reduces the complexity of model inputs and outputs. The resulting artificial intelligence method can model 1 year of global significant wave heights at a 0.5° × 0.5° × 1-hour resolution within half an hour on a personal computer, achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art numerical wave models.",

We identify an α V β 6 /HER2 cross-talk mechanism driving invasion, which is dysregulated in drug-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cells. Proteomic analyses reveal ligand-bound α V β 6 recruits HER2 and a trafficking subnetwork, comprising guanosine triphosphatases RAB5 and RAB7A and the Rab regulator guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 2 (GDI2). The RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 functional module mediates direct cross-talk between α V β 6 and HER2, affecting receptor trafficking and signaling. Acute exposure to trastuzumab increases recruitment of the subnetwork to α V β 6 , but trastuzumab resistance decouples GDI2 recruitment. GDI2, RAB5, and RAB7A cooperate to regulate migration and transforming growth factor–β activation to promote invasion. However, these mechanisms are dysregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells. In patients, RAB5A , RAB7A , and GDI2 expression correlates with patient survival and α V β 6 expression predicts relapse following trastuzumab treatment. Thus, the RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 subnetwork regulates α V β 6 -HER2 cross-talk to drive breast cancer invasion but is subverted in trastuzumab-resistant cells to drive α V β 6 -independent and HER2-independent tumor progression.",

In the particular case of Cys-loop receptor channels, five short stretches of amino acids, one per subunit, link the extracellular and transmembrane domains in such a way that the ion permeability of the latter and the affinity for neurotransmitters of the former become tied to each other. Here, using direct functional approaches, we set out to understand the molecular bases of this crucial interdependence through the characterization of total loss-of-current mutations at the interface between domains. Our results indicate that domain−domain proximity plays a previously unnoticed critical role inasmuch as inserting a single residue in each linker rendered the two domains independent of each other. In marked contrast, loss-of-current mutations that leave the linkers’ length unaltered did not compromise the interdomain coupling, but rather, seemed to cause agonist-bound closed receptors to desensitize without appreciably opening.",

Here, we demonstrate that QGP at the LaAlO 3 /KTaO 3 (110) interface can be efficiently modulated by the orientation of applied magnetic field: With a perpendicular field, an anomalous QGP emerges in the low-temperature regime, characterized by a decreasing critical field as temperature lowers; conversely, with a parallel field, a normal QGP arises, where the critical field increases with decreasing temperature. Such opposite characteristics stem from the controllable quantum fluctuations and conductivity corrections under distinct magnetic field orientations. Furthermore, we show the effective tuning of the phase boundary by electrostatic gating, attributed to the gate-controlled quantum fluctuations. These findings not only demonstrate how to experimentally manipulate QGP but also provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum fluctuations can effectively modulate QGP.",

The impact of these interactions is to distort DNA structural conformations, and these are also revealed with atomic force microscopy. The importance of the 5′-flanking DNA is further emphasized with reporter gene assays and comparisons with canonical response elements. Overall, the study reveals the inadequacy of current definitions of the DNA hormone response element (HRE) and suggests that future descriptions of the HRE include the conserved distal DNA sequences.

We used a high-throughput microfluidic platform combined with a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of VISTA levels. Functional characterization showed that the knockdown of these hits diminished VISTA surface levels on macrophages and sustained an antitumor phenotype. Furthermore, targeting of both AhR and IRAK1 in mouse models overcame resistance to ICB treatment. Tumor immunophenotyping indicated that infiltration of cytotoxic CD8 + cells, natural killer cells, and antitumor macrophages was substantially increased in treated mice.

With hundreds of well-recorded events, we verify that PmP is observable and develop a technique to identify and pick P-PmP differential times with high confidence.

Systematic interrogation of the five E protein binding elements (EPE1–5) in the Tcf7 enhancer region showed lineage-specific utilization. Specifically, loss-of-function analysis revealed that only EPE3 plays a critical role in supporting αβ T cell development, while EPE1, 3, and 5 regulate the γδ T cell maturation and functional cell fate decision. The importance of EPE3 in supporting both lineages may stem from its unique capacity to interact with the Tcf7 transcriptional start site.

Here, we identify an essential regulator of Drosophila thoracic flight muscle development, the Hox TF Antennapedia (Antp). Correcting a long-standing belief that flight muscle development occurs without the input of Hox TFs, we show that Antp intervenes at several stages of flight muscle development, from the establishment of the progenitor pool in the embryo to myoblast differentiation in the early pupa. Furthermore, the precisely regulated clearance of Hox in the developing flight muscle fibers is required to allow for fibrillar muscle fate diversification, setting these muscles apart from all other adult tubular muscle types.",

We report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young’s modulus (30 kilopascals) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20 to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies.

Despite profound implications for the Arctic climate system and marine ecosystems, the primary drivers of this process remain debated. One hypothesis suggested that alternating phases of the atmospheric Arctic Dipole may have mitigated recent atlantification. Here, we use high-resolution model simulations to disentangle the main contributors to atlantification in the Arctic basin. We show that the decline in Arctic sea ice was the dominant driver, while wind variability associated with the Arctic Dipole played a minor role, contributing slightly rather than mitigating the process. The positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation also made a relatively small contribution. Although recent changes in atmospheric circulation over the Greenland Sea tended to reduce warm water inflow through the Fram Strait, this cooling effect on the Arctic Atlantic Water layer was outweighed by the warming induced by sea ice decline.",

          "abstract": "Ocean-emitted dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a major source of climate-cooling aerosols. However, most of the marine biogenic sulfur cycling is not routed to DMS but to methanethiol (MeSH), another volatile whose reactivity has hitherto hampered measurements. Therefore, the global emissions and climate impact of MeSH remain unexplored. We compiled a database of seawater MeSH concentrations, identified their statistical predictors, and produced monthly fields of global marine MeSH emissions adding to DMS emissions. Implemented into a global chemistry-climate model, MeSH emissions increase the sulfate aerosol burden by 30 to 70% over the Southern Ocean and enhance the aerosol cooling effect while depleting atmospheric oxidants and increasing DMS lifetime and transport. Accounting for MeSH emissions reduces the radiative bias of current climate models in this climatically relevant region.",

          "abstract": "Astrocyte secreted signals substantially affect disease pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. It remains little understood about how proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1α/tumor necrosis factor–α/C1q (ITC), often elevated in neurodegenerative diseases, alter astrocyte-secreted signals and their effects in disease pathogenesis. By selectively isolating astrocyte exosomes (A-Exo.) and employing cell type–specific exosome reporter mice, our current study showed that ITC cytokines significantly reduced A-Exo. secretion and decreased spreading of focally labeled A-Exo. in diseased SOD1G93A mice. Our results also found that A-Exo. were minimally associated with misfolded SOD1 and elicited no toxicity to mouse spinal and human iPSC–derived motor neurons. In contrast, A-Exo. were neuroprotective against excitotoxicity, which was completely diminished by ITC cytokines and partially abolished by SOD1G93A expression. Subsequent proteomic characterization of A-Exo. and genetic analysis identified that surface expression of glial-specific HepaCAM preferentially mediates A-Exo’s axon protection effect. Together, our study defines a cytokine-induced loss-of-function mechanism of A-Exo. in protecting neurons from excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

          "abstract": "As versatile ligands with extraordinary coordination capabilities, RPH 2 (R = alkyl or aryl) are rarely used in constructing metal nanoclusters due to their volatility, toxicity, spontaneous flammability, and susceptibility to oxidation. In this work, we designed a primary and tertiary phosphorus-bound diphosphine chelator (2-Ph 2 PC 6 H 4 PH 2 ) to create ultrastable silver nanoclusters with metallic aromaticity. By controlling the deprotonation rate of 2-Ph 2 PC 6 H 4 PH 2 and adjusting the templates, we successfully synthesized two near-infrared emissive nanoclusters, Ag30 and Ag32 , which have analogous icosidodecahedral Ag 30 shells with an I h symmetry. Deprotonated ligand (2-Ph 2 P α C 6 H 4 P β 2− ) exhibits a coordination mode of μ 5 -η 1 (P β ),η 2 (P α ,P β ), which endows a unique metallic aromaticity to Ag30 and Ag32 . The solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes based on Ag30 achieve an external quantum efficiency of 15.1%, representing the breakthrough in application of silver nanoclusters to near-infrared–emitting devices. This work represents a special ligand system for synthesizing ligand-protected coinage metal nanoclusters and opens up horizons of creating nanoclusters with distinct geometries and metal aromaticity.",

We compile data on contemporary fluvial suspended sediment yield (SSY) and 12 environmental proxies from 151 rivers in High Mountain Asia surrounding the Tibetan Plateau. We demonstrate that glaciers exert a first-order control on fluvial SSYs, with high precipitation nonlinearly amplifying their role, especially in high–glacier cover basins. We find a bidirectional response to vegetation’s influence on SSY in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau and Tien Shan and identify that the two interacting factors of precipitation and vegetation cover explain 54% of the variability in SSY, reflecting the divergent roles of vegetation in promoting biogenic-weathering versus slope stabilization across bioclimatic zones. The competing interactions between glaciers, ecosystems, and climate in delivering suspended sediment have important implications for predicting carbon and nutrient exports and water quality in response to future climate change.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral inflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of sickness behaviors and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. The circumventricular organs (CVOs) are important brain sites to perceive peripheral inflammatory signals, but few studies have reported their role in inflammation-induced anxiety or depression. Using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced inflammation, we identified a previously unreported role of the subfornical organ (SFO), one of the CVOs, in combating inflammation-induced anxiety. LPS treatment induced anxiety-like and sickness behaviors in mice. Although both the SFO and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (a CVO) neurons were activated after LPS treatment, only manipulating SFO neurons modulated LPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Activating or inhibiting SFO neurons alleviated or aggravated LPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, SFO exerted this effect through glutamatergic projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Manipulating SFO neurons did not affect LPS-induced sickness behaviors. Thus, we uncovered an active role of SFO neurons in counteracting peripheral inflammation-induced anxiety.",

The pan-serotype DENV inhibitor JNJ-A07 has shown potent activity in a mouse model. It remains unknown whether an antiviral drug ingested by mosquitoes could inhibit virus replication and thus reduce transmission to other hosts. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of JNJ-A07 when administered in the blood meal to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. JNJ-A07 blocked DENV-2 transmission by the mosquitoes in both pre-exposure and post-exposure settings. In addition, JNJ-A07 remained in the mosquito bodies for 7 days after blood meal. Reductions of DENV systemic infection in the mosquitoes suggested a potential for decreased proportions of DENV outbreaks in a simulated environment when the mosquitoes ingested JNJ-A07 via the blood meal.",

Participants were from 19 pregnancy cohorts (9833 term newborns) and 6 pediatric cohorts (2429 children aged 6 to 10 years). We identified six CpGs in cord blood associated with cesarean delivery (effect size range: 0.4 to 0.7%, P &lt; 1.0 × 10 −7 ): MAP2K2 (cg19423175), LIM2 (cg01500140), CNP (cg13917614), BLM (cg18247172), RASA3 (cg22348356), and RUNX3 (cg20674490), independent of cell proportions and other confounders. In childhood, none of these CpGs were associated with cesarean delivery, and no additional CpGs were identified. Delivery mode was associated with cell proportions at birth but not in childhood. Further research is needed to elucidate cesarean delivery’s molecular influence on offspring health.",

Perforation morphologies observed by electron microscopy show that a much larger network region is deformed due to sp 3 bond enhanced load sharing within and between tubes, while defects introduced by the radiation induce more bond, shell, and tube damage leading to strongly enhanced energy dissipation.",

Biomarkers to distinguish patients who would benefit from combination therapy versus aPD-1 remain elusive. We analyzed whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment tumors from four cohorts ( n = 140) of ICB-naïve patients treated with aPD-1. High genomic heterogeneity and low ploidy robustly identified patients intrinsically resistant to aPD-1. To establish clinically actionable predictions, we optimized and validated a predictive model using ploidy and heterogeneity to confidently identify (90% PPV) patients with intrinsic resistance to and worse survival on aPD-1. We further observed that three of seven (43%) patients predicted to be intrinsically resistant to single-agent PD-1 ICB responded to combination ICB, suggesting that these patients may benefit disproportionately from combination ICB. These findings highlight the importance of heterogeneity and ploidy, nominating an approach toward clinical actionability.",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA repair dysregulation in cancer cells is crucial for cancer development and therapies. Here, we report that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) directly methylates poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an essential enzyme involved in DNA repair, and regulates its activity. Functionally, EZH2-catalyzed methylation represses PARP1 catalytic activity, down-regulates the recruitment of x-ray repair cross-complementing group-1 to DNA lesions and its associated DNA damage repair; on the other hand, it protects the cells from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide overconsumption upon DNA damage formation. Meanwhile, EZH2-mediated methylation regulates PARP1 transcriptional and oncogenic activity, at least in part, through impairing PARP1-E2F1 interaction and E2F1 transcription factor activity. EZH2 and PARP1 inhibitors synergistically suppress prostate cancer growth. Collectively, our findings uncover an insight of EZH2 functions in fine-tuning PARP1 activity during DNA damage repair and cancer progression, which provides a rationale for combinational targeting EZH2 and PARP1 in cancer.",

Products with opposite chirality have been both obtained using the same or closely analogous chiral catalyst in good efficiency and excellent enantioselectivity, and the enantiodivergence was mainly enabled by an achiral carboxylic acid and its silver salt. Mechanistic studies revealed the origin of the enantiodivergence ascribable to the switch of the enantiodetermining step (alkyne insertion versus protonolysis) under acid control, which constitutes a previously unidentified working mode of enantiodivergence by leveraging two elementary steps.",

Across the top 100 meters and from 1800 to 2014, the saturation state of aragonite (Ω arag ) and pH = −log[H + ] decreased by more than 0.6 and 0.1, respectively, with nearly 50% of the progression occurring over the past 20 years. While the magnitude of the Ω arag change decreases uniformly with depth, the magnitude of the [H + ] increase exhibits a distinct maximum in the upper thermocline. Since 1800, the saturation horizon (Ω arag = 1) shoaled by more than 200 meters, approaching the euphotic zone in several regions, especially in the Southern Ocean, and exposing many organisms to corrosive conditions.",
