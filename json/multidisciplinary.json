          "abstract": "Recent Antarctic sea-ice decline is a substantial source of concern, notably the record low in 2023 (ref. 1 ). Progress has been made towards establishing the causes of ice loss 1–5 but uncertainty remains about its consequences for ocean–atmosphere interaction. Resolution of this uncertainty is important as ice decline can substantially alter surface heat loss and thus the ocean and atmosphere 6 . Here we show that the strongest winter 2023 ice-retraction regions provide an important new source of turbulent ocean heat loss to the atmosphere in wintertime. Ice concentration in these regions (located primarily in the Weddell, Bellingshausen and Ross seas) is reduced by up to 80% and is accompanied by an unprecedented doubling of mid-winter ocean heat loss. Also, there is a phase shift in the time of peak heat loss from late April to mid-June, with weaker than normal heat loss in austral autumn. The winter surface-heat-loss intensification is accompanied by substantial changes on both sides of the ocean–atmosphere interface. These include increases in atmospheric-storm frequency and surface-heat-loss-driven dense water formation, although the implications of the densification for broader processes such as Antarctic bottom water formation remain unclear. Our results reveal that the 2023 Antarctic sea-ice loss has substantially modified air–sea interaction in the Southern Ocean and motivate in-depth analysis of the wider climate-system impacts.",

Despite TFs recognizing specific DNA motifs within accessible chromatin, this information is insufficient to explain how TFs select enhancers 1 . Here we compared four different TF combinations that induce different cell states, analysing TF genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of TFs. When bound together, TFs act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels TF combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, TFs assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing TF combinatorial binding to enhancers.",

          "authors": "Francis Nimmo, Thorsten Kleine, Alessandro Morbidelli",
          "abstract": "The last giant impact on Earth is thought to have formed the Moon 1 . The timing of this event can be determined by dating the different rocks assumed to have crystallized from the lunar magma ocean (LMO). This has led to a wide range of estimates for the age of the Moon between 4.35 and 4.51 billion years ago (Ga), depending on whether ages for lunar whole-rock samples 2–4 or individual zircon grains 5–7 are used. Here we argue that the frequent occurrence of approximately 4.35-Ga ages among lunar rocks and a spike in zircon ages at about the same time 8 is indicative of a remelting event driven by the Moon’s orbital evolution rather than the original crystallization of the LMO. We show that during passage through the Laplace plane transition 9 , the Moon experienced sufficient tidal heating and melting to reset the formation ages of most lunar samples, while retaining an earlier frozen-in shape 10 and rare, earlier-formed zircons. This paradigm reconciles existing discrepancies in estimates for the crystallization time of the LMO, and permits formation of the Moon within a few tens of million years of Solar System formation, consistent with dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation 11 . Remelting of the Moon also explains the lower number of lunar impact basins than expected 12,13 , and allows metal from planetesimals accreted to the Moon after its formation to be removed to the lunar core, explaining the apparent deficit of such materials in the Moon compared with Earth 14 .",

          "abstract": "Much of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs 1 , many of which contain structural elements that are important for their function. Such RNA molecules—including those that are structured and well-folded 2 —are conformationally heterogeneous and flexible, which is a prerequisite for function 3,4 , but this limits the applicability of methods such as NMR, crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy for structure elucidation. Moreover, owing to the lack of a large RNA structure database, and no clear correlation between sequence and structure, approaches such as AlphaFold 5 for protein structure prediction do not apply to RNA. Therefore, determining the structures of heterogeneous RNAs remains an unmet challenge. Here we report holistic RNA structure determination method using atomic force microscopy, unsupervised machine learning and deep neural networks (HORNET), a novel method for determining three-dimensional topological structures of RNA using atomic force microscopy images of individual molecules in solution. Owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy, this method is ideal for capturing structures of large RNA molecules in distinct conformations. In addition to six benchmark cases, we demonstrate the utility of HORNET by determining multiple heterogeneous structures of RNase P RNA and the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA. Thus, our method addresses one of the major challenges in determining heterogeneous structures of large and flexible RNA molecules, and contributes to the fundamental understanding of RNA structural biology.",

          "abstract": "Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions 1,2 . Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry 3 . Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96 nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design.",

          "abstract": "RNA conformational diversity has fundamental biological roles 1–5 , but direct visualization of its full conformational space in solution has not been possible using traditional biophysical techniques. Using solution atomic force microscopy, a deep neural network and statistical analyses, we show that the ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA adopts heterogeneous conformations consisting of a conformationally invariant core and highly flexible peripheral structural elements that sample a broad conformational space, with amplitudes as large as 20–60 Å in a multitude of directions, with very low net energy cost. Increasing Mg 2+ drives compaction and enhances enzymatic activity, probably by narrowing the conformational space. Moreover, analyses of the correlations and anticorrelations between spatial flexibility and sequence conservation suggest that the functional roles of both the structure and dynamics of key regions are embedded in the primary sequence. These findings reveal the structure–dynamics basis for the embodiment of both enzymatic precision and substrate promiscuity in the RNA component of the RNase P. Mapping the conformational space of the RNase P RNA demonstrates a new general approach to studying RNA structure and dynamics.",

Several different models have been proposed to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate 10–16 . Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Hα emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 × 10 8 M ⊙ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4—that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation—whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.",

Guided by this map, we investigated how differentiating human pluripotent stem cells develop a stereotypical spatial organization of trunk cell types. We found that YAP inactivation in conjunction with FGF-mediated MAPK signalling facilitated WNT pathway activation and induced expression of TBXT (also known as BRA). In addition, timely inhibition of WNT-induced NODAL and BMP signalling regulated the proportions of different tissue types, including notochordal cells. This enabled us to create a three-dimensional model of human trunk development that undergoes morphogenetic movements, producing elongated structures with a notochord and ventral neural and mesodermal tissues. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying vertebrate notochord formation and establish a more comprehensive in vitro model of human trunk development. This paves the way for future studies of tissue patterning in a physiologically relevant environment.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are rapidly advancing, enhancing human capabilities across various fields spanning from finance to medicine. Despite their numerous advantages, AI systems can exhibit biased judgements in domains ranging from perception to emotion. Here, in a series of experiments ( n = 1,401 participants), we reveal a feedback loop where human–AI interactions alter processes underlying human perceptual, emotional and social judgements, subsequently amplifying biases in humans. This amplification is significantly greater than that observed in interactions between humans, due to both the tendency of AI systems to amplify biases and the way humans perceive AI systems. Participants are often unaware of the extent of the AI’s influence, rendering them more susceptible to it. These findings uncover a mechanism wherein AI systems amplify biases, which are further internalized by humans, triggering a snowball effect where small errors in judgement escalate into much larger ones.",

          "abstract": "Although the use of short self-report measures is common practice in biobank initiatives, such a phenotyping strategy is inherently prone to reporting errors. To explore challenges related to self-report errors, we first derived a reporting error score in the UK Biobank (UKBB; n = 73,127), capturing inconsistent self-reporting in time-invariant phenotypes across multiple measurement occasions. We then performed genome-wide scans on the reporting error score, applied downstream analyses (linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization) and compared its properties to the UKBB participation propensity. Finally, we improved phenotype resolution for 24 measures and inspected the changes in genomic findings. We found that reporting error was present across all 33 assessed self-report measures, with repeatability levels as low as 47% (childhood body size). Reporting error was not independent from UKBB participation, evidenced by the negative genetic correlation between the two outcomes ( r g = −0.77), their shared causes (for example, education) and the loss in self-report accuracy following participation bias correction. Across all analyses, the impact of reporting error ranged from reduced power (for example, for gene discovery) to biased estimates (for example, if present in the exposure variable) and attenuation of genome-wide quantities (for example, 21% relative attenuation in SNP heritability for childhood height). Our findings highlight that both self-report accuracy and selective participation are competing biases and sources of poor reproducibility for biobank-scale research.",

A growing literature has examined the effect of fundamental structural elements of the models supporting SCC calculations. This work has accumulated in a piecemeal fashion, leaving their relative importance unclear. Here, we perform a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the SCC, combining 1,823 estimates of the SCC from 147 studies with a survey of authors of these studies. The distribution of published 2020 SCC values is wide and substantially right-skewed, showing evidence of a heavy right tail (truncated mean of $132). ANOVA reveals important roles for the inclusion of persistent damages, the representation of the Earth system, and distributional weighting. However, our survey reveals that experts believe the literature underestimates the SCC due to an undersampling of model structures, incomplete characterization of damages, and high discount rates. To address this imbalance, we train a random forest model on variation in the literature and use it to generate a synthetic SCC distribution that more closely matches expert assessments of appropriate model structure and discounting. This synthetic distribution has a mean of $283 per ton CO 2 for a 2020 pulse year (5% to 95% range: $32 to $874), higher than most official government estimates, including a 2023 update from the U.S. EPA.",

          "abstract": "Infectious disease can reduce labor productivity and incomes, trapping subpopulations in a vicious cycle of ill health and poverty. Efforts to boost African farmers’ agricultural production through fertilizer use can inadvertently promote the growth of aquatic vegetation that hosts disease vectors. Recent trials established that removing aquatic vegetation habitat for snail intermediate hosts reduces schistosomiasis infection rates in children, while converting the harvested vegetation into compost boosts agricultural productivity and incomes. We develop a bioeconomic model that interacts an analytical microeconomic model of agricultural households’ behavior, health status, and incomes over time with a dynamic model of schistosomiasis disease ecology. We calibrate the model with field data from northern Senegal. We show analytically and via simulation that local conversion of invasive aquatic vegetation to compost changes the feedback among interlinked disease, aquatic, and agricultural systems, reducing schistosomiasis infection and increasing incomes relative to the current status quo, in which villagers rarely remove aquatic vegetation. Aquatic vegetation removal disrupts the poverty-disease trap by reducing habitat for snails that vector the infectious helminth and by promoting the production of compost that returns to agricultural soils nutrients that currently leach into surface water from on-farm fertilizer applications. The result is healthier people, more productive labor, cleaner water, more productive agriculture, and higher incomes. Our model illustrates how this ecological intervention changes the feedback between the human and natural systems, potentially freeing rural households from poverty-disease traps.",

          "abstract": "Decisions about solar geoengineering (SG) entail risk–risk tradeoffs between the direct risks of SG and SG’s ability to reduce climate risks. Quantitative comparisons between these risks are needed to inform public policy. We evaluate idealized SG’s effectiveness in reducing deaths from warming using two climate models and an econometric analysis of temperature-attributable mortality. We find SG’s impact on temperature-attributable mortality is uneven with decreases for hotter, poorer regions and increases in cooler, richer regions. Relative to no SG, global mortality is reduced by over 400,000 deaths annually [90% CI: (−1.2 million,2.7 million)] for cooling of 1 °C from 2.5 °C above preindustrial in 2080. We find no evidence that mortality reduction achieved by SG is smaller than the reduction from equivalent cooling by emissions reductions. Combining our estimates with existing estimates of sulphate aerosol injection direct mortality risk from air quality and UV-attributable cancer enables the first quantitative risk-risk comparison of SG. We estimate with 61% probability that the mortality benefits of cooling outweigh these direct SG risks. We find the benefits outweigh these risks by 13 times for our central estimates, or 4 deaths per 100,000 per 1 °C per year [90% CI: (−11,23)]. This is not a comprehensive evaluation of the risk–risk tradeoffs around SG, yet by comparing some of the most consequential impacts on human welfare it is a useful first step. While these findings are robust to a variety of alternative assumptions, considerable uncertainties remain and require further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Institutions allow cooperation to persist when reciprocity and reputation provide insufficient incentives. Yet how they do so remains unclear, especially given that institutions are themselves a form of cooperation. To solve this puzzle, we develop a mathematical model of reputation-based cooperation in which two social dilemmas are nested within one another. The first dilemma, characterized by high individual costs or insufficient monitoring, cannot be solved by reputation alone. The second dilemma, an institutional collective action, involves individuals contributing to change the parameters of the first dilemma in a way that incentivizes cooperation. Our model demonstrates that this nested architecture creates a leverage effect. While insufficient on its own to incentivize cooperation in the first dilemma, reputation incentivizes contributions to the institutional collective action, which, in turn, strengthen the initially weak incentives for cooperation in the first dilemma. Just as a pulley system transforms minimal muscular strength into significant lifting capability, institutions act as cooperative pulleys, transforming initially weak reputational incentives into powerful drivers of cooperative behavior. Based on these results, we suggest that institutions have developed as social technologies, designed by humans to exploit this social leverage effect, just as material technologies are designed to exploit physical laws.",

Yet, training PNN is difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e., training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via an autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources. Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN), and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of the physical process. Using magnetic texture–defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja’s learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform toward efficient autonomous training directly in materials.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the way that digital artists zoom out of the canvas to assess the visual impact of their works, we introduce a conceptually simple yet effective metric for quantifying the clarity of digital images. This metric contrasts original images with progressively “melted” counterparts, produced by randomly flipping adjacent pixel pairs. It measures the presence of stable structures, assigning the value zero to completely uniform or random images and finite values for those with discernible patterns. This metric respects the color diversity of the original image and withstands image compression and color quantization. Its suitability for diverse image analysis problems is demonstrated through its effective evaluation of textural images, the identification of structural transitions in physical systems like the Potts model, and its consistency with color theory in digital arts. This allows us to demonstrate that color in visual art functions as a state variable, akin to the spin configuration in magnets, driving artistic designs to transition between states with distinct clarity. When combined with the Shannon entropy, which quantifies color diversity, the structural stability metric can serve as a navigation tool for artists to explore pathways on the complex structural information landscape toward the completion of their artwork. As a practical demonstration, we apply our metric to refine and optimize an emote design for a video game. The structural stability metric emerges as a versatile tool for extracting nuanced structural information from digital images, which may enhance decision-making and data analysis across scientific and creative domains.",

Rare fold-switching events by KaiB provide a critical delay in the negative feedback loop of this posttranslational oscillator. In this study, we experimentally and computationally investigate the temperature dependence of fold switching and its mechanism. We demonstrate that the stability of gsKaiB increases with temperature compared to fsKaiB and that the Q10 value for the gsKaiB → fsKaiB transition is nearly three times smaller than that for the reverse transition in a construct optimized for NMR studies. Simulations and native-state hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR experiments suggest that fold switching can involve both partially and completely unfolded intermediates. The simulations predict that the transition state for fold switching coincides with isomerization of conserved prolines in the most rapidly exchanging region, and we confirm experimentally that proline isomerization is a rate-limiting step for fold switching. We explore the implications of our results for temperature compensation, a hallmark of circadian clocks, through a kinetic model.",

The latest cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures provide unique insights into channel function and pharmacology, opening avenues for different therapeutic strategies against human diseases associated with KCNQ1 mutations. However, these structures also raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms of ion permeation. Cryo-EM structures thought to represent the open state of the channel feature a cavity region not wide enough for accommodation of hydrated K + . To understand how K + passes through the cavity constriction, we utilized microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the KCNQ1/KCNE3 cryo-EM structure, characterized mutants at the G345 residue situated at the narrowest point of the cavity, and recorded single channels. The findings indicate that ions become partially dehydrated at the constriction, which enables permeation. MD simulations demonstrate that the constriction can impede the flow of ions through the channel’s pore, a finding that is corroborated by mutational screening and single-channel recordings. Reduced channel conductance is the key mechanism underlying reported pathological KCNQ1 mutations at or near the constriction site.",

Notably, the temporal correlation of neural activity at rest, known as the intrinsic timescale, increases systematically along this hierarchy in both primates and rodents, analogous to the increasing scale and complexity of spatial receptive fields. However, how the timescales for task-related activity vary across brain regions and whether their hierarchical organization appears consistently across different mammalian species remain unexplored. Here, we show that both the intrinsic timescale and those of task-related activity follow a similar hierarchical gradient in the cortices of monkeys, rats, and mice. We also found that these timescales covary similarly in both the cortex and basal ganglia, whereas the timescales of thalamic activity are shorter than cortical timescales and do not conform to the hierarchical order predicted by their cortical projections. These results suggest that the hierarchical gradient of cortical timescales might represent a universal feature of intracortical circuits in the mammalian brain.",

          "abstract": "During tissue regeneration, lineage-related cells can switch their fate to replace missing cells. This cell plasticity is particularly prominent in more regenerative vertebrates such as zebrafish, yet the molecular basis by which cells transdifferentiate into another cell type upon injury remains unclear. Here, we investigate the epigenetic basis of regenerative transdifferentiation in the inner ear, where supporting cells (SCs) generate mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) upon damage. By comparing the chromatin landscapes in regenerative zebrafish and green anole lizards versus nonregenerative mice, we identified a class of enhancers that function in progenitors to generate HCs and then are selectively maintained in SCs of regenerative vertebrates to regenerate HCs. In particular, we uncovered a syntenic class of long-range enhancers for Atoh1 , a master transcription factor for HC differentiation. In the absence of injury, these enhancers maintain accessibility in SCs through adulthood but are prevented from driving zebrafish atoh1a expression through Notch repression. Deletion of these enhancers not only impaired atoh1a expression and HC formation during development but also blocked the ability of SCs to transdifferentiate into HCs during regeneration. Moreover, defects were specific to the inner ear versus the lateral line, revealing distinct mechanisms of regeneration in these mechanosensory organs. These findings reveal a class of regenerative enhancer that maintains competency of inner ear SCs to upregulate atoh1a and transdifferentiate into HCs upon damage.

          "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is often associated with excessive inflammatory response and highly dysregulated gut microbiota. Traditional treatments utilize drugs to manage inflammation, potentially with probiotic therapy as an adjuvant. However, current standard practices often suffer from detrimental side effects, low bioavailability, and unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes. Microbial complexes characterized by mutually beneficial symbiosis hold great promise for IBD therapy. Here, we aggregated Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Sp) with Bacillus subtilis (BS) by biomimetic mineralization to form cyanobacteria–probiotics symbionts (ASp@BS), which reshaped a healthy immune system and gut microbiota in a murine model of acute colitis. The symbionts exhibited excellent tolerance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, probiotics within the symbionts created a local anaerobic environment to activate the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme of cyanobacteria, facilitating the production of hydrogen gas (H 2 ) to persistently scavenge elevated reactive oxygen species and alleviate inflammatory factors. The resulting reduced inflammation improves the viability of the probiotics to efficiently regulate the gut microbiota and reshape the intestinal barrier functions. Our research elucidates that ASp@BS leverages the synergistic interaction between Sp and BS to create a therapeutic platform that addresses multiple aspects of IBD, offering a promising and comprehensive solution for IBD treatment.",

          "abstract": "Phase transitions are ubiquitous across life, yet hard to quantify and describe accurately. In this work, we develop an approach for characterizing generic attributes of phase transitions from very limited observations made deep within different phases’ domains of stability. Our approach is called thermodynamic maps (TM), which combines statistical mechanics and molecular simulations with score-based generative models. TM enable learning the temperature dependence of arbitrary thermodynamic observables across a wide range of temperatures. We show its usefulness by calculating phase transition attributes such as melting temperature, temperature-dependent heat capacities, and critical exponents. For instance, we demonstrate the ability of TM to infer the ferromagnetic phase transition of the Ising model, including temperature-dependent heat capacity and critical exponents, despite never having seen samples from the transition region. In addition, we efficiently characterize the temperature-dependent conformational ensemble and compute melting curves of the two RNA systems: a GCAA tetraloop and the HIV-TAR RNA, which are notoriously hard to sample due to glassy-like energy landscapes.",

          "abstract": "In view of changing climatic conditions and disappearing natural resources such as fertile soil and water, exploring alternatives to today’s industrial monocrop farming becomes essential. One promising farming practice is intercropping (IC), in which two or more crop species are grown together. Many experiments have shown that, under certain circumstances, IC can decrease soil erosion and fertilizer use, improve soil health and land management, while preserving crop production levels. However, there have been no quantitative approaches to predict, design, and control appropriate IC implementation for given particular environmental and farming conditions, and to assess its robustness. Here, we develop such an approach, based on methods and concepts developed in data science and systems biology. Our dataset groups the results of 2258 IC experiments, involving 274 pairs of 69 different plants. The data include 4 soil characteristics and 5 environmental and farming conditions, together with 8 traits for each of the two intercropped plants. We performed a dimensional reduction of the resulting 25-dimensional variable space and showed that, from a few quantities, one can predict IC yield relative to sole cultivation with good accuracy. For given environmental conditions, our computational approach can help to choose a companion plant and appropriate farming practices. It also indicates how to estimate the robustness of IC to external perturbations. This approach, together with its results, can be viewed as an initial step toward “systems agriculture,” which would ultimately develop systems of multiple plant grown together in appropriately designed and controlled settings.",

          "abstract": "The possible presence of brines on Mars adds an intriguing dimension to the exploration of Martian environments. Their potential involvement in the formation of recurring slope lineae has sparked debates on the existence of liquid water versus alternative dry processes. In situ instrumentation on rovers and landers has been instrumental in providing valuable data for comprehending the dynamics of brines. Laboratory experiments and thermodynamic simulations conducted under Martian conditions offer insights into the formation and persistence of brines, shedding light on the planet’s current hydrological processes. Despite these findings, the prevailing surface conditions on Mars, characterized by a combination of low temperature, pressure, and water vapor pressure, generally hinder the stability of most brines. In such environments, only a few select salts, notably calcium perchlorate, could play a pivotal role in potentially forming brines through deliquescence or melting. These environmental factors emerge as critical contributors influencing the stability of brines, but such limitations generally restrict the locations, timescales, and amounts of brine formed. However, the exploration of brines extends beyond geochemical considerations, serving as a lens through which we can examine potential habitability and gain a broader understanding of the Martian climate. Therefore, observing brines on Mars would offer valuable insights into the dynamic interplay of various factors that influence their stability, contributing to our overall comprehension of Mars’ unique environmental conditions.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic nuclear genomes often encode distinct sets of translation machinery for function in the cytosol vs. organelles (mitochondria and plastids). This raises questions about why multiple translation systems are maintained even though they are capable of comparable functions and whether they evolve differently depending on the compartment where they operate. These questions are particularly interesting in plants because translation machinery, including aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (aaRS), is often dual-targeted to the plastids and mitochondria. These organelles have different functions, with much higher rates of translation in plastids to supply the abundant, rapid-turnover proteins required for photosynthesis. Previous studies have indicated that plant organellar aaRS evolve more slowly compared to mitochondrial aaRS in eukaryotes that lack plastids. Thus, we investigated the evolution of nuclear-encoded organellar and cytosolic aaRS and tRNA maturation enzymes across a broad sampling of angiosperms, including nonphotosynthetic (heterotrophic) plant species with reduced plastid gene expression, to test the hypothesis that translational demands associated with photosynthesis constrain the evolution of enzymes involved in organellar tRNA metabolism. Remarkably, heterotrophic plants exhibited wholesale loss of many organelle-targeted aaRS and other enzymes, even though translation still occurs in their mitochondria and plastids. These losses were often accompanied by apparent retargeting of cytosolic enzymes and tRNAs to the organelles, sometimes preserving aaRS–tRNA charging relationships but other times creating surprising mismatches between cytosolic aaRS and mitochondrial tRNA substrates. Our findings indicate that the presence of a photosynthetic plastid drives the retention of specialized systems for organellar tRNA metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that tumor cells exhibit extreme plasticity in migration modes in order to adapt to microenvironments. However, the underlying mechanism for governing the migration mode switching is still unclear. Here, we revealed that epithelial tumor cells could develop a stable directional mode driven by hyperactivated ERK activity. This highly activated and dynamically changing ERK activity, called pERK transition, is crucial for inducing the switch from pauses state to directional movement and is also necessary for maintaining epithelial tumor cells in the directional mode. PERK transition integrated pERK surf, the dynamic and localized ERK activity at the leading edge. The sequential activation of RhoA and Rac1 by pERK transition played critical roles in generation of pERK surf activity through a movement feedback mechanism. PERK transition activity converted the orderly collective migration into the disordered dispersal movement, enhanced the invasiveness of epithelial tumor cells, and promoted their metastasis in immune-deficient mice. These findings revealed that the exquisite spatiotemporal organization of ERK activity orchestrates migration and invasion of tumor cells and provide evidence for the mechanism underlying migration mode switching in epithelial tumor cells.",

          "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus forms multicellular communities known as biofilms in which cells are held together by an extracellular matrix principally composed of repurposed cytoplasmic proteins and extracellular DNA. These biofilms assemble during infections or under laboratory conditions by growth on medium containing glucose, but the intracellular signal for biofilm formation and its downstream targets were unknown. Here, we present evidence that biofilm formation is triggered by a drop in the levels of the second messenger cyclic-di-AMP. Previous work identified genes needed for the release of extracellular DNA, including genes for the cyclic-di-AMP phosphodiesterase GdpP, the transcriptional regulator XdrA, and the purine salvage enzyme Apt. Using a cyclic-di-AMP riboswitch biosensor and mass spectrometry, we show that the second messenger drops in abundance during biofilm formation in a glucose-dependent manner. Mutation of these three genes elevates cyclic-di-AMP and prevents biofilm formation in a murine catheter model. Supporting the generality of this mechanism, we found that gdpP was required for biofilm formation by diverse strains of S. aureus . We additionally show that the downstream consequence of the drop in cyclic-di-AMP is inhibition of the “accessory gene regulator” operon agr , which is known to suppress biofilm formation through phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator AgrA by the histidine kinase AgrC. Consistent with this, an agr mutation bypasses the block in biofilm formation and eDNA release caused by a gdpP mutation. Finally, we report the unexpected observation that GdpP inhibits phosphotransfer from AgrC to AgrA, revealing a direct connection between the phosphodiesterase and agr .",

The abundance and physical state of water has evolved through time, from the surface having an early warmer and wetter environment to the present-day colder and drier one. Although multiple lines of evidence support this change, attempts to determine the abundance of water on the planet, the history of water at the surface, and the sequestration into both permanent and exchangeable sinks have yielded a wide range of results. I explore the uncertainties in the processes and interpretation, to understand our ability to quantitatively determine the water inventory and its changes through time. Results indicate that the present state of models and of the data constraining them preclude determining a unique history for water. This uncertainty does not affect the conclusion that significant amounts of water have been lost to space and to other sinks and that these losses are consistent with the changes in climate and surface environment.",

          "abstract": "The origin of water in the Earth-Moon system is a pivotal question in planetary science, particularly with the need for water resources in the race to establish lunar bases. The candidate origins of lunar water are an indigenous lunar component, solar wind water production, and the delivery of meteoritic and cometary material. Characterizing the oxygen isotopic composition of water provides information on lunar oxygen sources. The scarcity of lunar water required the development of a high-precision analytical technique for small samples. This method employs stepwise heating, fluorination, and oxygen isotopic measurements using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The three heating steps were selected based on other extraterrestrial material studies to release loosely bound water that may have been terrestrially contaminated (50 °C), loosely bound water (150 °C), and tightly bound water (as OH) (1,000 °C). This method was applied to a suite of 9 Apollo samples (basalts, breccias, and a regolith), along with terrestrial and meteoritic controls. We present here measurements of the triple oxygen isotopic composition of this water. Our data predominantly show high Δ′ 17 O values (≥ 0‰) for lunar water. These values are consistent with enstatite, ordinary, and CI chondrite-like signatures, although coupling Δ′ 17 O with δ 18 O forms mixing trends that dominantly overlap enstatite signatures. The other end of the mixing line is in the positive Δ′ 17 O space with cometary δ 18 O values, providing constraints for cometary Δ′ 17 O between 0.75 to 1.75‰.",

          "abstract": "Emotion and cognition involve an intricate crosstalk of neural and endocrine systems that support dynamic reallocation of neural resources and optimal adaptation for upcoming challenges, an active process analogous to allostasis. As a hallmark of human endocrine activity, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) is recognized to play a critical role in proactively modulating emotional and executive functions. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of such proactive effects remain elusive. By leveraging pharmacological neuroimaging and hidden Markov modeling of brain state dynamics, we show that the CAR proactively modulates rapid spatiotemporal reconfigurations (state) of large-scale brain networks involved in emotional and executive functions. Behaviorally, suppression of CAR proactively impaired performance of emotional discrimination but not working memory (WM), while individuals with higher CAR exhibited better performance for both emotional and WM tasks. Neuronally, suppression of CAR led to a decrease in fractional occupancy and mean lifetime of task-related brain states dominant to emotional and WM processing. Further information-theoretic analyses on sequence complexity of state transitions revealed that a suppressed or lower CAR led to higher transition complexity among states primarily anchored in visual-sensory and salience networks during emotional task. Conversely, an opposite pattern of transition complexity was observed among states anchored in executive control and visuospatial networks during WM, indicating that CAR distinctly modulates neural resources allocated to emotional and WM processing. Our findings establish a causal link of CAR with brain network dynamics across emotional and executive functions, suggesting a neuroendocrine account for CAR proactive effects on human emotion and cognition.",

Modern Wallaceans exhibit a longitudinal countergradient of Papuan- and Asian-related ancestries widely considered as evidence for mixing between local populations and Austronesian seafarers, though converging multidisciplinary evidence suggests that the Papuan-related component instead comes primarily from back-migrations from New Guinea. Here, we reconstruct Wallacean population genetic history using more than 250 newly reported genomes from 12 Wallacean and three West Papuan populations and confirm that the vast majority of Papuan-related ancestry in Wallacea (~75 to 100%) comes from prehistoric migrations originating in New Guinea and only a minor fraction is attributable to the founding AMH settlers. Mixing between Papuan and local Wallacean lineages appears to have been confined to the western and central parts of the archipelago and likely occurred contemporaneously with the widespread introduction of genes from Austronesian seafarers—which now comprise between ~40 and 85% of modern Wallacean ancestry—though dating historical admixture events remains challenging due to mixing continuing into the Historical Period. In conjunction with archaeological and linguistic records, our findings point to a dynamic Wallacean population history that was profoundly reshaped by the spread of Papuan genes, languages, and culture in the past 3,500 y.",

Breakdown of the BRB leads to the development of retinal diseases. Here, we show that Netrin-1/Unc5b and Norrin/Lrp5 signaling establish a zonated endothelial cell gene expression program that controls BRB integrity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of postnatal BRB-competent mouse retina endothelial cells (ECs), we identify &gt;100 BRB genes encoding Wnt signaling components, tight junction proteins, and ion and nutrient transporters. We find that BRB gene expression is zonated across arteries, capillaries, and veins and regulated by opposing gradients of the Netrin-1 receptor Unc5b and Lrp5-β-catenin signaling between retinal arterioles and venules. Mice deficient for Ntn1 or Unc5b display more BRB leakage at the arterial end of the vasculature, while Lrp5 loss of function causes predominantly venular BRB leakage. ScRNA-seq of Ntn1 and Unc5b mutant ECs reveals down-regulated β-catenin signaling and BRB gene expression that is rescued by Ctnnb1 overactivation, along with BRB integrity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Netrin-1 and Norrin additively enhance β-catenin transcriptional activity and Lrp5 phosphorylation via the Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) scaffolding protein, and endothelial Lrp5-Unc5b function converges in protection of capillary BRB integrity. These findings explain how arteriovenous zonation is established and maintained in the BRB and reveal that BRB gene expression is regulated at the level of endothelial subtypes.",

          "abstract": "Immune surveillance depends in part on the recognition of peptide variants by T cell antigen receptors. Given that both normal B cells and malignant B cells accumulate mutations we chose a murine model of multiple myeloma to test conditions to induce cell-mediated immunity targeting malignant plasma cell (PC) clones but sparing of normal PCs. Revealing a previously unknown function for intracellular C3d, we found that C3d engaged T cell responses against malignant PC in the bone marrow of mice that had developed multiple myeloma spontaneously. Our results show that C3d internalized by cells augments immune surveillance by several mechanisms. In one, C3d induces a master transcription regulator, E2f1, to increase the expression of long noncoding (lnc) RNAs, to generate peptides for MHC-I presentation, and increase MHC-I expression. In another, C3d increases expression of RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins linked to processing of defective ribosomal products that arise from noncanonical translation and known to promote immunosurveillance. Cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to increased expression and presentation of mutant peptides given the extent of protein misfolding and accumulation of somatic mutations. Accordingly, although C3d can be internalized by any cell, C3d preferentially targets malignant clones by evoking specific T cell–mediated immunity and sparing most nontransformed polyclonal B cells and PC with lower mutation loads. Malignant PC deletion was blocked by cyclosporin or by CD8 depletion confirming that endogenous T cells mediated malignant clone clearance. Besides the potential for therapeutic application our results highlight how intracellular C3d modifies cellular metabolism to augment immune surveillance.",

Comparative studies have suggested that human brain evolution was accompanied by accelerated changes of gene expression (referred to as “regulatory evolution”), especially those leading to an increase of gene products involved in energy production and metabolism. However, the signals of accelerated regulatory evolution were not always consistent across studies. One confounding factor is the diversity of distinctive cell types in the human brain. Here, we leveraged single-cell human and nonhuman primate transcriptomic data to investigate regulatory evolution at cell-type resolution. We relied on six well-established major cell types: excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We found pervasive signatures of accelerated regulatory evolution in the human brains compared to the chimpanzee brains in the major six cell types, as well as across multiple neuronal subtypes. Moreover, regulatory evolution is highly cell type specific rather than shared between cell types and strongly associated with cellular-level epigenomic features. Evolutionarily differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibit greater cell-type specificity than other genes, suggesting their role in the functional specialization of individual cell types in the human brain. As we continue to unfold the cellular complexity of the brain, the actual scope of DEGs in the human brain appears to be much broader than previously estimated. Our study supports the acceleration of cell-type-specific functional programs as an important feature of human brain evolution.",

          "abstract": "Coral populations are being progressively thinned by climate change, which elevates the risk of reproductive failure from Allee effects during fertilization. Studies have shown that fertilization success improves during more intense and synchronized spawning, but the local dependence of fertilization on coral density remains unknown in wild populations. Here, we measure the fertilization success of individual colonies of the common table coral, Acropora hyacinthus in Palau, Micronesia. We find strong evidence of spatial Allee effects such that fertilization averaged 30% when colonies were in close proximity (&lt;0.5 m), but this declined rapidly to less than 10% at a separation of 10 m and virtually zero by 15 to 20 m. The distance of a nearest neighbor conspecific, gravid colony is a better predictor of observing Allee effects than local colony density measured at several alternative scales (2 to 10 m). Spawning synchrony increases when corals are in close proximity, which may reinforce Allee effects as reproductive colonies become further separated. Fertilization success declined nearly threefold on a second night of spawning with higher wind despite there being more intensive spawning of colonies, highlighting the potential importance of prevailing weather in driving the outcome of mass spawning events. Overall, we find that the local population of A. hyacinthus achieved 71% of its fertilization potential. Further studies of spatial patchiness in coral populations are needed to generalize the likelihood of Allee effects, how climate change impacts reproductive function on reefs, and opportunities for restoration to safeguard reproductive success by reconnecting depleted coral populations.",

          "abstract": "Fever confers significant survival benefits on endotherms by optimizing both innate and adaptive immunity. Ectotherms achieve thermoregulation using behavioral strategies, but existing evidence supports its enhancement effect on innate immunity only. Therefore, it remains unknown whether the coordination between fever and adaptive immunity was independently acquired by endotherms or instead represents a gradually evolved function common to vertebrates. In the present study, we reported that Nile tilapia developed behavioral fever to enhance the immune response against Edwardsiella piscicida infection. Behavioral fever lasted five days, and the immune potential was optimized at 4 to 6 d post infection, indicating a potential correlation between fever events and T cell immunity. Further investigation suggested that fever did not affect T cell activation or proliferation but improved the ability of T cells to produce IFN-γ and Granzyme B and enhanced cytotoxicity, thereby eliminating the infection more effectively. Notably, we identified an advantage conferred by fever during infection: alleviation of T cell apoptosis to maintain a considerable T cell pool. Mechanistically, fever induced the expression of HSP70, which in turn entered the nucleus and bound to and promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby inhibiting the cleavage of caspase-8/caspase-3 and preventing T cell apoptosis. Our findings elucidate the detailed mechanism by which behavioral fever optimizes T cell immunity in a cold-blooded vertebrate and propose that integrating fever with adaptive immunity to gain survival advantages is an ancient strategy acquired before the emergence of tetrapod.",

          "abstract": "Camouflage is often considered a daytime phenomenon based on light and shade. Nocturnal camouflage can also occur, but its mechanistic basis remains unclear. Here, we analyze the conditions for background matching (BM) of avian predators against the night sky. Such concealment is achieved when the contrast between the predator and the sky is smaller than the contrast detection threshold of prey. This condition cannot be fulfilled under isotropic skies, as in fully overcast or moonless nights. However, on clear moonlit nights, the isotropy of the sky radiance is broken due to the presence of the Moon, and the conditions for BM can be met for a wide range of sky directions. This effect is mainly dependent on the altitude of the Moon above the horizon, rather than on Moon phase. We have modeled the feasibility of concealment through BM of a typically white barn owl ( Tyto alba ) when hunting rodents, based on its contrast against the moonlit sky. We considered the radiometric quantities of the sky, the ground, and the bird’s undersides. Our results show that a barn owl with highly reflecting underparts may approach a rodent from broad regions of the moonlit sky while keeping itself below the contrast detection threshold of the mouse M-cones and rods. S-cones, in turn, remain below their excitation threshold for most of the lunar cycle. Our results demonstrate that the white color of barn owls serves as camouflage tailored to the moonlit sky background, providing a mechanistic basis for understanding nocturnal camouflage.",

          "abstract": "More than 16,000 chemicals are incorporated into plastics to impart properties such as color, flexibility, and durability. These chemicals may leach from plastics, resulting in widespread human exposure during everyday use. Two plastic-associated chemicals—bisphenol A (BPA) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)—and a class of chemicals—brominated flame retardants [polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)]—are credibly linked to adverse health and cognitive impacts. BPA exposures are associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, DEHP exposure with increased all-cause mortality among persons 55 to 64 y old, and prenatal PBDE exposures in mothers with IQ losses in their children. We estimate BPA, DEHP, and PBDE exposures in 38 countries containing one-third of the world’s population. We find that in 2015, 5.4 million cases of IHD and 346,000 cases of stroke were associated with BPA exposure; that DEHP exposures were linked to approximately 164,000 deaths among 55-to-64 y olds; and that 11.7 million IQ points were lost due to maternal PBDE exposure. We estimate the costs of these health impacts to be $1.5 trillion 2015 purchasing power parity dollars. If exposures to BPA and DEHP in the United States had been at 2015 levels since 2003, 515,000 fewer deaths would have been attributed to BPA and DEHP between 2003 and 2015. If PBDE levels in mothers had been at 2015 levels since 2005, over 42 million IQ points would have been saved between 2005 and 2015.",

          "abstract": "Cytokines constitute a family of proteins that modulate the immune system and are secreted by many cells. CXCL12, along with its receptor CXCR4, are essential players in numerous processes. Dysregulation of their function underlie the mechanism(s) of several pathologies, including malignancies. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected effect of the cytokine and its receptor: In both cells and animal models, CXCL12 restricts tumorigenicity of the human glioblastoma cells U87-MG and U-118, and of a cell line derived from PyMT mouse breast cancer. Overexpression of CXCL12 inhibits activation of the oncogene Ras which results in downregulation of its proliferative signals, such as reduced phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), inhibition of c-Myc expression, and subsequent inhibition of cell cycle. Furthermore, CXCL12 induces downregulation of the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 (IGFBP6), and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3), which are implicated in sending metastases. Indeed, monitoring cell migration in vitro and generation of metastases in mice demonstrate that CXCL12 slows the migration of U87-MG and PyMT cells. Remarkably, overexpression of CXCL12 also downregulates the cell surface immune checkpoint protein programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), resulting in recruitment of cytotoxic CD8 T cells into xenografts accompanied by their shrinkage. Overall, CXCL12 inhibits tumor growth through several distinct mechanisms: inhibition of cell cycle and migration, as well as impairment of immune checkpoint, thereby stimulating a strong host’s immune response. The mechanism(s) that renders CXCL12 a tumor-promoting factor in certain cells and a suppressor in others has remained elusive.",

          "abstract": "Pannexin 1 (Panx1) constitutes a large pore channel responsible for the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from apoptotic cells. Strong evidence indicates that caspase-mediated cleavage of the C-terminus promotes the opening of the Panx1 channel by unplugging the pore. However, this simple pore-plugging mechanism alone cannot account for the observation that a Panx1 construct ending before the caspase cleavage site remains closed. Here, we show that a helical region located immediately before the caspase cleavage site, referred to as the “C-terminal activating domain (CAD)”, plays a pivotal role in facilitating Panx1 activation. Electrophysiology and mutagenesis studies uncovered that two conserved leucine residues within the CAD play a pivotal role. Cryoelectron microscopy (Cryo-EM) analysis of the construct ending before reaching the CAD demonstrated that the N terminus extends into an intracellular pocket. In contrast, the construct including the CAD revealed that this domain occupies the intracellular pocket, causing the N terminus to flip upward within the pore. Analysis of electrostatic free energy landscape in the closed conformation indicated that the intracellular side of the ion permeation pore may be occupied by anions like ATP, creating an electrostatic barrier for anions attempting to permeate the pore. When the N terminus flips up, it diminishes the positively charged surface, thereby reducing the drive to accumulate anions inside the pore. This dynamic change in the electrostatic landscape likely contributes to the selection of permeant ions. Collectively, these experiments put forth a mechanism in which C-terminal cleavage liberates the CAD, causing the repositioning of the N terminus to promote Panx1 channel opening.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapies have emerged as an effective treatment option for immune-related diseases, such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. However, variations in patient responsiveness limit the broad applicability and success of these immunotherapies. Noninvasive whole-body imaging of the immune status of individual patients during immunotherapy could enable the prediction and monitoring of the patient’s response, resulting in more personalized treatments. In this study, we developed a nanobody-based immunotracer targeting CD163, a receptor specifically expressed on macrophages. This anti-CD163 immunotracer bound to human and mouse CD163 with high affinity and specificity without competing for ligand binding. Furthermore, the tracer showed no unwanted immune cell activation and was nonimmunogenic. Upon radiolabeling of the anti-CD163 immunotracer, specific imaging of CD163 + macrophages using micro-single-photon emission computerized tomography/computed tomography or micro-positron emission tomography/CT was performed. The anti-CD163 immunotracer was able to stratify immunotherapy responders from nonresponders (NR) by visualizing differences in the intratumoral CD163 + TAM distribution in Lewis lung carcinoma-ovalbumin tumor-bearing mice receiving an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/CSF1R combination treatment. Immunotherapy-responding mice showed a more homogeneous distribution of the PET signal in the middle of the tumor, while CD163 + TAMs were located at the tumor periphery in NR. As such, visualization of CD163 + TAM distribution in the tumor microenvironment could allow a prediction or follow-up of therapy response. Altogether, this study describes an immunotracer, specific for CD163 + macrophages, that allows same-day imaging and follow-up of these immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, providing a good basis for the prediction and follow-up of immunotherapy responses in cancer patients.",

In the central nervous system, this is observed through a predominantly innate immune response in retinal vascular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity. Here, we set out to elucidate the dynamics of the immune response during progression and regression of pathological neovascularization in retinopathy. In a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, we report that dexamethasone, a broad-spectrum corticosteroid, suppresses initial formation of pathological preretinal neovascularization in early stages of disease, yet blunts reparative inflammation by impairing distinct myeloid cell populations, and hence reduces beneficial vascular remodeling in later stages of disease. Using genetic depletion of distinct components of the innate immune response, we demonstrate that CX3C chemokine receptor 1-expressing microglia contribute to angiogenesis. Conversely, myeloid cells expressing lysozyme 2 are recruited to sites of damaged blood vessels and pathological neovascularization where they partake in a reparative process that ultimately restores circulatory homeostasis to the retina. Hence, the Janus-faced properties of anti-inflammatory drugs should be considered, particularly in stages associated with persistent neovascularization.",

Despite its importance, the multiphase photochemistry of BBOA after light absorption remains poorly understood due to challenges in determining the oxidant concentrations and the reaction kinetics within aerosol particles. In this study, we explored the photochemical reactivity of BBOA particles in multiphase S(IV) oxidation to sulfate. We found that sulfate formation in BBOA particles under light is predominantly driven by photosensitization involving the triplet excited states ( 3 BBOA * ) instead of iron, nitrate, and S(IV) photochemistry. Rates in BBOA particles are three orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the bulk solution, primarily due to the fast interfacial reactions. Our results highlight that the chemistry of 3 BBOA * in particles can greatly contribute to the formation of sulfate, as an example of the secondary pollutants. Photosensitization of BBOA will likely become increasingly crucial due to the intensified global wildfires.",

We conducted precise measurements of oxygen isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rocks. The absence of an isotopic difference between the Moon and Earth on the sub-ppm level, as well as the absence of isotope heterogeneity in Earth’s upper mantle and the Moon, is discussed in relation to published Moon formation scenarios and the collisional erosion of Theia’s silicate mantles prior to colliding with proto-Earth. The data provide valuable insights into the origin of volatiles in the Earth and Moon as they suggest that the water on the Earth may not have been delivered by the late veneer.

While several prey traits potentially impact resistance to predation, their effects in a multispecies context remain unclear. Here, we leverage synthetic bacterial communities of varying complexity to identify traits driving palatability for nematodes, a main consumer of bacteria in soil. We assessed trophic interactions between four nematode species and 122 bacterial isolates, across a gradient of prey biodiversity ranging from single species to 50 species. Nematode size, a proxy for prey palatability, varied strongly with prey community composition and could be predicted by metabolic and morphological properties of the prey. However, the influence of prey traits on predators depended on biodiversity. Secondary metabolites drove palatability in monoculture, but this effect vanished under increasing prey biodiversity, where prey size became the dominant predictors of nematode size. Although idiosyncratic properties are often emphasized in the literatures, our results suggest that in biodiverse assemblages, the composition of available prey and their traits are more reliable predictors of predator–prey interactions. This study offers valuable insights into microbial ecology in the context of predator–prey interactions, as cryptic microbial responses can be guided by deductions based on generalizable biological traits.",

Notably, Setdb1 -deficient HSPCs exhibit reduced quiescence and increased proliferation, accompanied by the acquisition of a lineage-biased transcriptional program. In Setdb1 -deficient HSPCs, we identify genomic regions that are characterized by loss of H3K9me3 and increased chromatin accessibility, suggesting enhanced transcription factor (TF) activity. Interestingly, hematopoietic TFs like PU.1 bind these cryptic enhancers in wild-type HSPCs, despite the H3K9me3 status.

This process depends on an extracellular glycoprotein complex called the Aggregation Factor (AF), which is composed of proteins thought to be unique to sponges. We used quantitative proteomics to identify additional AF components and interacting proteins in the classical model, Clathria prolifera , and compared them to proteins involved in cell interactions in Bilateria. Our results confirm MAFp3/p4 proteins as the primary components of the AF but implicate related proteins with calx-beta and wreath domains as additional components. Using AlphaFold, we unveiled close structural similarities of AF components to protein domains in other animals, previously masked by the mutational decay of sequence similarity. The wreath domain, believed to be unique to the AF, was predicted to contain a central beta-sandwich of the same organization as the vWFD domain (also found in extracellular, gel-forming glycoproteins in other animals). Additionally, many copurified proteins share a conserved C-terminus, containing divergent immunoglobulin (Ig) and Fn3 domains predicted to serve as an AF–interaction interface. One of these proteins, MAF-associated protein 1, resembles Ig superfamily cell adhesion molecules and we hypothesize that it may function to link the AF to the surface of cells. Our results highlight the existence of an ancient toolkit of conserved protein domains regulating cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix protein interactions in all animals, and likely reflect a common origin of cell adhesion and allorecognition.",

          "abstract": "Microorganisms in marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) drive globally impactful biogeochemical processes. One such process is multistep denitrification (NO 3 – →NO 2 – →NO→N 2 O→N 2 ), which dominates OMZ bioavailable nitrogen (N) loss and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production. Denitrification-derived N loss is typically measured and modeled as a single step, but observations reveal that most denitrifiers in OMZs contain subsets (“modules”) of the complete pathway. Here, we identify the ecological mechanisms sustaining diverse denitrifiers, explain the prevalence of certain modules, and examine the implications for N loss. We describe microbial functional types carrying out diverse denitrification modules by their underlying redox chemistry, constraining their traits with thermodynamics and pathway length penalties, in an idealized OMZ ecosystem model. Biomass yields of single-step modules increase along the denitrification pathway when organic matter (OM) limits growth, which explains the viability of populations respiring NO 2 – and N 2 O in a NO 3 – -filled ocean. Results predict denitrifier community succession along environmental gradients: Pathway length increases as the limiting substrate shifts from OM to N, suggesting a niche for the short NO 3 – →NO 2 – module in free-living, OM-limited communities, and for the complete pathway in organic particle-associated communities, consistent with observations. The model captures and mechanistically explains the observed dominance and higher oxygen tolerance of the NO 3 – →NO 2 – module. Results also capture observations that NO 3 – is the dominant source of N 2 O. Our framework advances the mechanistic understanding of the relationship between microbial ecology and N loss in the ocean and can be extended to other processes and environments.",

          "abstract": "Decades after being replaced with digital platforms, analogue computing has experienced a surging interest following developments in metamaterials and intricate fabrication techniques. Specifically, wave-based analogue computers which impart spatial transformations on an incident wavefront, commensurate with a desired mathematical operation, have gained traction owing to their ability to directly encode the input in its unprocessed form, bypassing analogue-to-digital conversion. While promising, these systems are inherently limited to single-task configurations. Their inability to concurrently perform multiple tasks, or compute in parallel, represents a major hindrance to advancing conceptual mechanical devices with broader computational capabilities. In here, we present a pathway to simultaneously process independent computational tasks within the same architected structure. By breaking time invariance in a set of metasurface building blocks, multiple frequency-shifted beams are self-generated which absorb notable energy amounts from the fundamental signal. The onset of these tunable harmonics enables distinct computational tasks to be assigned to different independent “channels,” effectively allowing an analogue mechanical computer to multitask.",

We demonstrate that phosphorylation by GSK3β, but not by several other kinases, promotes the aggregation of full-length tau as well as enhances phase separation into gel-like condensate structures.

          "abstract": "For human infants, producing recognizable speech is more than a cognitive process. It is a motor skill that requires infants to learn to coordinate multiple muscles of varying functions across their body. This coordination is directly linked to ongoing fluctuations in heart rate; a physiological process that can scaffold behavior. We investigated whether ongoing fluctuations in heart rate coincide with vocal production and word formation in 24-mo-old infants. Infants were most likely to produce a vocalization when heart rate fluctuations reached a peak (local maximum) or trough (local minimum). Vocalizations produced at the peak were longer than expected by chance. Functionally, vocalizations produced just before the trough, while heart rate is decelerating, were more likely to be recognized as a word by naive listeners. Thus, for the developing infant, heart rate fluctuations align with the timing of vocal productions and are associated with their duration and the likelihood of producing recognizable speech. Our results have broad and immediate implications for understanding normative language development, the evolutionary basis and physiological process of vocal production, and potential early indicators of speech and communication disorders.",

For fully marine animals however, theory predicts the most cost-efficient depth-use pattern for migrating, air-breathing species that do not feed in transit is to travel at around 2 to 3 times the depth of their body diameter, to minimize the vertical distance traveled while avoiding wave drag close to the surface. This has rarely been examined, however, due to depth measurement resolution issues at the surface. Here, we present evidence for the use of this strategy in the wild to the nearest centimeter and document the switch to shallow swimming during naturally occurring long-distance migrations. Using high-resolution depth-accelerometry and video data for little penguins ( Eudyptula minor ) and loggerhead turtles ( Caretta caretta ), satellite-relayed data for green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ), and literature data for further sea turtle, penguin, and whale species, we show that near-surface swimming is likely used broadly across nonforaging diving animals to minimize the cost of transport.",

Here, we report a technique to measure TFs’ binding sites on the human genome with a near single-base resolution by footprinting with deaminase (FOODIE) on a single-molecule and single-cell basis. Single-molecule sequencing reads after enzymatic deamination allow detection of the TF binding fraction on a particular footprint and the binding cooperativity of any two adjacent TFs, which can be either positive or negative. As a newcomer of single-cell genomics, single-cell FOODIE enables the detection of cell-type-specific TF footprints in a pure cell population in a heterogeneous tissue, such as the brain. We found that genes carrying out a certain biological function together in a housing-keeping correlated gene module (CGM) or a tissues-specific CGM are coordinated by shared TFs in the gene’s promoters and enhancers, respectively. Scalable and cost-effective, FOODIE allows us to create an open FOODIE database for cell lines, with applicability to human tissues and clinical samples.",

Frameshift-inducing INDELs can introduce a premature termination codon and, in other instances, can lead to the appearance of new proteins. Here, we found that mutations in the rice jasmonate (JA) signaling gene OsJAZ10 by CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing did not affect canonical JA signaling. However, a type of mutant with an INDEL that yielded a novel frameshift protein named FJ10 ( F rameshift mutation of J AZ 10 ), exhibited enhanced rice growth and increased resistance to brown planthopper attacks. Overexpression of FJ10 in wild-type plants phenocopies OsJAZ10 frameshift mutants. Further characterization revealed that FJ10 interacts with Slender Rice 1 (OsSLR1) and F-box/Kelch 16 (OsFBK16). These interactions disrupt the function of OsSLR1 in suppressing gibberellin-mediated growth and the function of OsFBK16 in repressing lignin-mediated defense responses, respectively. Field experiments with FJ10 -expressing plants demonstrate that this protein uncouples the growth–defense tradeoff, opening broad avenues to obtain cultivars with enhanced yield without compromised defenses.",

          "abstract": "The issue of antibiotic resistance is a critical concern for public health, prompting numerous investigations into the impact of treatment strategies on preventing or slowing down the emergence of resistance. While existing studies have predominantly focused on chromosomal resistance mutations, the consequences of often clinically more relevant plasmid-conferred resistance remain insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conducted three extensive in vitro experiments utilizing a liquid-handling platform. These experiments evaluated the efficacy of five distinct treatment strategies using two antibiotics (tetracycline and ceftazidime) along with two horizontally transmissible clinical resistance plasmids conferring the respective resistances. Among the experimentally investigated treatment strategies, combination therapy proved to be the most effective in preventing the emergence of double resistance while minimizing the number of infections. To verify the reliability of these findings, we constructed a computational model of our experiments that we parameterized using the experimental data. We employed this model to augment the experimental data by conducting an in silico parameter sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis corroborated our experimental results, demonstrating that combination therapy consistently outperformed other treatment strategies across a range of parameter values.",

          "abstract": "Proteins become asymmetrically distributed in the one-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo thanks to reaction–diffusion mechanisms that are often entangled in complex feedback loops. Cortical polarity drives the enrichment of the RNA-binding proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6 in the anterior cytoplasm through concentration gradients. MEX-5 and MEX-6 promote the patterning of other cytoplasmic factors, including that of the anteriorly enriched mitotic polo-like kinase PLK-1, but also contribute to proper cortical polarity. The gradient of MEX-5 forms through a differential-diffusion mechanism. How MEX-6 establishes a gradient and how MEX-5 and MEX-6 regulate cortical polarity is not known. Here, we reveal that the two MEX proteins develop concentration asymmetries via similar mechanisms, but despite their strong sequence homology, they differ in terms of how their concentration gradients are regulated. We find that PLK-1 promotes the enrichment of MEX-5 and MEX-6 at the anterior through different circuits: PLK-1 influences the MEX-5 gradient indirectly by regulating cortical polarity while it modulates the formation of the gradient of MEX-6 through its physical interaction with the protein. We thus propose a model in which PLK-1 mediates protein circuitries between MEX-5, MEX-6, and cortical proteins to faithfully establish and maintain polarity.",

          "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster , successful development relies on the precise coordination of both spatial and temporal regulatory axes. The temporal axis governs stage-specific identity and developmental transitions through a number of genes, collectively forming the Metamorphic Gene Network . Among these, Ecdysone inducible protein 93F (E93) serves as the critical determinant for adult specification, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found that, rather than acting mainly as an instructive signal, E93 promotes adult differentiation through the repression of the pupal specifier broad ( br ). In the absence of E93, sustained high levels of Br during the pupal stage strongly represses pupal-specific enhancers that are essential for the terminal differentiation of the wing. Notably, RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the majority of E93-dependent transcriptomic changes in pupal wings are primarily driven by br repression. In addition, we also show that Br represses the pupal-enhancers during the larval and prepupal stages preventing the premature implementation of the adult genetic program, and that it also dampens the activity of larval enhancers during the latter stages of larval development. This mechanism of action seems to be a derived feature acquired in Diptera, as in the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum , repression of br by E93 is not sufficient to allow adult differentiation. In summary, our study elucidates the crucial role of the intricate interplay between E93 and Br as the governing mechanism in the process of terminal differentiation in Drosophila . This finding holds significant implications for advancing our understanding of the evolution of insect metamorphosis.",

While terpene synthases derived from isoprenyl diphosphate synthase have been shown to catalyze terpenoid biosynthesis in some insects, canonical terpene synthases (TPS) commonly found in plants, fungi, and bacteria were previously unidentified in insects. This study reveals the presence of TPS genes in insects, likely originating via horizontal gene transfer from noninsect arthropods. By examining 361 insect genomes, we identified TPS genes in five species of the Sciaridae family (fungus gnats). Additionally, TPS genes were found in Collembola (springtails) and Acariformes (mites) among diverse noninsect arthropods. Selected TPS enzymes from Sciaridae, Collembola, and Acariformes display monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and/or diterpene synthase activities. Through comprehensive protein database search and phylogenetic analysis, the TPS genes in Sciaridae were found to be most closely related to those in Acariformes, suggesting transfer of TPS genes from Acariformes to Sciaridae. In the model Sciaridae Bradysia coprophila , all five TPS genes are most highly expressed in adult males, suggesting a sex- and developmental stage-specific role of their terpenoid products. The finding of TPS genes in insects and their possible evolutionary origin through intraphylum gene transfer within arthropods sheds light on metabolic innovation in insects.",

We investigated titin’s function during contraction using small-angle X-ray diffraction to track structural changes before and after 50% titin cleavage and in the RFE-deficient, mdm titin mutant. We report that the RFE state is structurally distinct from pure isometric contractions, with increased thick filament strain and decreased lattice spacing, most likely caused by elevated titin-based forces. Furthermore, no RFE structural state was detected in mdm muscle. We posit that decreased lattice spacing, increased thick filament stiffness, and increased non-cross-bridge forces are the major contributors to RFE.

Volatiles in these reservoirs may consist of a variety of species whose stable isotope characteristics could elucidate both their sources and the processes instrumental in their formation. For example, the δD of potential contributors to the deposits can be used to identify a uniquely light solar wind component. Because of the exceptionally low temperatures of these volatile deposits, examining and interpreting their stable isotope systems to fulfill Artemis science goals through sampling, preserving, curating, and analyzing these samples are far more difficult than for other sample return missions.

Nature-based solutions provided by enhancing functions of coinciding species or ecosystems offer an opportunity to increase yields by reducing disease outbreaks while conserving biodiversity. Seagrass ecosystems can reduce the abundance of marine bacterial pathogens, although it remains unknown whether this service can extend to reducing disease risk in a marine resource. Using a meta-analysis of articles published over the past 40 y, we find that 17 known diseases of seaweeds are attributed to bacteria that have been previously shown to be lower when associated with seagrass ecosystems. Next, we surveyed over 8,000 individual seaweeds among farms in Indonesia and found that disease risk is reduced by 75% when seaweeds are co-cultivated directly within seagrass ecosystems, compared to when seagrass ecosystems were removed. Finally, we estimate that farming seaweed with seagrass ecosystems could increase annual revenue by $292,470 – $1,015,990 USD per km 2 from yield loss due to disease reduction and that ~20.7 million km 2 in 107 countries and 34 territories have suitable environmental conditions for farming seaweeds with seagrass ecosystems.

          "abstract": "Drugs that eliminate senescent cells, senolytics, can be powerful when combined with prosenescence cancer therapies. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen, we identify here SLC25A23 as a vulnerability of senescent cancer cells. Suppressing SLC25A23 disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis, impairs oxidative phosphorylation, and interferes with redox signaling, leading to death of senescent cells. These effects can be replicated by salinomycin, a cation ionophore antibiotic. Salinomycin prompts a pyroptosis-apoptosis-necroptosis (PAN)optosis-like cell death in senescent cells, including apoptosis and two forms of immunogenic cell death: necroptosis and pyroptosis. Notably, we observed that salinomycin treatment or SLC25A23 suppression elevates reactive oxygen species, upregulating death receptor 5 via Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway activation. We show that a combination of a death receptor 5 (DR5) agonistic antibody and salinomycin is a robust senolytic cocktail. We provide evidence that this drug combination provokes a potent natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cell–mediated immune destruction of senescent cancer cells, mediated by the pyroptotic cytokine interleukin 18 (IL18).",

However, current IDO inhibitors face significant challenges which limit their clinical application. Here, we genetically engineered a high tryptophan-expressing Clostridium butyricum (L-Trp CB) strain that can colonize tumors strictly following systemic administration. We revealed that butyrate produced by L-Trp CB can inhibit IDO activity, preventing tryptophan catabolism and kynurenine accumulation in tumors. In addition, the large released tryptophan by L-Trp CB can provide discrete signals that support CD8+ T cell activation and energy metabolism within the tumor microenvironment. We observed that L-Trp CB significantly restored the proportion and function of CD8+ T cells, leading to significantly delayed tumor growth in both mouse and rabbit multiple tumor models with limited side effects. We here provide a synthetic biology treatment strategy for enhanced tumor immunotherapy by inhibiting IDO activity and reprogramming CD8+ T cell response in tumors.",

          "abstract": "Detecting viral infection is a key role of the innate immune system. The genomes of some RNA viruses have a high CpG dinucleotide content relative to most vertebrate cell RNAs, making CpGs a molecular marker of infection. The human zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) recognizes CpG, mediates clearance of the foreign CpG-rich RNA, and causes attenuation of CpG-rich RNA viruses. While ZAP binds RNA, it lacks enzymatic activity that might be responsible for RNA degradation and thus requires interacting cofactors for its function. One of these cofactors, KHNYN, has a predicted nuclease domain. Using biochemical approaches, we found that the KHNYN NYN domain is a single-stranded RNA ribonuclease that does not have sequence specificity and digests RNA with or without CpG dinucleotides equivalently in vitro. We show that unlike most KH domains, the KHNYN KH domain does not bind RNA. Indeed, a crystal structure of the KH region revealed a double-KH domain with a negatively charged surface that accounts for the lack of RNA binding. Rather, the KHNYN C-terminal domain (CTD) interacts with the ZAP RNA-binding domain (RBD) to provide target RNA specificity. We define a minimal complex composed of the ZAP RBD and the KHNYN NYN-CTD and use a fluorescence polarization assay to propose a model for how this complex interacts with a CpG dinucleotide-containing RNA. In the context of the cell, this module would represent the minimum ZAP and KHNYN domains required for CpG-recognition and ribonuclease activity essential for attenuation of viruses with clusters of CpG dinucleotides.",

          "abstract": "Resource availability dictates how fast and how much microbial populations grow. Quantifying the relationship between microbial growth and resource concentrations makes it possible to promote, inhibit, and predict microbial activity. Microbes require many resources, including macronutrients (e.g., carbon and nitrogen), micronutrients (e.g., metals), and complex nutrients like vitamins and amino acids. When multiple resources are scarce, as frequently occurs in nature, microbes may experience resource colimitation in which more than one resource simultaneously limits growth. Despite growing evidence for colimitation, the data are difficult to interpret and compare due to a lack of quantitative measures of colimitation and systematic tests of resource conditions. We hypothesize that microbes experience a continuum of nutrient limitation states and that nutrient colimitation is common in the laboratory and in nature. To address this, we develop a quantitative theory of resource colimitation that captures the range of possible limitation states and describes how they can change dynamically with resource conditions. We apply this approach to clonal populations of Escherichia coli to show that colimitation occurs in common laboratory conditions. We also show that growth rate and growth yield are colimited differently, reflecting the different underlying biology of these traits. Finally, we analyze environmental data to provide intuition for the continuum of limitation and colimitation conditions in nature. Altogether our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding and quantifying colimitation of microbes in biogeochemical, biotechnology, and human health contexts.",

Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) than for skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), in line with fisheries science simulation models.",

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.",

We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies &gt;10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability.

These changes result in a significant upstream shift in streamflow experienced by about 29% of the global land surface. We found the most changes in the smallest steams in our study: increases in erosion potential (approximately 5% increase in stream power), flood frequency (approximately 42% increase in 100-year floods), and likely nutrient dynamics (altered seasonal flow regimes).

As a result, the total signal processing delay is dominated by the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay from the interconnects rather than the delay from the transistors’ switching speed. This bottleneck has spurred efforts both in academia and industry to explore alternative materials and disruptive device structures.

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages are the most abundant and phylogenetically diverse biological entities on Earth, yet the ecological mechanisms that sustain this extraordinary diversity remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that phage diversity consistently outstripped the diversity of their bacterial hosts under simple experimental conditions. We assembled and passaged dozens of diverse phage communities on a single, nonevolving strain of Escherichia coli until the phage communities reached equilibrium. In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species. Our experiments reveal that a rich community ecology of bacteriophages can emerge on a single bacterial host.",

We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5 + epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra + mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes.",

We generated a catalog of Neanderthal ancestry segments in more than 300 genomes spanning the past 50,000 years. We examined how Neanderthal ancestry is shared among individuals over time. Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of Neanderthal gene flow is attributable to a single, shared extended period of gene flow that occurred between 50,500 to 43,500 years ago, as evidenced by ancestry correlation, colocalization of Neanderthal segments across individuals, and divergence from the sequenced Neanderthals. Most natural selection—positive and negative—on Neanderthal variants occurred rapidly after the gene flow.

          "abstract": "Combined therapies in cancer treatment aim to enhance antitumor activity. However, delivering multiple small molecules imposes challenges, as different drugs have distinct pharmacokinetic profiles and tumor penetration abilities, affecting their therapeutic efficacy. To circumvent this, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)–polyethylene glycol (PEG)–based nanoparticles were developed as a platform for the codelivery of synergistic drug ratios, improving therapeutic efficacy by increasing the percentage of injected dose reaching the tumor. Nonetheless, extravasation-dependent tumor accumulation is susceptible to variations in tumor vasculature; therefore, PLGA-PEG was modified with sulfates to actively target P-selectin–expressing cancers. Here, we show the potential of our platform in unique three-dimensional (3D) in vitro and in vivo models. The P-selectin–targeted nanoparticles showed enhanced accumulation in 3D spheroids and tissues of P-selectin–expressing BRAF-mutated melanomas and BRCA-mutated breast cancers, resulting in superior in vivo efficacy and safety. This nanoplatform could advance the codelivery of a plethora of anticancer drug combinations to various P-selectin–expressing tumors.",

We pass air through the catalyst, which condenses microdroplets from atmospheric water vapor and uses nitrogen from the air, resulting in ammonia concentrations ranging from 25 to 120 μM in 1 hour, depending on local relative humidity. Operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, this technique eliminates the need for additional electricity or radiation, thereby substantially reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. In laboratory experiments, we further optimized the reaction conditions and scaled up the process. After 2 hours of spraying, the ammonia concentration increased to 270.2 ± 25.1 μM. In addition, we present a portable device designed for onsite ammonia production which consistently produces an ammonia concentration that is adequate for some agricultural irrigation purposes.",

CSLDs are important for tip growth and cytokinesis, but it was unknown whether they form membrane complexes in vivo or produce microfibrillar cellulose. We produced viable CESA-deficient mutants of the moss Physcomitrium patens to investigate CSLD function without interfering CESA activity. Microscopy and spectroscopy showed that CESA-deficient mutants synthesize cellulose microfibrils that are indistinguishable from those in vascular plants. Correspondingly, freeze-fracture electron microscopy revealed rosette-shaped particle assemblies in the plasma membrane that are indistinguishable from CESA-containing rosette cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs). Our data show that proteins other than CESAs, most likely CSLDs, produce cellulose microfibrils in P. patens protonemal filaments. The data suggest that the specialized roles of CSLDs in cytokinesis and tip growth are based on differential expression and different interactions with microtubules and possibly Ca 2+ , rather than structural differences in the microfibrils they produce.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotes carry three types of structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes, condensin, cohesin, and SMC5/6, which are ATP-dependent motor proteins that remodel the genome via DNA loop extrusion (LE). SMCs modulate DNA supercoiling but remains incompletely understood how this is achieved. Using a single-molecule magnetic tweezers assay that directly measures how much twist is induced by individual SMCs in each LE step, we demonstrate that all three SMC complexes induce the same large negative twist (i.e., linking number change Δ L k of ~−0.6 at each LE step) into the extruded loop, independent of step size and DNA tension. Using ATP hydrolysis mutants and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, we find that ATP binding is the twist-inducing event during the ATPase cycle, coinciding with the force-generating LE step. The fact that all three eukaryotic SMC proteins induce the same amount of twist indicates a common DNA-LE mechanism among these SMC complexes.",

          "abstract": "Geologic hydrogen could be a low-carbon primary energy resource; however, the magnitude of Earth’s subsurface endowment has not yet been assessed. Knowledge of the occurrence and behavior of natural hydrogen on Earth has been combined with information from geologic analogs to construct a mass balance model to predict the resource potential. Given the associated uncertainty, stochastic model results predict a wide range of values for the potential in-place hydrogen resource [10 3 to 10 10 million metric tons (Mt)] with the most probable value of ~5.6 × 10 6 Mt. Although most of this hydrogen is likely to be impractical to recover, a small fraction (e.g., 1 × 10 5 Mt) would supply the projected hydrogen needed to reach net-zero carbon emissions for ~200 years. This amount of hydrogen contains more energy (~1.4 × 10 16 MJ) than all proven natural gas reserves on Earth (~8.4 × 10 15 MJ). Study results demonstrate that further research into understanding the potential for geologic hydrogen resources is merited.",

          "abstract": "Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) are extremely prevalent in human cancers, although most of these remain clinically unactionable. The programmable RNA nuclease CRISPR-Cas13 has been deployed to specifically target oncogenic RNAs. However, silencing oncogenic SNVs with single-base precision remains extremely challenging due to the intrinsic mismatch tolerance of Cas13. Here, we show that introducing synthetic mismatches at precise positions of the spacer sequence enables de novo design of guide RNAs [CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs)] with strong preferential silencing of point-mutated transcripts. We applied these design principles to effectively silence the oncogenic KRAS G12 hotspot, NRAS G12D and BRAF V600E transcripts with minimal off-target silencing of the wild-type transcripts, underscoring the adaptability of this platform to silence various SNVs. Unexpectedly, the SNV-selective crRNAs harboring mismatched nucleotides reduce the promiscuous collateral activity of the Rfx Cas13d ortholog. These findings demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas13 system can be reprogrammed to target mutant transcripts with single-base precision, showcasing the tremendous potential of this tool in personalized transcriptome editing.",

We demonstrate that transcriptional activation of Pde6b can rescue the loss of Pde6a , with preservation of retinal structure, restoration of electroretinography responses, and improvement of visual function as assessed by optokinetic response and looming-induced escape behaviors. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a dCasMINI-mediated activation strategy that provides a mutation-independent treatment for retinal degeneration.

The realization of top-performing radiation detectors typically relies on careful crystal selection from broad candidate groups, as residual strain remains unavoidable during the SC growth process, which often leads to the formation of ferroelastic domains with varied orientations. Here, we introduce an in-line tempering strategy to alleviate microstrain and homogenize the domain orientation across methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite SCs. The progressive strain relief during the phase transition in situ, demonstrated by the removal of ferroelastic domain walls, substantially enhances the crystallinity and the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbI 3 SCs. As a result, the gamma-ray energy spectrum detector leveraging these strain-relaxed SCs achieves an energy resolution of 7.2% at 59.5 keV for a 241 Am gamma-ray source, and the 25-pixel device performs highly uniformly with concentrated current distribution, which paves the way for its implementation in high-resolution radiation spectroscopy.",

However, the mechanisms driving these processes remain elusive. In this study, we initially demonstrate that chronic alcohol consumption disrupts the burst-pause dynamics of CINs and impairs behavioral flexibility. We next aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which CIN dynamics control behavioral flexibility. We found that extinction learning enhances acetylcholine (ACh) release and that mimicking this enhancement through optogenetic induction of CIN burst firing accelerates the extinction process. In addition, we demonstrate that disrupting CIN pauses via continuous optogenetic stimulation reversibly impairs the updating of goal-directed behaviors. Overall, we demonstrate that CIN burst firing, which increases ACh release, promotes extinction learning, aiding the extinguishment of learned behaviors. Conversely, CIN firing pauses, which lead to ACh dips, are crucial for reversal learning, facilitating the adaptation of new actions. These findings shed light on how CIN dynamics regulate behavioral flexibility.",

Here, we used transgenic mice that globally express the Saccharomyces cerevisiae internal alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDI1) protein to determine whether the glucose-lowering effect of acute oral administration of metformin requires inhibition of mitochondrial complex I of the ETC in vivo. NDI1 is a yeast NADH dehydrogenase enzyme that complements the loss of mammalian mitochondrial complex I electron transport function and is insensitive to pharmacologic mitochondrial complex I inhibitors including metformin.

Our study reveals neural zinc finger (Nzf2) as a crucial orchestrator that controls the timing of OL differentiation both during development and myelin repair, contrasting with its previously suggested role in direct myelin gene regulation. Nzf2 ablation delays the onset of OL differentiation, while hyperactivation stimulates OL differentiation both during development and remyelination. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we pinpoint Nkx2.2 as a critical downstream target of Nzf2. Specific binding of Nzf2 in the Nkx2.2 gene locus inhibits histone deacetylation by disrupting the HDAC1 repressor complex and reducing deacetylase activity. Furthermore, Nzf2 overrides the inhibitory Notch signaling to initiate OL differentiation. Thus, we propose that the Notch-Nzf2-Nkx2.2 axis is a vital component of OL differentiation timing mechanism, suggesting Nzf2 as a potential therapeutic target for stimulating OL differentiation and boosting myelin repair in demyelinating diseases.",

We use the recently evolved gene HP6 / Umbrea as an example of the ECD process. By assaying genome-wide chromosomal conformations in multiple Drosophila species, we show that HP6/Umbrea was inserted near a preexisting, long-distance three-dimensional genomic interaction. We then use this data to identify a newly found enhancer ( FLEE1 ), buried within the coding region of the highly conserved, essential gene MFS18 , that likely neofunctionalized HP6/Umbrea .

Our experimental results demonstrate DNE’s superior performance over existing techniques across various critical network analyses, including PPI inference and the identification of protein functional modules.

A class of models implementing linear dynamics driven by external inputs accurately captured PFC responses within contexts and revealed equally performing mechanisms. One model implemented context-dependent recurrent dynamics and relied on transient input amplification; the other relied on subtle contextual modulations of the inputs, providing constraints on the attentional effects in sensory areas required to explain flexible PFC responses and behavior. Both models revealed properties of inputs and recurrent dynamics that were not apparent from qualitative descriptions of PFC responses.

In contrast to previous interpretations of multiple extensive early glaciations, our data suggest that grounded ice extended across the central North Sea only once, from western Norway, during the Early Pleistocene. This ice sheet advance, which probably occurred ~1.1 million years ago, deposited an up to 120-meter-thick layer of till across &gt;10,000 square kilometers of the central basin. During the rest of the Early Pleistocene, elliptical pockmarks and elongate contour-current furrows show that the central basin was instead scoured by along-slope currents.

Despite being classified together due to their short, noncontractile tails, there is a huge amount of diversity among members of this group. Of the podophages, the N4-like Schitoviridae family is the least well studied structurally and is quite divergent from well-characterized podophages such as T7 and P22. In this work, we isolate and fully characterize two members of the Schitoviridae family by cryo–electron microscopy, genetics, and biochemistry. We describe the capsid features of Moo19 and B2, including a decoration protein. In addition, we have fully modeled the tail machinery for both phages and identify proteins with esterase activity. Genetic knockouts of the host reveal factors specific for host attachment including key modifications to the O-antigen on the lipopolysaccharide. Moo19 and B2 are both Schitoviridae members, yet some distinct differences in the genome and structure place them into distinct clades.",

          "abstract": "For millennia, alloying has been the greatest gift from metallurgy to humankind: a process of mixing elements, propelling our society from the Bronze Age to the Space Age. Dealloying, by contrast, acts like a penalty: a corrosive counteracting process of selectively removing elements from alloys or compounds, degrading their structural integrity over time. We show that when these two opposite metallurgical processes meet in a reactive vapor environment, profound sustainable alloy design opportunities become accessible, enabling bulk nanostructured porous alloys directly from oxides, with zero carbon footprint. We introduce thermodynamically well-grounded treasure maps that turn the intuitive opposition between alloying and dealloying into harmony, facilitating a quantitative approach to navigate synthesis in such an immense design space. We demonstrate this alloy design paradigm by synthesizing nanostructured Fe-Ni-N porous martensitic alloys fully from oxides in a single solid-state process step and substantiating the critical kinetic processes responsible for the desired microstructure.",

Microbial diversity is similar in marine and terrestrial microbiomes at local to global scales. However, community composition greatly differs between sea and land, corroborating a phylogenetic divide that mirrors patterns in plant and animal diversity. In contrast, community composition overlaps between surface to subsurface environments supporting a diversity continuum rather than a discrete subsurface biosphere. Differences in microbial life thus seem greater between land and sea than between surface and subsurface. Diversity of terrestrial microbiomes decreases with depth, while marine subsurface diversity and phylogenetic distance to cultured isolates rivals or exceeds that of surface environments.

During treadmill validation, AI-based assistance reduced metabolic cost by 6.5% compared to 3.5% for conventional assistance. We expanded testing the controller in real-world walking, where AI-based assistance showed effective modulation and higher user preference compared to conventional assistance. Leveraging the AI-based approach and a comprehensive dataset, the controller achieved superior performance in environment- and user-state estimations. This approach does not require a separate mode classifier and operates on a user-independent basis, enabling immediate deployment across diverse conditions.

The subtype GlyRα3 expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons of the spinal dorsal horn is a key regulator of physiological pain perception. Disruption of spinal glycinergic inhibition is associated with chronic inflammatory pain states, making GlyRα3 an attractive target for pain treatment. GlyRα3 activity is modulated by numerous endogenous and exogenous ligands that consequently affect pain sensitization. To understand the mechanism of two such endogenous modulators, Zn 2+ and protons, we have used cryo–electron microscopy to determine structures of full-length human GlyRα3 in various functional states. Whereas acidic pH reduces peak glycine response, Zn 2+ displays biphasic modulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings reveal the effector sites and also capture intermediate conformations in the gating cycle. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology, this work provides important insights into GlyRα3 activation and regulation.",

Leveraging the ultralow cross-plane thermal conductivity and strong temperature-dependent excitonic resonances of 2D-MHPs, we demonstrate ambient-temperature, all-optical detection of MIR light with sensitivity down to 1 nanowatt per square micrometer, using plastic substrates. Through the adoption of membrane-based structures and a photonic enhancement strategy unique to our all-optical detection modality, we further improved the sensitivity to sub–10 picowatt-per-square-micrometer levels. The detection covers the mid-wave infrared regime from 2 to 4.5 micrometers and extends to the long-wave infrared wavelength at 10.6 micrometers, with wavelength-independent sensitivity response.

A peripheral membrane protein PssA can associate with the cellular membrane in its active state or exist in the cytosol in an inactive form. The membrane-bound enzyme acts on cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DG) to form cytidine monophosphate and a covalent intermediate, which is subsequently targeted by serine to produce phosphatidylserine. Here, we present two crystal structures of Escherichia coli PssA, one complexed with CDP-DG and the other without. The lipid-bound structure mimics the Michaelis complex before the formation of a covalent intermediate, revealing key determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis. Notably, membrane-free PssA is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with only the monomer capable of associating with the membrane, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for phospholipid biosynthesis dependent on the oligomerization state of the enzyme.",

Inspired by this, bioactive hydrogels (Hep@Gel) composed of collagen-derived gelatins and highly anionic heparin were constructed for scarless corneal repair. Hep@Gel resembled the barrier function of the EBM regarding surface-confined binding, long-time sequestration, and progressive degradation of IL-1, TGF-β, and PDGF-BB, which robustly inhibited the apoptosis and myofibroblast transition of keratocytes. Animal models of rabbits and nonhuman primates confirmed that Hep@Gel effectively limited the influx of inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines from the epithelium into the stroma to down-regulate the wound healing cascade, contributing to better vision quality with 73% reduced fibrosis. Hep@Gel offers a solution for preventing corneal injury–induced scarring and substituting for lamellar keratoplasty to remove scarring.",

To generate appropriate muscle activity, the cortical descending motor output must coordinate with spinal reflexes, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. We simultaneously recorded activities in motor-related cortical areas, afferent neurons, and forelimb muscles of monkeys performing reaching movements. Motor-related cortical areas, predominantly primary motor cortex (M1), encode subsequent afferent activities attributed to forelimb movement. M1 also encodes a subcomponent of muscle activity evoked by these afferent activities, corresponding to spinal reflexes. Furthermore, selective disruption of the afferent pathway specifically reduced this subcomponent of muscle activity, suggesting that M1 output drives muscle activity not only through direct descending pathways but also through the “transafferent” pathway composed of descending plus subsequent spinal reflex pathways. Thus, M1 provides optimal motor output based on an internal forward model that prospectively computes future spinal reflexes.",

We demonstrate on-off switching and continuous modulation of local polariton-soliton interactions, which results from marked modifications of topological and conventional soliton states through variation of local strain direction. Furthermore, we reveal the capability of these structures to spatially modify the near-field profile, phase, and propagation direction of polaritons in record-small footprints, enabling generation and electrical switching of directional polaritons.

Four recombinases and two attC sites form the synaptic complex. Yet, for unclear reasons, the recombination efficiency varies greatly. Here, we established an optical tweezers force spectroscopy assay to probe the synaptic complex stability and revealed, for seven combinations of attC sites, significant variability in the mechanical stability. We found a strong correlation between mechanical stability and recombination efficiency of attC sites in vivo, indicating a regulatory mechanism from the DNA structure to the macromolecular complex stability. Taking into account known forces during DNA metabolism, we propose that the variation of the integron in vivo recombination efficiency is mediated by the synaptic complex stability.

Strikingly, enhancer mobility becomes constrained on transcriptional firing, homogenizing its dynamics with the gene promoter, suggestive of their cotranscriptional sharing of a nuclear microenvironment.

We critically examine the sensory feedback’s fidelity and the cognitive demands of interfacing with these systems. We examine how artificial touch interfaces could be redesigned to better align with human sensory, motor, and cognitive systems, emphasizing the dynamic and context-dependent nature of sensory integration. We consider the various learning processes involved in adapting to artificial haptics, highlighting the need for interfaces that support both explicit and implicit learning mechanisms. We emphasize the need for technologies that are not only physiologically biomimetic but also behaviorally and cognitively congruent with the user, affording a range of alternative solutions to users’ needs.",

Here, using first-principles calculations on thin films of the antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , we demonstrate how the generalized optical weight arising from the absorptive part of the optical conductivity can be used to probe the ground-state quantum geometry and topology. We show that three-septuple-layer MnBi 2 Te 4 film exhibit an enhanced, almost-perfect magnetic circular dichroism for a narrow photon energy window in the infrared region.

Despite studies on LaNiO 3 /LaFeO 3 superlattices and heterostructures, the direction and magnitude of the charge transfer remain debated, with some suggesting no charge transfer due to the high stability of Fe 3+ (3d 5 ). Here, we synthesized a series of epitaxial LaNiO 3 /LaFeO 3 superlattices and demonstrated partial (up to ~0.5 e − /interface unit cell) charge transfer from Fe to Ni near the interface, supported by density functional theory simulations and spectroscopic evidence of changes in Ni and Fe oxidation states. The electron transfer from LaFeO 3 to LaNiO 3 and the subsequent rearrangement of the Fe 3d band create an unexpected metallic ground state within the LaFeO 3 layer, strongly influencing the in-plane transport properties across the superlattice. Moreover, we establish a direct correlation between interfacial charge transfer and in-plane electrical transport properties, providing insights for designing functional oxide heterostructures with emerging properties.",

Rapid changes in cell strain by disruption of cytoskeletal and nuclear filaments sensitize nuclei to DOX, whereas chronic reduction of cell strain desensitize nuclei to DOX. Extracted nuclei from invasive cancer cells lines from different tissues have distinct nuclear permeability to DOX. Last, we show that mechano-priming of cells by paclitaxel markedly improves DOX nuclear internalization, rationalizing the observed drug synergies. Our findings reveal that nuclear uptake is a critical, previously unquantified aspect of drug resistance.

Here, we use the organic paleothermometer MBT′ 5me and the carbon-isotope composition of two K–Pg-spanning lignites from the western Unites States, to test models of volcanogenic air temperature change in the ~100 kyr before the mass extinction. Our records show long-term warming of ~3°C, probably driven by Deccan CO 2 emissions, and reveal a transient (&lt;10 kyr) ~5°C cooling event, coinciding with the peak of the Poladpur “pulse” of Deccan eruption ~30 kyr before the K–Pg boundary. This cooling was likely caused by the aerosolization of volcanogenic sulfur.

Individual dyslexia-disposing genetic variants showed distinct patterns of association with brain structure. Independent component analysis revealed various brain networks that each had their own genomic profiles related to dyslexia susceptibility. Circuits involved in motor coordination, vision, and language were implicated. Polygenic scores for eight traits genetically correlated with dyslexia, including cognitive, behavioral, and reading-related psychometric measures, showed partial similarities to dyslexia in terms of brain-wide associations. Notably, microstructure of the internal capsule was consistently implicated across all of these genetic dispositions, while lower volume of the motor cortex was more specifically associated with dyslexia genetic disposition alone. These findings reveal genetic and neurobiological features that may contribute to dyslexia and its associations with other traits at the population level.",

In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a subwavelength 2D nanocavity using two atomically thin mirrors with degenerate resonances. Angle-resolved measurements show a flat band, which sets this system apart from conventional photonic cavities. We demonstrate how the excitonic nature of the mirrors enables the formation of chiral and tunable optical modes upon the application of an external magnetic field. Moreover, we show the electrical tunability of the confined mode.

Though more compact than known structures, M. hungatei ’s S-layer is a flexible hexagonal lattice of dome-shaped tiles, uniformly spaced from both the overlying cell sheath and the underlying cell membrane. Subtomogram averaging resolved the S-layer hexamer tile at 6.4-angstrom resolution. By fitting an AlphaFold model into hexamer tiles in flat and curved conformations, we uncover intra- and intertile interactions that contribute to the S-layer’s cylindrical and flexible architecture, along with a spacer extension for cell membrane attachment.

Our model captures a full spectrum of trophic modes, in which the optimal investments reflect zero-waste solutions (i.e., growth is colimited by carbon and nitrogen) and accurately reproduces experimental results. By fitting the model to data for Ochromonas , we were able to predict metabolic strategies at a global scale.

Unsupervised clustering of immunometabolic relationships in people with DS revealed subgroups with different frequencies of co-occurring conditions.

Substituting in the pandemic PB1 genes reduced polymerase activity, virulence, and altered lung pathology, while the native LPAI PB1 showed the highest pathogenicity and polymerase activity. The native LPAI PB1 virus caused severe pneumonia and high early viral RNA levels, correlating with elevated host cytokine signaling. Increased genetic distance from the LPAI PB1 sequence correlated with reduced polymerase activity, IFN-β expression, viral replication, and pathogenicity.",

          "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) splits water in oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth. The structure and function of the C 4 S 4 M 2 -type PSII-LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) megacomplexes from the wild-type and PsbR-deletion mutant plants are studied through electron microscopy (EM), structural mass spectrometry, and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy [time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)]. The cryo-EM structure of a type I C 4 S 4 M 2 megacomplex demonstrates that the three domains of PsbR bind to the stromal side of D1, D2, and CP43; associate with the single transmembrane helix of the redox active Cyt b 559 ; and stabilize the luminal extrinsic PsbP, respectively. This megacomplex, with PsbR and PsbY centered around the narrow interface between two dimeric PSII cores, provides the supramolecular structural basis that regulates the plastoquinone occupancy in Q B site, excitation energy transfer, and oxygen evolution. PSII-LHCII megacomplexes (types I and II) and LHC aggregation levels in Arabidopsis psbR mutant were also interrogated and compared to wild-type plants through EM and picosecond TRF.",

          "authors": "Kyle Hanniman, Olivier Jacques, J Scott Matthews, Christopher Abbott, Elizabeth Goodyear-Grant",
          "abstract": "Developments over the past decade have made it increasingly difficult for central banks to achieve their macroeconomic objectives without the help of fiscal policy, resulting in some surprisingly public efforts from central banks to influence the size and direction of government budget balances. But do voters find central bank appeals persuasive and what are the reputational consequences of engaging the public on this sensitive issue, particularly in the event of partisan counterattacks? We examine these issues with two parallel survey experiments conducted in Canada and the USA. The results suggest central bank endorsements modestly increased support for expansionary fiscal policies. They also suggest the right’s attack on the central bank may have backfired—ultimately improving rather than undermining the bank’s reputation among non-conservatives. This research has implications for theoretical work in political psychology and public economics and for on-going empirical debates about voters’ attitudes toward austerity.",

          "authors": "Dzifa Ametowobla, Stefan Kirchner",
          "abstract": "This article challenges the idea of platform capitalism, that digital platforms implement a uniform model based on a self-employed labor force. Expanding on empirical evidence of a diversity of platform models, we theorize expectations about platform diversity from competition and comparative capitalism research. Using a unique cross-national dataset of leading food delivery platforms in 32 countries across North America and Europe, we compare platform models and competitive relations across national institutional regimes. Our analyses uncover a considerable diversity of platform models across Europe, in contrast to a clear uniformity in North America. We also find that the use of self-employment varies across and within large multinational corporations and is most prevalent in countries of the lightly regulated regime type. Our results call for an economic sociology perspective on the platform economy that integrates a general concept of platforms but allows for diversity stemming from competition and different national regimes.",
