          "authors": "Antonio Falasconi, Harsh Kanodia, Silvia Arber",
          "abstract": "The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits 1–8 . Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres 9,10 . However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry 11–22 . Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level. Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements. Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets. Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry. We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability 1 . Host–fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined 2–4 . However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals 5 . Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions 6–8 , but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.",

          "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a globally important seed oil, fibre and drug-producing plant species. However, a century of prohibition has severely restricted development of breeding and germplasm resources, leaving potential hemp-based nutritional and fibre applications unrealized. Here we present a cannabis pangenome, constructed with 181 new and 12 previously released genomes from a total of 144 biological samples including both male (XY) and female (XX) plants. We identified widespread regions of the cannabis pangenome that are surprisingly diverse for a single species, with high levels of genetic and structural variation, and propose a novel population structure and hybridization history. Across the ancient heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes, we observed a variable boundary at the sex-determining and pseudoautosomal regions as well as genes that exhibit male-biased expression, including genes encoding several key flowering regulators. Conversely, the cannabinoid synthase genes, which are responsible for producing cannabidiol acid and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, contained very low levels of diversity, despite being embedded within a variable region with multiple pseudogenized paralogues, structural variation and distinct transposable element arrangements. Additionally, we identified variants of acyl-lipid thioesterase genes that were associated with fatty acid chain length variation and the production of the rare cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabivarin and cannabidivarin. We conclude that the C. sativa gene pool remains only partially characterized, the existence of wild relatives in Asia is likely and its potential as a crop species remains largely unrealized.",

In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states 3–5 and are believed to enable topological quantum computing 6,7 . One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here we observed emergent anyonic correlations in a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum gas, resulting from the phenomenon of spin–charge separation 8–10 . A mobile impurity provides the necessary spin degree of freedom to engineer anyonic correlations in the charge sector and simultaneously acts as a probe to reveal these correlations. Starting with bosons, we tune the statistical phase to transmute bosons through anyons to fermions and observe an asymmetric momentum distribution 11–14 , a hallmark of anyonic correlations. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we observed dynamical fermionization of the anyons 15 . This study opens the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting 15–17 .",

          "abstract": "Early or sorting endosomes are dynamic organelles that play key roles in proteome control by triaging plasma membrane proteins for either recycling or degradation in the lysosome 1,2 . These events are coordinated by numerous transiently associated regulatory complexes and integral membrane components that contribute to organelle identity during endosome maturation 3 . Although a subset of the several hundred protein components and cargoes known to associate with endosomes have been studied at the biochemical and/or structural level, interaction partners and higher-order molecular assemblies for many endosomal components remain unknown. Here, we combine crosslinking and native gel mass spectrometry 4–7 of purified early endosomes with AlphaFold 8,9 and computational analysis to create a systematic human endosomal structural interactome. We present 229 structural models for endosomal protein pairs and additional higher-order assemblies supported by experimental crosslinks from their native subcellular context, suggesting structural mechanisms for previously reported regulatory processes. Using induced neurons, we validate two candidate complexes whose interactions are supported by crosslinks and structural predictions: TMEM230 as a subunit of ATP8 and ATP11 lipid flippases 10 and TMEM9 and TMEM9B as subunits of the chloride–proton antiporters CLCN3, CLCN4 and CLCN5 (ref. 11 ). This resource and its accompanying structural network viewer provide an experimental framework for understanding organellar structural interactomes and large-scale validation of structural predictions.",

          "abstract": "Economic, social and environmental infrastructure forms a fundamental pillar of societal development. Ensuring equitable access to infrastructure for all residents is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, yet knowledge gaps remain in infrastructure accessibility and inequality and their associations with human health. Here we generate gridded maps of economic, social and environmental infrastructure distribution and apply population-weighted exposure models and mixed-effects regressions to investigate differences in population access to infrastructure and their health implications across 166 countries. The results reveal contrasting inequalities in infrastructure access across regions and infrastructure types. Global South countries experience only 50–80% of the infrastructure access of Global North countries, whereas their associated inequality levels are 9–44% higher. Both infrastructure access and inequality are linked to health outcomes, with this relationship being especially pronounced in economic infrastructure. These findings underscore the necessity of informed decision-making to rectify infrastructure disparities for promoting human well-being.",

To reveal the behavioural principles of rule-following, we develop CRISP, an interdisciplinary framework that explains rule-conformity C as a function of intrinsic respect for rules R , extrinsic incentives I , social expectations S and social preferences P . We deploy CRISP in four series of online experiments with 14,034 English-speaking participants. In our baseline experiments, 55–70% of participants conform to an arbitrary costly rule, even though they act anonymously and alone, and violations hurt no one. We show that people expect rule-conformity and view it as socially appropriate. Rule-breaking is contagious but remains moderate. Pro-social motives and extrinsic incentives increase rule-conformity, but unconditional rule-following and social expectations explain most of it. Our results demonstrate that respect for rules and social expectations are basic elements of rule-conformity that can explain why people follow laws and social norms even without extrinsic incentives and social preferences.",

Understanding these differences, particularly at the age of first symptom onset, is critical for advancing early detection, uncovering aetiological mechanisms and improving interventions. Leveraging the Get SET Early programme, we analysed a cohort of 2,618 toddlers (mean age: ~27 months) through cross-sectional, longitudinal and clustering analyses, performed using statistical and machine learning approaches, to assess sex differences in groups with ASD, developmental delay and typical development across standardized and experimental measures, including eye tracking. The results revealed no significant sex differences in toddlers with ASD across 17 of 18 measures, including symptom severity based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, receptive and expressive language based on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and social attention based on the GeoPref eye-tracking test. In contrast, girls with typical development outperformed boys on several measures. Subtyping analyses stratifying toddlers into low, medium and high clusters similarly showed virtually no sex differences in ASD. Overall, our findings suggest that phenotypic sex differences are minimal or non-existent in those with ASD at the time of first symptom onset.",

          "abstract": "A major challenge for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) cure is the presence of viral latent reservoirs. The “Shock &amp; Kill” strategy involves the combined use of latency reversal agents (LRA) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) to reactivate HIV-1 latent reservoirs, followed by elimination of infected cells. However, current LRAs are insufficient in fully reactivating the latent reservoirs. Therefore, investigation on novel HIV-1 latency regulators will be crucial to the success of HIV-1 cure research. Here, we identify bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) as an HIV-1 latency regulator. BRD9 inhibition induces HIV-1 latency reactivation in T cell lines, human resting memory CD4 + T cells, and PBMCs derived from people living with HIV-1 (PWH) on ART. BRD9 inhibition, gene depletion, and protein degradation consistently reactivate HIV-1 latency. Moreover, BRD9 inhibition synergizes with BRD4 inhibition in inducing HIV-1 production. Mechanistically, BRD9 binds to HIV-1 LTR promoter and competes with HIV-1 Tat protein for binding to the HIV-1 genome. Additionally, our integrated CUT&amp;RUN DNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and pharmacological analysis revealed downstream host targets of BRD9, including ATAD2 and MTHFD2, that modulate HIV-1 latency.",

          "abstract": "During infection, foreign DNA is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) leading to the production of cGAMP, STING-dependent type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine expression, and autophagy. To prevent a response to self-DNA, cGAS activity is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of cGAS underpins interferonopathies, such as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, as well as Lupus and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease. Thus, cGAS and its product cGAMP are therapeutic targets. However, if cGAS functions independently of cGAMP signaling is undefined. Here, we identified an alternative signaling pathway that cGAS engages independent of cGAMP synthesis. We demonstrate that alternative cGAS signaling promotes hyperexpression of CXCL1 and enhanced neutrophil recruitment that facilitates viral dissemination during herpes simplex encephalitis. Our study reports of an alternative cGAS response independent of cGAMP, highlighting a previously uncharacterized scaffold function for cGAS.",

          "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) begins with the assembly of clathrin onto the plasma membrane. These structures grow and stabilize to form clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which invaginate and accumulate cargo. Finally, through membrane fission, CCPs detach to form clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Mechanisms governing the transition of CCPs from flat-to-curved structures have been a matter of debate. GAK and its chaperone protein, Hsc70, are well known to mediate clathrin release from CCVs, and several studies have observed a late burst of GAK recruitment as CCVs form. Other studies have proposed that early recruitment of GAK–Hsc70 could function to provide the necessary energy source to remodel nascent flat clathrin lattices, replacing hexagons with pentagons and enabling a gain of curvature and invagination of the growing CCP; however, direct functional evidence is lacking. Here, we show that GAK knockdown inhibits CCP stabilization and invagination. Furthermore, mutations in the J domain of GAK that abolish Hsc70 recruitment to and activation at CCPs lead to the accumulation of GAK at CCPs, hinder CCP stabilization and invagination, and result in a striking increase in the proportion of highly transient, abortive CCPs. These findings support the hypothesis that GAK–Hsc70 promotes the turnover and remodeling of nascent clathrin assemblies required for curvature development during CME.",

          "abstract": "We employ fine-scale population genetic analyses to reveal dynamics among interacting forces that act at synonymous sites and introns among closely related Drosophila species. Synonymous codon usage bias has proven to be well suited for population genetic inference. Under major codon preference (MCP), translationally superior “major” codons confer fitness benefits relative to their less efficiently and/or accurately decoded synonymous counterparts. Our codon family and lineage-specific analyses expand on previous findings in the Drosophila simulans lineage; patterns in naturally occurring polymorphism demonstrate fixation biases toward GC-ending codons that are consistent in direction, but heterogeneous in magnitude, among synonymous families. These forces are generally stronger than fixation biases in intron sequences. In contrast, population genetic analyses reveal unexpected evidence of codon preference reversals in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage. Codon family-specific polymorphism patterns support reduced efficacy of natural selection in most synonymous families but indicate reversals of favored states in the four codon families encoded by NAY. Accelerated synonymous fixations in favor of NAT and greater differences for both allele frequencies and fixation rates among X-linked, relative to autosomal, loci bolster support for fitness effect reversals. The specificity of preference reversals to codons whose cognate tRNAs undergo wobble position queuosine modification is intriguing. However, our analyses reveal prevalent dinucleotide preferences for ApT over ApC that act in opposition to GC-favoring forces in both coding and intron regions. We present evidence that changes in the relative efficacy of translational selection and dinucleotide preference underlie apparent codon preference reversals.",

          "abstract": "NMR-based metabolic biomarkers provide comprehensive insights into human metabolism; however, extracting biologically meaningful patterns from such high-dimensional data remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a manifold-fitting-based framework to analyze metabolic heterogeneity within the UK Biobank population, utilizing measurements of 251 NMR biomarkers from 212,853 participants. Initially, our method clusters these biomarkers into seven distinct metabolic categories that reflect the modular organization of human metabolism. Subsequent manifold fitting to each category unveils underlying low-dimensional structures, elucidating fundamental variations from basic energy metabolism to hormone-mediated regulation. Importantly, three of these manifolds clearly stratify the population, identifying subgroups with distinct metabolic profiles and associated disease risks. These subgroups exhibit consistent links with specific diseases, including severe metabolic dysregulation and its complications, as well as cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions, highlighting the intricate relationship between metabolic states and disease susceptibility. Supported by strong correlations with demographic factors, clinical measurements, and lifestyle variables, these findings validate the biological relevance of the identified manifolds. By utilizing a geometrically informed approach to dissect metabolic heterogeneity, our framework enhances the accuracy of population stratification and deepens our understanding of metabolic health, potentially guiding personalized interventions and preventive healthcare strategies.",

Their developmental synchronization is essential for structural and functional integration. The brain and skull shape coevolution is evident along the vertebrate phylogeny; however, the genetic basis underlying their close evolutionary and developmental relationship remains little explored. Here, we reveal the evolution and function of the MN1 gene that was previously found to be associated with significant shape variation in the mouse skull and the formation of cranial bones. We show that the vertebrate MN1 gene evolved from an ancestral deuterostome sequence. In vertebrates, the MN1 gene structure, synteny, and spatiotemporal expression pattern are remarkably conserved, indicating that the gene carries out a core function. Using a newly generated mouse knock-out model, we demonstrate in vivo that Mn1 integrated into an ancient molecular machinery and controls the expression of the Cyp26 genes in the developing hindbrain, thereby tuning the retinoic acid levels and patterning of the developing central nervous system. This study thus showcases the emergence of a novel gene function from an ancestral sequence and its role in generating a macroevolutionary innovation. The data expand our knowledge of brain and skull codevelopment and coevolution and highlight the role of this regulatory loop in craniofacial human syndromes.",

Specialized transposable elements (TEs), introners, are thought to be one of the major drivers of intron gain in diverse eukaryotes. However, the molecular mechanism(s) and evolutionary processes driving introner propagation within and between lineages remain elusive. Here, we analyze 8,716 genomes, revealing 1,093 introner families in 201 species spanning 1.7 billion years of evolution. Introners are derived from functionally diverse TEs including families of terminal-inverted-repeat DNA TEs, retrotransposons, cryptons, and helitrons as well as mobile elements with unknown molecular mechanisms. We identify eight cases where introners recently transferred between divergent host species and show that giant viruses that integrate into genomes may facilitate introner transfer across lineages. We propose that ongoing intron gain is primarily a consequence of TE activity in eukaryotes, thereby resolving a key mystery of genome structure evolution.",

In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and postreconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behavior independent of the small-scale regularizing dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.",

Yet, the efficacy of current state-of-the-art LNP formulations remains low, a few percent at best. A deeper understanding of how LNP cargo, lipid composition, stoichiometry, size, structure, and pH-induced conformational changes influence their efficiency is therefore necessary for improved design. Given the variability of these properties, preferred screening methods should offer single-particle-resolved multiparametric characterization. In this work, we employ combined surface-sensitive fluorescence and label-free scattering microscopy with single LNP resolution, which when integrated with microfluidics for liquid exchange between media of varying refractive index, enables quantification of LNP size, refractive index, and cargo content. We investigate two LNP formulations that, while similar in size and mRNA content, exhibit differences in functional mRNA delivery. Correlating size with the content of Cy5-labeled mRNA revealed that the cargo scaled with LNP volume for both types of LNPs, while the refractive index varied marginally across LNP size. While this multiparametric fingerprinting alone could not distinguish the two LNP formulations, we use the same experimental platform to show that their difference in fusogenicity to a supporting lipid bilayer under early endosomal conditions (drop in pH from 7.4 to 6.0) correlates with observed differences in in vitro cellular data. This highlights a limitation of the current state-of-the-art toolbox for in situ LNP characterization, which generally focuses on structural properties of suspended LNPs, which may not adequately capture functional performance.",

Nociceptors also express other sodium channels, notably Nav1.7, raising the question of how effectively excitability of the neurons is reduced by inhibition of Nav1.8 channels alone. We used VX-548 to explore this question, recording from dissociated human dorsal root ganglion neurons at 37 °C. Applying VX-548 at 10 nM (about 25 times the IC 50 determined using cloned human Nav1.8 channels at 37 °C) had only small effects on action potential threshold and upstroke velocity but substantially reduced the peak and shoulder. Counterintuitively, VX-548 shortened the refractory period—likely reflecting reduced potassium channel activation by the smaller, narrower action potential—sometimes resulting in faster firing. Generally, repetitive firing during depolarizations was diminished but not eliminated by VX-548. Voltage clamp analysis suggested two reasons that repetitive firing often remains in 10 to 100 nM VX-548. First, many neurons had such large Nav1.8 currents that even 99% inhibition leaves nA-level Nav1.8 current that could help drive repetitive firing. Second, Nav1.7 current dominated during initial spikes and could also contribute to repetitive firing. The ability of human neurons to fire repetitively even with &gt;99% inhibition of Nav1.8 channels may help explain the incomplete analgesia produced by even the largest concentrations of VX-548 in clinical studies.",

          "abstract": "Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) mediates early signaling events in immunity by coupling membrane receptors to immune responses. Syk comprises a tandem SH2 (tSH2) regulatory module—two SH2 domains connected by a structured linker—and a kinase domain. The association of tSH2 with a doubly tyrosine-phosphorylated motif (dpITAM) on membrane immunoreceptors is central to controlling Syk’s signaling activity. tSH2-dpITAM association is regulated by Y131-phosphorylation on linker A, distant from the Syk–immunoreceptor binding sites. A unique thermodynamic signature was reported to control this protein–protein interaction by phosphorylation, yet the molecular mechanism for the phosphorylation effect is unknown. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation affords the detail needed to fill this knowledge deficiency. Long MD simulations revealed a highly correlated interdomain electrostatic network (distance correlation coefficients &gt; 0.75) that is lost upon Y131-phosphorylation. Some of the strongly correlated interdomain pairs carry the same charge or are separated by distances greater than a salt-bridge pair. The strong interdomain connectivity accounts for the single, narrow free energy basin in the domain-structure conformational landscape for unphosphorylated tSH2. Linker phosphorylation disrupts this network and yields a broader free energy landscape with multiple networks formed by the same group of residues adopting alternative interdomain conformations. A salt dependence of NMR rotational tumbling times substantiates the electrostatic nature of tSH2 domain–domain coupling. Syk tandem SH2 is thus a sensor whose conformational plasticity is sensitive to Y131 phosphorylation. This phospho-sensing response provides the basis for an entropically driven regulatory mechanism that is so-far unique to Syk–immunoreceptor protein–protein association.",

          "abstract": "Greening immediately after etiolated-seedling’s emergence from the soil is critical for plants to initiate their autotrophic life cycle through photosynthesis. The greening process relies on a complex transcriptional network that fine-tunes the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and prevents premature development of chloroplasts. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis HOOKLESS1 (HLS1) as a key regulator of light-induced cotyledon greening. Our results demonstrated that HLS1 is essential for the proper expression of greening-related genes controlling chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development. Loss of HLS1 severely disrupts the Pchlide-to-Chlide transition and impairs reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in etiolated seedlings upon light exposure, leading to catastrophic ROS burst and even photobleaching. Biochemical assays revealed that HLS1 is a histone acetyltransferase mediating the deposition of H3K9ac and H3K27ac marks at multiple greening-related genes, thereby promoting their transcriptional activation. Genetic analysis further confirmed that HLS1’s promotive effect on the greening process is fully dependent on its histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, the loss of HLS1 also interrupts the promotive effect of ethylene signaling on the greening process by reducing the binding of ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 to the promoter region of POR genes, thus inhibiting the activation effect of ethylene signaling on the expression of PORs . Collectively, our study reveals that HLS1 acetylates histones to activate greening-related genes, optimizing chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development during dark-to-light transition in seedlings.",

Within the NLR family, NLRP12 was recently identified as a key regulator of PANoptosis, which is an innate immune, lytic cell death pathway initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes. While NLRP12 activation is critical for maintaining homeostasis, aberrant activation has been implicated in a broad range of disorders, including cancers and metabolic, infectious, autoinflammatory, and hemolytic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of NLRP12 activation remain poorly understood. Here, we identified hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) as a regulator of NLRP12-mediated PANoptosis. HCK expression was significantly upregulated in response to NLRP12-PANoptosome triggers. Moreover, Hck knockdown inhibited NLRP12-mediated PANoptosis. Computational analyses identified residues in the putative interaction interface between NLRP12 and HCK, suggesting that HCK likely binds NLRP12 in the region between its NACHT domain and pyrin domain (PYD); removal of the NLRP12 PYD abrogated this interaction in vitro. Overall, our work identifies HCK as a regulator of NLRP12-mediated PANoptosis, suggesting that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating inflammation and pathology.",

Here, we use micropipette aspiration (MPA) to directly characterize the viscoelasticity and interfacial tensions of nucleoli within transcriptionally active Xenopus laevis oocytes. We examine the major nucleolar subphases, the outer granular component (GC) and the inner dense fibrillar component (DFC), which itself contains a third small phase known as the fibrillar center (FC). We show that the behavior of the GC is more liquid-like, while the behavior of the DFC/FC is consistent with that of a partially viscoelastic solid. To determine the role of ribosomal RNA in nucleolar material properties, we degrade RNA using RNase A, which causes the DFC/FC to become more fluid-like and alters interfacial tension. Together, our findings suggest that RNA underlies the partially solid-like properties of the DFC/FC and provide insights into how material properties of nucleoli in a near-native environment are related to their RNA-dependent function.",

The numerical indices being promoted suffer from numerous conceptual and quantitative problems, to the point of being devoid of meaning, with the authors even failing to recognize the distinction between mutation and selection. Moreover, the promulgators of these new laws base their arguments on the idea that natural selection is in relentless pursuit of increasing organismal complexity, despite the absence of any evidence in support of this and plenty pointing in the opposite direction.

          "abstract": "Root development is tightly regulated in plants to optimize nutrient acquisition and interactions with soil microorganisms. In legumes, the Autoregulation of Nodulation (AoN) pathway systemically controls the proliferation of root nodules, which are energy-intensive organs. Mutations affecting the AoN pathway result in a hypernodulation phenotype accompanied by altered root development. However, it remains unclear whether this modification of root development is also systemic and coordinated with nodulation. In this study, we report the identification of the constitutive cluster root 1 (ccr1) mutant in white lupin ( Lupinus albus ), which exhibits constitutive production of an excessive number of cluster roots. We demonstrate that CCR1 is an ortholog of HAR1/SUNN/NARK leucin-rich repeat-receptor like kinases (LRR-RLKs), which are key regulators of the AoN pathway. Furthermore, we show that CCR1 negatively regulates both nodule and cluster root development. Interspecific grafting experiments between white and narrow-leaved lupin ( Lupinus angustifolius ), a species incapable of producing cluster roots, show that ccr1 shoots can induce the formation of cluster-like roots in narrow-leaved lupin rootstocks. This highlights the conservation of a CCR1-dependent signaling cascade. Transcriptome analyses reveal that CCR1 targets the conserved NIN/LBD16-NFYA regulatory module, which connects nodule and lateral root development through a shared inhibitory systemic pathway. We propose that this pathway represents a broader developmental control mechanism of root organogenesis, termed Autoregulation of Cluster Root and Nodule Development (AoDev).",

          "abstract": "Astrocytes, the most abundant type of glial cell, play a fundamental role in memory. Despite most hippocampal synapses being contacted by an astrocyte, there are no current theories that explain how neurons, synapses, and astrocytes might collectively contribute to memory function. We demonstrate that fundamental aspects of astrocyte morphology and physiology naturally lead to a dynamic, high-capacity associative memory system. The neuron–astrocyte networks generated by our framework are closely related to popular machine learning architectures known as Dense Associative Memories. Adjusting the connectivity pattern, the model developed here leads to a family of associative memory networks that includes a Dense Associative Memory and a Transformer as two limiting cases. In the known biological implementations of Dense Associative Memories, the ratio of stored memories to the number of neurons remains constant, despite the growth of the network size. Our work demonstrates that neuron–astrocyte networks follow a superior memory scaling law, outperforming known biological implementations of Dense Associative Memory. Our model suggests an exciting and previously unnoticed possibility that memories could be stored, at least in part, within the network of astrocyte processes rather than solely in the synaptic weights between neurons.",

          "abstract": "The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL135 and UL138 genes play opposing roles regulating latency and reactivation in CD34 + human progenitor cells. We designed an RNA sequencing study to compare the transcriptional profile of HCMV infection in the presence and absence of these genes using the Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) monocytic cell line model for latency. Relative to primary cell models, THP-1 cells offer the strength of a homogenous population that uniformly silences gene expression and will synchronously reexpress viral genes following stimulation to differentiate, which models early phases of viral reactivation. The loss of UL138 resulted in elevated levels of viral gene expression and in spontaneous adhesion of distinct cell populations that support HCMV gene expression and genome synthesis. The loss of UL135 resulted in diminished viral gene expression during an initial burst that occurs as latency is established and in no expression of eleven viral genes from the UL b ′ region even following differentiation and reexpression of viral genes. Transcriptional network analysis revealed host transcription factors (TFs) with potential to regulate the UL b ′ genes in coordination with pUL135. We show that the cellular TF peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma binds to the viral genome and influences the expression of UL133-UL138 locus genes. Our results define roles for UL135 and UL138 in regulation of patterns of viral gene expression for the establishment of latency and reexpression of viral genes for reactivation and reveal insights into differentiation-linked mechanisms of transcriptional control of the HCMV genome.",

          "abstract": "The human cortex undergoes immense change in the first years of life, doubling in thickness within the first year and evidencing the greatest change within the first 5 y. While substantial research has identified the early postnatal period as a sensitive period in cortical development, research to date lacks the temporal resolution necessary to identify which aspects of cortical change predict later neural and cognitive function. This study leveraged a rich longitudinal dataset of cortical thickness in 50 children who were scanned up to 11 times between birth and 6 y. We used nonlinear multilevel modeling to explore patterns of cortical change across the brain during this period and distinguish whether different phases of change would predict performance and brain activation during a working memory task children completed at approximately 9 y. Cortical thickness across the brain showed a large increase from birth through 12 mo, a decrease from 12 to 18 mo, and a small increase from 18 mo to 6 y, mirroring patterns of early neural proliferation, pruning, and sustained growth. Performance and neural activation during the working memory task were associated with smaller peak (i.e., 12 mo) thickness and a marginally less steep 12 to 18-mo decline in thickness in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) of the frontal lobe, in line with evidence demonstrating concurrent links between frontal lobe structure and working memory. These findings validate theories of cortical growth developed in preclinical models using human data and demonstrate that prefrontal cortex development in infancy uniquely predicts neurocognitive function 9 y later.",

The engineered VHH remains stable for over 8 h in intestinal fluid and 24 h in fecal samples. Oral administration of this VHH achieves deep pathway inhibition in a murine colitis model.

Here, we show that pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) exerts toxicity on the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by generating an aberrantly planar endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure, which we named a “giant ER sheet.” Untargeted lipidomics revealed that C15:0 is incorporated into complex lipids depending on an acyl-CoA ligase Lcf1 and an acyl-CoA transferase Slc1, thereby increasing the saturation level of the acyl chains. The toxicity and giant ER sheet formation were abolished by deleting lcf1 or slc1 gene, indicating that the incorporation of C15:0 into glycerophospholipids causes giant ER sheet formation. The giant ER sheets disrupted the correct migration of Mid1, a protein determining the cell division site, and physically blocked septum formation, hindering correct cell separation. Our results suggest that the ER is the primary site targeted by saturated FAs, leading to lipotoxicity.",

          "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes, including severe congenital abnormalities. The phosphatidylserine receptors AXL and TIM-1 are recognized as critical entry factors for ZIKV in vitro. However, it remains unclear whether and how ZIKV regulates these receptors during infection. In this study, we investigated AXL and TIM-1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells, glioblastoma U87 cells, and embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblasts following ZIKV infection. We found that both the Asian strain FSS13025 and the African strain MR766 of ZIKV downregulate AXL, with a milder effect on TIM-1. We identified several ZIKV proteins, notably envelope (E), NS2A, NS3, and NS4B, that contribute to this downregulation. Notably, treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NH 4 Cl or the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine mitigated the AXL/TIM-1 downregulation, indicating autophagy’s involvement in the process. Importantly, this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death, which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread.",

          "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms underlying the green insect camouflage have puzzled researchers for over a century. Here, we isolated and identified a green water-soluble protein from the integument of bush-cricket Tettigonia cantans . De novo sequencing and cloning revealed a severely fragmented form of vitellogenins, ubiquitous and multifunctional, but still largely enigmatic glycolipoproteins essential for embryonic development and lacking structural characterization. The distinctive color of the identified chromoprotein results from binding of a remarkable combination of farnesylated bilins (recently identified, tentative heme A catabolites) and xanthophylls, which commensurably absorb light in the 600 to 700 nm and 400 to 550 nm spectral regions and thereby produce a hue that perfectly mimics foliage. The high-resolution crystal structure of this unique ~80 kDa dichromophoric protein, which we named “dibilinoxanthinin” (DBXN), revealed two DBXN protomers, each consisting of three polypeptides, with a novel fold enclosing a large hydrophobic cavity that accommodates two bilins, two luteins, and four phosphatidylcholines, all anchored by hydrogen bonds and giving DBXN unique biochemical and optical properties. Among the green insects tested, some contained yellow and blue chromophores in separate fractions, while others had green proteins similar to DBXN, although not necessarily of the same size. Surprisingly, we isolated and identified a larger vitellogenin proteoform with DBXN-like absorption, from the green huntsman spider Micrommata virescens . These data illustrate striking variations in the DBXN-related pigmentation mechanism among different green arthropods and suggest that vitellogenins may have undergone neofunctionalization, reflecting their potential for functional diversification.",

By using a filtration-based protocol, our experiments demonstrate that the self-reproduction process occurs concomitantly with the PISA process and results in a nonlinear increase in the number of polymer vesicles during photopolymerization which can only be ascribed to their reproduction via polymeric spores ejected from previously existing first-generation vesicles. The second and subsequent generations’ vesicles also self-reproduce and continue the process of population growth.",

          "abstract": "Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene expression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that ignore intracluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond coarse analyses of predefined subgroups by using contextualized learning, a multitask learning paradigm that uses multiview contexts including phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information to infer personalized models. With sample-specific contexts, contextualization enables sample-specific models and even generalizes at test time to predict network models for entirely unseen contexts. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, and Neighborhood Selection) and estimate context-specific GRNs for 7,997 tumors across 25 tumor types, using copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics as model context. Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based precision oncology by providing a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects and leading to subtypings that improve survival prognosis.

However, the high-yield biochemical isolation and visualization of endogenous NLGNs is hampered by the lack of efficient antibodies. Thus, to reveal their subcellular distribution, binding partners, and synaptic function, NLGNs were extensively manipulated using knock-down, knock-out, or overexpression approaches, leading to controversial results. As an alternative to the manipulation of NLGN expression level, we describe here the generation of a knock-in (KI) mouse strain in which native NLGN1 was N-terminally tagged with a small biotin acceptor peptide (bAP) that can be enzymatically biotinylated by the exogenous delivery of biotin ligase. After showing that KI mice exhibit normal behavior as well as similar synaptic number, ultrastructure, transmission properties, and protein expression levels when compared to wild type counterparts, we exploited the fact that biotinylated bAP-NLGN1 can be selectively isolated or visualized using high-affinity streptavidin conjugates. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we show that bAP-NLGN1 binds PSD-95 and gephyrin and populates both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, challenging the historical view that NLGN1 is exclusively localized at excitatory synapses. Using superresolution optical and electron microscopy, we further highlight that bAP-NLGN1 forms in the synaptic cleft a subset of nanodomains, which contain each a few NLGN1 dimers and whose number positively scales with the postsynapse size. Overall, our study not only provides an extensively characterized KI mouse model which will be available to the scientific community but also an unprecedented view of the nanoscale organization of endogenous NLGN1.",

These cells were termed liver metastasis-initiating cells (LMICs). LMICs exhibit high stemness, low proliferation, active interaction with surrounding stromal components, and a close association with liver metastasis. Notably, we found significant interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and LMICs via the SEMA3C–NRP2 receptor–ligand pair. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that CAF-secreted SEMA3C could bind to the NRP2 receptor, which activates the MAPK pathway and promotes colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

          "abstract": "A recent study has suggested that the stimulus responses of cortical neural populations follow a critical power law. More precisely, the power spectrum of the covariance matrix of neural responses follows a power law with an exponent indicating that the neural manifold lies on the edge of differentiability. This criticality is hypothesized to balance expressivity and robustness in neural encoding, as population responses on a nondifferential fractal manifold are thought to be overly sensitive to perturbations. However, contrary to this hypothesis, we prove that neural coding is far more robust than previously assumed. We develop a theoretical framework that provides an analytical expression for the Fisher information of population coding under the small noise assumption. Our results reveal that, due to its intrinsic high dimensionality, population coding maintains reliability even on a nondifferentiable fractal manifold, despite its sensitivity to perturbations. Furthermore, the theory reveals that the trade-off between energetic cost and information makes the critical power-law coding the optimal neural encoding of sensory information for a wide range of conditions. In this derivation, we highlight the essential role of a neural correlation, known as differential correlation, in power-law population coding. By uncovering the nontrivial nature of high-dimensional information coding, this work deepens our understanding of criticality and power laws in both biological and artificial neural computation.",

However, the nature of Il18r1 + IECs, and their subsequent role in epithelial-intrinsic IL-18 signaling is poorly characterized. Here, we show that, in the murine small intestine, the IL-18 receptor is expressed by rare IECs that we identified to be a subset of enterochromaffin cells (ECC). While these cells are the major producers of serotonin in the intestine, we found no evidence that IL-18 regulated serotonin metabolism or release. Rather, upon radiation-induced injury, Il18r1 + cells appeared in the crypt base and took on a revival stem cell (revSC) program, marked by mixed expression of YAP/TAZ and enteroendocrine genes signatures. Functionally, irradiated Il18 −/− mice display reduced epithelial proliferation and altered differentiation in the small intestine, characterized by increased Paneth cells (PC) and elevated Wnt3 levels, which was partially recapitulated in Il18 −/− ileal organoids.

AprA induces repulsion by inhibiting Ras activation and pseudopod formation on the side of the cell closest to the source of AprA, without affecting the overall frequency of pseudopod formation. In contrast, polyP activates Ras at multiple regions of the cortex and increases pseudopod formation frequency, especially at the side of the cell furthest from the source of polyP. At least 20 signal transduction proteins are needed for both AprA and polyP repulsion, 9 are needed by polyP but not AprA, and 4 are needed by AprA but not polyP. Together, these results indicate that proliferating D. discoideum cells use two different chemorepellents, that one of the repellents is the unusual molecule polyphosphate, and that the two repellents activate partially overlapping and partially different pathways to induce repulsion by two basically different mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Microsaccades (MSs) are commonly associated with covert spatial attention, yet their impact on cortical processing of visual objects remains unclear. Rhesus macaques, randomly cued to attend to a target object amid distracters, were rewarded for detecting a color change in the target. While spatial attention does not affect the object tuning curves of V4 cells, the direction of MS significantly influenced object representations in V4 throughout the entire trial. Specifically, intervals following an MS toward the target exhibited superior stimulus decoding and sharper tuning curves compared to intervals following an MS away from the target. Furthermore, MSs directed toward the target enhanced neuronal responses to behaviorally relevant color changes, leading to faster reaction times. This sharpening effect stems from both a refreshing of the initial sensory response and an amplification of attention effects. The firing rate enhancement associated with spatial attention is delayed until the occurrence of the first MS directed toward the target. Subsequently, a positive effect of attention on firing rate, influenced by MS direction, was found throughout the trial across deep and superficial layers of V4, lateral pulvinar, and IT cortex. In summary, these findings underscore a crucial link between covert attention, object processing, and their coordination with MSs.",

          "abstract": "The underlying factors that lead to specific strains within a species to emerge as human pathogens remain mostly enigmatic. The diarrheal disease cholera is caused by strains from a phylogenetically confined group within the Vibrio cholerae species, the pandemic cholera group (PCG), making it an ideal model system to tackle this puzzling phenomenon. Comprehensive analyses of over 1,840 V. cholerae genomes, including environmental isolates from this study, reveal that the species consists of eleven groups, with the PCG belonging to the largest and located within a lineage shared with environmental strains. This hierarchical classification provided us with a framework to unravel the ecoevolutionary dynamics of the genetic determinants associated with the emergence of toxigenic V. cholerae . Our analyses indicate that this phenomenon is largely dependent on the acquisition of unique modular gene clusters and allelic variations that confer a competitive advantage during intestinal colonization. We determined that certain PCG-associated alleles are essential for successful colonization whereas others provide a nonlinear competitive advantage, acting as a critical bottleneck that clarifies the isolated emergence of PCG. For instance, toxigenic strains encoding non-PCG alleles of a) tcpF or b) a sextuple allelic exchange mutant for genes tcpA , toxT , VC0176 , VC1791 , rfbT, and ompU , lose their ability to colonize the intestine. Interestingly, these alleles do not play a role in the colonization of newly established model environmental reservoirs. Our study uncovers the evolutionary roots of toxigenic V. cholerae offering a tractable approach for investigating the emergence of pathogenic clones within an environmental population.",

          "abstract": "Pigmentation plays a vital role in the survival of organisms, supporting functions such as camouflage, communication, and mate attraction. In vertebrates, these functions are mediated by specialized pigment cells known as chromatophores of which, uric acid crystal–forming leucophores remain the least understood, with little known about their molecular mechanisms. A key question in pigment cell biology is whether different crystal chemistries require distinct molecular pathways, or whether similar cellular processes drive the formation of diverse crystals. This study was designed to unravel the uncharacterized process of uric acid crystallization in leucophores and compare them to guanine crystal formation in iridophores and pterin formation in xanthophores. The results of our transcriptomic, ultrastructural, and metabolomic analyses, demonstrate that leucophores share molecular pathways with iridophores, particularly those connected to organelle organization and purine metabolism, but express discrete genes involved in uric acid biosynthesis and storage. Additionally, leucophores share intracellular trafficking and pterin biosynthesis genes with xanthophores, suggesting universally conserved processes. Ultrastructural studies reveal star-like fibrous structures in leucosomes, which likely serve as scaffolds for unique one-dimensional uric acid assemblies that radiate from the core and act as efficient light scatterers. These findings provide insights into leucophore cell biology and the specialized mechanisms driving molecular crystalline assembly, and reveal that while some cellular processes are conserved, the specific chemistry of each crystal type drives the evolution of distinct molecular pathways.",

          "abstract": "Imbalanced production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While several monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ have shown reductions in amyloid burden, their impact on cognitive function remains controversial, with the added risk of inflammatory side effects. Dysregulated stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, yet the biological interaction between this pathway and Aβ, as well as their combined influence on AD progression, is poorly understood. Here, we show that while microglia play a protective role in clearing extracellular Aβ, excessive Aβ engulfment triggers the cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA for cGAS–STING cascade. This creates a negative feedback loop that not only exacerbates neuroinflammation but also impairs further Aβ clearance. To address this, we present a nanomedicine approach termed “Aβ-STING Synergistic ImmunoSilencing Therapy (ASSIST)”. ASSIST comprises STING inhibitors encapsulated within a blood–brain barrier (BBB)-permeable polymeric micelle that also serves as an Aβ scavenger. Through a multivalent interaction mechanism, ASSIST efficiently destabilizes Aβ plaques and prevents monomer aggregation, subsequently promoting the engulfment of the dissociated Aβ by microglia rather than neurocytes. Furthermore, the STING signaling induced by excessive Aβ uptake is blocked, reducing inflammation and restoring microglial homeostatic functions involved in Aβ clearance. Intravenous administration of ASSIST significantly reduces Aβ burden and improves cognition in AD mice, with minimal cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microhemorrhages. We provide a proof-of-concept nanoengineering strategy to target the maladaptive immune feedback loop arising from conventional immunotherapy for AD treatment.",

          "abstract": "Host-derived factors ingested during mosquito blood feeding are poorly understood modulators of malaria transmission. Here, we demonstrated that host complement C3, acquired by mosquitoes during Plasmodium infection, significantly enhanced rodent malaria infection in laboratory-reared mosquitoes. This effect was recapitulated in field-caught Anopheles sinensis mosquitoes, confirming its relevance to malaria transmission in a more natural setting. Moreover, host-derived C3 significantly reduced the efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies in blocking malaria transmission. Mechanistically, host-derived C3 lyses the mosquito midgut symbiont Elizabethkingia anophelis ( E. anophelis )—a bacterium that intrinsically suppresses parasite development by blocking the zygote-to-ookinete transition. Strikingly, host-derived C3 in mosquitoes appears to be activated by the alternative pathway, and inhibiting Factor B with Iptacopan (LNP023) reduced Plasmodium falciparum ( P. falciparum ) infection, while increased the efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies to blocking P. falciparum transmission in the standard membrane-feeding assay. Therefore, this study describes a strategy of the malaria parasite to utilize host complement C3 to promote its transmission and provides us with an avenue to block malaria transmission and improve the blocking efficacy of anti-Pfs25 antibodies by the inhibition of C3 activation.",

          "abstract": "Necroptosis is an inflammatory programmed cell death pathway triggered by RIPK3 activation through one of the upstream RHIM-domain-containing proteins including RIPK1, TRIF, and ZBP1. Whether necroptosis can be activated independent of the upstream signaling pathways leading to inflammatory pathogenesis remains ambiguous. Here, we revealed a mechanism in which a viral protein mediates direct RIPK3 activation resulting in severe inflammatory pathogenesis in patients. The nonstructural protein NSs of a pathogenic hemorrhagic virus, SFTSV, interacts with the RIPK3 kinase domain and forms biocondensate to promote RIPK3 autophosphorylation and necroptosis activation in an RHIM-independent manner. In parallel, sequestration of RIPK3 within the NSs–RIPK3 condensate inhibited RIPK3-mediated apoptosis and promoted viral replication. Infection with an SFTSV NSs mutant virus not forming NSs condensate triggered pronounced apoptosis resulting in reduced viral replication and decreased fatality in vivo. Blocking SFTSV-triggered necroptosis through depletion of MLKL or treatment with a RIPK3-kinase inhibitor reduced viral inflammatory pathogenesis and fatality in vivo. In contrast, blocking SFTSV-triggered apoptosis through depletion of RIPK3 resulted in enhanced viral replication and increased fatality in vivo. The virus-triggered necroptosis correlated with severe inflammatory pathogenesis and lethality in virus-infected patients. The NSs–RIPK3 condensate may represent a necroptosis activation mechanism that promotes viral pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "A major focus of human genetics is to map severe disease mutations. Increasingly, that goal is understood as requiring huge numbers of people to be sequenced from every broadly defined genetic ancestry group, so as not to miss “ancestry-specific variants.” Here, we consider whether this focus is warranted. We start from first principles considerations, based on models of mutation–drift-selection balance, which suggest that since severe disease mutations tend to be strongly deleterious, and thus evolutionarily young, they will be kept at relatively constant frequency through recurrent mutation. Therefore, highly pathogenic alleles should be shared identically by descent within extended families, not broad ancestry groups, and sequencing more people should yield similar numbers regardless of ancestry. We test the model predictions using gnomAD genetic ancestry groupings and show that they provide a good fit to the classes of variants most likely to be highly pathogenic, notably sets of loss of function alleles at strongly constrained genes. These findings clarify that strongly deleterious alleles will be found at comparable rates in people of all ancestries, and the information they provide about human biology is shared across ancestries.",

          "abstract": "Melanocyte development involves key pathways that are often recapitulated during melanoma initiation, highlighting the importance of understanding these regulatory processes. Our study identifies mgat4b , a glycosyl transferase involved in selective N -glycan branching enriched in pigment progenitors, as a regulator of directional cell migration and establishment of melanocyte stem cell (McSC) pool during early development. Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis in zebrafish upon targeted disruption of mgat4b reveals, that migratory melanocyte progenitors marked by galectin expression fail to persist. Lectin affinity proteomic analysis reveals the glycosylation of key melanocyte proteins GPNMB, KIT, and TYRP1 to be under the control of MGAT4B in melanocytic cells. Additionally, mislocalization of Junctional plakoglobin (JUP) explains the observed defects in cell adhesion and migration to be regulated by MGAT4B but not its isozyme MGAT4A. Our meta-analysis further reveals that melanoma patients with both the BRAF V600E mutation and elevated MGAT4B levels have significantly worse survival outcomes compared to those with only the BRAF V600E mutation. By leveraging the zebrafish MAZERATI platform to model BRAF V600E driver mutation in vivo, we show that mgat4b mutant cells fail to aggregate and initiate tumors. RNA profiling of the transformed melanocytes revealed cell–cell junction, adhesion, and ECM binding to be probable contributing factors that resulted in the failure of tumor onset. Using a small-molecule inhibitor we demonstrate that complex N -glycosylation inhibits early-stage melanoma progression. Our study underscores the importance of selective N -glycan branching in both melanocyte development and melanoma initiation, suggesting MGAT4B as a promising therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.",

Our findings indicate remarkably consistent Zn and K isotope compositions across all lunar basalt types, despite significant variations in Th content. This consistency suggests a relatively homogeneous isotopic composition of volatile elements within the Moon, unaffected by subsequent impact events that formed major basins.

Mosaic-8b immunizations protected animals from challenges from viruses whose RBDs were matched or mismatched to those on nanoparticles. Here, we describe neutralizing mAbs isolated from mosaic-8b-immunized rabbits, some on par with Pemgarda, the only currently FDA-approved therapeutic mAb. Deep mutational scanning, in vitro selection of spike resistance mutations, and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of spike–antibody complexes demonstrated targeting of conserved RBD epitopes. Rabbit mAbs included critical D-gene segment RBD-recognizing features in common with human anti-RBD mAbs, despite rabbit genomes lacking an equivalent human D-gene segment, thus demonstrating that the immune systems of humans and other mammals can utilize different antibody gene segments to arrive at similar modes of antigen recognition. These results suggest that animal models can be used to elicit anti-RBD mAbs with similar properties to those raised in humans, which can then be humanized for therapeutic use, and that mosaic RBD nanoparticle immunization coupled with multiplexed screening represents an efficient way to generate and select broadly cross-reactive therapeutic pan-sarbecovirus and pan-SARS-CoV-2 variant mAbs.",

However, modern Dicer orthologs exhibit divergent helicase functions that affect their ability to contribute to antiviral defense. Moreover, mechanisms that couple ATP hydrolysis to Dicer helicase movement on dsRNA remain enigmatic. We used biochemical and structural analyses of ancestrally reconstructed Dicer helicases to map evolution of dsRNA binding affinity, ATP hydrolysis and translocation. Loss of affinity for dsRNA occurred early in Dicer evolution, coinciding with a decline in translocation activity, despite preservation of ATP hydrolysis activity. Ancestral nematode Dicer also exhibited significant decline in ATP hydrolysis and translocation, but studies of antiviral activities in the modern nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate Dicer retained a role in antiviral defense by recruiting a second helicase. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses of an ancient metazoan Dicer allowed capture of multiple helicase states revealing the mechanism that connects each step of ATP hydrolysis to unidirectional movement along dsRNA. Our study rationalizes the diversity in modern Dicer helicases by connecting ancestral functions to observations in extant enzymes.",

          "abstract": "How does emigration of highly educated citizens of low-income countries to high-income countries affect the economies of the origin countries? The direct effect is “brain drain”—a decrease in the country’s human capital stock. However, there may also be indirect “brain gain” effects. This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration. We discuss conditions under which beneﬁts from skilled migration may outweigh costs and also describe potential research paths to inform policy.",

          "abstract": "Several bacterial pathogens have transitioned from tick-borne to louse-borne transmission, which often involves genome reduction and increasing virulence. However, the timing of such transitions remains unclear. We sequenced four ancient Borrelia recurrentis genomes, the agent of louse-borne relapsing fever, dating from 2300 to 600 years ago. We estimated the divergence from its closest tick-borne relative to 6000 to 4000 years ago, which suggests an emergence coinciding with human lifestyle changes such as the advent of wool-based textiles. Pan-genome analysis indicated that much of the evolution characteristic of B. recurrentis had occurred by ~2300 years ago, though further gene turnover, particularly in plasmid partitioning, persisted until ~1000 years ago. Our findings provide a direct genomic chronology of the evolution of this specialized vector-borne pathogen.",

          "abstract": "The efflux of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from woody stems, a proxy for stem respiration, is a critical carbon flux from ecosystems to the atmosphere, which increases with temperature on short timescales. However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO 2 efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions.",

In this work, we report a formal 1,2-acyl transposition through the photochemical exchange of the C 2 –C 3 positions of C 2 -acylated dihydrobenzofurans. This strategy relies on an unusual photochemical isomerization of the dihydrobenzofuran core to a highly electrophilic spiro-cyclopropane intermediate that is then intercepted by a halide nucleophile. A variety of aryl ketones are transposed using 370-nanometer centered irradiation. Additionally, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides can be transposed using 310-nanometer centered irradiation.

We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulation q -vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu 2 Si 2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu 2 Si 2 by manipulating magnetic domains with magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing potential future applications for data storage and processing devices.",

In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. Here, we introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires a constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. Physical synchronization of several of these self-oscillating limbs enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than those of comparable state-of-the-art robots. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.",

          "abstract": "Mountain biodiversity reorganizes rapidly as species shift upslope to track temperatures. Pervasive species redistribution poses substantial threats to mountain ecosystems, a phenomenon sometimes described as an “escalator to extinction,” primarily through mountaintop extinctions, range shift gaps (i.e., rapid shifts of suitable temperatures getting ahead of narrow-range species’ upper limits), and lowland biodiversity attrition, yet empirical evidence remains scarce. In this study, our analysis of 8800 records of historical and modern elevational range limits for 440 animal and 1629 plant species revealed little evidence supporting the proposed threats. Observed changes largely fell within random expectations, accounting for geometric constraints. Although delayed mountaintop extinctions point to accumulating extinction debt, concurrent range expansions of both narrow-range and lowland species suggest thermal niche underfilling, processes that collectively drive biotic homogenization across biologically complex mountain ecosystems.",

Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.",

          "abstract": "Interfacial polymerization has been an industrial standard for preparing desalination membranes. Extending the same concept to molecular separation of organic solvents would be a key enabler for the decarbonization of the chemical and petrochemical industries through energy-efficient crude or biocrude oil fractionation. Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts. These membranes, which feature fast and selective transport of hydrocarbons, including multicomponent and industrially relevant mixtures, outperform commercial and state-of-the-art benchmark membranes.",

          "abstract": "In temperate regions experiencing rapid ocean warming, kelp forests are being replaced by chemically rich turf algae. However, the extent to which these turf algae alter the surrounding chemical environment or affect the rebound potential of kelp forests (through chemically mediated interactions) remains unknown. Here, we used underwater visual surveys, comprehensive chemical profiling, and laboratory experiments to reveal that turf algae release bioactive compounds into the water that fundamentally alter the reef “chemical landscape” and directly suppress kelp recruitment. Therefore, our study reveals that chemical ecology is critical in shaping modern kelp forest ecosystems and their resilience. Further, it demonstrates that reversing climate-driven state shifts will require not only curbing global carbon emissions but also implementing targeted local interventions that break harmful ecological feedback loops and foster recovery.",

          "abstract": "Both neurons and glia communicate through diffusible neuromodulators; however, how neuron-glial interactions in such neuromodulatory networks influence circuit computation and behavior is unclear. During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.",

Since 1975, the intent of this international treaty has been to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. Global commitment to these objectives is reflected by the treaty’s total membership of 188 states. However, member states have thus far been unable to raise strong barriers against illicit bioweapons development. With rapid advancements in science and technology and the rise of biological weapons disinformation, improvements of the Convention are urgently needed. One way to reinforce the treaty is to consider an inspection mechanism that aims to disrupt illicit programs rather than detect them.",

A growing body of work has shown that IDRs often interact with partners in a manner that does not depend on the precise order of amino acids but is instead driven by complementary chemical interactions, leading to disordered bound-state complexes. However, these chemically specific dynamic interactions are difficult to predict. In this study, we repurposed the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to predict this chemical specificity between IDRs and partner proteins using protein sequence as the only input. Our approach—FINCHES—enables the direct prediction of phase diagrams, the identification of chemically specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, the decomposition of chemically distinct domains in IDRs, and a route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in molecular recognition.",

The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star.

A second class of proteins were designed to catalyze a silicon-hydrogen insertion and were optimized by directed evolution in whole cells. The evolved proteins incorporated features unlikely to be generated by computational design alone, including a proline in an α helix. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that as the proteins evolved toward higher activity, their conformational ensembles narrowed to favor more productive conformations.

Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago.

          "abstract": "The role of the Great Acceleration in transitioning the Earth into a new system state invites questions about the acceleration mechanism itself. Here, we use socioeconomic and environmental datasets from Roman Western Anatolia (first c. BCE to seventh c. CE) to investigate the possible mechanisms of globalization-driven acceleration. After the Roman conquest, Anatolia experienced a rapid transition to profoundly anthropogenic landscapes, reaching hitherto unknown levels of agricultural production that remained stable for several centuries. At the socioeconomic level, as revealed by our application of social network analysis to the numismatic data, the growth dynamics continued, leading to ever greater integration. When international conflict in the seventh c. CE disrupted the connectivity, the anthropogenic landscapes rewilded. This dual-system behavior, critical transition followed by equilibrium in the socioecological realm and continued growth in the socioeconomic realm, suggests that the observed postacceleration stabilization necessitated differential balancing of negative and positive feedbacks in each domain.",

This study investigates this topic using representative samples of 4127 Afghans living through the latter stages of the War in Afghanistan and its aftermath. We find that the life satisfaction of Afghans dropped significantly following the conclusion of the War in Afghanistan in 2022, with two-thirds reporting a life satisfaction rating of 0 or 1 on a 0-to-10–point scale. When compared to data from two international well-being datasets together covering more than 170 countries between 1946 and 2022, the mean life satisfaction score in Afghanistan following the Taliban regaining power ( M  = 1.28) is the lowest ever recorded. The mean hope score in the country also dropped to a critically low level ( M  = 1.02) in 2022. Wars are devastating, but the conclusion of war can appear worse from the perspectives of civilians despite the de-escalation of physical violence.",

          "abstract": "Action sequencing is fundamental to behavior. A critical decision for survival and reproduction is whether to repeat a current action or switch to a different one. However, the neural mechanisms governing action repetition and switching remain largely unknown. In mice trained to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we found that the M1-DLS circuit regulates action repetition, while the PrL-DMS pathway controls action switching. These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1-SPNs by M1 and D2-SPNs by PrL, respectively. In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD, the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL-DMS pathway was reversed, leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors. Genetic restoration of Shank3 in the DMS rescued both physiological and behavioral deficits. These findings reveal how the brain orchestrates action sequencing in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress exposure is a primary contributor to the development of anxiety disorders, closely associated with hippocampal dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), we observed a notable increase in the activity, rather than its overall expression level, of hippocampal Rap1, a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily. Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) effectively mitigated CRS-induced anxiety. Cell type–specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons (PNs), but not in astrocytes or interneurons, contributed to CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistically, the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv4.2 phosphorylation at the Thr 607 site, which contributes to the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice following CRS. Overall, our study reveals a previously undescribed anxiogenic effect of Rap1 and highlights it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stress-related mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "Broadband photodetection, especially for the high-intensity pulsed lasers, has garnered increasing interest in photophysics and applied sciences driven by the development of pulsed lasers. However, direct broadband photodetection of high-intensity pulsed lasers, with precisely capturing their spatiotemporal properties, has been hampered by low saturation intensity or damage threshold of traditional optoelectronic materials. Here, we demonstrate that strategic enhancement of excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskite can enable robust high-order multiphoton absorption (MPA) optoelectronics with achieving strong four-photon absorption (4PA) and five-photon absorption (5PA) nonlinearities as well as efficient electronic properties simultaneously. This effectively overcomes the limitations of mainstream photodetectors. Our approach facilitates direct photodetection and high-precision imaging of high-intensity femtosecond lasers (21.5 GW/cm 2 ) across a broad wavelength range of 800 to 2300 nanometer. These results offer valuable insights into advancing high-order nonlinearity-based optoelectronics and provide practical solutions for direct measurement tools of intensive lasers, filling the blank of high-precision characterization of intense-field laser phenomena.",

We identify FOXO3 as a repressor of IFNS, whose abundance decreases upon PHD3 induction in response to oAß. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations. Together, our data strongly indicate that the inactivation of the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, improving AD outcome.",

          "abstract": "Digital twins, which replicate real-world entities through computational models, are transforming manufacturing and automation. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven digital twin development using discrete-time data and finite-depth models on digital hardware, these approaches face significant limitations. They struggle to capture continuous-time dynamics and model complex systems, and suffer from substantial time and energy overheads due to physically separated storage and processing as well as frequent analog-digital (A/D) conversions. Here, we propose a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins. Our approach is intrinsically time-continuous using infinite-depth neural networks to model complex dynamics. Fully analog memristor arrays collocate storage and computation, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck and reducing A/D conversion requirements. We experimentally validate our solver on digital twins of HP variable-resistor model and Lorenz96 dynamics, demonstrating a 166.5-fold/369.3-fold speedup and a 499.0-fold/673.9-fold improvement in energy efficiency, respectively.

However, prolonged use is associated with severe hematologic toxicity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of linezolid metabolites. Our clinical study indicates that elevated exposure to PNU142586, a primary metabolite of linezolid, is associated with an increased risk of linezolid-induced toxicity, even in the absence of renal impairment. To elucidate its mechanism, we identify DNA topoisomerase 2-α (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-β (TOP2B) as primary targets of PNU142586 at molecular, cellular, and in vivo levels. PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the regulation of N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A), the prominent internal modification in mRNA, fosters the development of potential therapeutic strategies for human cancers. While the m 6 A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout of FTO , but not ALKBH5 , significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression. Mechanistic analysis reveals that FTO heightens ELK3 mRNA stability in an m 6 A-dependent manner. Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppresses ELK3 expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy. Our findings unravel the crucial role of FTO in T-ALL and highlight the FTO-ELK3 axis as a key nodule during leukemogenesis, thereby providing a fundamental basis to harness selective FTO antagonist for T-ALL therapeutics.",

We reveal that preceramic hunter-gatherers represent a previously unknown basal lineage that derives from the initial South American radiation. These hunter-gatherers do not carry differential affinity to ancient North American groups nor contribute genetically to ancient or present-day South American populations. By 2000 years ago, the local genetic ancestry is replaced by populations from Central America associated with the Herrera ceramic complex and survives through the Muisca period despite major cultural changes.

However, whether small nucleolar RNAs participate in the regulation of ISC self-renewal remains unclear. Here, we identified a small nucleolar RNA ( Snora54 ) that was highly expressed in the nucleolus of ISCs. Snora54 knockout enhanced the self-renewal capacity of ISCs and intestinal regeneration. Mechanistically, in a steady state, highly expressed Snora54 anchored the nucleolar protein Lyar in the nucleolus of ISCs, preventing Lyar from translocation into the nucleoplasm. Thereby, Lyar failed to recruit on the Notch2 promoter region in the nucleoplasm to promote Notch2 transcription, leading to suppression of ISC self-renewal. By contrast, with deletion of Snora54 , Lyar translocated to the nucleoplasm of ISCs where it enriched on the Notch2 promoter to initiate its transcription resulting in the activation of Notch2 signaling pathway. Therefore, Snora54 negatively regulates self-renewal of ISCs and gut regeneration via suppression of Notch2 signaling.",

          "abstract": "The mechanisms by which epithelial stem cells (SCs) sense mechanical cues within their niche and convert the information into biochemical signals to govern their function are not well understood. Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion of Piezo1 leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs. These findings establish the force threshold necessary for PIEZO1 activation and reveal PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx as a key mechanism for sensing mechanical cues in the niche and regulating HF-SC activity.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal activity stimulates mRNA translation crucial for learning and development, but the mechanism linking translation to neuronal activity is not understood. In humans, learning and memory are severely disrupted by mutations in the potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, Slo2.2). We find that pharmacological stimulation of this channel and a constitutively active Slack mutation stimulate mRNA translation of a reporter for β-actin mRNA in cell lines and increases the synthesis of β-actin in the neurites of cortical neurons. Moreover, channel activation promotes the binding of two key mRNA translation regulators, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1–interacting protein 1), to the channel itself, releasing both from eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), where they normally inhibit initiation of translation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for Slack activity–dependent regulation of translation and suggests that the effects of Slack mutations on this process may explain the severe intellectual disabilities associated with these mutations.",

Using over 9 years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, we present the first observations of present-day sputtering in the martian upper atmosphere. By correlating argon densities with solar electric fields, we find that sputtered rates of argon are over four times higher than model predictions. We also present evidence of enhanced sputtering during a solar storm, offering a glimpse at more intense conditions in the early solar system.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, psychophysical experiments, and resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, our study demonstrated that events have an independent storage space within WM, named as event cache, with distinct neural correlates compared to object storage in WM. We found the cerebellar network to be the most essential network for event cache, with the left cerebellum Crus I being particularly involved in encoding and maintaining events.

After printing, the structures were heated to high temperatures in air to remove organic components and convert the remaining material into silica glass. 3D glass PhCs with periodicities as small as 260 nanometers were obtained after sintering at 650°C. The 3D glass PhCs exhibit ~100% reflectance in the visible range, surpassing the typical reflectances observed from similar structures in low–refractive index materials.

Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples, we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co-occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions. The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans, where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation. Conversely, in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans, plankton showed enrichment in non-phosphorus lipids, likely responding to warm temperature, with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump. In the subsurface of these regions, highly unsaturated lipids were enriched, suggesting phytoplankton adaptation to low light and contributing unsaturated fatty acids to tropical and subtropical ocean food webs.",

After the LGM, birds and amphibians underwent population expansion, whereas mammals and reptiles’ populations declined. Regions with high N e shifted from Neotropical to Afrotropical and to Palearctic, some overlapping with recognized glacial refugia and biodiversity hotspots. In addition, climate-related factors exerted long-term effects on N e , while human disturbances might confine to specific regions around the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary.

Here, we use a frequency-agile optical frequency comb to coherently interrogate the optical field within the microresonator in both temporal and spectral domains. In the chaotic regime, we observe transient events characterized by extremely high optical intensity, identified as rogue waves based on the long-tailed distribution of peak powers.

Here, we reported that BAG3 expression was significantly elevated in AD. It interacted with and stabilized BACE1 by delaying its degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal pathways. BAG3 E455K and BAG3 R480A mutations reduced their interaction with BACE1. SPOT peptide arrays revealed that BACE1 carboxyl-terminal peptide fragments bound to the RQ domain of BAG3. This interaction can be disrupted by BACE1-derived peptide (Tat-BACE1 480-494 ), leading to decreased BACE1 stability. In APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, Tat-BACE1 480-494 reduced BACE1 levels, decreased Aβ production, and improved synaptic and cognitive deficits.

Closed-basin brines, which generate ~40% of global lithium production, often have a circumneutral pH; however, during the evaporative concentration required for lithium production, the evaporated brines become acidic. Using primary geochemical and boron isotope data from the Salar de Uyuni (SDU), Bolivia combined with a modeling approach, we show that boron enrichment, which commonly co-occurs with lithium in closed-basin brines, is the primary factor in controlling the pH of brines from the SDU. We demonstrate that boron in global lithium- and boron-rich brines from closed basins exerts a similar influence on brine pH. The unique boron enrichments and its speciation can explain large proportions of alkalinity in these brines (~98% at the SDU), where evaporation alters the dissociation of boric acid, which triggers the formation of acidic evaporated brines.",

To overcome these issues, we introduce a universal alcohol-based molecule coupling (AMC) method to regulate amorphousness and inhibit V dissolution in VOs (VO 2 , V 2 O 5 , and V 6 O 13 ), resulting in high-performance cathodes. The strategy enables alcohol molecules with different chain lengths (ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol) to couple with VOs by forming V─OH bonds under Lewis acid–based interactions, inducing controlled amorphization. Among these, isopropanol coupling stands out by enabling the formation of short-range ordered amorphous structure (SOA-VO/Ipr). This structure enhances the reaction kinetics and suppresses V dissolution. As a result, the SOA-VO/Ipr cathode achieves 219.4 mAh g −1 at 100 A g −1 , retains 92.6% capacity over 10,000 cycles, and delivers 228.8 mAh g −1 at 9.1 A g −1 under high loading (21.9 mg cm −2 ) over 3500 cycles, demonstrating a promising method for durable zinc-ion batteries.",

          "abstract": "The striatum plays a key role in decision-making, with its effects varying with anatomical location and direct and indirect pathway striatal projecting neuron (d- and iSPN) populations. Using a mouse gambling task with a reinforcement-learning model, we described individual decision-making profiles as a combination of three archetypal strategies: Optimizers, Risk-averse, and Explorers. These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles. Hence, we propose that striatal populations from different subregions influence distinct decision-making parameters, leading to profile-dependent choices.",

This design extends energy harvesting to rainy conditions while maintaining thermal regulation on clear days. The metafilm features a sandwich structure with fluorinated ethylene propylene/indium tin oxide outer layers for raindrop-induced electricity generation and thermochromic core layers for self-regulated heating and cooling. It achieves an optical contrast exceeding 63% in the visible spectrum, enabling sub-ambient cooling in hot conditions and above-ambient heating when cold. In addition, it demonstrates efficient droplet-induced electricity generation, delivering a high-voltage output of 208 volts with exceptional long-term stability.

The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism.",

Here, we report a tough underwater robot that exhibits an accurate, three-dimensional, and multimodal motion. Counterintuitively, the soft robot is composed of polymers that are not photo-mechanically responsive but are powered by the ambient fluid. The unique feature notably widens the pool of material selection and allows further treatment to strengthen the polymer matrix without concerns of trade-off between the mechanical properties with the actuation capability.

NAECs were differentiated, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro RSV infection. Gene expression of NAECs from children with a wheeze phenotype indicated abnormal differentiation and basal cell activation of developmental pathways, plasticity in precursor differentiation, delayed onset of maturation, increased diversity of RSV receptors, and blunted antiviral immune responses to in vitro RSV infection. The most marked changes in differentiation were observed in NAECs from children with both wheeze and RSV in the first year of life.

However, their clustering mechanisms remain unknown. Because Kv1 channels have a highly conserved PDZ-binding motif, we used CRISPR-based genome editing to screen 18 PDZ domain-containing proteins identified in our previous AIS proximity proteome for their AIS localization. Among these, we found that the scaffolding proteins SCRIB and PSD93 are highly enriched at the AIS. Using CRISPR-mediated knockout, cell surface clustering assays, and coimmunoprecipitation, we show that SCRIB and PSD93 bind to and are required for AIS Kv1 channel clustering, whereas SCRIB links the AIS Kv1 channel protein complex to the master AIS scaffolding protein AnkyrinG.

The structure reveals a substrate interaction surface on the AMBRA1 WD40 domain that specifically binds to the C-terminal region of D-type cyclins. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr 286 residue in the C-terminal phosphodegron site of D-type cyclins. The phosphodegron motif folds into a turn-like conformation, followed by a 3 10 helix that promotes its assembly with AMBRA1. In addition, we show that AMBRA1 mutants, which are defective in cyclin D1 binding, lead to cyclin D1 accumulation and DNA damage. Understanding the AMBRA1–D-type cyclin structure enhances the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern the cell cycle control and may lead to potential therapeutic approaches for cancers linked to abnormal cyclin D activity.",

In the quantum tunneling regime (realized by decreasing the gap size), by injection of carriers into a nanocavity-integrated tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) monolayer, spectrally tunable EL (controlled by the bias polarity) is achieved with a room-temperature quantum efficiency reaching ~3.5%, showing an improvement of more than 10 3 times over previous works.",

However, there have been no self-consistent models that quantify whether this process can generate the required field intensities. Our impact and magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that for an initial maximum surface field of only 2 microtesla, plasmas created from basin-forming impacts can amplify a planetary dipole field at the basin antipode to ~43 microtesla.

We introduce a multiplexed genetically encoded sensor–based imaging and voltammetry method to simultaneously record synaptic, perisynaptic, and extrasynaptic dopaminergic transmission at mouse central neurons. Using this method alongside a genetically encoded sensor–based image analysis program, we found that heterogeneous dopaminergic firing patterns create various transmission modes, encoding frequency, number, and synchrony of firing pulses using neurotransmitter quantity, releasing synapse count, and synaptic and/or volume transmission. Under both tonic and low-frequency phasic activities, transporters effectively reuptake dopamine at perisynaptic sites, confining dopamine within synaptic clefts to mediate synaptic transmission. In contrast, under high-frequency, particularly synchronized firing activity or transporter inhibition, released dopamine may overwhelm transporters, escaping from synaptic clefts via one to three outlet channels, triggering volume transmission.

We use a novel vesicle modeling technology to model the synaptic vesicle cycle in unprecedented molecular and spatial detail at a hippocampal synapse. Our model demonstrates robust recycling of synaptic vesicles that maintains consistent synaptic release, even during sustained high-frequency firing. We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment. We also monitored vesicle usage in isolated hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive pHluorin, demonstrating that reserve vesicle recruitment depends on firing frequency, even at nonphysiologically high firing frequencies, as predicted by the model.",

We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of its pharmacological inhibition in glioblastoma using DDP_38003 (LSD1i), which selectively targets tumor-initiating cells (TICs) by hampering their adaptability to stress. Through biological, metabolic, and omic approaches, we now show that LSD1i acts as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor, activating the integrated stress response and altering mitochondrial structure and function. These effects impair TICs’ oxidative metabolism and generate reactive oxygen species, further amplifying cellular stress. LSD1i also impairs TICs’ glycolytic activity, causing their metabolic decline. TICs with enhanced glycolysis benefit from LSD1-directed therapy. Conversely, metabolically silent TICs mantain ER and mitochondrial homeostasis, adapting to stress conditions, including LSD1i treatment. A dropout short hairpin RNA screening identifies postglycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to proteins inositol deacylase 1 (PGAP1) as a mediator of resistance to LSD1i. Disruptions in ER and mitochondrial balance holds promise for improving LSD1-targeted therapy efficacy and overcoming treatment resistance.",

Tumor vasculature also plays a pivotal role in immunoregulation and antitumor immunity. Here, we show that small GTPase Rab27 controls the vascular morphogenesis and permeability for blood content and immune effectors. Thus, in Rab27a/b double knock out (Rab27-dKO) mice, the brain vasculature is abnormally scarce, while the blood vessels become dysmorphic and hyperpermeable in the context of brain tumors, including syngeneic glioblastoma. These defects are reflected in rearrangements of endothelial cell subpopulations with underlying diminution of venous endothelial subtype along with changes in gene and protein expression. Notably, Rab27-dKO brain endothelial cells exhibit deficient tight junctions, whereby they enable large-scale extravasation of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass. We show that Rab27-regulated vascular T cell infiltration can be exploited to enhance adoptive T cell therapy in syngeneic brain tumors.",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing of embryonic hearts, we identified prothymosin α (PTMA) as a key factor driving cardiomyocyte proliferation. Overexpression of PTMA in primary mouse and rat cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and similarly enhanced proliferation in human iPSC–derived cardiomyocytes. Conditional knockout of Ptma in cardiomyocytes impaired neonatal heart regeneration. AAV9-mediated overexpression of Ptma extended the neonatal proliferative window and showed therapeutic promise for enhancing adult heart regeneration. Mechanistically, PTMA interacted with MBD3, inhibiting its deacetylation activity within the MBD3/HDAC1 NuRD complex. This inhibition increased STAT3 acetylation, which positively regulated STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of its target genes. These findings establish PTMA as a critical regulator of heart regeneration and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic myocardial injury.",

Here, we present a transient expression protocol that produces robust mouse Na V 1.9 currents, enabling direct electrophysiological comparisons with native dorsal root ganglion neurons. To further understand the low current density observed in human Na V 1.9, we created chimeras with Na V 1.5 and identified a role for the C-tail—specifically the IQ motif and EF-hand—in regulating current densities, likely due to a weak affinity for calmodulin. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that, unlike other Na V channel subtypes, calmodulin binding to the C-tail is likely too weak to occur under physiological conditions. Markedly, the pre-IQ region did not influence channel expression but was responsible for conferring the characteristic depolarized voltage dependency of inactivation of Na V 1.9. Our findings provide insights into the unique gating mechanisms of Na V 1.9 and demonstrate the robustness of this platform for structure-function studies.",

Zkscan4 disruption ( Zkscan4 −/− ) was sufficient to induce depression-like behaviors following subthreshold social stress. Zkscan4 regulated excitatory synaptic transmission mainly through direct interaction with the Htr2a promoter and the recruitment of glucocorticoid receptors for the transcriptional repression of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2a (Htr2a). Reduced excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and stress susceptibility in Zkscan4 −/− mice were restored by pharmacological inhibition, genetic knockdown of Htr2a, or overexpression of the amino-terminal SCAN domain of Zkscan4 (Zkscan4 1–133 ) in cornus ammonis region 3.

Gargalesis is likely the earliest trigger for laughter in life, but it is unclear whether we laugh because we enjoy it. Socrates, Aristotle, Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, and Darwin theorized about tickling, but after two millennia of intense philosophical interest, experimentation remains scarce. This review argues that gargalesis is an exhilarating scientific puzzle with far-reaching implications for developmental, sensorimotor, social, affective, clinical, and evolutionary neuroscience. We reflect on the challenges in defining and eliciting ticklish sensations in the lab and unraveling their neural mechanism, discuss five classic yet unanswered questions about tickle, and suggest directions for future research.",

Hence, a multifunctional soft hydrogel integrated with programmed drug release capability (MLVgel) was fabricated. MLVgel is adhesive and moldable with low friction response, which provides moisture and responses to an infectious environment to deliver bactericidal and antioxidant effects in rat bacterial infection and burn wound models. By release control, instant short-term inflammation suppression is combined with sustained mechano-transduction signal inhibition. This dynamically modulates immune responses and delays En1 + fibroblast activation via the YAP-TEAD pathway, ultimately facilitating scarless wound regeneration. Genomic analyses showed that the enhanced reepithelization and mechanoregulation by MLVgel during different wound phases are indispensable for its therapeutic outcomes. Last, MLVgel resulted in markedly improved healing in a pig mature scar model, which demonstrated its translation potential.

GATA2 low murine progenitors are hypersensitive to inflammatory mediators. We discovered that the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 conferred transcriptional activation in GATA2 low progenitors in response to Interferon-γ and Toll-Like Receptor 1/2 agonists. In a locus-specific manner, inflammation reconfigured genome activity by promoting PU.1 recruitment to chromatin or tuning activity of PU.1-preoccupied chromatin. The recruitment mechanism disproportionately required IKKβ activity. Inflammation-activated genes were enriched in motifs for RUNX factors that cooperate with GATA factors. Contrasting with the GATA2-RUNX1 cooperativity paradigm, GATA2 suppressed and RUNX1 promoted PU.1 mechanisms to endow the progenitor genome with inflammation-sensing capacity.",
