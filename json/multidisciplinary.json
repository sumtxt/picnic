          "abstract": "To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions 1–5 . However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2 + ) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2 + neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.",

          "abstract": "Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops 1,2 . A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area) 3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops 6,7 . Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum 8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars 9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 ( CLV3 ) 10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified 1–6 . These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forest canopies are the biosphere’s most concentrated atmospheric interface for carbon, water and energy 1,2 . However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties 3 . This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically 4 . Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space.",

          "abstract": "Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, yet their resilience to rising temperatures remains poorly understood 1,2 . This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased 3 , compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk 4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features.",

          "abstract": "Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells from primary tumours to distant organs and is the cause of 90% of cancer deaths globally 1,2 . Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours 3 . There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA 2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA 2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Haematopoietic stem cells maintain blood production throughout life 1 . Although extensively characterized using the laboratory mouse, little is known about clonal selection and population dynamics of the haematopoietic stem cell pool during murine ageing. We isolated stem cells and progenitors from young and old mice, identifying 221,890 somatic mutations genome-wide in 1,845 single-cell-derived colonies. Mouse stem cells and progenitors accrue approximately 45 somatic mutations per year, a rate only approximately threefold greater than human progenitors despite the vastly different organismal sizes and lifespans. Phylogenetic patterns show that stem and multipotent progenitor cell pools are established during embryogenesis, after which they independently self-renew in parallel over life, evenly contributing to differentiated progenitors and peripheral blood. The stem cell pool grows steadily over the mouse lifespan to about 70,000 cells, self-renewing about every 6 weeks. Aged mice did not display the profound loss of clonal diversity characteristic of human haematopoietic ageing. However, targeted sequencing showed small, expanded clones in the context of murine ageing, which were larger and more numerous following haematological perturbations, exhibiting a selection landscape similar to humans. Our data illustrate both conserved features of population dynamics of blood and distinct patterns of age-associated somatic evolution in the short-lived mouse.",

          "abstract": "Pathogen genomics can provide insights into underlying infectious disease transmission patterns 1,2 , but new methods are needed to handle modern large-scale pathogen genome datasets and realize this full potential 3–5 . In particular, genetically proximal viruses should be highly informative about transmission events as genetic proximity indicates epidemiological linkage. Here we use pairs of identical sequences to characterize fine-scale transmission patterns using 114,298 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected through Washington State (USA) genomic sentinel surveillance with associated age and residence location information between March 2021 and December 2022. This corresponds to 59,660 sequences with another identical sequence in the dataset. We find that the location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postcodes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities. We find that transmission patterns between age groups vary across spatial scales. Finally, we use the timing of sequence collection to understand the age groups driving transmission. Overall, this study improves our ability to use large pathogen genome datasets to understand the determinants of infectious disease spread.",

          "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin (Aux) is a principal endogenous developmental signal in plants. It mediates transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling mechanism. TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors 1–3 . Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity 4 , auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming.",

          "abstract": "Mergers of binary neutron stars emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2 ) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology 3 , nuclear physics 4–6 and gravity 7 . Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8 ), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that higher maternal and paternal age is positively associated with children’s education. Debate continues as to whether these relationships are causal. This is of great interest given the postponement of first births in almost all developed countries during the twentieth century. Here we use an instrumental variable approach (Mendelian randomization) using maternal and paternal polygenic indices (PGIs) for age at first birth—while conditioning on the child’s PGI for age at first birth—to identify the causal effects of maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores based on data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study. We do not find evidence of positive causal effects of both maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores at age 10 years once the children’s PGI and correlations among different PGIs are controlled for. We therefore conclude that our results do not provide evidence in favour of sociological theories that predict positive causal effects of parental age on children’s educational attainment.",

          "abstract": "Urban highways are common, especially in the United States, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here, we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.",

          "abstract": "Recent research, focused mostly on the United States and Western Europe, shows that marginalized communities often face greater environmental degradation. However, the ethnoracial categories used in these studies may not fully capture environmental inequality in the Global South. Moving beyond conventional ethnoracial variables, this study presents findings exploring the link between skin tone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure in Colombia. By matching household geolocations from a large-scale longitudinal survey with satellite-based PM 2.5 estimates, we find that skin tone predicts both initial pollution exposure levels and their changes over time. Although average exposure levels remained stable during our study period, the environmental justice (EJ) landscape in Colombia contemporaneously underwent a complete transformation. In 2010, lighter-skinned individuals faced higher PM 2.5 exposure, but darker-skinned individuals experienced steeper increases in the following years. By 2016, the EJ gap had reversed, with people with the darkest skin tones exposed to PM 2.5 levels nearly one SD higher than those faced by people with the lightest skin tones. These patterns remain robust when controlling for a comprehensive set of theoretically relevant covariates, including ethnoracial self-identification and income. Disproportionate exposure to pollution from fires partially explains the observed disparities. Decomposition analysis shows that this variable, local collective action, and economic marginalization account for a sizeable share of the EJ gap. However, one-third of the gap remains unexplained by observable characteristics. With climate change intensifying fire incidence, the disproportionate disease burdens that vulnerable groups face might deepen unless policy measures are taken to reverse this trend.",

Both tests, however, have well-known statistical limitations, sometimes suggesting discrimination even when there is none. Despite the fallibility of the benchmark and outcome tests individually, here we prove a surprisingly strong statistical guarantee: Under a common nonparametric assumption, at least one of the two tests must be correct; consequently, when both tests agree, they are guaranteed to yield correct conclusions. We present empirical evidence that the underlying assumption holds approximately in several important domains, including lending, education, and criminal justice—and that our hybrid test is robust to the moderate violations of the assumption that we observe in practice. Applying this approach to 2.8 million police stops across California, we find evidence of widespread racial discrimination.",

However, the varying degrees of epidemiological dominance among different lineages or clades of H9N2 AIVs have not been fully clarified. The matrix protein M1, a key structural component of the virion, plays a crucial role in maintaining the viral structure and lifecycle. To elucidate the intrinsic relationship between the genetic patterns of M1 and the adaptive dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, this study focused on the five major evolutionary patterns of M1 and conducted in vitro and in vivo investigations from the perspectives of vRNP release after viral uncoating, polymerase activity, mRNA and vRNA levels, the nuclear export of vRNPs, plasma membrane–binding capacity, proliferation capacity, growth competitiveness, and transmission potential. The results revealed a strong correlation between the epidemiological dominance of H9N2 AIVs and the specific patterns of M1, with M1 P5 standing out as particularly significant. This finding highlights the pivotal influence of the M1 gene patterns on the replication and transmission dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, thereby offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving differences in adaptive evolution and shifts in epidemiological dominance within the H9N2 AIV population.",

In this paper, we report that vimentin forms liquid condensates which appear to enable rapid filament growth. Given the transient nature of these droplets, we focus on properties of vimentin-Y117L, which has a point mutation that leads to formation of condensates but not IFs, enabling us to study these droplets in detail. The droplets dissolve under 1,6-Hexanediol treatment and under decreasing concentration, confirming that they are liquid, and phase separated. These condensates extensively wet actin stress fibers, rendering them resistant to actin-binding drugs and protecting them from depolymerization. We show similar behavior occurs in wild-type vimentin during its assembly into filaments.",

          "abstract": "NASA’s Kepler mission identified over 4,000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes—a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution—remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1,646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e = 0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e = 1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.05 ± 0.01 for small planets to ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.20 ± 0.03 for planets larger than ∼3.5 Earth-radii R ⊕ . The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below ∼3.5 R ⊕ . We also find size-dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the “radius valley,” a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky “super-Earths” (1.0 to 1.5 R ⊕ ) from gas-rich “sub-Neptunes” (2.0 to 3.0 R ⊕ ). We detect this feature at 2.1σ significance. Planets in single- and multitransiting systems exhibit the same size–eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.",

          "abstract": "In the polar regions, which are vulnerable receptors of mercury pollution, atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) efficiently convert elemental mercury (Hg(0)) into oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) via bromine oxidation. Hg(II) subsequently deposits onto snow and sea ice. While field observations have shown that a large percentage of deposited mercury is re-emitted from the ice to the atmosphere by a photoinduced process, the fundamental photochemistry that drives the re-emission process remains unknown. Here, using multiconfigurational quantum chemistry, we find that the photoreduction of HgBr 2 , HgBr 3 − , and HgBr 4 2− in ice is more efficient than in the gas phase. This results from the influence of water molecules on the molecular geometry and electronic structure of mercuric bromides in ice, which enhances the absorption intensities at wavelengths relevant in the troposphere (λ &gt; 290 nm), as compared to gas phase. Kinetic modeling shows that ~30 to 60% of deposited mercury in AMDEs can be reemitted due to the photoreduction of mercuric bromides in ice, in agreement with field observations. Our results reveal a photoreduction mechanism of sunlight-induced excited state chemistry of mercuric bromides on ice. These findings strongly suggest that this chemistry should be incorporated into atmospheric models to account for ice-atmosphere mercury cycling in the polar environments, currently not considered.",

          "abstract": "Pathogen-derived nuclear localization signals (NLSs) enable vigorous nuclear invasion in the host by the virulence proteins harboring them. Herein, inspired by the robust nuclear import mechanism, we show that NLSs originating from the plant infection–associated Agrobacterium proteins VirD2 and VirE2 can be incorporated into the Cas9 system as efficient nuclear delivery enhancers, thereby improving the low gene-editing frequency in a model microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , caused by poor nuclear localization of the bulky nuclease. Prior to evaluation of the NLSs, IPA1 (Cre04.g215850) was first defined in the alga as the nuclear import-related importin alpha (Impα) that serves as a counterpart adaptor protein of the NLSs, based on extensive in silico analyses considering the protein’s sequence, tertiary folding behavior, and structural basis when interacting with a well-studied SV40TAg NLS. Through precursive affinity explorations, we reproducibly found that the NLSs mediated the binding between the Cas9 and Impα with nM affinities and visually confirmed that the fusion of the NLSs strictly localized the peptide-bearing cargoes in the microalgal nucleus without compensating for their cleavage ability. When employed in a real-world application, the VirD2 NLS increases the mutation frequency (~1.12 × 10 −5 ) over 2.4-fold compared to an archetypal SV40TAg NLS (~0.46 × 10 −5 ) when fused with Cas9. We demonstrate the cross-species versatility of the Impα-dependent strategy by successfully applying it to an industrial alga, Chlorella Sp. HS2. This work, focused on affinity augmentation, provides insights into increasing the frequency of gene editing, which can be advantageously used in programmable mutagenesis with broad applicability.",

Wang et al ., Nat. Mat. 23, 492–498 (2024)]. This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks C 4 symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by V pp ) between oxygen p x and p y electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard [aka the Emery-VSA (Varma-Schmitt-Rink-Abrahams) model], using cluster dynamical mean-field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between V pp and V pd (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper d x 2 − y 2 and oxygen p x , y electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.",

Here, we show that Tex38 knockout (KO) male mice are infertile.

TEX38 interacts and colocalizes with ZDHHC19, a testis-enriched acyltransferase catalyzing protein S-palmitoylation, at the plasma membrane of spermatids. ZDHHC19 and TEX38 are each downregulated in mouse testes lacking the other protein. TEX38 stabilizes and localizes ZDHHC19 to the plasma membrane of cultured cells and vice versa, consolidating their interdependence. Mice deficient in ZDHHC19 or harboring a C142S mutation that disables the palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC19 display phenotypes resembling those of Tex38 KO mice. Strikingly, ZDHHC19 palmitoylates ARRDC5, an arrestin family protein regulating sperm differentiation. Overall, our findings indicate that TEX38 forms a stable complex with ZDHHC19 at the plasma membrane of spermatids, which governs downstream S-palmitoylation of proteins essential for morphological transformation of spermatids.",

          "abstract": "Sea otters are an iconic keystone predator that can maintain kelp forests by preying on grazing invertebrates such as sea urchins. However, the effects of sea otters on kelp forests vary over their geographic range. Here, we analyze two 30-y datasets on kelp forest communities during the reintroduction of sea otters along the west coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada, and around San Nicolas Island, CA. We developed a community model to estimate species interactions as dynamic rates, varying with community state. We find evidence of a classic trophic cascade off Vancouver Island; the arrival of otters quickly led to depletion of urchins and recovery of kelp. However, this cascade was muted around San Nicolas Island, with otters, urchins, and kelp all coexisting at intermediate densities for multiple years. Our models show that this difference came from a pulse of strong otter impacts on urchins following recolonization off Vancouver Island, but not off San Nicolas Island. The mean effects of otters on urchins and urchins on kelp were not stronger in the north, indicating that interaction dynamics and not average interaction strength are key to explaining differences in community trajectories. We also find stronger multistep interaction chains in the south, arising from competitive interactions that indirectly buffered otter effects. These findings shed light on long-standing hypotheses about how interspecific interactions can alter the function of keystone species across community contexts. More broadly, we show how community change can be more accurately predicted by considering dynamic interaction strengths.",

          "abstract": "The tuberculosis-causing agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) establishes its niche inside macrophages by secretion of several virulence factors and engaging many host factors. Mycobacterial infection of macrophages results in a proinflammatory trigger–mediated secretion of TNFα. Protein kinase G (PknG), a Serine/Threonine kinase, is essential for mycobacterial survival within the macrophage. Pathogenic mycobacteria, upon infection, can trigger the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, but whether secreted PknG plays any role in TNFα secretion at early stages of infection remains undeciphered. Moreover, at early infection stages, prevention of macrophage apoptosis is vital to successful mycobacterial pathogenesis. Our studies show that mycobacteria-secreted PknG can dampen the expression and concomitant secretion of proinflammatory TNFα. During early infection, M.tb infection–induced generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) leads to S-nitrosylation of PknG on Cys109, thereby enabling its secretion into macrophages. Upon M.tb infection, secreted S-nitrosylated PknG phosphorylates macrophage Silencer of Death Domains (SODD) at Thr405, as identified through our phosphoproteomic studies. Thereafter, phosphorylated SODD, through an irreversible binding with the TNFR1 death domain, prevents Caspase8 activation and concomitant extrinsic apoptotic trigger. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from mice infected with PknG-knockout M.tb also exhibited SODD phosphorylation and hindered Caspase8 activation to prevent extrinsic macrophage apoptosis. Therefore, this work exhibits S-nitrosylation-mediated secretion of PknG to induce phosphorylation of macrophage SODD, which, through irreversible interaction with TNFR1, prevented extrinsic macrophage apoptosis at the early stages of infection.",

          "abstract": "Visually guided grasping is a fundamental building block of animal behavior, the specific neural mechanisms of which remain poorly documented in the human brain. We have mapped the causal contribution of different brain parts to grasping behavior by studying the kinematic parameters of 33 patients with brain tumors, engaged in actions directed toward objects of different sizes. Using motion capture techniques, we analyzed the dynamics of grip aperture and wrist transport. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis was applied to correlate lesion volumes with specific behavioral deficits. Results showed that lesions in the anterior and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus produced impaired finger scaling related to object size. Conversely, impaired velocity of finger aperture was associated with lesions in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Grip aperture deficits following dominant hemisphere lesions were bilateral and were unilateral when following nondominant hemisphere lesions. Impaired wrist transport during reaching was associated with lesions in the first segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Our work highlights an architecture of the grasping network in humans, with unique species-specific features. We hypothesize a model of human neural architecture in which object geometry for hand preshaping is first coded in the left anterior intraparietal cortex and then shared with the right hemisphere. Execution of the motor program of hand preshaping is then performed by the PMd on the corresponding side.",

          "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of biological and artificial networks, an intuitive understanding of how their local learning dynamics contribute to network-level task solutions remains a challenge to this date. Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce “infomorphic” neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised, and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.",

          "abstract": "Molecular research suggests that avocados ( Persea americana Mill.) were domesticated multiple times in the Americas. Seed exchange, hybridization, and cloning have played an essential role across their wild distribution from Mexico to South America to create the modern varieties of today. Archaeological sites with well-preserved and directly radiocarbon-dated botanical assemblages are rare, however, so we know very little about the complexities of the domestication process. Here, we define an early locus of avocado domestication using well-dated desiccated and carbonized avocado remains from El Gigante rockshelter in western Honduras spanning the last 11,000 y. Measurements of avocado seeds and rinds show evidence for long-term management resulting in selection for larger, more robust fruits through time that culminated by 2,250 to 2,080 calendar B.P. (cal. B.P.). However, human-directed selection for larger fruits with thicker rinds is evident as early as 7,565 to 7,265 cal. B.P. Seed morphology is similar to P. americana var. guatemalensis and is congruent with genetic data for the development of this variety in both the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. Increases in seed size and rind thickness through time are consistent with genetic evidence for the enrichment of putative candidate genes for fruit development and ripening in this variety.",

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess associations between long-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 outcomes (infection, hospitalization, and death) in a COVID-19-naive cohort (n = 458,396). Additionally, associations between air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and death) were evaluated in a COVID-19 infection cohort (n = 110,216). Furthermore, this study investigated the role of host genetic susceptibility in the relationships between exposure to air pollutants and the development of COVID-19-related outcomes. Long-term exposure to air pollutants was significantly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes in the COVID-19 naive cohort. Similarly, in COVID-19 infection cohort, hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 hospital admission were 1.23 (1.19, 1.27) for PM 2.5 and 1.22 (1.17, 1.26) for PM 10 , whereas HRs for COVID-19 death were 1.28 (1.18, 1.39) for PM 2.5 and 1.25 (1.16, 1.36) for PM 10 . Notably, significant interactions were found between PM 2.5 /PM 10 and genetic susceptibility in COVID-19 death. In COVID-19 infection cohort, participants with both high genetic risk and high air pollutants exposure had 1.86- to 1.97-fold and 1.91- to 2.14-fold higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death compared to those with both low genetic risk and low air pollutants exposure. Exposure to air pollution is significantly associated with an increased burden of severe COVID-19, and air pollution–gene interactions may play a crucial role in the development of COVID-19-related outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from its onset due to disease or trauma to either recovery or death is poorly understood. Currently, there are no generally accepted treatments aside from supportive care using mechanical ventilation. However, this can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which contributes to a 30 to 40% mortality rate. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a technique to quantify forms of energy transport and dissipation during mechanical ventilation to directly evaluate their relationship to VILI. A porcine ARDS model was used, with ventilation parameters independently controlling lung overdistension and alveolar/airway recruitment/derecruitment (RD). Hourly measurements of airflow, tracheal and esophageal pressures, respiratory system impedance, and oxygen transport were taken for six hours following lung injury to track energy transfer and lung function. The final degree of injury was assessed histologically. Total and dissipated energies were quantified from lung pressure–volume relationships and subdivided into contributions from airflow, tissue viscoelasticity, and RD. Only RD correlated with physiologic recovery. Despite accounting for a very small fraction (2 to 5%) of the total energy dissipation, RD is damaging because it occurs quickly over a very small area. We estimate power intensity of RD energy dissipation to be 100 W/m 2 , equivalent to 10% of the Sun’s luminance at the Earth’s surface. Minimizing repetitive RD events may thus be crucial for mitigating VILI.",

          "abstract": "Drainage divide migration alters the geometry of drainage basins, influencing the distribution of water, erosion, sediments, and ecosystems across Earth’s surface. The rate of divide migration is governed by differences in erosion rates across the divide and is thus sensitive to spatiotemporal variations in tectonics and climate. However, established approaches for quantifying divide migration rates offer only indirect evidence for the motion of the divide and provide only migration rate averages. Consequently, transience in divide migration cannot be resolved, hindering the ability to explore environmental changes that drive the dynamics of such potential transience. Here, we study a set of datable terraces identified as markers of paleo-divide locations, which provide direct evidence for the paleo motion of the divide. The location and age of the terraces reveal intermittent divide migration at timescales of 10 4 to 10 5 y, with phases of rapid migration—at rates more than twice the average—which coincide with documented regional paleoclimate fluctuations. These findings highlight the intermittent nature of divide migration dynamics over geomorphic timescales and its potential sensitivity to climate changes, underscoring the impact of such changes on the planform evolution of drainage basins.",

Operationalizing these commitments requires choosing a planting strategy: How many trees should be planted, of which species, and where? Given those choices must be made now but have long-term consequences, such decisions are plagued by uncertainty. For example, species that are well suited to present conditions may perform poorly under future climates, yet those future climates are themselves highly uncertain. Using the exemplar of the United Kingdom, a nation committed to achieving net zero emissions by midcentury, we quantify key uncertainties pertaining to coevolving climate and economic conditions and examine how modern methods of decision-making under uncertainty can advise on planting choices. Our analysis reveals that the best planting strategy assuming a “high-emissions” future is radically different to that for a future that remains on a “near-historic” path. Planting for the former while experiencing the latter results in substantial net costs to UK society. Assimilating uncertainty into decision-making identifies planting strategies that diversify risk and significantly reduce the probability of high-cost outcomes. Importantly, our research reveals that the scope for mitigating risk through choice of planting strategy is relatively limited. Despite this persistent risk, we find that tree planting remains a highly cost-effective carbon removal solution when compared to alternative technologies, even when those alternatives are assumed to be riskless.",

This study presents a database of over 2,000 pristine and defective nanoscale CNT bundles and other graphitic assemblies, inspired by microscopy, with associated stress–strain curves from reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive INTERFACE force field (IFF-R). These 3D structures, containing up to 80,000 atoms, enable detailed analyses of structure-stiffness-failure relationships. By leveraging the database and physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning (ML), accurate predictions of elastic moduli and tensile strength are demonstrated at speeds 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than efficient MD simulations. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Spatial Information (HS-GNNs) are introduced, which integrate chemistry knowledge. HS-GNNs as well as extreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) achieve forecasts of mechanical properties of arbitrary carbon nanostructures with only 3 to 6% mean relative error. The reliability equals experimental accuracy and is up to 20 times higher than other ML methods. Predictions maintain 8 to 18% accuracy for large CNT bundles, CNT junctions, and carbon fiber cross-sections outside the training distribution. The physics- and chemistry-informed HS-GNN works remarkably well for data outside the training range while XGBoost works well with limited training data inside the training range. The carbon nanostructure database is designed for integration with multimodal experimental and simulation data, scalable beyond 100 nm size, and extendable to chemically similar compounds and broader property ranges.

          "abstract": "B cells generate pathogen-specific antibodies and play an essential role in providing adaptive protection against infection. Antibody genes are modified in evolutionary processes acting on the B cell populations within an individual. These populations proliferate, differentiate, and migrate to long-term niches in the body. However, the dynamics of these processes in the human immune system are primarily inferred from mouse studies. We addressed this gap by sequencing the antibody repertoire and transcriptomes from single B cells in four immune-rich tissues from six individuals. We find that B cells descended from the same pre-B cell (“lineages”) often colocalize within the same tissue, with the bone marrow harboring the largest excess of lineages without representation in other tissues. Within lineages, cells with different levels of somatic hypermutation are uniformly distributed among tissues and functional states. This suggests that the relative probabilities of localization and differentiation outcomes change negligibly during affinity maturation, and quantitatively agrees with a simple dynamical model of B cell differentiation. While lineages strongly colocalize, we find individual B cells nevertheless appear to make independent differentiation decisions. Proliferative antibody-secreting cells, however, deviate from these global patterns. These cells are often clonally expanded, their clones appear universally distributed among all sampled organs, and form lineages with an excess of cells of the same type. Collectively, our findings show the limits of peripheral blood monitoring of the immune repertoire, and provide a probabilistic model of the dynamics of antibody memory formation in humans.",

          "abstract": "Sperm IZUMO1 binds to egg JUNO, and this interaction is essential for mammalian fertilization. Isolated from a female mouse immunized with syngeneic sperm, the antisperm antibody OBF13 recognizes IZUMO1 and inhibits murine fertilization. How OBF13 interferes with sperm–egg interactions was unknown. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of IZUMO1 in complex with OBF13. OBF13 binds to the apex of the four-helix domain of IZUMO1, distant from the JUNO-binding site. Our crystal structure of OBF13-bound IZUMO1 resembles apo-IZUMO1 and differs from the structure of IZUMO1 in complex with JUNO. We identify that OBF13 carries a low level of somatic hypermutation, and through deep mutational scanning, we engineer an affinity-enhanced OBF13 variant. This OBF13 variant single-chain fragment variable decreases the apparent affinity of IZUMO1 for membrane-bound murine JUNO and blocks the binding of acrosome-reacted sperm to eggs, thereby preventing fertilization. We propose allostery between the OBF13 epitope and the JUNO-binding site. OBF13 inhibits a conformational change in IZUMO1, preventing fusion-competent sperm from adhering to murine eggs during fertilization. Surprisingly, murine IZUMO1 binds to hamster JUNO with an affinity ~20-fold higher than to murine JUNO. The decreased affinity caused by OBF13 of murine IZUMO1 for hamster JUNO is sufficient for murine sperm to bind to and fuse with hamster eggs. Our studies provide a structural and mechanistic framework for species-specific, allosteric inhibition of IZUMO1 by a naturally occurring antisperm antibody and offer insights into the development of immunocontraceptives.",

Activity levels of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, gauged by a live biosensor, predict cell cycle entry, and optogenetic ERK activation regulates cell cycling dynamics. As development proceeds, rates of peridermal cell proliferation decrease, and ERK activity becomes more pulsatile and functionally transitions to promote hypertrophic cell growth.

Knocking out OsWRKY36 causes elevated lignin biosynthesis and increased sclerenchyma thickness of leaf sheath, leading to enhanced resistance to multiple pests and pathogens.

Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are then trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A nonlinear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, which features two nondimensional numbers representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate, and two additional parameters representing simultaneous freezing and nucleation treated as the initial condition. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of these bubbles have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation and that most bubbles can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This method enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical “ice worms,” well known to glaciologists.",

Here, we identify and characterize a lncRNA, TRIM28 Interacting DNA damage repair Enhancing Noncoding Transcript ( TRIDENT ), whose expression is induced upon epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, and which exerts pro-oncogenic functions in EGFR-driven non–small cell lung cancer. Knocking down TRIDENT leads to decreased tumor-cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo model systems and induces sensitization to chemotherapeutic drugs. Using ChIRP-MS analysis we identified TRIM28 as a protein interactor of TRIDENT . TRIDENT promotes phosphorylation of TRIM28 and knocking down TRIDENT leads to accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells via decreased TRIM28 phosphorylation. Altogether, our results reveal a molecular pathway in which TRIDENT regulates TRIM28 phosphorylation to promote tumor cell growth and drug resistance. Our findings suggest that TRIDENT can be developed as a biomarker or therapeutic target for EGFR mutant non–small cell lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "Identifying conserved mechanisms used by viruses to delay host innate responses can reveal potential targets for antiviral therapeutics. Here, we investigated coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), which encodes a highly conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU). EndoU functions as an immune antagonist by limiting the accumulation of viral replication intermediates that would otherwise be sensed by the host. Despite being a promising antiviral target, it has been difficult to develop small-molecule inhibitors that target the EndoU active site. We generated nsp15 mutants of the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 and identified conserved residues within the amino-terminal domain that are required for EndoU activity. Loss of EndoU activity caused the activation of host sensors, which limited viral replication in interferon-responsive cells and attenuated disease in MHV-infected mice. Using transcriptional profiling, we found that MHV EndoU mutant viruses upregulate multiple host sensors, including Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). We found that nsp15 mutants induced early, robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis. EndoU mutant viruses also induced ZBP1-independent apoptosis and pyroptosis pathways, causing early, robust cell death that limits virus replication and pathogenesis. Overall, we document the importance of the amino-terminal domain for EndoU function. We also highlight the importance of nsp15/EndoU activity for evading host sensors, delaying cell death, and promoting pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Viruses have evolved unique strategies to circumvent host control of protein synthesis and enable viral protein synthesis in the face of the host response. Defining the factors that regulate viral messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is thus critical to understand how viruses replicate and cause disease. To identify factors that might regulate viral mRNA translation, we developed a technique for identifying proteins associated with a native RNA expressed from its endogenous promoter and genomic locus. This approach uses a guide RNA to target dCas13b fused to a biotin ligase domain to a specific RNA, where it covalently labels proteins in close proximity. Using this approach, we identified multiple proteins associated with transcripts encoding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins and found that several associated proteins positively or negatively regulate HCMV replication. We confirmed that one such protein, the cellular Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), binds to HCMV immediate early mRNAs and is required for efficient viral protein expression and virus replication. Ablating YBX1 expression reduced the association of HCMV immediate early mRNAs with polysomes, demonstrating a role for YBX1 as a positive regulator of viral RNA translation. These results provide a powerful tool for unraveling RNA–protein interactions that can be used in a wide range of biological processes and reveal a role for YBX1 as a critical regulator of HCMV immediate early gene expression.",

          "abstract": "Planets are often covered with thin cracked shells. From mud films to lithospheres of rock or ice, fracture networks form two-dimensional (2D) tessellations of convex polygons whose geometry encodes their genesis. Here, we chart the geometry of 2D fracture mosaics across the solar system, and decode their formative conditions using a new dynamical crack model. We show that mosaics can be projected onto a Symbolic Ternary Diagram, where the relative proportions of “T,” “X,” and “Y” junctions are uniquely related to contributions from distinct modes of fracture. Most planetary mosaics cluster in a region associated with hierarchical fracture networks, where sequential cracking favors formation of T junctions. Exceptions to this rule may betray the presence of water. Europa’s fracture networks stand apart due to the predominance of X junctions; this is a special feature of ice, where healing of cracks by refreezing of water allows new fractures to overprint older ones. Several fracture networks on Mars appear as outliers due to the high proportion of Y junctions. These patterns—previously interpreted as ancient mudcracks and frozen polar terrain, based on geological evidence—are consistent with the twisting of crack junctions by cyclic volume change. Our findings suggest that counting cracks could aid in the identification of other water-influenced planetary environments.",

          "abstract": "Bdelloid rotifers are well known for their abilities to survive long periods of freezing as well as acquire foreign genes. Recently sequenced genomes of some bdelloid rotifers in England were found to encode several proteins similar to ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that are usually associated with freeze–thaw tolerance. Here, I describe bdelloid rotifers inhabiting an algal patch in Antarctica that have multiple homologs of these genes. Structures of the proteins predicted by AlphaFold show that they are well designed for ice-binding and a recombinant protein made for one of them showed strong ice-binding activity. The existence of multiple copies of these proteins is another characteristic of IBPs. Furthermore, multiple bdelloid rotifers in the algal patch were revived in less than an hour after storage at −25 °C for 24 y, an apparent record for laboratory-controlled studies. Several characteristics of these genes point to bacteria as their source: sequence homology, absence of introns, and a structural peculiarity so far found only in bacteria. The remarkable freezing tolerance of bdelloid rotifers can thus be at least partially attributed to horizontally acquired bacterial genes encoding IBPs.",

          "abstract": "Oscillations of conductance observed in strong magnetic fields are a striking manifestation of the quantum dynamics of charge carriers in solids. The large charge carrier density in typical metals sets the scale of oscillations in both electrical and thermal conductivity, which characterize the Fermi surface. In semimetals, thermal transport at low-charge carrier density is expected to be phonon dominated, yet several experiments observe giant quantum oscillations in thermal transport. This raises the question of whether there is an overarching mechanism leading to sizable oscillations that survives in phonon-dominated semimetals. In this work, we show that such a mechanism exists. It relies on the peculiar phase-space allowed for phonon scattering by electrons when only a few Landau levels are filled. Our measurements on the Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 support this counterintuitive mechanism through observation of pronounced thermal quantum oscillations, since they occur in similar magnitude and phase in directions parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Our phase-space argument applies to all low-density semimetals, topological or not, including graphene and bismuth. Our work illustrates that phonon absorption can be leveraged to reveal degrees of freedom through their imprint on longitudinal thermal transport.",

Using these images, we next collected 1.87 million triplet similarity judgments and used a computational model to derive a set of sparse, positive dimensions underlying these judgments. The resulting multidimensional embedding space predicted independent material similarity judgments and the similarity matrix of all images close to the human intersubject consistency. We found that representations of individual images were captured by a combination of 36 material dimensions that were highly reproducible and interpretable, comprising perceptual (e.g., grainy, blue) as well as conceptual (e.g., mineral, viscous) dimensions.

          "abstract": "Removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft is vital for proper function of the brain. Excitatory amino acid transporters mediate this process by uptaking the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft back to the cell after its release. The archaeal homolog, Glt Ph , an aspartate transporter from Pyrococcus horikoshii , presents the best structurally characterized model for this family of transporters. In order to transport, Glt Ph undergoes elevator-like conformational changes between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states. Here, we characterize, at an atomic level, the OF⇌IF transition of Glt Ph in different apo /bound states using a combination of ensemble-based enhanced sampling techniques, employing more than two thousand of coupled simulation replicas of membrane-embedded Glt Ph . The resulting free-energy profiles portray the transition of apo /bound states as a complex four-stage process, while sodium binding alone locks the structure in one of its states. Along the transition, the transport domain (TD) disengages from the scaffold domain (SD), allowing it to move as a piston sliding vertically with respect to the membrane during the elevator-like motion of TD. Lipid interactions with residues comprising the SD–TD interface directly influence the large-scale conformational changes and, consequently, the energetics of transport. Structural intermediates formed during the transition leak water molecules and may correlate to the uncoupled Cl − ion conductance observed experimentally in both prokaryotic and mammalian glutamate transporters. Mechanistic insights obtained from our study provide a structural framework for better development of therapeutic for neurological disorders.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase elongates telomeres to maintain chromosome stability in most eukaryotes. Despite extensive studies across eukaryotic kingdoms, the telomerase holoenzyme in arthropods remains poorly understood. In this study, we purify the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex from the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and identify a copurified 135-nucleotide telomerase RNA (TR) component. This miniature S. frugiperda TR (sfTR), the smallest TR known to date, retains a universal pseudoknot structure and a structurally defined template. Despite its small size, sfTR assembles with the recombinant S. frugiperda telomerase reverse transcriptase (sfTERT) protein in vivo to reconstitute telomerase activity for the synthesis of insect telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGG)n. The sfTR gene, like other animal TR genes, features an snRNA-type RNA polymerase II promoter. Uniquely, the sfTR transcript harbors a 5′-7-methylguanosine (M 7 G) cap, as opposed to the more typical snRNA-type 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap. The difference in 5′-cap is likely because sfTR lacks the H/ACA snoRNA biogenesis domain necessary for cap hypermethylation. Moreover, sfTR also lacks the CR4/5 regulatory domain that is indispensable in vertebrate TRs for telomerase activity. This degenerate sfTR complements an enigmatic sfTERT that is missing certain telomerase-specific elements yet catalytically active in the absence of sfTR. Thus, insects have evolved a simplified telomerase, consisting of a small noncoding RNA that retains only minimal attributes essential for telomerase function. The simplified insect telomerase demonstrates a plausible evolutionary pathway for the emergence of telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, arising from an ancient reverse transcriptase associated with a simple templating RNA component in early eukaryotes.",

In this study, we first identified a biomimetic solvent to generate triclinic monohydrate crystals, while avoiding the formation of nonphysiological solvates and enabling crystallization at rates where the dynamics of surface growth could be captured in real time. Using a binary mixture of water and isopropanol, with the latter serving as a surrogate for lipids in physiological environments, we show that cholesterol monohydrate crystals grow classically by the nucleation and spreading of crystal layers. Time-resolved imaging confirms that layers are generated by dislocations and monomers incorporate into advancing steps after diffusion along the crystal surface and not directly from the solution. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidics measurements concertedly reveal abundant macrosteps, which engender a self-inhibition mechanism that reduces the rate of crystal growth. This finding stands in contrast to numerous other systems, in which classical mechanisms lead to unhindered growth by spreading of single layers.",

We recently demonstrated that human B cell responses to membrane-associated but not to soluble antigens in vitro depended on the expression and activity of the plasma membrane mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1. Here, we provide evidence that the efficacy of the current human papillomavirus virus-like particle (HPV VLP) vaccines may be due in part to their inherent ability to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane presentation of antigens to B cells. We compared HPV-specific human B cell responses to HPV VLPs versus soluble HPV pentameric capsomeres and showed that although both induced calcium responses, only HPV VLP-induced responses were blocked by Piezo1 inhibitors. The kinetics of internalization of HPV-VLP and capsomeres into HPV-specific B cells were similar and neither required Piezo1 function as shown by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Piezo. However, trafficking of HPV-VLPs into intracellular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) + antigen-processing compartments was Piezo1-dependent, whereas trafficking of capsomeres was not. In addition, a time course of intracellular trafficking suggested that colocalization of HPV-VLP with MHC classII was more stable over time as compared to capsomeres. Taken together these findings suggest that the ability of HPV-VLP vaccines to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane antigen presentation may be exploited in the design of highly effective human vaccines.",

Using the canopy height metrics products from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a space-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument specifically designed to characterize forest structure, we analyze the environmental correlates of spatial variation of global tropical forest canopy height. Our study demonstrates that climate, topography, and soil properties account for 75% of the variation in tropical forest canopy height. Elevation, dry season length, and solar radiation are the most important drivers in determining canopy height both locally and regionally.

          "abstract": "Secreted mucins are multimegadalton glycoprotein polymers that share the function of protecting mucosal tissues but diversified for activities in different organs of the body. Structural studies of secreted mucins are complicated by the enormous sizes, flexibility, and complex supramolecular assembly modes of these glycoproteins. The two major respiratory mucins are MUC5AC and MUC5B. Here, we present structures of a large amino-terminal segment of MUC5AC in the form of helical filaments. These filaments differ from filamentous and tubular structures observed previously for the intestinal mucin MUC2 and the partial mucin homolog VWF. Nevertheless, the MUC5AC helical filaments support the proposed mechanism, based on MUC2 and VWF, for how noncovalent interactions between mucin monomers guide disulfide crosslinking to form polymers. The high-resolution MUC5AC structures show how local and limited changes in amino acid sequence can profoundly affect higher-order assembly while preserving the overall folds and polymerization activity of mucin glycoproteins. Differences in supramolecular assembly are likely to be functionally significant considering the divergence of mechanical properties and physiological requirements between respiratory and intestinal mucins. Determining the high-resolution structures of respiratory mucins provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which they clean and protect the lungs. Moreover, the MUC5AC structure enables visualization of the sites of human amino acid sequence variation and disease-associated mutations.",

          "abstract": "Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, manifests as progressive muscle weakness and peripheral nerve defects. Dominant mutations in DNM2 , encoding the large GTPase dynamin 2, result in CMT without any suggested therapeutic strategy. Different dominant mutations in DNM2 also cause centronuclear myopathy (CNM), and increasing BIN1 (amphiphysin 2), an endogenous modulator of DNM2, rescued CNM in mice. Here, we found that increasing BIN1 level exacerbated the phenotypes of the Dnm2 K562E/+ mouse carrying the most common DNM2 -CMT mutation. Conversely, whole-body reduction of Bin1 expression level, through the generation of Dnm2 K562E/+ mice with heterozygous loss of BIN1, restored motor performance and ameliorated muscle organization and structural defects of peripheral nerves. The rescue of motor defects was maintained at least up to 1 y of age. BIN1 inhibited the GTPase activity of DNM2, and the rescue was driven by an increased activity of the K562E DNM2 -CMT mutant, and a normalization of integrin localization in muscle. Overall, this study highlights BIN1 as a modifier of DNM2 -CMT, and its reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy. It also revealed an opposite pathological mechanism and inverse therapeutic concepts for DNM2 -CMT peripheral neuropathy versus DNM2 -CNM myopathy.",

          "abstract": "Broadband pump–probe spectroscopy has been widely used to measure vibrational decoherence associated with the reaction coordinate in photoinduced ultrafast vibration-coupled electron transfer (VCET) reactions. These experiments provide insight into the interplay of intramolecular coordinates along the reaction coordinate. However, a general theoretical foundation for analyzing, and even for explaining rigorously, these data is lacking. In this work, we study vibrational decoherence in a model VCET reaction using the nearly exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulation method. We explore how analyzing the density matrix with quantum information measures can help elucidate the evolution of vibrational coherence in simulations of dynamics. We examine how vibrational coherence is affected by electron transfer on the timescale of approximately 100 femtoseconds. Our results suggest that electron transfer, in the nonadiabatic model, changes the vibrational equilibrium position abruptly—an example of a “quantum quench” event. This explains the concomitant vibrational decoherence. We find that abrupt vibrational decoherence can be mitigated by wavepacket motion occurring on the timescale of the electron transfer.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 30% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) via accumulating gene mutations. Genomic analyses reveal a complex interplay among mutant genes, with co-occurring and mutually exclusive patterns. Hyperactivation of c-MYB and deficiency of PU.1 have been linked to myeloid disorders. We report a case of AML with concurrent PU.1 and c-MYB mutations, exhibiting early onset, high blast count, chemo-resistance, indicating high-risk features, along with elevated Pelger–Huët anomaly (PHA). However, the synergistic mechanism of c-MYB and PU.1 in sAML remains unclear. Using c-Myb-hyperactivation and Pu.1-deficient double-strain ( c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D ) zebrafish, we investigated MDS/sAML progression. Surprisingly, the double mutant exhibited a distinct type of neutrophil resembling clinical PHA cells and demonstrated a higher rate of MDS/sAML transformation. Further expression analysis revealed reduced lmnb1 expression in double-mutant zebrafish. Knockdown of lmnb1 resulted in PHA and increased blast cells, while overexpression of lmnb1 in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D reduced PHA cell level. This suggests that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency synergistically reduce lmnb1 expression, inducing the development of PHA-like neutrophils and promoting MDS/sAML progression in zebrafish. Moreover, coadministration of cell cycle inhibitor cytarabine (Ara-C) and the differential inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could effectively relieve the neutrophil expansion and PHA symptoms in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D zebrafish. Our findings revealed that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency played a synergistic role in sAML development and suggests a phenotypic association between the emergence of PH-like cells and the transformation to sAML. Furthermore, c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D zebrafish might serve as a suitable sAML model for drug screening.",

          "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11 , e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer’s disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22 , 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation is a critical determinant of the diversification, persistence, and geographic range limits of species. Yet the genetic basis of adaptation is often unknown and potentially underpinned by a wide range of mutational types—from single nucleotide changes to large-scale alterations of chromosome structure. Copy number variation (CNV) is thought to be an important source of adaptive genetic variation, as indicated by decades of candidate gene studies that point to CNVs underlying rapid adaptation to strong selective pressures. Nevertheless, population-genomic studies of CNVs face unique logistical challenges not encountered by other forms of genetic variation. Consequently, few studies have systematically investigated the contributions of CNVs to adaptation at a genome-wide scale. We present a genome-wide analysis of CNV contributing to the adaptation of an invasive weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia . CNVs show clear signatures of parallel local adaptation between North American (native) and European (invaded) ranges, implying widespread reuse of CNVs during adaptation to shared heterogeneous patterns of selection. We used a local principal component analysis (PCA) to genotype CNV regions in whole-genome sequences of samples collected over the last two centuries. We identified 16 large CNV regions of up to 11.85 megabases in length, eight of which show signals of rapid evolutionary change, with pronounced frequency shifts between historic and modern populations. Our results provide compelling genome-wide evidence that CNV underlies rapid adaptation over contemporary timescales of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is a robust, impermeable barrier that excludes many classes of antibiotics. Contrary to the classical model of an asymmetric lipid bilayer, recent evidence suggests the OM is predominantly an asymmetric proteolipid membrane (APLM). Outer leaflet lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that surround integral β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are shared with other OMPs to form a supramolecular network in which the levels of OMPs approach those of LPS. Some of the most abundant OMPs in the Escherichia coli OM are trimeric porins. How porins and LPS are incorporated into the OM of growing bacteria is poorly understood. Here, we use live-cell imaging and microfluidics to investigate how LPS, labeled using click chemistry, and the porin OmpF, labeled using the bacteriocin colicin N, are incorporated into the E. coli OM. Diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy shows OmpF and LPS to be uniformly distributed and immobile. However, clustering of both macromolecules becomes evident by superresolution microscopy, which is also the case for their biogenesis proteins, BamA and LptD, respectively. Notwithstanding these common organizational features, OmpF insertion into the OM is cell-cycle-dependent leading to binary partitioning and strong polar accumulation of old OmpF. Old LPS on the other hand is diluted ~50% at each division cycle by new LPS, resulting in only mild polar accumulation of preexisting LPS. We conclude that although LPS and OMPs are destined to form the APLM their insertion dynamics are fundamentally different, which has major implications for understanding how the OM is assembled.",

          "abstract": "Molecular-level understanding of the early stage of crystallization remains a significant challenge. For a wide range of fundamental research and applications, it is of great importance to understand the mechanism of crystal polymorph selections in different solvents or in the presence of additives. We studied glycine crystallization in aqueous solution with or without the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), one crystal nucleation at a time, using the recently developed single-crystal nucleation spectroscopy (SCNS). It has been reported that glycine forms γ-glycine when salt is added to aqueous solution, and the mechanism has been considered as a classical nucleation where γ-glycine forms directly as a crystal nucleus. Our study shows that metastable polymorph β-glycine forms first in aqueous solution both with or without NaCl through a nonclassical nucleation pathway. NaCl can stabilize the metastable β-glycine over several hours and also prevent it from converting to α-glycine. Eventually γ-glycine nucleates on the surface of β-glycine and then grows while dissolving the mother β-glycine. The crystal habit of β-glycine suggests that the stabilization by NaCl occurs at its polar face. SCNS provides crucial information to accelerate the investigation of the early stage of crystallization toward the rational control of polymorphisms.",

          "abstract": "The continued emergence of antimalarial drug resistance highlights the need to develop new antimalarial therapies. Unfortunately, new drug development is often hampered by undesirable drug-like properties of lead compounds. Prodrug approaches temporarily mask undesirable compound features, improving bioavailability and target penetration. We have found that lipophilic diester prodrugs of phosphonic acid antibiotics, such as fosmidomycin (Fsm), exhibit significantly higher antimalarial potency than their parent compounds [R.L. Edwards et al. , Sci. Rep. 7 , 8400 (2017)]. However, the activating enzymes for these prodrugs were unknown. Here, we show that an erythrocyte enzyme, acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), is the major activating enzyme of multiple lipophilic ester prodrugs. Surprisingly, this enzyme is taken up by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , where it localizes to the parasite cytoplasm and retains enzymatic activity. Using a fluorogenic ester library, we characterize the structure–activity relationship of APEH and compare it to that of P. falciparum esterases. We show that parasite-internalized APEH plays an important role in the activation of substrates with branching at the alpha carbon, in keeping with its exopeptidase activity. Our findings highlight a mechanism for antimicrobial prodrug activation, relying on a host-derived enzyme to yield activation at a microbial target. Mutations in prodrug-activating enzymes are a common mechanism for antimicrobial drug resistance [E. S. Istvan et al. , Nat. Commun. 8 , 14240 (2017); K. M. V.

Despite the development of various distinct probes that enable super-resolved stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging of mitochondria in live cells, most of these membrane-potential-dependent fluorophores cannot be retained well in mitochondria after chemical fixation. This lack of suitable mitochondrial probes has limited STED imaging of mitochondria to live cell samples. In this study, we introduce a mitochondria-specific probe, PK Mito Orange FX (PKMO FX), which features a fixation-driven cross-linking motif and accumulates in the mitochondrial inner membrane. It exhibits high fluorescence retention after chemical fixation and efficient depletion at 775 nm, enabling nanoscopic imaging both before and after aldehyde fixation. We demonstrate the compatibility of this probe with conventional immunolabeling and other strategies commonly used for fluorescence labeling of fixed samples. Moreover, we show that PKMO FX facilitates correlative super-resolution light and electron microscopy, enabling the correlation of multicolor fluorescence images and transmission EM images via the characteristic mitochondrial pattern.

The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.",

Pinched hysteresis I-V loop curve, scan rate dependency, and distinctive impedance spectra confirmed the memristive characteristics of the as-prepared device. Moreover, the memory mechanism was discussed theoretically and validated by finite-element modeling. The ISM features multiple neuromorphic functions, such as paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and learning–experience behavior. More importantly, the ion selectivity of the ISM was observed, which allowed further emulation of ion-selective neural functions like resting membrane potential. Benefiting from the structural similarity to membrane-embedded ion channels, the ISM opens the door for ion-based neuromorphic computing and sophisticated chemical regulation by manipulating multifarious ions with neuromorphic functions.",

A critical parameter affecting the function of these molecules is the thermal half-life of the light state. Reports in the literature indicate that, in some cases, a binding partner can significantly influence the thermal half-life, while in other cases it has no effect. Here, we present a unifying framework for quantitatively analyzing the effects of binding partners on thermal reversion rates. We focus on photoswitchable protein/binder interactions involving LOV domains, photoactive yellow protein, and CBCR GAF domains with partners that bind either the light or the dark state of the photoswitchable domain. We show that the effect of a binding partner depends on the extent to which the transition state for reversion resembles the dark state or the light state. We quantify this resemblance with a ϕ switching value, where ϕ switching = 1 if the conformation of the part of the photoswitchable molecule that interacts with the binding partner closely resembles its dark state conformation and ϕ switching = 0 if it resembles its light state. In addition to providing information on the transition state for switching, this analysis can guide the design of photoswitchable systems that retain useful thermal half-lives in practice. The analysis also provides a basis for the use of simple kinetic measurements to determine effective changes in affinity even in complex milieu.",

High-throughput and AI-driven screens have the potential to identify drugs and downstream pathways that modulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Here, we developed LogiRx, a logic-based mechanistic machine learning method that predicts drug-induced pathways. We applied LogiRx to discover how drugs discovered in a previous compound screen attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We experimentally validated LogiRx predictions in neonatal cardiomyocytes, adult mice, and two patient databases. Using LogiRx, we predicted antihypertrophic pathways for seven drugs currently used to treat noncardiac disease. We experimentally validated that escitalopram (Lexapro) and mifepristone inhibit hypertrophy of cultured cardiomyocytes in two contexts. The LogiRx model predicted that escitalopram prevents hypertrophy through an “off-target” serotonin receptor/PI3Kγ pathway, mechanistically validated using additional investigational drugs. Further, escitalopram reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a mouse model of hypertrophy and fibrosis. Finally, mining of both FDA and University of Virginia databases showed that patients with depression on escitalopram have a lower incidence of cardiac hypertrophy than those prescribed other serotonin reuptake inhibitors that do not target the serotonin receptor. Mechanistic machine learning by LogiRx discovers drug pathways that perturb cell states, which may enable repurposing of escitalopram and other drugs to limit cardiac remodeling through off-target pathways.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material’s morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalizes puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.",

To date, recessive genotypes (RGs) have commonly been implicated through anecdotal ascertainment of consanguineous families and candidate gene-based analysis; the recessive contribution to the broad range of CHD phenotypes has been limited. We analyzed whole exome sequences of 5,424 CHD probands. Rare damaging RGs were estimated to contribute to at least 2.2% of CHD, with greater enrichment among laterality phenotypes (5.4%) versus other subsets (1.4%). Among 108 curated human recessive CHD genes, there were 66 RGs, with 54 in 11 genes with &gt;1 RG, 12 genes with 1 RG, and 85 genes with zero. RGs were more prevalent among offspring of consanguineous union (4.7%, 32/675) than among nonconsanguineous probands (0.7%, 34/4749). Founder variants in GDF1 and PLD1 accounted for 74% of the contribution of RGs among 410 Ashkenazi Jewish probands. We identified genome-wide significant enrichment of RGs in C1orf127 , encoding a likely secreted protein expressed in embryonic mouse notochord and associated with laterality defects. Single-cell transcriptomes from gastrulation-stage mouse embryos revealed enrichment of RGs in genes highly expressed in the cardiomyocyte lineage, including contractility-related genes MYH6, UNC45B , MYO18B , and MYBPC3 in probands with left-sided CHD, consistent with abnormal contractile function contributing to these malformations. Genes with significant RG burden account for 1.3% of probands, more than half the inferred total. These results reveal the recessive contribution to CHD, and indicate that many genes remain to be discovered, with each likely accounting for a very small fraction of the total.",

Here, we integrate human brain and physiological data to investigate underlying mechanisms. Functional MRI analyses across four large datasets (totaling 19,300 participants) show that brain networks not only destabilize throughout the lifetime but do so along a nonlinear trajectory, with consistent temporal “landmarks” of brain aging starting in midlife (40s). Comparison of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers implicate dysregulated glucose homeostasis as the driver mechanism for these transitions. Correlation between the brain’s regionally heterogeneous patterns of aging and gene expression further supports these findings, selectively implicating GLUT4 (insulin-dependent glucose transporter) and APOE (lipid transport protein). Notably, MCT2 (a neuronal, but not glial, ketone transporter) emerges as a potential counteracting factor by facilitating neurons’ energy uptake independently of insulin. Consistent with these results, an interventional study of 101 participants shows that ketones exhibit robust effects in restabilizing brain networks, maximized from ages 40 to 60, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for early metabolic intervention.",

          "abstract": "The recently identified histone modification lysine lactylation can be stimulated by L-lactate and glycolysis. Although the chemical group added upon lysine lactylation was originally proposed to be the L-enantiomer of lactate (K L-la ), two isomeric modifications, lysine D-lactylation (K D-la ) and N-ε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (K ce ), also exist in cells, with their precursors being metabolites of glycolysis. The dynamic regulation and differences among these three modifications in response to hypoxia remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that intracellular K L-la , but not K D-la or K ce , is up-regulated in response to hypoxia. Depletion of glyoxalase enzymes, GLO1 and GLO2, had minimal impact on K D-la , K ce , or hypoxia-induced K L-la . Conversely, blocking glycolytic flux to L-lactate under hypoxic conditions by knocking out lactate dehydrogenase A/B completely abolished the induction of K L-la but increased K D-la and K ce . We further observed a correlation between the level of K L-la and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression under hypoxic conditions and when small molecules were used to stabilize HIF-1α in the normoxia condition. Our result demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between HIF-1α and K L-la in lung cancer tissues and that patient samples with higher grade tend to have higher K L-la levels. Using a proteomics approach, we quantified 66 K L-la sites that were up-regulated by hypoxia and demonstrated that p300/CBP contributes to hypoxia-induced K L-la . Collectively, our study demonstrates that K L-la , rather than K D-la or K ce , is the prevailing lysine lactylation in response to hypoxia. Our results therefore demonstrate a link between K L-la and the hypoxia-induced adaptation of tumor cells.",

          "abstract": "Optimal activation of CD8+ T cells is crucial for immunity-mediated destruction of cancer, requiring a substantial amount of proteins involved in metabolism, proliferation, and effector function. Despite extensive studies emphasizing the role of transcriptional regulation in this process, paired transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that the RNA profile is poorly correlated with protein levels. This discrepancy underscores the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in controlling protein abundance during activation. However, the impact of PTMs on the CD8+ T cell protein dynamic remains underexplored. We identify that neddylation, a recently discovered PTM, is activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enriched in effector CD8+ T cells from colon cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found the rate-limiting enzyme of neddylation, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), is induced by the NFATc1, a critical transcription factor downstream of TCR signaling. Our observation revealed that genetic ablation of NAE1 significantly disturbed the proteomic landscape related to activation and mitochondrial function. As a result, CD8+ T cells lacking NAE1 exhibited severely compromised activation, proliferation, and survival, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function. Consistently, deletion of NAE1 in CD8+ T cells abolished their antitumor function and promoted tumor progression. By contrast, the overexpression of NAE1 significantly improved the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Overall, we uncovered neddylation, a previously underappreciated PTM, as a proteomic checkpoint for CD8+ T cell activation. Enforced expression of NAE1 offers promising therapeutic potential for boosting the antitumor CD8+ T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the most abundant cell type in the artery’s media layer and regulate vascular tone and lesion remodeling during atherogenesis. Like monocyte-derived macrophages, VSMCs accumulate excess lipids and contribute to the total intimal foam cell population in human coronary plaques and mouse aortic atheroma. While there are extensive studies characterizing the contribution of lipid metabolism in macrophage immunometabolic responses in atherosclerotic plaques, the role of VSMC lipid metabolism in regulating vascular function and lesion remodeling in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway in VSMC is continuously activated during atherogenesis. Notably, we found that LXR deficiency in SMCs under hypercholesterolemic conditions influenced lesion remodeling by altering the fate of dedifferentiated SMCs and promoting the accumulation of VSMC-derived transitional cells. This phenotypic switching was accompanied by reduced indices of plaque stability, characterized by a larger necrotic core area and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Moreover, SMC-specific LXR deficiency impaired vascular function and caused visceral myopathy characterized by maladaptive bladder remodeling and gut lipid malabsorption. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux and FA synthesis including Abca1 , Srebf1 , Scd1 , Scd2 , Acsl3, and Mid1ip1 was downregulated in mice lacking LXRαβ in SMCs, likely contributing to the phenotypic switching of VSMC in the atherosclerotic lesions.",

But how is the rolling affected if these shapes are irregular or random? Treating the terminal rolling speed as an order parameter, we show that there are qualitative transitions in the speed as a function of the dimension of the state space and inertia. We calculate the scaling exponents and the macroscopic lag time associated with the presence of first- and second-order transitions and describe the regimes of coexistence of stable states and the accompanying hysteresis. Experiments with rolling cylinders corroborate our theoretical results on the scaling of the lag time. Experiments with spheres reveal closed orbits and their period-doubling in the overdamped and inertial limits, respectively, providing visible manifestations of the hairy ball theorem and the doubly connected nature of S O ( 3 ) , the space of 3D rotations. Going beyond simple curiosity, our study might shed light on a number of natural and artificial systems that involve the rolling of irregular objects, ranging from nanoscale cellular transport to robotics.",

In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this nonmotility activity affects the structure, dynamic, and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena.

          "abstract": "Positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)RNA] viruses constitute more than one-third of all virus genera, including numerous pathogens of clinical significance. All (+)RNA viruses reorganize cellular membranes from organelles to establish replication compartments (RCs). These RCs are thought to form a platform for membrane-associated replicases, in addition to protecting the viral RNAs from cytosolic innate immune signaling and RNA-degradation machinery. Previous work demonstrated that three families of (+)RNA viruses, namely Bromoviridae , Picornaviridae , and Flaviviridae , commonly induce the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) at their RCs. This phenomenon suggests a potential avenue for a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy targeting PC metabolism. Our study elucidates three key observations: i) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prompts the relocalization of CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, to the RCs; ii) the enhancement of PC synthesis is contingent upon the protease activity of the NS3/4A protein; and iii) utilizing click chemistry, we demonstrate that HCV infection stimulates de novo PC synthesis at the viral replication site through the Kennedy pathway. These findings provide significant insights into the manipulation of lipid metabolism by HCV during RC formation, a mechanism likely conserved across various (+)RNA virus families.",

A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C.

We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.",

We uncover erucamide as a previously unknown phytoalexin of both dicots and monocots that blocks the T3SS function of multiple bacterial pathogens. Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance. This work reveals a plant chemical defense that targets major virulence machinery in bacterial pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Inferring cellular and molecular dynamics of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from postmortem tissue collected decades after onset is challenging. Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density–weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.",

          "abstract": "Materials functionalities may be associated with atomic-level structural dynamics occurring on the millisecond timescale. However, the capability of electron microscopy to image structures with high spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution is often limited by poor signal-to-noise ratios. With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with in situ electron microscopy greatly improves spatiotemporal characterization, opening a new window for the exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis is crucial for health, with dysregulation leading to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This study identifies alkylation repair homolog protein 5 (ALKBH5), an RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase, as a major regulator in metabolic disease. ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential. This study unveils a regulatory mechanism wherein ALKBH5 orchestrates glucose and lipid homeostasis by integrating the GCGR and mTORC1 pathways, providing insight into the regulation of metabolic diseases.",

Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the “tragedy of the commons” perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources.

In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism, used by multiple phytopathogenic fungi, that manipulates the highly conserved plant phosphate sensing pathway to exacerbate disease.",

Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.",

We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.",

Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.",

However, a partial decoupling of internal molecular motion from external degrees of freedom can reveal striking interference effects despite significant momentum exchange between the molecule and the bath of surface vibrations. We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.",

If accurate, such age-driven skill losses pose a major threat to the human capital of societies with rapidly aging populations. We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in literacy and numeracy skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Our empirical approach separates age from cohort effects and corrects for measurement error from reversion to the mean. Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy.",

First, although women today report higher levels of life satisfaction and overall happiness than men, they experience worse outcomes in mental health and negative affect. Second, despite substantial advances in women’s social and economic status over the past 50 years, their well-being relative to men has declined. We explore the evidence supporting these paradoxes, considering potential explanations related to differential expectations, biology, and scale use. Using global data from 2006 to 2023 and long-term data from Europe and the US since the 1970s, we provide empirical illustrations. These findings reveal a diverse and seemingly inconsistent pattern of gender well-being gaps between countries, suggesting that the first paradox is not universally applicable. However, there is clear global evidence of a relative decline in women’s well-being, particularly in terms of negative affect.",

In contrast, neurobiological circuits can function while simultaneously adapting to changing conditions. Here, we present a brain-inspired Super-Turing AI model based on a synaptic resistor circuit, capable of concurrent real-time inference and learning. Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO materials was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks.

In vitro validation revealed a 94.4% success rate, with two candidates demonstrating exceptional antibacterial efficacy, minimal hemotoxicity, stability in human plasma, and low potential to induce resistance, as evidenced by significant bacterial load reduction in murine lung infection experiments. The entire process, from design to validation, concluded in 48 days. AMP-Designer excels in creating AMPs targeting specific strains despite limited data availability, with a top candidate displaying a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2.0 micrograms per milliliter against Propionibacterium acnes .

As a steroid hormone, progesterone is thought to modify uterine and placental morphology by altering gene expression, but another direct mode of action has long been suspected. Here, we reveal the nongenomic molecular mechanism of progesterone as the activation of human and murine inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1, which is expressed in myometrium and placental pericytes during late gestation. Kir7.1 is also activated by selective steroids, including those used to prevent premature labor, such as 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and dydrogesterone, revealing their unexpected mode of action. Our results reveal that Kir7.1 is the molecular target of both endogenous and synthetic steroids that control uterine excitability and placental function. Kir7.1, therefore, is a promising therapeutic target to support healthy pregnancy during mid and late gestation.",

We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations. Our study highlights CF’s major role in modulating epithelial structure and OR expression, shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to olfactory loss in CF.",

We directly observe that PS based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately −55 kHz. After accounting for this PS shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of 276,764,094,712.45 ± 0.86 kHz for the 2 3 S 1 − 2 3 P 0 transition. Combining this result with existing data for 3 He, we derive a value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, which shows a σ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.",

High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses.",

DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy cooperating with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes it regulates the activation of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1’s functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a molecular relay in which AFPs’ genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status. This work offers a molecular understanding of how plants fine-tune germination timing, while preserving seed responsiveness to adverse environmental cues, and thus represents a milestone in the realm of conservation and breeding programs.",

Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.",

          "abstract": "Defective apoptosis mediated by B cell lymphoma 2 antagonist/killer (BAK) or B cell lymphoma 2–associated X protein (BAX) underlies various pathologies including autoimmune and degenerative conditions. On mitochondria, voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) interacts with BAK and BAX through a common interface to inhibit BAK or to facilitate BAX apoptotic activity. We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism.

          "abstract": "High-entropy materials have expanded the frontier for discovering uncharted physicochemical properties. The phenomenon of chemical fluctuation is ubiquitous in high-entropy materials, yet its role in the thermoelectric field is often overlooked. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of (Mg 0.94− n Yb 0.26 Sr 0.26 Zn m )(Mg n Cd 0.69 Zn 0.69− m Na x )(Sb 1.74 Ca 0.26 ) samples characterized by ultrahigh configurational entropy. These samples exhibit a homogeneous single-phase structure at macroscopic and microscopic scales, yet display notable chemical fluctuations at the atomic to nanoscale. These fluctuations, along with the unusual atomic occupations, lead to an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity akin to that of amorphous materials. Combining the optimized carrier concentration and well-maintained carrier mobility, we ultimately achieved a high zT value of 1.2 at 750 kelvin, outperforming most previously reported AB 2 Sb 2 -type Zintls. This study underscores that the atomic to nanoscale chemical fluctuations are the crucial catalyst for the enhanced thermoelectric performance in high-entropy materials.",

The wireless sensor could be integrated with complex structures in surgical scenarios involving lateral collateral ligament injury and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, enabling distinct responses to graft stretching, reinjury, and loosening.

We overcame this problem by optogenetic current injection into all illuminated cardiomyocytes of mouse hearts in different action potential phases. Precisely triggered and patterned illumination enabled measuring R m and λ, which both were smallest at diastole. Pharmacological and depolarization-induced reduction of inwardly rectifying K + currents ( I K1 ), gap junction block, and cardiac infarction reduced I thr , showing the importance of high I K1 density and intact cardiomyocyte coupling for preventing arrhythmia initiation. Combining optogenetic current injection and computer simulations was used to classify pro- and anti-arrhythmic mechanisms based on their effects on R m and I thr and allowed to quantify I K1 inward rectification in the intact heart, identifying reduced I K1 rectification as anti-arrhythmic concept.",

However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungus Trichoderma guizhouense , whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability.

By using chemicals representing five basic tastes, systematic codesign of key functional components yields reliable performance including tunability, versatility, safety, and mechanical robustness.

Compromising Polα genetically induces the local replication-coupled histone incorporation pattern in progenitor cells to resemble that in stem cells, seen by both nuclear localization patterns and chromatin fibers. This is recapitulated using a Polα inhibitor in a concentration-dependent manner. The local old versus new histone asymmetry is comparable between stem cells and progenitor cells at both S phase and M phase. Together, these results indicate that developmentally programmed expression of key DNA replication components is important to shape stem cell chromatin. Furthermore, manipulating one crucial DNA replication component can induce replication-coupled histone dynamics in nonstem cells to resemble those in stem cells.",

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 10 12 Jones and low detection errors (Δ S 1–3 ≤ 5.0%). We further showcase their application in full-stokes imaging polarimetry with the lowest detection errors yet.",

We use allele-specific, single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that aging remodels transcription of the Xi and Xa across hippocampal cell types. Aging preferentially changed gene expression on the X’s relative to autosomes. Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory. Expression of the Xi escapee Plp1 , a myelin component, was increased in the aging hippocampus of female mice and parahippocampus of women. AAV-mediated Plp1 elevation in the dentate gyrus of aging male and female mice improved cognition. Understanding how the Xi may confer female advantage could lead to novel targets that counter brain aging and disease in both sexes.",

Further investigation indicates that GPR132-deficient NK92 cells expressed more GzmB and IFN-γ and exhibited stronger cytotoxicity. Mechanically, GPR132 regulates NK cell function through the CSK/ZAP70/NF-κB signaling axis. Down-regulation of GPR132 weakens the inhibition of NK cell function by lactate, thereby enhancing the functional execution of CAR-NK cells against colorectal cancer.

Host caspase-3 cleaves the precursor NS1/2, leading to NS1 secretion via an unconventional pathway. An unbiased CRISPR screen identifies NINJ1 as an essential factor for NS1 secretion. During infection, NINJ1 is recruited to the viral replication site, where it oligomerizes and forms speckled bodies, directly interacting with NS1. Subsequent mutagenesis studies identify critical amino acid residues of NS1 necessary for its interaction with NINJ1 and selective secretion.

Here, we investigate (i) whether opening of KCNQ2 channels requires a concerted step or can result from independent subunit activation and (ii) how individual subunits regulate gate opening and conductance. The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement.

In this study, we investigated the fundamentals of applying a solid-state electrolyte (SSE), typically used in battery technologies, as a membrane material for aqueous lithium extraction. We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry. Such exceptional selectivity is shown to be the result of the characteristic size and charge exclusion mechanisms of solid-state ion transport, which may be leveraged in the design of next-generation membranes for resource recovery.",

The macaque is a fundamental model organism in neuroscience, but the translational potential of macaque gene expression rests on the assumption that it is a good proxy for patterns of corresponding proteins (vertical translation) and for patterns of orthologous human genes (horizontal translation). Here, we systematically benchmark regional gene expression in macaque cortex against (i) macaque cortical receptor density and in vivo and ex vivo microstructure and (ii) human cortical gene expression. We find moderate cortex-wide correspondence between macaque gene expression and protein density, which improves by considering layer-specific gene expression. Half of the examined genes exhibit significant correlation between macaque and human across the cortex. Interspecies correspondence of gene expression is greater in unimodal than in transmodal cortex, recapitulating evolutionary cortical expansion and gene-protein correspondence in the macaque. These results showcase the potential and limitations of macaque cortical transcriptomics for translational discovery within and across species.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the 13 C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize 13 C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the 13 C relaxation ( T 1 ) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Adjustments to the dynamical nuclear polarization sequence (PulsePol) are performed, as well as slow sample rotation, to improve the NV- 13 C polarization transfer rate. The hyperpolarized 13 C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2-micrometer and 100-nanometer median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29-tesla magnetic field) of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.",

Here, we realized the entangled antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with diazahexabenzocoronene oligomers (up to 7 units) on Au(111). Extensive low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory and many-body calculations show that even-numbered spin chains host a collective state with gapped excitations, while odd-numbered chains feature a Kondo excitation. We found that a given antiferromagnetic coupling J value between first neighbors in the entangled quantum states is responsible for the quantum phenomena, strongly relating to their parities of the chain.

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation.",

Under depolarizing conditions, it accumulates on mitochondria where it becomes activated, phosphorylating both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, at Ser 65 . Our experiments reveal that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, only a fraction of PINK1 becomes stabilized after depolarization by electron transport chain inhibitors. Furthermore, the observed accrual of PINK1 cannot be completely accounted for without an accompanying increase in biosynthesis. We have used a ubiquitylation inhibitor TAK-243 to accumulate cleaved PINK1. Under these conditions, generation of unconjugated “free” phospho-ubiquitin serves as a proxy readout for PINK1 activity. This has enabled us to find a preconditioning phenomenon, whereby an initial depolarizing treatment leaves a residual pool of active PINK1 that remains competent to seed the activation of nascent cleaved PINK1 following a 16-hour recovery period.",

However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream.

We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly. Sustained CEP192 loss in vivo led to cell division failure and cell death in proliferative tissues.

This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), as enhancing cytosolic NAD + regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the intersection between SC metabolic shifts and immune responses within the muscle microenvironment, dictated by circadian rhythms, and underscore the potential for targeting circadian and metabolic pathways to enhance tissue regeneration.",

Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface.

Our work demonstrates an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets through van der Waals interfacial interactions.",

          "abstract": "Latent infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this association, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with or without a history of EBV infection and/or relapsing MS (RRMS). HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV-seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe neurological symptoms than healthy EBV-seropositive and RRMS donor groups. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis were associated with a significant increase in the number of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating effector T cells due to enhanced proliferation of proinflammatory T cells and limited expansion of regulatory T cells. The data indicate that a history of EBV infection, further compounded by a diagnosis of RRMS, promotes T cell–mediated xenogeneic CNS disease in a humanized mouse model of MS.",

          "abstract": "In acetylcholine receptor (AChR)–seropositive myasthenia gravis (MG), anti-AChR autoantibodies impair neuromuscular transmission and cause severe muscle weakness. MG therapies broadly suppress immune function, risking infections. We designed a chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR) expressing the 210–amino acid extracellular domain of the AChR α subunit (A210) linked to CD137-CD3ζ cytoplasmic domains to direct T cell cytotoxicity against anti-AChRα B cells. A210-CAART incorporating a CD8α transmembrane domain (TMD8α) showed functional but unstable surface expression, partially restored by inhibiting lysosomal degradation. A210-CAART with a CD28 TMD showed sustained surface expression, independent of TMD dimerization motifs. In a mouse xenograft model, A210.TMD8α-CAART demonstrated early control of anti-AChR B cell outgrowth but subsequent rebound and loss of surface CAAR expression, whereas A210.TMD28-CAART induced sustained surface CAAR expression and target cell elimination. This study demonstrates the importance of the CD28 TMD for CAAR stability and in vivo function, laying the groundwork for future development of precision cellular immunotherapy for AChR-MG.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria respond to environmental stimuli and attacks from competing organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa assembles the type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS) to precisely retaliate against aggressive competing bacteria. However, we lack an understanding of how the H1-T6SS assembly dynamically responds to nanomechanical forces. To address this, we analyzed live cells using correlative atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy. We show that indentation forces above 7 nanonewtons trigger local, repeated and targeted H1-T6SS assemblies within seconds of impact by the AFM tip. Analysis of the corresponding AFM force curves shows that a breach of a single layer of the cell envelope is necessary and sufficient for triggering H1-T6SS assembly. Accordingly, polymyxin B nonapeptide, which damages the outer membrane, also triggers H1-T6SS assembly. This suggests that P. aeruginosa has evolved a danger-sensing mechanism that enables rapid and precise deployment of its antibacterial H1-T6SS in response to breaches in the outer membrane.",

          "abstract": "Childbirth is a life-changing event in a mother’s life. While the transition to motherhood has recently been recognized as one of the most neuroplastic periods in adulthood, no study has yet explored whether the hippocampus and amygdala change during the peripartum in relation to childbirth experience and perinatal depression symptoms. In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala. A more challenging birth experience was associated with bilateral increases in hippocampal volume. These findings show that studying the neuroanatomical changes during the transition to motherhood can inform not only about adaptive processes but also about potential vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of tracking perinatal experiences to enhance women’s health.",

          "abstract": "Credible projections of Arctic warming and wetting (AWW) are essential for informed decision-making in a changing climate. However, current AWW projections from state-of-the-art climate models carry uncertainties. Using observational datasets and CMIP6 model simulations, we demonstrate that the observed historical global warming trend and the climatological mean pattern of Arctic sea ice can serve as effective constraints on AWW projections. Under SSP2-4.5, the constrained warming by the end of the century is reduced from 5.5° to 4.6°C. Similarly, the projected wetting decreases from 6.8 to 5.7 millimeter per month. The inter-model spread in warming and wetting is reduced by 25 and 15%, respectively. The reduction is the largest in the Barents-Kara seas, reducing warming by 1.2°C, lessening wetting by 1.7 millimeter per month, and decreasing the inter-model spread by one-third. Our findings suggest that unconstrained CMIP6 projections overestimate future AWW, particularly in the Barents-Kara seas, due to an overestimation of historical global warming and excessive sea ice in the models.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates whether incentives generated by public policies contribute to motherhood penalties. Specifically, we study the consequences of subsidized small jobs, the German Minijobs, which are frequently taken up by first-time mothers upon labor market return. Using a combination of propensity score matching and an event study applied to administrative data, we compare the long-run child penalties of mothers who started out in a Minijob employment versus unsubsidized employment or non-employment after birth. We find persistent differences between the Minijobbers and otherwise employed mothers up to 10 years after the first birth, which suggests adverse unintended consequences of the small jobs subsidy program for maternal earnings and pensions.",

          "abstract": "We study the effects of digital transformation in the European Union on individual employment outcomes, wage growth, and income inequality, during the decade 2010–9. Our results allow us to formulate a ‘conveyor-belt’ hypothesis suggesting that employment confers a competitive advantage in navigating the digital transition due to the accumulation of pertinent skills in the workplace. Because digital skills are acquired with the changing demands of the job, their initial endowment matters less for the employed than for the non-employed. Furthermore, the ability of out-of-work individuals with higher digital skills to jump back on the labour market is reduced for those with higher education, suggesting a faster depreciation of their digital skills. A similar effect, although of limited size, is found for earning growth: out-of-work individuals with higher digital skills are not only more likely to find a job, but experience higher earnings growth, compared to their peers with lower digital skills. Our results point to a vulnerability of workers ‘left behind’ from the digital transformation and the labour market. The overall effects on inequality are, however, limited.",
