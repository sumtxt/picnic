          "abstract": "The nine human herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus, present a significant burden to global public health 1 . Their envelopes contain at least ten different glycoproteins, which are necessary for host cell tropism, attachment and entry 2 . The best conserved among them, glycoprotein B (gB), is essential as it performs membrane fusion by undergoing extensive rearrangements from a prefusion to postfusion conformation. At present, there are no antiviral drugs targeting gB or neutralizing antibodies directed against its prefusion form, because of the difficulty in structurally determining and using this metastable conformation. Here we show the isolation of prefusion-specific nanobodies, one of which exhibits strong neutralizing and cross-species activity. By mutational stabilization we solved the herpes simplex virus 1 gB full-length prefusion structure, which allowed the bound epitope to be determined. Our analyses show the membrane-embedded regions of gB and previously unresolved structural features 3,4 , including a new fusion loop arrangement, providing insights into the initial conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Binding an epitope spanning three domains, proximal only in the prefusion state, the nanobody keeps wild-type HSV-2 gB in this conformation and enabled its native prefusion structure to be determined. This also indicates the mode of neutralization and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions.",

          "abstract": "The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence 1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons 3–6 . However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce . Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements.",

          "abstract": "Enteric pathogens engage in complex interactions with the host and the resident microbiota to establish gut colonization 1–3 . Although mechanistic interactions between enteric pathogens and bacterial commensals have been extensively studied, whether and how commensal fungi affect enteric infections remain largely unknown 1 . Here we show that colonization with the common human gut commensal fungus Candida albicans worsened infections with the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The presence of C. albicans in the mouse gut increased Salmonella caecal colonization and systemic dissemination. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that Salmonella binds to C. albicans via type 1 fimbriae and uses its type 3 secretion system to deliver effector proteins into C. albicans . A specific effector, SopB, was sufficient to manipulate C. albicans metabolism and trigger the release of millimolar amounts of arginine into the extracellular environment. The released arginine, in turn, induced expression of the type 3 secretion system in Salmonella , increasing its invasion of epithelial cells. C. albicans deficient in arginine production was unable to increase Salmonella virulence. Arginine-producing C. albicans also dampened the inflammatory response during Salmonella infection. Arginine supplementation in the absence of C. albicans increased the systemic spread of Salmonella and decreased the inflammatory response, phenocopying the presence of C. albicans . In summary, we identified C. albicans colonization as a susceptibility factor for disseminated Salmonella infection and arginine as a central metabolite in the cross-kingdom interaction between fungi, bacteria and host.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems 1–7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization.",

In the brain, fibroblasts are border-enriched cells whose dynamic molecular states and immune interactions after injury remain unclear 1 . Here we define the shared fibroblast–immune response to brain injury. Early profibrotic myofibroblasts develop from pre-existing brain fibroblasts and infiltrate brain lesions, orchestrated by fibroblast TGFβ signalling, profibrotic macrophages and microglia, and perilesional glia. Myofibroblasts transition into several late fibroblast states, including lymphocyte-interactive fibroblasts. Interruption of the early myofibroblast state exacerbated sub-acute brain injury, tissue loss and secondary neuroinflammation, with increased mortality in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model. Disruption of late lymphocyte–fibroblast niches via selective loss of fibroblast chemokine CXCL12 led to late brain-specific innate inflammation and lymphocyte dispersal with increased IFNγ production. These data indicate the response to brain injury is coordinated by evolving temporal and spatial fibroblast states that limit functional tissue loss and chronic neuroinflammation.",

          "abstract": "Nuclease–helicase DNA2 is a multifunctional genome caretaker that is essential for cell proliferation in a range of organisms, from yeast to human 1–4 . Bi-allelic DNA2 mutations that reduce DNA2 concentrations cause a spectrum of primordial dwarfism disorders, including Seckel and Rothmund–Thomson-related syndromes 5–7 . By contrast, cancer cells frequently express high concentrations of DNA2 (refs. 8–11 ). The mechanism that precludes cell proliferation in the absence of DNA2 and the molecular aetiology of DNA2 -linked diseases remain elusive. Here we used yeast and human cells to demonstrate that DNA2 suppresses homologous recombination-restarted replication and checkpoint activation at stalled DNA replication forks. Loss of this control mechanism upon degradation of DNA2 in human cells causes recombination-dependent DNA synthesis and build-up of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Consequently, DNA2 deprivation triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and invariably leads to ATR–p21-dependent cell-cycle exit before mitosis. These findings explain why DNA2 is essential for cell proliferation and reveal that replication fork processing to restrict recombination is indispensable for avoiding cellular senescence. Stochastic entry into senescence stifles the proliferative potential of cells following the expression of a Seckel syndrome patient-derived DNA2 hypomorph or partial degradation of DNA2, providing a conceptual framework to explain global growth failure in DNA2 -linked primordial dwarfism disorders.",

          "abstract": "The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood 1 . Here, to investigate them, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with a prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions that, notably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex) to motor regions (secondary and primary motor cortex and gigantocellular reticular nucleus) and high-level cortical regions (the dorsal anterior cingulate area and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision-making areas. This study offers a brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large-scale recordings on a single standardized task.",

          "abstract": "For rocky planets, the presence of a solid inner core has notable implications on the composition and thermal evolution of the core and on the magnetic history of the planet 1–3 . On Mars, geophysical observations have confirmed that the core is at least partially liquid 4–7 , but it is unknown whether any part of the core is solid. Here we present an analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission, demonstrating that Mars has a solid inner core. We identify two seismic phases, the deep core-transiting phase, PKKP, and the inner core boundary reflecting phase, PKiKP, indicative of the inner core. Our inversions constrain the radius of the Martian inner core to about 613 ± 67 km, with a compressional velocity jump of around 30% across the inner core boundary, supported by additional inner-core-related seismic phases. These properties imply a concentration of distinct light elements in the inner core, segregated from the outer core through core crystallization. This finding provides an anchor point for understanding the thermal and chemical state of Mars. Moreover, the relationship between inner core formation and the Martian magnetic field evolution could provide insights into dynamo generation across planetary bodies.",

          "abstract": "Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures 1,2 . In the early embryo, these processes occur concurrently such that forces generated in neighbouring tissues can impose mechanical stresses on each other 3–5 , potentially disrupting development and consequently decreasing fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to mitigate inter-tissue mechanical conflicts remains unclear. Here, we combined phylogenetic survey, quantitative live imaging and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate mechanical stress management during gastrulation across the insect order of flies (Diptera). We identify two distinct cellular mechanisms that prevent tissue collision between the expanding head and trunk. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic subgroup including Drosophila melanogaster , active out-of-plane deformation of a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow, acts as a mechanical sink to pre-empt head–trunk collision. Genetic and optogenetic ablation of the cephalic furrow leads to accumulation of compressive stress, tissue buckling at the head–trunk boundary and late-stage embryonic defects in the head and nervous system. By contrast, the non-cyclorrhaphan Chironomus riparius lacks cephalic furrow formation and instead undergoes widespread out-of-plane division that reduces the duration and spatial extent of head expansion. Re-orienting head mitosis from in-plane to out-of-plane in Drosophila partially suppresses tissue buckling, showing that it can function as an alternative mechanical sink. Our data suggest that mechanisms of mechanical stress management emerge and diverge in response to inter-tissue conflicts during early embryonic development.",

Here, we report a shift from this norm in Messor ibericus , an ant that lays individuals from two distinct species. In this life cycle, females must clone males of another species because they require their sperm to produce the worker caste. As a result, males from the same mother exhibit distinct genomes and morphologies, as they belong to species that diverged over 5 million years ago. The evolutionary history of this system appears as sexual parasitism 3 that evolved into a natural case of cross-species cloning 4,5 , resulting in the maintenance of a male-only lineage cloned through distinct species’ ova. We term females exhibiting this reproductive mode as xenoparous, meaning they give birth to other species as part of their life cycle.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development 1–3 . However, their relevance for the evolution of development remains poorly understood 4 . Here we show that an evolutionary novelty of fly embryos—the patterned embryonic invagination known as the cephalic furrow 5–7 —has a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we demonstrate that the head–trunk boundary of the embryo is under increased compressive stress due to the concurrent formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension and that the cephalic furrow counteracts these stresses, preventing mechanical instabilities during gastrulation. Then, by comparing the genetic patterning of species with and without the cephalic furrow, we find evidence that changes in the expression of the transcription factor buttonhead are associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. These results suggest that the cephalic furrow may have evolved through the genetic stabilization of morphogenesis in response to the mechanical challenges of dipteran gastrulation. Together, our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with previous expectations to initiate movements and make decisions 1 . It is difficult to meet this challenge if different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 621,733 neurons recorded with 699 Neuropixels probes across 139 mice in 12 laboratories. The data were obtained from mice performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor and cognitive components. The probes covered 279 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map and assess how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli transiently appeared in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of midbrain and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with impending motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption were also widespread. This publicly available dataset represents a resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.",

The capacity to spatially profile DNA methylation, which is a canonical epigenetic mark extensively implicated in transcriptional regulation 4,5 , is lacking. Here we introduce a method for whole-genome spatial co-profiling of DNA methylation and the transcriptome of the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and the postnatal mouse brain resulted in rich DNA–RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The concordance and distinction in spatial patterns of the two modalities highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics that underlie mammalian embryogenesis for both the epigenome and transcriptome, revealing details of sequence-, cell-type- and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to include DNA cytosine methylation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology across development and disease.",

However, the storage potential is not unlimited 3,4 . Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO 2 storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources. Treating carbon storage as a limited intergenerational resource has deep implications for national mitigation strategies and policy and requires making explicit decisions on priorities for storage use.",

          "abstract": "Steel truss bridges are constructed by connecting many different types of bars (components) to form a load-bearing structural system. Several disastrous collapses of this type of bridge have occurred as a result of initial component failure(s) propagating to the rest of the structure 1–3 . Despite the prevalence and importance of these structures, it is still unclear why initial component failures propagate disproportionately in some bridges but barely affect functionality in others 4–7 . Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development. These findings can be used to enhance present bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately leading to safer transport networks.",

          "abstract": "This study compares the bibliographic and full-text coverage of 15 conventional and alternative discovery/access mechanisms: two multidisciplinary library databases (Scopus and the Web of Science Core Collection), five single-subject databases, the integrated library search (ILS) mechanism of Manhattan University, a scholarly search engine (Google Scholar), two web-based scholarly databases (Dimensions and OpenAlex), two academic social networks (Academia.edu and ResearchGate), and two pirate sites (Anna’s Archive and Sci-Hub). The analysis is based on known-item searches for 875 target documents in chemistry, materials science, cardiology, public health, economics, education, and psychology. Overall, Google Scholar, OpenAlex, and the ILS are the most comprehensive sources of bibliographic records. Google Scholar’s coverage rate is higher than that of all the Manhattan University databases combined, and Scopus—the most comprehensive multidisciplinary library database—has a lower bibliographic coverage rate than Google Scholar, both of the web-based scholarly databases, one of the two ASNs, and one of the two pirate sites. In terms of full-text coverage, the best multidisciplinary options are the ILS, Google Scholar, and the two pirate sites. Although several of the alternative discovery/access mechanisms are deficient in terms of their user interfaces, search capabilities, and metadata, they nonetheless provide excellent bibliographic and full-text coverage of the scholarly literature. In contrast, many single-subject library databases provide very incomplete coverage of their own subject areas. These findings have implications for scholars and students as well as system-wide implications for the use, development, and evaluation of information resources.",

          "abstract": "Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data are available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our minimal hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation–integration transition even with memory-less agents. While residential segregation is a multifactorial phenomenon, this physics analogy suggests a simple mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood’s population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract spaces.",

Research has suggested that class-based differences in factors such as socialization practices and access to resources partly explain this phenomenon, but less work has explored whether teachers’ practices also exacerbate these inequalities. Using whole-class observations of 63 preschool classroom discussions ( N = 226 students, 10 teachers), we coded 7,941 student participation attempts and subsequent responses from teachers. Mixed-effects Bayesian logistic regressions showed that whether students played by the rules by raising their hands or broke the rules by calling out, they were less likely to have their participation attempts accepted if they came from a working-class background, even when their perceived language skills were matched to their middle- and upper-class peers. These results suggest that early schooling experiences may serve to exacerbate inequalities rather than level the playing field.",

          "abstract": "Understanding host factors driving asymptomatic versus severe disease outcomes is of key importance if we are to control emerging and re-emerging viral infections. HLA-B*15:01 has been associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhospitalized individuals of European ancestry, with protective immunity attributed to preexisting cross-reactive CD8 + T-cells directed against HLA-B*15:01-restricted Spike-derived S 919-927 peptide (B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells). However, fundamental questions remained on the abundance and clonotypic nature of CD8 + T-cell responses in HLA-B*15:01-positive patients who succumbed to life-threatening COVID-19. Here, we analyzed B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses in COVID-19 patients from independent HLA-typed COVID-19 patient cohorts across three continents, Australia, Asia and Europe. We assessed B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells in COVID-19 patients across disease outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to hospitalized critical illness. We found that severe/critical COVID-19 patients mounted B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses lacking a highly expanded key public B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR; TRAV9-2/TRBV7-2) which recurred across multiple individuals in COVID-19 patients with a mild disease. Instead, B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses in life-threatening disease had a prevalence of an alternate TCR clonotypic motif (TRAV38-2/DV8/TRBV20-1), potentially contributing, at least in part, to why B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients were less protective. Interestingly, the frequency, memory phenotype, and activation profiles of circulating B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells did not differ across disease severity. Moreover, B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells were better maintained into convalescence compared to other SARS-CoV-2-specificities. Our study thus provides evidence on the differential nature of the TCR clonal repertoire in 22.37% of HLA-B*15:01-positive COVID-19 patients who developed severe or critical disease in our cohorts, comparing to HLA-B*15:01-expressing individuals with mild COVID-19.",

          "abstract": "Self-assembled thin films respond to external loads via surface instabilities that are critical to their functionality in both biology and technology. Lipid monolayers at the air–liquid interface are one such system. Tunability between out-of-plane buckling (e.g., folding) and in-plane relaxation (e.g., reorganization of lipid domains) in highly compressed lipid monolayers suggests underlying mechanistic generality. Yet, how in-plane relaxation occurs and how it is distinguished from folding remains elusive. Here, we use continuum mechanics, finite element (FE) simulations, and Langmuir trough fluorescence microscopy (FM) data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these elastic instability modes. Uniaxial loading of the Langmuir trough is evaluated in FE simulations, where the lipid monolayer is modeled as a thin sheet with a hyperelastic energy function developed to exhibit a relaxation mechanism. Results show that this material relaxation mechanism triggers tunable in-plane shear localization (shear banding). Furthermore, the simulation results of a heterogeneous model, built from fluorescence micrographs of lipid domains distributed in a continuous matrix, are rigorously compared with experimental data by domain organizational analyses. These analyses suggest shear bands are sufficient in inducing domain symmetry breaking that is characteristic of in-plane relaxation and, without such shear bands, domain organization remains in powder structure, characteristic of folding lipid monolayers. Our findings develop a hyperelastic model validated against experimental FM images that can connect the observed lipid monolayer instabilities of folding and in-plane relaxation, establishing a generalized framework with the potential to unify all other monolayer instability modes and characterize other thin film systems.",

          "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite treatment advances, and a major challenge is that biomarkers that predict response and resistance to current therapies are lacking. We report that activated and proliferating malignant CLL B cells in circulation express PD-1, a protein normally expressed in T cells. PD-1 expression is absent in circulating B cells from healthy controls and nonmalignant B cells from patients with CLL. Circulating PD-1 + CLL cells are found in all treatment naïve patients, regardless of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation status or cytogenetic abnormalities. PD-1 + CLL cells are transcriptionally distinct compared to PD-1 − CLL cells and upregulate genes associated with cell activation, proliferation, and B cell receptor (BCR) and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Indeed, ex vivo stimulation of the BCR and TLR9 readily increased PD-1 expression in CLL cells from treatment-naïve patients within 24 h, an effect that was blocked by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). More importantly, patients initiating BTKi therapy experienced profound reductions in circulating PD-1 + CLL cell numbers within 1 mo, which is in line with reduction in Ki-67 + CLL cells. Elevated percentages of circulating PD-1 + CLL cells also preceded a clinical diagnosis of disease progression in patients receiving BTKi. Thus, our findings indicate that PD-1 expression is a potential biomarker to identify proliferating CLL cells in vivo and will be useful to predict response and resistance to BTKi. In addition, eliminating PD-1 + CLL cells with depleting anti-PD-1 monospecific or bispecific antibodies should be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "Local neural activation drives regional increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF), in a phenomenon known as functional hyperemia. Astrocytes, which enwrap cerebral blood vessels and respond to neuronal activity through their G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), play a vital role in brain energy metabolism. Although astrocytic calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling has been widely studied in relation to neurovascular coupling, the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), another key second messenger of GPCRs, on CBF has not been established. In this study, we explored the effects of optogenetically induced astrocytic cAMP elevation on CBF. We engineered adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to express a bacterial photoactivated adenylyl cyclase in astrocytes, which triggers an increase in cAMP upon blue light stimulation. Opto-stimulation also elevated astrocytic Ca 2+ , albeit with a delayed onset under mild stimulation. In vivo imaging of anesthetized and awake wild-type mice through a thinned skull preparation revealed that optogenetically induced astrocytic cAMP elevation led to pronounced arteriole dilation, with a latency of 1.8 s and maximal dilation reached within 10 s in the awake state and slower response under anesthesia. Mild opto-stimulation causing sensory-level cAMP elevations was sufficient to induce arteriole dilation. This effect was preserved in IP 3 receptor type 2-knockout (IP 3 R2 −/− ) mice, indicating a mechanism independent of GPCR-induced intracellular Ca 2+ elevations. These findings highlight astrocytic cAMP as a key modulator of cerebral vasodilation, contributing to our understanding of local CBF regulation. This study opens broad avenues for understanding astrocyte-mediated control of CBF and its implications in neurological diseases characterized by dysregulated blood flow.",

We interpret these data in the context of elemental behavior in modern weathering environments and modern marine sediments. We find that from 2000 Mya to ca. 650 Mya, physical erosion was effective, where braided rivers efficiently delivered particles from land to the sea. Overall, chemical weathering was less efficient than now, although many easily weatherable minerals were as weathered as today. We suggest a dramatic change in weathering dynamics after 650 Mya when modern-like deep subduction originated. With this development, mantle dynamics, by promoting periodic vigorous subduction and intense mountain building, began to control the intensity of chemical weathering and particle transport to the oceans. Through spectral analysis of several geochemical records, we find that during times of enhanced subduction and mountain building, continents underwent periods of net erosion and less intense chemical weathering, while during periods of less intense subduction, continents accumulated particles, and chemical weathering was more intense. The evolution and proliferation of land plants changed chemical weathering intensity but had little apparent impact on the cyclic nature of particle transport and storage on the continents. These results could offer a framework to better understand the evolution of elemental cycling from the continents to the oceans over the last 2000 My.",

          "abstract": "In mammals, a hierarchically organized circadian timing system orchestrates daily rhythms of nearly all physiology. A master pacemaker in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes subsidiary clocks in most peripheral organs. By driving anabolic and catabolic cycles of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and by detoxifying endo- and xenobiotic components, the liver plays an important role in adapting the metabolic needs to rest-activity rhythms. In keeping with these functions, the liver expresses many clock-controlled genes that are required for these processes. Remarkably, however, this organ also fluctuates in size and morphological parameters. In mice, the mass of the liver increases and decreases by 30 to 40% during the 24-h day. The oscillation in liver mass is accompanied by daily rhythms of similar amplitudes in hepatocyte cell size and global RNA and protein accumulation. The number of ribosomes, which parallels the ups and downs of liver size, appears to be the rate-limiting factor in driving the diurnal rhythms of overall protein synthesis. Obviously, the rapid increase in hepatocyte size within the liver engenders mechanical stress, which must be dealt with by increasing the physical robustness of cells. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton of hepatocytes undergoes dramatic polymerization cycles. Thus, massive intracellular and subcortical F-actin bundles are assembled during the night, at which the liver reaches its maximal size. In turn, the oscillation in actin polymerization elicits rhythms in myocardin-related transcription factors-serum response factor signaling, which participate in the circadian transcription of the core clock gene Per2 and thereby contribute to the synchronization of hepatocyte clocks.",

However, the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors in animal body size evolution, and the coevolution of wild and domestic species remain poorly understood. In the Northwestern Mediterranean, abundant archaeozoological data from well-contextualized sites and reliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions provide a unique opportunity to explore long-term morphological changes and their drivers over time. This study analyzes 81,211 biometric measurements from 311 archaeological sites in Mediterranean France, spanning the past 8,000 y. It examines body size evolution in key wild (red deer, red fox, brown hare, rabbit) and domestic (sheep, goat, cattle, pig, chicken) species alongside vegetation, climate, and human activity changes. Our analyses reveal a long-standing synchrony between wild and domestic species until the last millennium, both influenced by a complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. From the Early Neolithic to the Roman period, environmental conditions exerted comparable effects on wild and domestic species, though the magnitude and timing of changes varied, reflecting species-specific interactions with humans. From the Middle Ages onward, evolutionary trajectories diverged. Domestic species experienced intensified human selection, while human activities increasingly impacted wild populations and their habitat. These findings highlight the dynamic and interwoven roles of environmental and anthropogenic factors in shaping animal morphological evolution, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in the evolution of domestic species, and illustrating the growing impact of human activities on wild populations.",

          "abstract": "Circadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate daily fluctuations in light and temperature, but how this anticipatory role promotes adaptation to different environments remains poorly understood. Here, we subjected the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to a long-term evolution experiment under high light, high temperature, and elevated CO 2 levels. After 1,200 generations, we obtained a strain exhibiting a 600% increase in growth rate. Whole-genome sequencing revealed three mutations fixed in the evolved population, two of which were sufficient to recapitulate the fast-growing phenotype in the wild type. A mutation in the promoter of the shikimate kinase aroK led to its overexpression, while a mutation in the central circadian regulator sasA disrupted both the phase and amplitude of the circadian rhythm. Changes in circadian control led to widespread perturbations in the transcriptome and metabolome. These included major shifts in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and glycogen storage dynamics. While these changes increased fitness under the experimental conditions, they caused maladaptation when light or CO 2 levels were altered, revealing a trade-off between fitness and environmental flexibility. Our results demonstrate that mutations in circadian control can drive fast adaptation by modulating central metabolism, underscoring the circadian cycle as a cornerstone of cellular plasticity. Thus, targeting the circadian cycle could be key to engineering cyanobacterial strains optimized for carbon fixation and biomass production.",

While hERG1a homomers traffic efficiently to the plasma membrane, hERG1b homomers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When expressed together, the two subunits avidly associate during biogenesis. Seeking rules specifying heteromeric association, we characterized the fate of hERG1b proteins using confocal and superresolution imaging in fixed and live HeLa cells. We found hERG1b sequestered in punctate intracellular structures when expressed alone in HeLa cells. These puncta, which depend on the presence of an N-terminal “RXR” ER retention signal, represent a privileged ER subcompartment distinct from that containing ER-retained, type 2 (hERG-based) LQTS mutant proteins, which were rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Introducing hERG1a to cells with preformed hERG1b puncta dissolved these puncta by rescuing extant hERG1b. Rescue occurred by association of fully translated hERG1b with 1a, a surprising finding given previous studies demonstrating cotranslational heteromeric association. We propose that sequestration limits potentially deleterious surface expression of hERG1b homomeric channels while preserving hERG1b for an alternative mode of heteromeric hERG1a/1b channel assembly posttranslationally. These findings reveal a surprising versatility of biosynthetic pathways promoting heteromeric assembly.",

          "abstract": "Chimaeras ( Holocephali ) are an understudied group of mostly deep-ocean cartilaginous fishes ( Chondrichthyes ) with unique characteristics that distinguish them from their distant relatives, sharks, skates, and rays. Unlike sharks, chimaeras lack scales and do not have serially replacing rows of serrated teeth crowned with enameloid. Instead, they possess a fused dentition of dentine tooth plates. Additionally, male chimaeras develop an articulated cartilaginous facial appendage, the tenaculum, which is covered in an arcade of tooth-like structures. These extraoral teeth remain poorly understood, and their evolutionary origin is unclear. We investigate the development of the tenaculum and its teeth throughout the ontogeny of the Spotted Ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei , to assess homology and convergence between this novel craniofacial feature and oral jaws. Our study aims to 1) describe the development of the tenaculum, 2) assess tenaculum tooth development in comparison to oral teeth and denticles, and 3) characterize the genes and tissues responsible for tenaculum tooth emergence. We found that juvenile male chimaeras develop a full tenaculum before tooth development is complete and that only mature males possess a fully toothed tenaculum. These extraoral teeth emerge from within the tenaculum rather than from the surrounding epithelium. We integrate our developmental data with fossil evidence of the tenacular dentition from the Carboniferous holocephalan Helodus simplex . Our findings show that the tenaculum is closely associated with the upper jaw and that tenacular dentition resembles separate shark-like oral tooth whorls more than modified dermal denticles.",

          "abstract": "In mammals, sperm formation is completed in the seminiferous tubules within the testis, and sperm maturation occurs during the epididymal transit of the spermatozoa. Sperm morphology drastically changes when abnormal spermatozoa migrate from the testis to the epididymis. Detailed molecular mechanisms for sperm survival in the epididymis have not been determined yet. Globozoospermia is a cause of male infertility and is characterized by round-headed spermatozoa without acrosomes, an abnormal sperm nuclear membrane, and sperm midpiece defects. Testis expressed 50 ( Tex50 ) is a testis-enriched gene that is expressed in mice and humans. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated Tex50 knockout (KO) mice and found that the KO males were sterile due to epididymal sperm malformations and impaired sperm motility. Surprisingly, electron microscopy, sperm morphology, and globozoospermia-related protein expression and localization in the KO testis were all normal. To understand this phenotype in more detail, we created TEX50-mCherry knockin mice to determine the localization of the TEX50 protein during spermatogenesis. The mCherry signals detected a ring-shaped structure surrounding the sperm acrosome and migrated to the posterior region of the sperm head. After the acrosome reaction, most of the spermatozoa retained mCherry signals. These results indicate that the Tex50 KO globozoospermia phenotype occurs after the migration of spermatozoa from the testis to the epididymis. We found that sperm membrane protein TEX50 is a putative key molecule to survive against globozoospermia-like malformations in the epididymis. It is essential for complete sperm formation and male fertility in mice.",

Although many of these substrates are believed to promote M.tb virulence, most remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a complete locus deletion strain of ESX-5 in M.tb to examine the molecular changes caused by a broad loss in ESX-5 secretory substrates. We confirmed the selective loss of PE/PPE proteins secreted by ESX-5 into both the culture filtrate (CF) and outer mycomembrane (OMM) fractions of the M.tb ∆esx5 mutant. In examining other ESX systems, we found that ESX-1 substrate levels were increased in both the CF and OMM fractions of the ∆esx5 mutant. Conversely, the ESX-3 locus was transcriptionally repressed upon ESX-5 deletion. We noted that the ∆esx5 mutant had altered morphology in the form of wrinkled distortions of the bacterial surface. Likewise, we identified increased susceptibility of the ∆esx5 mutant to a variety of large (molecular weight &gt;550 g/mol) antimicrobial compounds, suggesting that an intact ESX-5 system is required for M.tb to exclude such molecules. Our findings suggest that removing the ESX-5 system from M.tb fundamentally alters the properties of the mycobacterial OMM and impacts the expression and secretion activity of other ESX systems.",

          "abstract": "Cardiogenesis relies on the integrated interplay between cardiac transcription factors and signaling pathways. Here, we uncover a role for type IIA procollagen (IIA), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein encoded by an alternatively spliced Col2a1 transcript, encoding a N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, as a critical regulator in a cardiac gene regulatory feedback loop. The cysteine-rich domain of IIA protein was previously reported to interact with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and transforming growth factors-beta (TGFβ) in in vitro binding assays and acts as a BMP antagonist in amphibian embryo assays. We show that the Col2a1 gene in mice is activated in the developing heart by core cardiogenic factors (NKX2-5, GATA4, MEF2, and SRF) via cis-regulatory enhancer elements. IIA loss (ΔIIA) in mice results in depletion of Isl1- and Nkx2-5-expressing progenitors, causing outflow tract defects resembling disrupted BMP/TGFβ-SMAD signaling, alongside reduced nuclear pSMAD1/5/8 in cardiac tissues. Compound +/ΔIIA ; Smad4+/− mutants exhibit aggravated malformations. IIA enhances BMP-responsive reporter activity in cells in transactivation assays. We propose that IIA supports a positive functional role on SMAD4-dependent signaling, fine-tuning BMP/TGFβ signaling, thereby regulating GATA4 and NKX2-5 activity during second heart field progenitor specification. These findings position IIA procollagen as a key ECM component that integrates BMP/TGFβ signaling with cardiac transcription factors such as NKX2-5, revealing a feedback loop essential for cardiogenesis. Given its role in cardiac development, IIA emerges as a potential congenital heart disease risk factor.",

          "abstract": "In vivo genome editing has the potential to address many inherited and environmental disorders. However, a major hurdle for the clinical translation of genome editing is safe, efficient delivery to disease-relevant tissues. A modality-agnostic reporter animal model that facilitates rapid, precise, and quantifiable assessment of functional delivery and editing could greatly enhance the evaluation and translation of delivery technologies. Here, we present the development of the tdTomato in vivo genome-editing reporter (TIGER) mouse, a reporter strain that harbors an integrated and constitutively expressed mutated tdTomato gene in the Polr2a locus. The mutations (Q115X, Q357X) abolish fluorescence, but successful adenine base editing (ABE) or prime editing (PE) restores tdTomato fluorescence. This mouse model facilitates the tissue- and cell type–specific assessment of genome editing agent delivery. We describe several editing strategies validated in vitro and demonstrate efficient ABE and PE in vivo using viral and nonviral delivery vectors targeting four cell types within the mouse eye: the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, Müller glia, and the trabecular meshwork. We show direct editing characterization in the ocular tissues via in vivo and ex vivo two-photon confocal microscopy and verify the spectral and fluorescence lifetime properties of tdTomato reporter in other mouse tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate successful adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PE of extraocular tissues, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and brain neurons by intravenous injection. Thus, the TIGER mouse facilitates the direct development, comparison, and optimization of delivery platforms for efficient and productive ABE or PE broadly applicable in vivo across multiple tissues tested in this study.",

In many natural ecosystems, methane is sequestered by microbial communities, yet little is known about how constituents of methane-oxidizing communities interact with each other and their environment. This lack of mechanistic understanding is a common issue for many important microbial communities, but it is difficult to draw links between available sequencing information and the metabolites that govern community interactions. Here, we develop and apply a technique called inverse stable isotope probing–metabolomics (InverSIP) to bridge the gap between metagenomic and metabolomic information and functionally characterize interactions in a complex methane-oxidizing community. Using InverSIP, we link a highly transcribed biosynthetic gene cluster in the community with its secondary metabolite product: methylocystabactin, a triscatecholate siderophore not previously observed in nature. We find that production of methylocystabactin is widespread among methanotrophic alphaproteobacteria and that it can be used by another methanotroph in the community that does not produce this siderophore itself. Functional assays reveal that methylocystabactin supports methanotroph growth and the activity of the methane-oxidizing enzyme soluble methane monooxygenase under conditions where bioavailable iron is limited, establishing an important molecular link between methane-oxidation and the insoluble iron found in many natural environments. These findings contribute to a molecular-level understanding of these environmentally important bacterial communities and establish InverSIP as a broadly applicable genomics-guided strategy for characterizing metabolites in microbial ecosystems.",

Here, we show that monoallelic missense mutations in TRIM71 are associated with hearing loss (HL) and inner ear aplasia in humans. Utilizing conditional Trim71 knockout mice carrying a CH and HL-associated mutation, we demonstrate that loss of TRIM71 function during early otic development (embryonic day 9 to 10) causes severe HL. While inner ear morphogenesis occurs normally in Trim71 knockout mice, we find that early otic loss of TRIM71 function disrupts the highly stereotyped timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation within the inner ear auditory sensory organ (cochlea), resulting in the premature formation and innervation of mechanosensory hair cells. Transcriptomic profiling of Trim71 -deficient cochlear progenitor cells identifies Inhba and Tgfbr2 as targets of TRIM71 repression, and our analysis of Inhba-Tgfbr1 double knockout mice indicates that TRIM71 maintains hair cell progenitors in a proliferative and undifferentiated state by restricting TGFβ-type signaling. Characterization of hair cells and their associated neurons in adult Trim71 knockout mice revealed reduced presynaptic terminals and neuronal degeneration in the outer hair cell region, providing a basis for the observed hearing deficits in Trim71 knockout mice.",

AMOTL2 affects IFN signaling by modulating STAT1 levels and activation in response to type I IFN.

In this study, we identified the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 as a key driver of acquired BETi resistance in TNBC, primarily through its role in enhancing the translation of c-MYC mRNA. Given that IGF2BP2 is not an ideal target for small-molecular drugs, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-Seq) and found circRNA-BISC as a potent IGF2BP2 repressor. BISC effectively inhibited both c-MYC translation and BETi resistance. Notably, BISC contains a “CAC-linker-XGGX” motif that specifically binds IGF2BP2 rather than to IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3. The efficacy and selectivity of BISC in targeting IGF2BP2 prompted further exploration of BISC-based RNA therapeutics for TNBC. In vitro transcribed and circularized BISC, when combined with the BETi OTX-015, demonstrated impressive tumor regression in BETi-resistant TNBC models without detectable toxicity. These findings establish BISC as a potent IGF2BP2 repressor and highlight the feasibility of circRNA-based therapeutic strategies to overcome BETi resistance in TNBC.",

          "abstract": "Creatine plays a vital role in cellular energy production and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) homeostasis and has also been identified as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Creatine is transported into cells by the human creatine transporter (hCRT) (SLC6A8), an Na + /Cl − -dependent symporter encoded on the X chromosome. Mutations in hCRT cause cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome 1, a neurological disorder marked by intellectual disability, speech delay, and seizures. Beyond its role in the brain and muscle, hCRT is highly expressed in metabolically active tumors. Many cancer cells, including colorectal cancer and glioblastoma, upregulate hCRT to sustain intracellular creatine levels and buffer ATP under energy stress. Pharmacological blockade of hCRT by RGX202 has been shown to impair tumor growth by disrupting energy homeostasis. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human hCRT in three states: apo, creatine-bound, and RGX202-bound. hCRT adopts a canonical LeuT-fold with 12 transmembrane helices and two pseudosymmetric inverted repeats. Creatine is coordinated in the central substrate-binding site through interactions with transmembrane helices TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8, while the inhibitor RGX202 occupies the same binding pocket, engaging in overlapping contacts that competitively block creatine access. Our structural and mechanistic findings clarify substrate recognition and inhibitory binding of hCRT, providing a molecular rationale for targeting hCRT in both inherited metabolic diseases and cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Bivalve farming, a vital component of global aquaculture, has been proposed as a potential marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) strategy, yet its role remains contentious. Using field mesocosms, we demonstrate that oyster filter-feeding enhances mCDR by accelerating the formation of particulate and dissolved organic carbon in the water column and promoting organic carbon deposition in sediments. This process shifts the water column toward a more autotrophic and alkaline state, effectively sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere. Over the full culture period, the net carbon sequestered by oyster-driven organic carbon production is 2.39 times greater than the CO 2 sequestered in oyster shells. These findings position oyster farming as a scalable, nature-based solution for climate change mitigation, offering dual benefits of carbon sequestration and enhanced food security. Our results underscore the potential of oyster farming to address global challenges such as rising food demand and ocean acidification, making it a critical component of sustainable marine resource management.",

          "abstract": "Isoniazid (INH) inhibits mycolic acid synthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) and is a cornerstone of treatment regimens against this deadly pathogen. However, over 10% of Mtb infections are INH-resistant. The compound C10 can sensitize clinically relevant INH-resistant mutants to killing by INH. Thus, understanding the mechanism of action for C10 could aid in designing new strategies for circumventing drug resistance. We find that C10 treatment reroutes carbon flux toward valine, drawing carbon away from gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle. As a result, C10 decreases cell envelope capsule thickness and blocks an accumulation of peptidoglycan precursors that occurs in response to INH treatment in an INH-resistant Mtb katG mutant. In this altered metabolic state induced by C10, INH treatment of the INH-resistant Mtb katG mutant inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, precipitating collapse of cell envelope integrity. Pyruvate supplementation relieves the C10-induced requirement for carbon flux toward valine, enhancing carbon assimilation into cell envelope precursors and restoring resistance to INH. In addition, we identify the formation of isoniazid-pyruvate in INH-treated katG W328L Mtb , where pyruvate sequesters INH, lowering the concentration of INH available to inhibit Mtb . Together, our findings reveal a bactericidal activity for INH in Mtb that can function in INH-resistant mutants independently of INH-mediated inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis. This activity for INH can be elicited by shifting carbon flux toward valine and away from cell envelope precursor synthesis, highlighting a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to kill INH-resistant Mtb .",

          "abstract": "Membrane proteins play crucial roles in numerous biological processes and are important drug targets. However, structural studies of membrane proteins often rely on solubilization with detergents, which may not accurately reflect their native states in a cellular context. Additionally, identifying suitable detergents for individual membrane proteins can be a detailed and time-consuming process. Here, we developed a vesicle-based method that preserves the native lipid environment for subsequent structural and functional studies. Using the bacterial multidrug efflux transporter AcrB as an example, we isolated AcrB-containing vesicles and determined its cryo-EM structure with all protomers in a loose (L) state at 3.88 Å by incorporating our micrograph-based sorting strategy. Notably, compared to the L-state AcrB in liposomes and nanoparticles, the exterior transmembrane helices (TMs) in our map exhibited superior quality, featuring a continuous and clear representation of lα, which is positioned horizontally within the lipid bilayer. We further expanded our method by identifying endogenous membrane proteins, including F-ATPase and respiratory complexes, in vesicles generated using mitochondria from pig hearts. The high-resolution structure of respiratory complex III in vesicles revealed a shared subunit nine between two monomers. Briefly, our method presents a promising and straightforward approach for studying the structure and function of membrane proteins in their native environment, eliminating the need for detergent screening and protein purification.",

          "abstract": "Sexual conflict over mating has been documented in many species, both in the field and in experimental studies. In pond damselflies (family Coenagrionidae), sexual conflict maintains female-limited color polymorphisms, with one female morph typically being a male mimic. However, it is not known whether sexual conflict can also explain the evolutionary origin of novel female morphs, and if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition, by modulating the strength of the conflict. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female color polymorphisms are more likely to evolve in temperate regions and open landscapes, whereas region and habitat shifts are independent of female-color states. We also show that these macroecological patterns are mediated by population densities at breeding sites. Temperate and open habitats are associated with female-polymorphic lineages because they harbor higher densities of adults, promoting more frequent encounters between females and males. Finally, we found that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. We conclude that female color polymorphisms evolve in a predictable fashion and are likely driven by ecological conditions that increase the rate of premating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual conflict.",

          "abstract": "Arsenite (As III ) is toxic to all organisms due to its ability to tightly bind exposed thiols within cells. An important As III resistance mechanism in prokaryotes involves proteins encoded by the ars operon. A central component of the ars operon in many bacteria is the cytoplasmic ATPase, ArsA, which orchestrates a series of nucleotide-dependent handoffs, starting with the capture of As III by the ArsD metallochaperone and culminating in its removal from the cell by the ArsB efflux pump. Although the mechanism of ArsA has been widely studied, the molecular details of how nucleotide hydrolysis modulates these events remain unclear. ArsA is an archetypal member of the intradimeric Walker A (IWA) family of ATPases, implicated in a diversity of complex biological functions. Conformational changes typical of IWA ATPases have been postulated to drive these molecular events but have not been demonstrated. We report cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ArsA in MgADP-bound and MgATP-bound open states, as well as a distinct closed MgATP-bound state liganded to As III . X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed three-coordinate binding of As III to the conserved cysteines at the metalloid-binding site of the closed state. Coupled with biochemical characterization, our cryo-EM structures reveal key conformational changes in the ArsA catalytic cycle consistent with other IWA ATPases and provide the structural basis for allosteric activation of nucleotide hydrolysis by As III . This work establishes how the nucleotide state of ArsA transiently creates a high-affinity binding site that can sequester metalloid within the cell, followed by a nucleotide-driven handoff to ArsB for efflux.",

          "abstract": "Redox-sensitive elements figure prominently in studies of the evolution of Earth’s surface redox state, including the first major rise in atmospheric O 2 , the Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event. Most Precambrian rocks endured multistage tectonothermal histories, however, adding ambiguity to interpretation of their chemistry. Here, we apply U-Th-Pb isotope geochronology to the highly oxidized ~2.06 Ga Kuetsjärvi Volcanic Formation, Pechenga Greenstone Belt, Russia, to constrain the age and extent of U oxidation. By contrasting the relative mobility of U and Th using Pb isotopes, we find that complete to near-complete oxidation and removal of U occurred shortly after eruption. We argue that this likely indicates relatively high atmospheric O 2 , where oxidative weathering and alteration produced a global pulse of U to the oceans. Such a pulse could explain widespread shifts in the U-Th-Pb isotope character of mantle reservoirs at ~2 Ga, including a decrease in the 232 Th/ 238 U ratio of the mid-ocean ridge basalt source and inception of the high- 238 U/ 204 Pb (HIMU) source to ocean island basalts, underscoring the connections between the redox character of the Paleoproterozoic surface and deep Earth. Using 207 Pb- 206 Pb, 238 U- 206 Pb, 235 U- 207 Pb, and 232 Th- 208 Pb geochronology, ~2.06 Ga oxidative loss of U may be distinguished from reintroduction of U at ~1.8 Ga during regional metamorphism, as well as Pb loss during a Phanerozoic tectonothermal event. Our results therefore establish the complex history of redox-sensitive element behavior in the rocks, highlighting the fact that elemental abundances, by themselves, are unlikely to capture straightforward proxy information in rocks that have seen multistage geologic histories.",

Rotaviruses (RVs) are nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses and the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children. We identified fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (encoded by FA2H ) in the fatty acid 2-hydroxylation pathway as a proviral gene that supports RV infection. Genetic ablation of FA2H interfered with an early step in RV entry for multiple human and animal strains. Intestinal epithelial cell–specific deletion of Fa2h limited RV replication and diarrhea incidence in vivo. Using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, we found that viral particles were trapped in early and late endosomes in FA2H knockout cells, preventing their further exit into the cytosol. The defect in RV infectivity could be partially restored by treatment of cells with long-chain 2-hydroxy ceramides or a calcium channel activator that promotes Ca 2+ efflux from endosomes. Both Junín virus, an arenavirus, and Shiga toxin, dependent on endosomal Ca 2+ transport, required FA2H for efficient entry. Together, this study highlights a role of fatty acid 2-hydroxylation in RV entry into host cells and implicates 2-hydroxy ceramides as potential key regulators of endosomal Ca 2+ levels, offering important insights for the development of host-directed therapies targeting fatty acid 2-hydroxylation to control microbial infections.",

          "abstract": "Coopetition is a term from game theory that describes a mix of cooperative and competitive behavior. The maternal–fetal interface (MFI) among eutherian mammals presents close interaction of two distinct individuals. These interactions have resulted in a remarkable diversity in MFI structure, often interpreted as the outcome of maternal–fetal conflict. Nevertheless, the fetus and the mother share evolutionary interests since 50% of fetal genes are maternal. In hemochorial species, characterized by invasive placentation, endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESFs) undergo decidualization to regulate embryo implantation. In great apes, hemochorial placentation is driven by highly invasive extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT). Here, using EVTs differentiated from trophoblast stem cells, term placenta, as well as HTR8/SVneo, we demonstrate that EVTs orchestrate a transformation of the maternal stroma, reducing its resistance to invasion acquired during decidualization. Through paracrine signals, in particular IL-11, trophoblasts transform decidual ESFs from a matrix-producing to a matrix-degrading state. Notably, noninvasive cytotrophoblast cells, do not transform decidual ESFs. We further provide evidence that maternal coadaptation is critical to EVT-induced decidual transformation. Decidual ESFs upregulate expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 in response to EVTs, rewiring downstream IL-11 signaling from JAK/STAT to AP-1 specific transcription. We conclude that the evolution of highly invasive placentation is the outcome of both the evolution of invasive EVTs, as well as the evolution of maternal traits, i.e., the switch from JAK/STAT to AP-1 signaling. We interpret this as evidence for co-opetition (cooperation among competitors).",

Here, we apply the CR–driven electron-induced reaction (CRE) theory of ozone depletion to obtain a quantitative understanding of spatiotemporal variations in Earth’s lower-stratospheric ozone (LSO) and temperature, which provide fingerprints for the mechanisms of ozone depletion and examine the impact of nonhalogen greenhouse gases on the ozone layer. We first show from observations that both LSO and temperature display pronounced 11-y cyclic variations over Antarctica and mid-latitudes, while weak (no apparent) cyclic variations over the tropics. These observations are consistent with the prediction by the CRE theory. Second, our no-parameter CRE theoretical calculations give the vertical profile of ozone loss in perfect agreement with observations at the Antarctic Syowa station and reproduce well the time-series variations of both LSO and temperature in the polar, mid-latitude, and tropical regions, including the previously reported large ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere over the tropics. The results also demonstrate that both LSO and temperature are controlled by CRs and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) only. Moreover, CRE calculations exhibit complex phenomena in future trends of LSO and temperature, which are strongly affected by the future trend of CR fluxes. The latter might even lead to almost no recovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica and no returning to the 1980 level over the tropics by 2100. This study greatly improves quantitative understanding of ozone depletion and climate in the global lower stratosphere and offers predictions on future trends.",

Recent advances in imaging technologies, such as “mother machines” for bacteria or yeast, have allowed long-term tracking of cell-size dynamics across many generations, and thus have brought major insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-size control. However, understanding the governing rules of cell growth and division within a quantitative dynamical-systems framework remains a major challenge. Here, we implement and apply a framework that makes it possible to infer stochastic-differential-equation models with Poisson noise directly from experimentally measured time series for cellular growth and division. To account for potential nonlinear memory effects, we parameterize the Poisson intensity of stochastic cell-division events in terms of both the cell’s current size and its ancestral history. By applying the algorithm to experimentally measured cell-size trajectories, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the linear one-step memory hypothesis underlying the popular “sizer,” “adder,” and “timer” models of cell homeostasis. For Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria, Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we find that in many cases, the inferred stochastic models have a substantial nonlinear memory component. This suggests a need to reevaluate and generalize some of the currently prevailing linear-memory paradigms of cell homeostasis. More broadly, the underlying inference framework is directly applicable to identify quantitative models for stochastic jump processes in a wide range of scientific disciplines.",

Here, we observe the cell behaviors of the murine neural crest in three dimensions over time and apply a free energy framework to more wholly understand why cells ingress. Guided by work on granular matter that provides a path by which to define the roles of stochastic mechanisms in nonequilibrium systems, we measured and manipulated biophysical parameters in vivo. The data suggest that an energy barrier to cell ingression is overcome by a combination of relatively favorable cell adhesion energies, high cell shape fluctuations, and entropic cell packing configurations. Under those conditions, cell ingression may proceed spontaneously. Recognized biophysical cues likely tilt these parameters to make the process more robust. The results imply that dissipative mechanisms which transiently disorder tissue may underlie some morphogenetic events.

Extensive studies have made significant progress in explaining the physics behind their propulsion in cruising by developing scaling laws of their flight kinematics. Notably Strouhal number ( St ; ratio of flapping frequency times stroke amplitude to cruising speed) has been found to fall in a narrow range for animal cruising flights. However, St exhibits strong correlation to flight conditions; as such, its universality has been confined to preferred flight conditions. Since the leading-edge vortices (LEV) on flapping appendages generate the majority of propulsive forces, here we take the perspective of LEV circulation maximization, which generalizes the dimensionless vortex formation time to flapping flight. The generalized vortex formation time scales the duration of vorticity injection with the rate of total vorticity growth inside the LEV and the maximum vorticity allowed inside it. By comparing the new scaling with St of previously reported animal cruising flights of 28 species, we show that the generalized vortex formation time is consistent across different animals and cruising locomotion, independent of flight conditions. This finding advances the fundamental principles underlying the complex wing kinematics of biological flyers and highlights a unifying framework for understanding biolocomotion.",

However, the rapid dynamics and highly localized nature of SB propagation present significant challenges for direct observation of their atomistic mechanisms using experimental techniques. In this study, we employ hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of SB propagation in Mg 65 Cu 25 Y 10 MGs, prepared using cooling rates as slow as 10 4 K s −1 —comparable to experimental casting conditions and significantly slower than the 10 10 K s −1 rates previously employed in atomistic simulations. Our results reveal a qualitative shift in SB propagation mechanisms as the structural state evolves with decreasing cooling rates. In hyperquenched MGs, SB propagation occurs intermittently, characterized by a “stop-and-go” motion driven by sequential activation and coalescence of multiple shear transformation zones (STZs) separated by vortex-like fields. In contrast, slowly cooled MGs exhibit continuous and rapid SB propagation, mediated by localized shear softening and the formation of large vortex fields, indicative of a more collective structural response. This transition arises from significant differences in the number density and spatial distribution of activated STZs across different structural states. These findings provide insights into the microscopic dynamics of SB initiation and propagation in MGs, highlighting how the structural state can be strategically tuned to control SB behavior. This opens up different opportunities for optimizing the mechanical performance of MGs for targeted engineering applications.",

          "abstract": "How drugs penetrate tissues is poorly understood yet important, since drugs that fail to reach their target will be ineffective. We followed the fate of anthracycline cancer drugs at high resolution by exploiting their intrinsic fluorescence. In a cell-based spheroid model, the soluble compound fluorescein penetrates the entire spheroid, unlike hydrophobic fluorescent lipids, which only enter the outermost cell layer. Anthracyclines have intermediate hydrophobicity. They enter the nucleus of a few outer cell layers at neutral pH, but penetrate the spheroids more deeply under acidic conditions, with a reduction in cell entry and cytotoxicity. The glycolytic conditions that prevail in the tumor microenvironment may thus limit cell entry and contribute to anthracycline drug resistance. We evaluated a library of anthracycline variants to determine the physicochemical properties related to tissue penetration depth. We find that this is determined by only three chemical properties: molar refractivity, topological polar surface area, and water solubility. Our findings suggest that modifications of anthracyclines may improve access and activity to deeply tissue-embedded targets such as pancreatic cancer.",

          "abstract": "Reconstructing carbon release fluxes during ancient climatic warming events is important for improving predictions of carbon cycle and climate dynamics under future anthropogenic warming scenarios. We investigate the extent of biogenic methane release and its contribution to climate variability across the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) approximately 183 million years ago. To do this, we developed a global biogeochemical model and applied a Bayesian inversion using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Based on a high-resolution record of carbon isotope excursions from the Yorkshire section, our results indicate that a release of at least 4,700 Gt carbon from biogenic CH 4 (with a carbon isotopic composition, δ 13 C of −50 to −70‰) is necessary to accurately reproduce the pronounced pulsed shift in the δ 13 C, as well as the inferred changes in atmospheric p CO 2 and global temperature. This massive methane release may have led to a substantial increase in atmospheric p CH 4 and contributed to additional global surface warming, perhaps by more than 2 °C. We further elucidate that the liberation of methane may have been facilitated by an upsurge in methanogenesis alongside a concomitant decline in methane oxidation within organic-rich, sulfate-depleted marine environments. An active CH 4 cycle represents a positive feedback mechanism that exacerbates environmental deterioration during climatic warming events, ultimately contributing to mass extinction of marine life.",

          "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a prevalent joint disease in the aging population. The hallmark of osteoarthritis is the degeneration of the joint cartilage, characterized by changes in chondrocytes including mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise mechanisms of how this affects chondrocyte homeostasis and whether such processes can be explored as therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis remain unclear. Here, we show that impaired mitochondrial function and disrupted cartilage matrix metabolism due to loss of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) expression in chondrocytes leads to the development of osteoarthritis. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a key regulator of mitochondrial function, plays a critical role in modulating MFN2 to restore mitochondrial dynamics, reduce fragmentation, and preserve mitochondrial function in chondrocytes. Specifically, SIRT3 directly deacetylates and indirectly deubiquitinates MFN2, preventing its degradation. MFN2-mediated mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions support cellular homeostasis, alleviate ER stress, and maintain mitochondrial calcium ion balance, which collectively mitigate chondrocyte senescence. Extracellular vesicles engineered with MFN2 mRNA effectively prevented cartilage degeneration and restored mobility in osteoarthritic mice. These findings suggest that targeting MFN2 is a promising strategy to prevent cartilage degeneration and alleviate progression of osteoarthritis.",

          "abstract": "As global climate change exacerbates extreme heat events, the interplay between heat stress and blast disease resistance in rice remains poorly understood. In this study, through integrated transcriptome profiling and systematic phenotyping of mutants in several thermosensory pathways, we identified HsfA1 as a positive regulator of heat priming–enhanced blast resistance in rice. Systematic analysis of microRNA (miRNA) dynamics, bioinformatics prediction, and RNA pull-down experiments revealed that miR444b.2 , a temperature-responsive miRNA, directly suppresses the expression of HsfA1 by targeting the second exon of HsfA1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Genetic analyses demonstrated that heat stress–mediated suppression of miR444b.2 expression relieves the repression of HsfA1 , thereby enhancing blast resistance in rice. Furthermore, HsfA1 directly binds to the promoter of AOC1 , a key jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis gene, to activate its expression. Knockout of HsfA1 or AOC1 abolishes heat priming–enhanced JA accumulation and blast disease resistance, and the phenotypes are largely restored via AOC1 overexpression and MeJA treatment. Further identification of HsfA1 natural variants and generation of the HsfA1 uORF -edited lines with improved blast resistance offer potential strategies for breeding disease-resistant rice varieties. This study elucidates the miR444b.2 –HsfA1– AOC1 module that links thermal sensing to JA-mediated blast resistance, providing a molecular blueprint for engineering climate-resilient crops with concurrent biotic–abiotic stress tolerance.",

Proteolytic removal of the evolutionarily added N-terminal variable region of cardiac TnT, as occurs in acute ventricular contractility-afterload mismatch, brings back a TnI-like molecular conformation and function to reduce ventricular systolic velocity, elongates ejection time, and sustains stroke volume. Investigating the underlying mechanism found in addition to the two previously known tropomyosin (Tm)-binding sites another Tm-binding site in the highly conserved C-terminal end segment of TnT, which is also an F-actin binding site. Its functionality is retained in the form of free peptide with an effect on cardiac muscle contractile kinetics.

          "abstract": "Across taxonomical domains, synonymous codons of an amino acid are found to be used at unequal frequencies within genomes. This codon usage bias (CUB) is highly variable across species. Genome-wide CUB reflects a balance between adaptive and nonadaptive microevolutionary processes within a species. Variation in microevolutionary processes results in across-species variation in CUB. As CUB is tightly linked to important molecular and biophysical processes, it is critical to understand how changes to these processes are linked to changes in microevolutionary processes. We employed a population genetics model to quantify natural selection and mutation biases on a per-codon basis across the Saccharomycotina budding yeast subphylum. We find that the strength of natural selection and mutation biases varied significantly between closely related yeasts. Across-species variation in natural selection reflected the evolution of tRNA gene copy number (tGCN). Additionally, we find that changes to tRNA modification expression can contribute to changes in natural selection across species independent of changes to tGCN. Both lines of evidence support the link between the evolution of the tRNA pool and natural selection in codon usage through changes in the translation efficiency of a codon. Furthermore, we show that changes to tGCN often reflected changes in genome-wide GC%, suggesting changes in the tRNA pool reflect changes in mutation biases. Our work establishes how changes in microevolutionary processes impact changes in molecular mechanisms, ultimately shaping the macroevolutionary variation of a trait.",

          "abstract": "Membrane active peptides (MAPs) represent a diverse group of agents that disrupt the integrity of lipid membranes. One class of MAPs, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), destroy bacteria by transiently porating the bacterial membrane causing leakage of cellular contents. Transient leakage is classified as “graded,” where all vesicles in a population leak partially, or “all-or-none,” where some vesicles leak completely. However, the molecular interactions underlying transient leakage have eluded experimental determination. Here, dye leakage experiments with the AMP piscidin 1 (P1) show that graded leakage can be converted to all-or-none by simply adding a defect-promoting lysophospholipid. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that area stress arising from membrane asymmetry decreases the energy of pore formation and is highly lipid dependent. Furthermore, lipids and peptides translocate the bilayer through these pores, leading to area-relaxed states where poration is highly unfavorable. Even pores too small to leak dye relieve area stress; they are the “none” component of all-or-none release. These observations lead to development of a quantitative model where graded and all-or-none leakage are treated as a continuum explained by a single mechanism that accounts for the local peptide concentration and probabilities of different pore sizes. This unified model accurately reproduces the P1 dye leakage data and provides an explanation for varying pore energy, size, and probability within the framework of asymmetry-driven poration. This model is expected to be applicable to other MAPs, including cell-penetrating peptides, and could provide a framework for designing peptides with greater cellular specificity, a long-sought outcome.",

          "abstract": "With No lysine (K) 1 (WNK1) is essential for ion and volume homeostasis, sensing osmotic stress and activating pathways that regulate ion transport. Its response to osmotic stress shares similarities with the function of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In this study, we show that Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, activates WNK1 downstream kinase targets oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related serine, proline-, and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in endothelial cells within minutes. Ionophore-induced Ca 2+ influx similarly triggers their activation. Comparable responses were observed in HDMEC, HUVEC, A549, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells. Hypotonic stress also enhances SPAK and OSR1 phosphorylation, which is attenuated by WNK1 inhibition or Piezo1 knockdown, whereas hypertonic stress-induced phosphorylation is not affected by Piezo1 knockdown. Chelating Ca 2+ or depleting intracellular stores prevents their activation, while increasing intracellular Ca 2+ via the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger or thapsigargin enhances it. ER-released Ca 2+ is sufficient to activate SPAK and OSR1 even in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ , and this effect is diminished by Piezo1 knockdown. Both Yoda1 and ionomycin promote phosphorylation of WNK1 at serine 382, a modification that increases its catalytic activity. These findings identify Piezo1 as an activator of WNK1, linking Ca 2+ dynamics to WNK1-OSR1/SPAK signaling.",

          "abstract": "Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles as the liquid pressure is reduced below the saturated vapor pressure, often requires a substantial negative relative pressure in a pure liquid. Classical nucleation theory (CNT) provides an estimate for the rate of cavitation but there is often a disconnect between the predictions at the molecular scale compared to observations at the macroscale. We report on mesoscale simulations of cavitation based on many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD), a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD), which bridges the two scales. A liquid layer is confined between smooth planar walls at a constant temperature, while the pressure is reduced slowly by expanding the wall-bounded domain. The wetting properties of the liquid are determined by the parameters of the interaction potentials. With hydrophilic walls, homogeneous nucleation is observed in the liquid bulk. As a bubble forms and grows, it creates a strong pressure pulse and oscillations that cause other bubbles that may have formed slightly later to collapse. For a nearly neutral wall with a contact angle close to 90 ° , heterogeneous nucleation occurs at the walls at a smaller negative pressure and generates weaker pressure oscillations. With hydrophobic walls or seed particles, heterogeneous nucleation readily occurs, where fluctuations and the merger of transient surface bubbles are significant.",

In the present study, we demonstrate that dormant breast cancer cells lodged in the lungs reside in a highly mesenchymal, nonproliferative phenotypic state. The awakening of these cells is not triggered by a cancer cell-autonomous process. Instead, lung inflammation induced by the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin effectively awakens dormant cancer cells, providing useful models for studying metastatic awakening. Mechanistically, the awakened cells shift from a highly mesenchymal to a quasi-mesenchymal phenotypic state in which they acquire tumorigenicity and proliferative ability. Once awakened, these cells can stably reside in this quasi-mesenchymal state and maintain their tumor-initiating ability, doing so without ongoing heterotypic signaling from the lung microenvironment. Epidermal growth factor receptor ligands released by the cells of the injured tissue microenvironment, including notably M2 type macrophages, promote dormant cancer cells to move toward this quasi-mesenchymal state, a transition that is critical for the awakening process. An understanding of the mechanisms of metastatic awakening may lead in the future to treatment strategies designed to prevent such awakening and resulting metastatic relapse.",

This gene exhibits inducible expression following missing-tissue injury in a back-and-forth manner between myosin + muscular cells and piwi-1 + stem cells. The dynamic expression of pdgfl is induced through the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) signaling over short distances. Suppression of pdgfl expression impairs the regrowth of essential structures, including the intestine and central nervous system. Evidence on the decrease of notum and sfrp-1 at the anterior pole, together with the accumulation of myoD + PIWI-1 + progenitors, suggests a role of pdgfl in pole muscular cell differentiation.

The SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 structure reveals how UCB1244283 allosterically enhances BRV binding by occupying an allosteric site near the primary binding site, preventing BRV dissociation. This allosteric site, formed by hydrophobic and uncharged residues, is an uncharacterized small-molecule binding site in SV2A. Structural analysis and mutagenesis demonstrate that an allosteric network between the primary and allosteric sites governs high-affinity ASM binding. Our studies suggest that UCB1244283 selectively binds SV2A over SV2B and SV2C, with specific mutations disrupting binding. Structures of SV2A-UCB-J and SV2A-UCB7361 show that UCB1244283 binding is only possible when the primary site ligand does not overlap with the allosteric site, and that repositioning of Ser601, Thr605, and Leu655 is critical for allosteric ligand binding. Structural comparison of multiple SV2A complexes reveals that primary site occupancy shapes the conformation of the lumenal half of the transmembrane domain, influencing how UCB1244283 binds via a connected network that differentially stabilizes TM1 in either an open or closed conformation and repositions key allosteric and primary site residues.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in metastatic progression, yet their molecular diversity and upstream regulators remain poorly defined. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), overexpressed in subsets of tumors including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is implicated in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified GPNMB as a marker of immunosuppressive TAMs associated with poor prognosis, but its mechanistic role in TNBC has remained unclear. Coculturing monocytic cells with three-dimensional TNBC spheres induced GPNMB + TAMs expressing sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9). Tumor-expressed GPNMB promotes monocyte-to-TAM polarization by inducing secondary GPNMB expression in monocytes, establishing a feed-forward amplification loop. GPNMB knockdown in TNBC cells inhibited immunosuppressive TAM subsets, including Siglec-9 + and EMT-associated populations, as determined by deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using a custom TAM signature matrix derived from publicly available TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. TNBC-derived GPNMB carried α2,3-sialylation, whereas macrophage-derived GPNMB carried α2,6-sialylation, enabling differential Siglec-9 recognition. Elevated GPNMB and Siglec-9 correlated with poor prognosis in TNBCcohorts. Importantly, dual inhibition of Siglec-E (murine Siglec-9 ortholog) and PD-1 reduced tumor stemness, suppressed IL-6-dependent EMT, and limited lung metastasis in vivo.

          "abstract": "While it has been appreciated for decades that lysosomes can import cysteine, its significance for whole-organism physiology has remained uncertain. Recent work identified MFSD12 as a transmembrane protein required for cysteine import into lysosomes (and melanosomes), enabling genetic interrogation of this pathway. Here, we show that Mfsd12 knockout mice die between embryonic days 10.5 and 12.5, indicating that MFSD12 is essential for organogenesis. Mfsd12 loss results in the expression of genes involved in cellular stress and thiol metabolism and likely disproportionately affects the erythroid, myeloid, and neuronal lineages. Within lysosomes, imported cysteine is largely oxidized to cystine, which is exported to the cytosol by the cystinosin (CTNS) transporter. However, unlike Mfsd12 , loss of Ctns is compatible with viability, suggesting that the essential role of MFSD12 lies not in supplying cystine to the cytosol, but in providing reduced cysteine within the lysosomal lumen. Supporting this model, maternal treatment with cysteamine—a lysosome-penetrant thiol—rescued the development of Mfsd12 knockout embryos, yielding viable adult offspring. These findings establish lysosomal thiol import as a critical metabolic pathway and provide genetic tools to further clarify its physiological and biochemical roles.",

Local electromagnetic fields, that usually produced by current in micro/nanoscale metal wires, have been employed for the coherent driving and addressing of spin qubit. However, the fixed distribution limits the spatial selectivity and efficiency of qubit manipulation, which is of central importance in a scaled-up quantum system. Here, we report a solution by demonstrating a reconfigurable current with arbitrary shape to engineer microwave and DC magnetic field at microscale. A “photothermal doping” method was proposed to optically control local insulator-to-metal transition in vanadium dioxide.

Universal manipulation and selective addressing of spins at arbitrary sites are realized, by freely changing the filament and electromagnetic field on demand.

These instruments first map the methane enhancement field and then combine this information with the effective wind speed to estimate the source emission rate. This wind speed is typically the largest uncertainty in derived emission rates. It is often, by necessity, inferred from coarse-resolution meteorological reanalysis products which do not match the spatial or temporal extent of wind experienced by the gas plume. Here, we circumvent this problem by simultaneously measuring plume velocity using the same spectrometer that maps the methane plume. Our approach acquires multiple consecutive views of the same point source, with visual tracking of the plume’s features to estimate its ground velocity. This resolves the representational mismatch between reanalysis and effective wind speeds. It provides data with exact spatiotemporal coincidence to the plume being measured. The approach facilitates dramatic improvement in the precision of remote methane point source quantification.",

Their creation and disintegration are defined by a singularity that separates a topologically distinct extended liquid film from a boundary-free closed shell. Such topology-changing processes are of fundamental interest. They are also essential for intercellular transport, transcellular communication, and drug delivery. However, studies of vesicle formation are challenging because of the rapid dynamics and small length scale involved. We develop fluid colloidosomes, micrometer-sized analogues of lipid vesicles. The mechanics of colloidosomes and lipid vesicles are described by the same theoretical model. We study colloidosomes close to their disk-to-sphere topological transition. Intrinsic colloidal length and time scales slow down the dynamics to reveal colloidosome conformations in real time during their assembly and disassembly. Remarkably, the lowest-energy pathway by which a closed vesicle transforms into a flat disk involves a topologically distinct cylinder-like intermediate. These results reveal aspects of topological changes that are relevant to all liquid capsules. They also provide a robust platform for the encapsulation, transport, and delivery of nanosized cargoes.",

Across multiple cell lines and genomic loci, CRISPR LNP–SNAs induce insertion–deletion mutations at average frequencies two- to three-fold higher than those observed with LNPs. When codelivered with donor templates, CRISPR LNP–SNAs enable homology-directed repair at an average efficiency of 21 ± 7%, a 2.5-fold improvement over LNPs (8 ± 4%).

However, conventional approaches typically rely on fluorescence detection of single-enzyme reactions, which limits molecular selectivity and the ability to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To address these limitations, we developed a digital bioanalysis platform based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy and microchamber arrays decorated with silver nanoparticles. This platform achieves a million-fold amplification of Raman signals from products generated by single-enzyme reactions, enabling precise digital counting of enzyme biomarkers with high molecular selectivity and multiplexing capability. We applied this platform to detect and distinguish two closely related enzyme biomarkers, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase. By leveraging the sharp and distinct Raman spectral signatures of the reaction products, the platform achieved multiplexed biomarker quantification with femtomolar-level sensitivity. As a proof-of-concept, the platform successfully quantified AChE in human cerebrospinal fluid within 8.5 min, highlighting its potential utility in clinical diagnostics, particularly for differentiating types of dementia based on subtle differences in enzyme levels. Hence, this study presents a valuable alternative to fluorescence-based digital bioanalysis by offering enhanced molecular selectivity and multiplexing capability. Its application extends the scope of digital bioanalysis and broadens its capacity to quantify multiple biomarkers in complex biological samples with high precision and efficiency.",

We identified a candidate that binds the essential lipid A component of gram-negative lipopolysaccharide. Nonetheless, this nanobody required a weakened outer membrane to access its target and elicit its toxic activity. Borrowing from observations of innate immune proteins, we found that resurfacing nanobodies with positively charged residues enabled them to bind and perturb the gram-negative outer membrane, but this alone was not sufficient for toxic activity. However, when we resurface our lipid A-targeting nanobody, it gained the ability to disrupt the outer membrane and enact its antibacterial function against wild-type bacteria. This development of a dual-function nanobody that can reach and bind previously inaccessible gram-negative targets introduces a route for antimicrobial biologic advancement.",

          "abstract": "The exclusion of T cells causes immune escape of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). T cell exclusion is mediated by the interaction between CXCR4 on T cells and its ligand, CXCL12, which is complexed to keratin-19 (KRT19) on the surface of PDA cells. KRT19 secretion by PDA cells is essential to this process but is unusual because KRT19 lacks an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-directing signal peptide (SP). By using biotinylation by an ER-restricted TurboID system and a split-GFP assay in PDA cells, we demonstrate that KRT19 enters the ER via its “head” domain. Additionally, KRT19 is shown to interact with the signal recognition particle and its secretion is sensitive to canonical protein secretion inhibitors. In vivo, mouse tumors formed with ER-TurboID-expressing PDA cells contain biotinylated KRT19. In contrast, keratin-8 (KRT8), which colocalizes with KRT19 on the surface of PDA cells, does not enter the ER. Rather, KRT8 is externalized via secretory autophagy possibly in a complex with KRT19. Thus, despite lacking a classical SP, PDA cells secrete KRT19 to capture CXCL12 and protect against immune attack.",

We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets.

          "abstract": "The discovery of paleo-meanders on Mars and debates about the occurrence of meandering on prevegetation early Earth have stimulated field studies of channel morphology and deposit stratigraphy in arid environments. They show that mud can provide the cohesive strength to retard outer bank erosion, enabling inner bank lateral accretion (including mud deposition) to keep pace and thus sustain meandering. The process by which mud is deposited in the lateral accretion deposits, however, is poorly known. Building on previous fieldwork in the muddy meandering Quinn River, we use Delft3D and the Partheniades–Krone model for cohesive sediment transport to predict erosion and deposition patterns in a 2,300 m long reach. While flocculation of mud increases the settling velocity and hence the likelihood of deposition, the standard metric for distinguishing washload from suspended load, (i.e. settling velocity to shear velocity ratio), does not indicate relative deposition rate. Mud deposition is driven by the product of settling velocity times basal concentration: w s c b . Relatively low w s but high c b can induce deposition. We show that with sufficiently high basal concentrations, significant net lateral accretion deposition occurs in areas where elevated flocculation settling velocities are &gt; 100 times lower than the local shear velocity. Observed grain size distributions of lateral accretion deposits are predicted. Just by introducing a period of elevated mud load with no change in discharge creates a distinct muddy interbed. Our model points to multiple ways lateral accretion deposits can vary sedimentologically, including creating mud-sand couplets, and lead to single thread, active meandering channels in muddy rivers.",

However, there is a shortage of molecular tools that enable the discovery of potential drug targets within schistosomes. Thus, praziquantel has remained the frontline treatment for schistosomiasis despite known liabilities. Here, we have conducted a genome-wide study in Schistosoma mansoni using the human druggable genome as a bioinformatic template to identify essential genes within schistosomes bearing similarity to catalogued drug targets. Then, we assessed these candidate targets in silico using a set of unbiased criteria to determine which possess ideal characteristics for a ready-made drug discovery campaign. Following this prioritization, we pursued a parasite p97 ortholog as a bona-fide drug target for the development of therapeutics to treat schistosomiasis. From this effort, we identified a covalent inhibitor series that kills schistosomes through an on-target killing mechanism by disrupting the ubiquitin proteasome system. Fascinatingly, these inhibitors induce a conformational change in the conserved D2 domain P-loop of schistosome p97 upon modification of Cys519. This conformational change reveals an allosteric binding site adjacent to the D2 domain active site reminiscent of the “DFG” flip in protein kinases. This allosteric binding site can potentially be utilized to generate new classes of species-selective p97 inhibitors. Furthermore, these studies provide a resource for the development of alternative therapeutics for schistosomiasis and a workflow to identify potential drug targets in similar systems with few available molecular tools.",

Highlighting the importance of FcγR-mediated signaling in the regulation of the fate, activation, and differentiation status of leukocytes, FcγRs are ubiquitously expressed by nearly all leukocyte populations. Here, we report that while at steady state, T cells are negative for all classes of FcγRs, CD8 T cells specifically induce the expression of the activating FcγR, FcγRIIIa, in response to viral infection in cohorts of COVID-19 and dengue patients, as well as in virus infection models using FcγR humanized mouse strains. In in vivo mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that induction of FcγRIIIa expression on effector CD8 T cells follows a well-defined trajectory that closely tracks the course and magnitude of the immune response, while immune resolution is characterized by receptor downregulation. Uniquely to these CD8 T cells, FcγRIIIa crosslinking alone is paradoxically insufficient to elicit T cell activation and cytotoxicity. However, when coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, it results in synergistic cellular activation and, compensates for the downregulation of canonical costimulatory molecules on terminal effector CD8 T cells. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role for FcγRIIIa as a unique costimulatory molecule that synergizes with TCR signaling to lower the effective threshold required for CD8 T cell activation, highlighting the role of virally induced antibodies in modulating CD8 effector cell responses.",

However, while their descriptive value seems to be well established, they have not been compared regarding their possible adaptive value. In this study, we address this gap by simulating reinforcement learning agents in a variety of environments with a variant of an evolutionary algorithm. Our results show that positivity bias (in the form of asymmetric update) is evolutionary stable in many situations, while the emergence of gradual perseveration is less systematic and robust. Overall, our results illustrate that biases can be adaptive and selected by evolution, in an environment-specific manner.",

Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for variational quantum eigensolver or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical central processing unit/graphical processing unit) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, which is passed as input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator.

          "abstract": "Environmental stimuli, including the exposure to ultraviolet (UV)-B light, are known to play a role in the modulation of immune-mediated mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS). In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we have shown that UV-B irradiation ameliorates disease outcome by regulatory T cells (Treg) expansion. Moreover, the UV-B-mediated induction of Treg numbers was also observed in MS. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) can be activated by environmental factors including UV-B-induced photoproducts of tryptophan. Thus, we investigated the role of AhR during the transmission of UV-B irradiation. Therefore, wild-type (WT) and AhR-deficient mice (AhR –/– ) were irradiated with UV-B light and immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-peptide. In WT mice it was shown that UV-B irradiation reduces EAE symptoms by Treg expansion. This effect was abrogated in animals with AhR deficiency. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of AhR regulation, we used mice with a deletion of AhR specifically in different subsets of antigen-presenting cells (APC) that have been shown to mediate the expansion of Treg. Interestingly, we could show that the AhR activation in murine cutaneous APC was sufficient to switch APC from a stimulatory into a regulatory phenotype, and moreover, responsible for APC cell maturation and migration into regional lymph nodes. Thus, our data indicate that AhR activation in APC might be required for UV-B-mediated immunosuppression during MOG-induced EAE. Hence, activation of AHR in tissue-resident APC, potentially by low-dose UV-B irradiation, might be beneficial as an adjuvant treatment in inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.",

However, empirical and theoretical treatments of the niche are mostly performed at the species level, neglecting individuals as important units of ecological and evolutionary processes. So far, a formal mathematical link between individual-level niches and higher organismal-level niches has been lacking, hampering the unification of ecological theories and more accurate forecasts of biodiversity change. To fill in this gap, we propose a bottom–up approach to derive population and higher organismal-level niches from individual niches. We demonstrate the power of our framework by showing that 1) the statistical properties of higher organismal-level niches (e.g., niche breadth, skewness, etc.) can be partitioned into individual contributions and 2) the species-level niche shifts can be estimated by tracing the responses of individuals. By using individual-level GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking data from three different species, we show that climate change could have contrasting consequences on population-level niche shift depending on individual niche compositions. Our method paves the way for a unifying niche theory and enables mechanistic assessments of organism–environment relationships across organismal scales.",

          "abstract": "In recent years the functionality of synthetic active microparticles has edged even closer to that of their biological counterparts. However, we still lack the understanding needed to recreate at the microscale key features of autonomous behavior exhibited by microorganisms or swarms of macroscopic robots. In this study, we propose a model for a three-dimensional deformable cellular composite particle consisting of self-propelled rod-shaped colloids confined within a flexible vesicle—representing a superstructure we call a “flexicle” that couples particle deformation to the internal dynamics of the internal active components. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the collective behavior of dense systems composed of many flexicles. We show that individual flexicles exhibit shape changes upon collisions with other flexicles that lead to rearrangements of the internal active rods, which slows flexicle motion. This shape deformability gives rise to a diverse set of motility-induced phase separation phenomena and the spontaneous flow of flexicles reminiscent of the migration of cells in dense tissues. Our findings establish a foundation for designing responsive, cell-like active particles and developing strategies for controlling swarm migration and other autonomous swarm behaviors at cellular and colloidal scales.",

          "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence shows that some diseases tend to co-occur; more exactly, certain groups of patients with a given disease are at a higher risk of developing a specific secondary condition. Here, we develop an approach to generate a disease network that uses the accumulating RNA-seq data on human diseases to significantly match an unprecedented proportion of known comorbidities, providing plausible biological models for such co-occurrences and effectively mirroring the underlying structure of complex disease relationships. Furthermore, 64% of the known disease pairs can be explained by analyzing groups of patients with similar expression profiles, highlighting the importance of patient stratification in the study of comorbidities. These results solidly support the existence of molecular mechanisms behind many of the known comorbidities, with most captured co-occurrences implicating the immune system. Additionally, we identified new and potentially underdiagnosed comorbidities, providing molecular insights that could inform targeted therapeutic strategies.

          "abstract": "12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX, Alox15 ) generates bioactive oxygenated lipids during inflammation, however its homeostatic role(s) in normal healing are unclear. Here, the role of 12/15-LOX in resolving skin wounds was elucidated, focusing on how its lipids act together in physiologically relevant amounts. In mice, wounding caused acute appearance of 12/15-LOX-expressing macrophages and stem cells, coupled to early generation of ~12 monohydroxy-oxylipins and enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPL). Alox15 deletion increased collagen deposition, stem cell/fibroblast proliferation, IL6/pSTAT3, pSMAD3, and interferon (IFN)-γ levels. Conversely, CD206 expression, F480+ cells, and MMP9 and MMP2 activities were reduced. Alox15 −/− skin was deficient in PPARγ/adiponectin activity. Furthermore, while pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated as normal during wounding, many including Il6, Il1b, ccl4, Cd14, Cd274, Clec4d, Clec4e, Csf3, Cxcl2, and miR-21 failed to revert to baseline during healing, indicating disruption of PPARγ’s anti-inflammatory brake on NLRP3/inflammasome and TGF-β signaling. Reconstituting Alox15 −/− wounds with a physiological mixture of Alox15 -derived primary oxylipins generated by healing wounds restored MMP and dampened collagen deposition. The oxylipin mixture activated the PPARγ response element in vitro, while in vivo, its coactivator, Helz2 , was significantly upregulated as well as several fatty acid and prostaglandin PPARγ ligands. Additional inflammatory and proliferative gene networks impacted by Alox15 −/− included Elf4, Cebpb , and Tcf3. In summary, 12/15-LOX generates abundant monohydroxy oxylipins that act together via PPARγ. The identification of multiple gene alterations reveals several targets for treating nonhealing wounds. Our studies demonstrate that 12/15-LOX oxylipins act in concert, dampening inflammation in vivo, revealing the need to consider lipid signaling holistically.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages often pervade solid tumors, and clusters of macrophages sometimes associate with longer survival of patients. However, clustering mechanisms and impacts on key functions such as phagocytosis remain obscure. Here, under conditions that maximize cancer cell phagocytosis within cohesive tumors, we uncover pathways that favor dynamic clusters and find a colocalization of tumor-intrusive pseudopodia which we term “intrudopodia.” Cluster formation over hours on low-adhesion substrates occurs after macrophage induction to a state colloquially referred to as M1 after exposure to interferons and T cell–derived cytokines. Clusters prove fluid on timescales of minutes and also sort from interleukin-4-treated, so-called M2 macrophages that tend to disperse. M1 macrophages upregulate specific cell–cell adhesion receptors but suppress actomyosin contractility, with both pathways contributing to cluster formation. Decreased cortical tension was not only reflected in a low level of nuclear lamin-A that downregulates cytoskeletal targets of serum response factor and tends to soften the nucleus but was also predicted to unleash pseudopodia. Macrophage neighbors in tumor spheroids indeed coextend intrudopodia between cancer cell junctions—at least when phagocytosis conditions are maximized. Intrudopodia from neighbors help detach and individualize cancer cells for rapid engulfment. Juxtaposition of a macrophage cluster with tumor cell nests defines a broad interface that minimizes cancer cell nearest neighbor interactions and maximizes coordination of macrophage intrudopodia. Cooperative phagocytosis thus overcomes solid tumor cohesion—and might explain why the macrophage clustering factor ITGAL associates with patient survival.",

We used a hybrid two-step perovskite deposition method that is compatible with industry-standard textured silicon, incorporating a perovskite surface treatment based on 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide. The interaction of this molecule with the perovskite surface increased the majority charge carrier concentration at the electron-selective contact, which reduced interfacial recombination. Simultaneously, this field-effect passivation increased the electron concentration across the entire intrinsic perovskite absorber, which increased conductivity and reduced transport losses. Combined, this yields high-performance, fully-textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 2.01 volts, and an extended outdoor stability in the Red Sea Coast.",

The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H 2 ) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H 2 dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H 2 dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO 2 to ethane in &gt;99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in &gt;99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.",

RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specific Retnlg deletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia.",

Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and local geodetic and seismic data, we show that the 1000-kilometer-distant, February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in southeastern Türkiye triggered deformation and/or eruption at 56 mud volcanoes and centimeter-scale aseismic slip on seven faults over tens of kilometers within the fluid-rich Kura Basin in the West Caspian region. This transient deformation event, with an equivalent moment magnitude of 6.1, was coupled with local inflation below major hydrocarbon fields. We postulate that seismic waves led to a change in pore pressure at depth, which in turn triggered aseismic slip along several crustal faults crossing the basin and its surroundings.",

          "abstract": "Diamond and adamantane ( Ad ) share a T d -symmetric carbon skeleton, but converting Ad to diamond has been challenging because it requires selective carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bond cleavage and monomer assembly into a diamond lattice. Our approach differs from the conventional high-temperature, high-pressure diamond syntheses. We electron-irradiated Ad submicrocrystals at 80 to 200 kilo–electron volts and 100 to 296 kelvin in vacuum for tens of seconds. This process yielded defect-free nanodiamonds (NDs) of cubic crystal structure, accompanied by hydrogen gas evolution. Time-resolved transmission electron microscopy revealed the initial formation of Ad oligomers transforming into spherical NDs. A sizable kinetic isotope effect indicates that C–H cleavage was rate-determining, and other hydrocarbons tested failed to form NDs.",

          "abstract": "Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers and binary black hole eccentricity and provide early warnings for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today’s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave observatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control systems.",

Although similar geometry-induced phenomena in chiral organic molecule-based systems were observed, synthesizing uniform inorganic nanostructures with desired chirality using a scalable method remains challenging. We electrochemically synthesized chiral ferromagnetic cobalt-iron nanohelices from nanoparticles in anodized aluminum oxide templates. The spiral directions and the number of strands were regulated by incorporating chiral molecules and applying an appropriate potential. We demonstrate the observation of Faraday’s law of induction at the nanoscale and show how chiral nanohelices regulate the electron flow direction. The implications of our findings extend to the technological realm, with chirality- and ferromagnetism-based spin-tunable devices.",

          "abstract": "Cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.",

We analyzed the recent (1/21/22 – 03/20/25) continuous seismic data, which showed a sharp increase in seismicity at the highly populated CFc. Our analysis expanded the seismicity catalog from around 12,000 to over 54,000 earthquakes. The more complete picture of seismicity revealed a sharply defined caldera ring fault system (RFS) featuring a very narrow depth range of seismicity, clearly illuminated shallow faults in the northern part of the caldera and uncovered a source of very shallow hybrid earthquakes likely related to the hydrothermal system. To date, we have not observed any direct signature of upward migration of magma, nor have we observed seismic activity at depths below 3.7 km on or inside the RFS.",

          "abstract": "The global burden of kidney disease displays marked sexual dimorphism. Lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that starting from puberty, estrogen signaling in female mice supports self-renewal and differentiation of renal progenitors to increase filtration capacity, reducing sensitivity to glomerular injury compared with that of males. This phenomenon accelerated as female kidneys adapted to the workload of pregnancy. Deletion of estrogen receptor α in renal progenitors disrupted this adaptation, leading to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and increased maternal risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Offspring from affected mothers had fewer nephrons, resulting in early-life hypertension and greater susceptibility to kidney disease. These results highlight the fundamental role of kidney fitness and renal progenitors for pregnancy and preeclampsia and as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in kidney disease.",

          "abstract": "We investigate how to counter misinformation about voter and election fraud using data from the US and Brazil. Our study first compares two types of messages countering claims of widespread fraud: (i) retrospective corrections from credible sources speaking against interest and (ii) prebunking messages that prospectively warn of false claims about future elections and provide information about election security practices. In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects. In Brazil, prebunking had positive immediate effects across measured outcomes, whereas those of the credible source corrections were less consistent. We then conducted an experiment in the US randomizing exposure to a persuasion forewarning before election security information is provided. Prebunking again increased confidence and decreased fraud beliefs but only when the forewarning was omitted, suggesting that novel factual information is responsible for the observed effects of the prebunking treatment.",

          "abstract": "When speakers of different languages are in contact, they often borrow features like sounds, words, or syntactic patterns from one language to the other. However, the lack of historical data has hampered estimation of this effect at a global scale. We overcome this hurdle by using genetic admixture and shared geohistorical location as a proxy for population contact. We find that language pairs whose speaker populations underwent genetic admixture or that are located in the same geohistorical area exhibit notable similar increases in shared linguistic patterns across world regions and different demographic relationships, suggesting a consistent trend in borrowing rates. At the same time, the effect varies strongly across specific linguistic features. This variation is only partly explained by cognitive differences in lifelong learnability and by social functions of signaling assimilation through borrowing, leaving much randomness in which specific features are borrowed. Additionally, we find that, for some features, admixture decreases sharing, likely reflecting signals of divergence (schismogenesis) under contact.",

          "abstract": "Artists are rapidly integrating generative text-to-image models into their workflows, yet how this affects creative discovery remains unclear. Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted creators to matched nonadopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, a concentrated subset of AI-assisted creators contributes more novel artifacts in absolute terms through increased output—the productivity effect—although the average rate of contributing novel artifacts decreases because of a dilution effect. This reflects a shift toward high-volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI-assisted creators. We observe no evidence of a human-AI effect above and beyond the productivity effect. The release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a more diverse group, suggesting that text-to-image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by select “masterminds,” driven by increased volume, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from a “hive mind.”",

          "abstract": "Calcium is a critical regulator of Staphylococcus aureus skin adhesion, stabilizing one of the strongest noncovalent biomolecular interactions ever recorded. Using in vitro and in silico single-molecule force spectroscopy, we demonstrate that calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) are essential for the ultrastrong binding between the serine-aspartate repeat protein D (SdrD) adhesin and the human skin protein desmoglein-1 (DSG-1), withstanding forces exceeding 2 nanonewtons. Ca 2+ ions stabilize both the SdrD complex and the mechanically robust SdrD B-domains, which exhibit unprecedented folding strength. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), disrupted calcium gradients amplify SdrD interactions, which could potentially intensify S. aureus virulence. Furthermore, abnormal DSG-1 distribution on AD-affected skin enhances bacterial adhesion. These findings provide crucial insights into the calcium-dependent regulation of bacterial adhesion and folding, suggesting possible therapeutic targets to combat S. aureus infections.",

The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role; however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO 3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into an order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along &lt;111&gt; direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the &lt;111&gt; polar Ti displacements.

It is accepted that most STAT3 variants causing AD-HIES are dominant negative. Whether haploinsufficient mutations cause a phenotype in humans is still debated. We report on a family with a heterozygous STAT3 nonsense mutation that led to rapid decay of the mutant mRNA and protein, leading to haploinsufficiency. To explore STAT3 heterozygosity, we created a Stat3 haploinsufficient ( Stat3 +/− ) mouse model in which we found that Stat3 +/− mice had increased IgE serum levels, reduced T H 17 cell differentiation, and were susceptible to a cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus infection. Together, our findings provide mechanistic evidence for the impact of haploinsufficiency in STAT3 with residual protein expression as an important cause for immune deficiency. The implications extend to the diagnosis of immunodeficiency disorders and to the design of gene therapy in situations where gene dosage matters.",

Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom.

We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modeling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory, and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion–based navigation tasks for detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease–related cognitive changes.",

Advances in flexible electronics offer possibilities for wearable monitoring of tissue stiffness.

This study introduces a mechano-acoustic wave sensing technology for automated, wireless elastography. The patch-form sensor maintains conformal contact with the skin, regardless of body motion or deformation. It provides continuous, depth-sensitive estimation of subcutaneous tissue stiffness through real-time surface wave dispersion analysis. Theoretical and experimental investigations on phantom materials and tissues spanning a wide range of Young’s modulus (in kilopascals to megapascals) demonstrate the capability of the device to rapidly and robustly evaluate the stiffness at depths up to several centimeters. The device shows compatibility with various tissue models, with results consistent with in-parallel ultrasound elastography measurements. Deployment of the device during exercises confirms its viability for ambulatory monitoring, enabling continuous assessment of variation in tissue stiffness.",

Here, we mapped the chromatin contacts along nuclear radial axis and built radial score by factoring in contact frequencies. The chromatin high-order structures exhibit rich diversity along radial axis. Furthermore, the proximal trans contacts retrieved by radial score reveal conserved active/inactive chromatin segregation across intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Ablation of CTCF proteins disrupts chromatin loops with mild changes to chromatin radial positioning. By acutely perturbing multiple transcription factor (TF) occupancy, chromatin loop dissolutions are often accompanied by radial dissociations between two anchors. Our work provides a genome architecture reference map adhering to nuclear physical axis and suggests that multiple architectural TFs collectively shape nuclear positioning of chromatin and their contacts, with contacts serving as forces on chromatin positioning as well.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal death in stroke and other conditions stems in part from stimulation of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors. This induces neuronal production of both nitric oxide and superoxide, which together induce oxidative cell injury. Nitric oxide can readily cross lipid membranes, but superoxide, being an anion, cannot. Using primary neuronal cultures, we show that superoxide enters neurons through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Oxidative injury produced by either exogenous superoxide or NMDA receptor stimulation is prevented by the VRAC inhibitor [4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichlor-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid] (DCPIB) and by disruption of the essential VRAC subunit, leucine-rich repeat–containing 8A (LRRC8A). In mouse cortex, neuronal oxidative injury induced by either NMDA or transient ischemia is likewise blocked by both DCPIB and LRRC8A disruption. Selective expression of LRRC8A/C and LRRC8A/D but not LRRC8A/D subunits conferred superoxide conductance in HeLa cells. Superoxide entry through VRACs is thus a requisite step in excitotoxic neuronal injury, and interventions affecting VRAC subunit composition, localization, or opening could influence neuronal survival.",

Introduction of stiffness mismatch induced localized curvature, which preserved the initial curvature and simultaneously enhanced photomechanical strain responsivity. By programming for symmetry of stiffness variation, we achieved directional or vertical jumping via strategic placement of the rigid region, with corresponding stress accumulation behaviors corroborated by finite element simulations. Integration of patterned stiffness variation with geometric asymmetry enabled both vertical and horizontal jumping within a single structure, without compromising performance.

In chordoma cells, T-DARPins reduced cell cycle progression, spheroid formation, and tumor growth in mice and induced signs of senescence and differentiation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified gene networks involved in cell cycle regulation, embryonic cell identity, and interferon response and revealed features of regulome components, such as susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition and the fine-tuning of TBXT downstream effectors through IGFBP3. Finally, we found high interferon signaling in chordoma cell lines and patient tumors, which was promoted by TBXT and associated with sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors.

Here, we describe the mechanism used by tularemia agent Francisella tularensis exploiting host mitochondrial anaplerosis. Shortly after internalization, Francisella associates with DC mitochondria, which leads to the rapid repurposing of their oxidative metabolism for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mitochondrial metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the intramitochondrial signaling mediated by protein acetylation and involves switching to glutamate as the primary substrate for DC tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rather than killing the bacterium, glutamate-fueled mtROS production activates p38-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Blocking of glutamate utilization prevents DC activation and bacterial dissemination and alleviates inflammation in vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of metabolic plasticity in antibacterial DC response and open up potential avenues for therapies targeting host metabolism.",

The colonization defect of Δ b-Cool was rescued in mucin deficient mice, suggesting that b-Cool may facilitate colonization in the presence of airway mucins.",

However, this important comprehensive issue remains unsolved. Here, we report the efficient activation of aldehydes by the in situ growth of a molybdenum selenide-graphdiyne heterointerface structure, allowing an aldehyde molecule to be selectively coupled with another aldehyde at room temperature and ambient pressure. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images reveal the formation of high-density active sites at the interface structure. The synchrotron x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy results confirmed the selective formation of ketyl radicals. The noninteger charge transfer between graphdiyne and metal atoms promotes the continuous selectivity and efficient activation of aldehydes and C─C coupling of ketyl radicals. The ultrahigh selectivity of 2-furaldehyde for hydrofurion reached 92 ± 2%, while the turnover frequency reached 57 ± 4 per second.",

Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification.

Differentiation therapy, aiming to mature CSCs and MDSCs, shows great promise. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited accessibility in hypoxic deep tumor regions. Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy.",

We quantify dynamic changes to northern terrestrial carbon stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years) until present at millennial time steps using a combination of paleo-data and climate-biome modeling. During the deglaciation, northern land carbon storage declined by &gt;300 petagrams of carbon with a minimum around 11,000 years, followed by progressively higher land carbon stocks during the Holocene. We find evidence that dynamic changes in terrestrial land carbon stocks were of a scale to exert large influence on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and that postglacial terrestrial carbon stock dynamics were dominated by losses from permafrost-affected loess and gains into peatlands.",

Combining the structural advantage of polyethyleneimine and piperazine monomers, the separation layer had a large free volume, high-density homogeneity, well-tuned nanopores, and tailored charge distribution. The staged-regulated membrane exhibited high water permeance and could even adapt to ion separation in ultrahigh-salt solutions (Mg/Li = 50, 20,000 parts per million), with a notable Mg 2+ /Li + selectivity improvement of more than 1600% over that of the control, directly mixed dual aqueous monomer-prepared membrane.

However, excitonic absorption may dampen SHG. Here, we demonstrate tunable SHG enhancement using virtual coupling effects between quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) optical resonances and tunable excitons in high-index WS 2 metasurfaces with crescent meta-atoms. These metasurfaces promote a magnetic-type qBIC resonance, enabling control over nonlinear optical processes in the visible spectrum. The used qBIC resonance at half the exciton energy increases SHG efficiency by 98-fold compared to monolayer WS 2 and by four orders of magnitude relative to an unpatterned WS 2 film. The enhancement is tunable with temperature and incident light polarization, allowing the dynamic control of virtual coupling and SHG efficiency, thereby paving the way for next-generation reconfigurable metaoptics devices.",

While the role of these genes has been extensively studied in neurons, microglial functions such as phagocytosis are also dependent on cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that disturbance of actin cytoskeletal regulation in microglia, modeled by genetically impairing the scaffold protein Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which integrates actin-binding proteins, causes a shift in actin regulatory balance favoring filopodial versus lamellipodial actin organization. The resulting microglia-specific dysregulation of actin dynamics leads to excessive uptake of synaptic proteins. Genetically engineered DISC1-deficient mice show diminished hippocampal excitatory transmission and associated spatial memory deficits. Reintroducing wild-type microglia-like cells via bone marrow transplantation in adult DISC1-deficient mice restores the synaptic function of neurons and rescues cognitive performance. These findings reveal a pivotal role for microglial actin cytoskeletal remodeling in preserving synaptic integrity and cognitive health. Targeting microglial cytoskeletal dynamics may effectively address cognitive impairments associated with NDDs, even in adulthood.",

Using parylene C film for waterproofing and encapsulation, the ultrathin perovskite curved image sensor with the hierarchical mesh design is demonstrated, which conforms to spherical surfaces of different radii while maintaining mechanical stability during deformation. The image sensor exhibits low detection limit (10 nanowatts per square centimeter) and long-term stable dynamic photoresponse. Combining the image sensor with a tunable lens achieves clear images at different distances via simultaneously adjusting both sensor and lens radii.

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway repairs stalled replication forks (RFs) and prevents such instability. Through an E3 ubiquitin ligase screen aimed at identifying regulators of RAD51, we identified macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA), a core component of C-terminal to Lish (CTLH) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as a regulator of the HR pathway. Loss of MAEA impairs RAD51 recruitment at stalled RFs, leading to increased sensitivity to RS-inducing agents and excessive degradation of nascent DNA strands. Mechanistically, MAEA associates with and mediates the ubiquitylation of Ku80, enabling its removal from RF ends and facilitating the loading of RAD51. Notably, MAEA deficiency is associated with a developmental disorder involving microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, ocular defects, and heart malformations. Functional assays show that disease-linked MAEA variants (R34C, E349G, Y394D, and M396R) are defective in RS response.

We lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes reshape the resulting bimodal rest-activity pattern. Here, we uncover a seasonal switch mechanism that remodels the evening bout of activity. Under temperate summer-like conditions, levels of the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDF receptor (PDFR) signaling disinhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY to advance the evening output, and in parallel, weakens the siesta-promoting vc DN1p-SIF amide axis to expand the evening peak. Under these conditions, vc DN1p takes over the evening pacemaker role by exerting control over the dorsal lateral oscillator neurons. Our findings elucidate how environment-induced changes in PDFR signaling tip the balanced output of the clock network, aligning daily rhythms with seasonal time. Neuropeptide-driven parallel adjustment of clock circuitry and clock protein functioning likely represents a conserved strategy, enabling animals to adapt their daily behavior to seasonal changes.",

These representations minimize neural distances across different vocalizations from the same individual while preserving distinct trajectories for different callers. This structure emerged from the coordinated activity of the broader neuronal ensemble, although a small subset of highly identity-selective neurons carried high identity information. Our findings provide a neural basis for voice identity recognition in primates and highlight the ATL as a key hub for integrating perceptual voice features into higher-level identity representations.",

Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior.",

However, these processes were not fully integrated in past sulfur cycling models because of complexity from the gas-melt interactions in chemically and dynamically evolving magmatic systems with multicomponent volatiles. Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H 2 S and S 2 , are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust. The degassed H 2 S and S 2 may form a hazy atmosphere with SF 6 , a potent greenhouse gas, to shape the paleoclimate of Mars.",

Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species ( Ammonia confertitesta ) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA). A. confertitesta was rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s.

          "abstract": "For over 25 years, the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has claimed to observe an annual modulation signal, suggesting the existence of dark matter interactions. However, no experiment using different target materials has observed a dark matter signal consistent with their result. To address this puzzle, the COSINE-100 collaboration conducted a model-independent test using sodium iodide crystal detectors, the same target material as DAMA/LIBRA. Analyzing data collected over 6.4 years by the effective mass of 61.3 kilograms, with improved energy calibration and time-dependent background modeling, we found no evidence of an annual modulation signal, challenging the DAMA/LIBRA result with a confidence level greater than 3σ. This finding represents a substantial step toward resolving the long-standing debate surrounding DAMA/LIBRA’s dark matter claim, indicating that the observed modulation is unlikely to be caused by dark matter interactions.",

Besides the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) BCR, lymphoma cells can also express non–IgM (IgG) BCRs; however, the role of IgG BCRs in malignant B cell is not well understood. Here, we report poorer disease outcomes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) expressing high IgM versus those expressing IgG1. Using isogenic lymphoma cells expressing distinct BCRs, we found that IgM expressing cells strongly outcompete their IgG1 counterparts. Mechanistically, IgG1 BCR is associated with a dysfunctional mitochondrial state and reduced cell survival. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered by accentuated calcium responses downstream of IgG1 BCR. Genetic reversal of IgG1 to IgM, pharmacological dampening of calcium signaling, or treatment with interleukin-21 can correct mitochondrial defects and rescue IgG1 survival. Our findings demonstrate that distinct BCR isotypes are inherently unique and can differentially affect B cell lymphoma pathogenesis.",

Specifically, Mn 2+ @Man-phage anchored on bacterial surfaces and provided artificial recognition sites that enabled macrophages to phagocytize via mannose receptors, accompanied by enhanced bactericidal activity triggered by manganese ions in response to an infectious microenvironment. Moreover, immune labeling–activated macrophages enhanced antigen presentation at infection sites, further boosting specific T cell–mediated adaptive immune responses and infection eradication effects. Overall, this study illustrates a scalable bacteriophage immune therapy based on precise biological labeling and targeted modulation of immune responses, bridging the natural divide between bacteriophages and host immunity.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic malignancies emerge through the acquisition of genetic mutations within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Some mutations impart a selective growth advantage to HSPCs, which expand and contribute to mature blood cells. This expansion is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) protein is a transcriptional regulator of proliferation/differentiation of hematopoietic cells. HSPCs express low levels of Id1 that is induced by growth factors and other mediators of inflammatory during stress to promote HSPC expansion. Since chronic inflammation is associated with the progression of hematopoietic malignancies, reducing Id1 expression may reduce CH. Genetic ablation of Id1 in Tet2 −/− HSPCs reduces HSPC expansion/CH, extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloid skewing, and genetic instability and delays the onset of disease. Mechanistically, p16 expression, senescence, and apoptosis were increased, and proliferation decreased in Tet2 −/− ;Id1 −/− HSPCs. Thus, ID1 may represent a therapeutic target to reduce CH and delay the onset of disease.",

In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLN v s form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLN v s form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep. Our results reveal that the main postsynaptic partners of key Drosophila pacemaker neurons are a nonclock neuronal cell type that regulates the timing of sleep and activity.",

While direct diffusion-driven cell-to-cell exchanges are difficult to map, current nanotechnology enables one to probe single-cell exchanges with the medium. We introduce a mathematical method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of intercellular exchange networks from these data, applying it to an experimental coculture system. The exchange network, initially dense, progressively fragments into small disconnected clusters. To explain these dynamics, we develop a maximum-entropy multicellular metabolic model with diffusion-driven exchanges. The model predicts a transition from a dense network to a sparse one as nutrient consumption shifts. We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover. These findings offer insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations.",

Cryo–electron microscopy of the capsid (2.1 angstroms) and portal-tail complex (1.9 angstroms) reveals an unambiguous phage particle with T7-like morphology.

In CDW materials, carrier density substantially influences the ground state, typically altered through foreign ion doping and investigated at macro- or mesoscopic scales via photoemission or transport techniques. However, atomic-scale visualization, particularly in doped CDW systems without foreign ions, remains rare. Here, we present real-space observation of doping-tunable granular charge ordering using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in semiconducting single-layer Cr 2 Se 3 , a group VIB transition metal chalcogenide (TMC). Observations of lattice distortion, bandgap modulation at E F , and STM contrast inversion at low temperatures indicate a charge ordering origin. Cr 2 Se 3 ’s semiconducting nature enables charge ordering modulation through doping: Hole doping suppresses it, whereas electron doping alters the pattern, yielding a periodic 3√3 × 3√3 CDW phase. This tunable charge ordering in a group VIB TMC advances the understanding of charge doping and ordering interactions in two-dimensional materials.",

We report on the operation of a free space ring laser gyroscope over a period of 250 days under an ambient pressure stabilizing vessel continuously in an unperturbed underground laboratory. Because we measure relative to local inertial space, the precession and nutation motion of Earth’s axis are intrinsically contained in the observations. It is demonstrated that optical interferometry, using an ultrastable cavity, yields an accuracy limit for rotation sensing of 48 parts per billion (i.e., picoradians per second), less than an order of magnitude away from the regime in which relativistic effects can be measured.",

          "abstract": "ADP-ribosylation can occur as mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) or be extended into poly-ADP-ribose (PAR). Tankyrase, a PAR transferase, adds PAR to itself and other proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation via the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146. This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism that can regulate the balance between MAR and PAR on tankyrase to control degradation. We show that Deltex E3 ligases DTX2 and DTX3 catalyze monoubiquitylation of tankyrase in cells. This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase.

Here, we unveil that the TaCEP15 peptide interacts with the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase TaCEPRL. Knockout of TaCEP15 or TaCEPRL increases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressing TaSnRK1 α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to the TaCEP15 promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in the TaCEP15 promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants with TabZIP9 knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance.

Phytoplankton frequently experience a limiting supply of multiple nutrients simultaneously (colimitation). Ocean warming is predicted to exacerbate marine nutrient limitation. Yet, how phytoplankton adapt their physiology and regulate responses to colimitation is poorly understood. Here, we show that when the crucial macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) colimit growth of globally abundant phytoplankton, the diatoms, cellular resources are diverted to prioritize N uptake over P sensing and acquisition. Regulatory mechanisms for responding to fluctuating P supply, including Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PSR1) and P-resupply sensing via Ca 2+ signaling, are strictly nitrate dependent. Further, P-Ca 2+ signaling is impaired in psr1 mutants, suggesting that PSR1 is necessary for this response and coordinates adaptations to colimitation. Our study demonstrates a hierarchy of resource allocation during colimitation that points to N starvation mechanisms overriding those of P and could lead to N-P colimitation being masked in many marine ecosystems.",

Mechanical theories, finite element analysis, and experiments verified that, with multilayer stacks and interconnects with various geometric designs as examples, the overbend strategy can enhance the designed elastic bendability to twice for the material of the ideal elastoplastic/kinematic hardening constitutive relationship and to more than twice for the mixed hardening/isotropic hardening constitutive relationship. The mechanism is extending the elastic strain range at the critical section to twice or more times the original value by the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relationship.

Our findings reveal dynamic regulation of SLC35A4-MP expression during primary brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro and during cold exposure or high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obesity in mice. Using a knockout mouse model, we show that loss of SLC35A4-MP disrupts mitochondrial lipid composition, decreasing cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamine in brown adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice. SLC35A4-MP deficiency also impairs mitochondrial activity, alters mitochondrial number and morphology, and promotes inflammation. Knockout mice accumulate acylcarnitines during cold exposure, indicating defective fatty acid oxidation. These findings reveal SLC35A4-MP as a previously unrecognized microprotein in regulating mitochondrial function and tissue lipid metabolism, adding to the growing list of functional endogenous microproteins.",

          "abstract": "The transition from unicellular to multicellular life required the acquisition of coordinated and regulated cellular behaviors, including adhesion and migration. In metazoans, this involves adhesion proteins, signaling systems, and an elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM) that contributes to adhesion and signaling interactions. Innovations that enabled complex multicellularity occurred through new genes in these pathways, novel functions for existing genes, and regulatory changes. Gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) expanded with multicellularity. A single miRNA, miR-100, arose in the last common eumetazoan ancestor and is widely conserved across animals. We reveal the molecular function of its C. elegans homolog, the miR-51 family. This family acts in a dose-dependent manner to control morphogenesis by regulating several genes involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and migration, including ECM modifiers—specifically heparan sulfate sulfotransferases (HSTs). Some of these targets are also predicted to be conserved targets across vertebrates. Our work suggests that this miRNA provided an innovation in the regulation of cellular interactions early in metazoan evolution.",

Guided by preoperative imaging, conventional approaches are mostly performed manually, lacking operation stability and interactive feedback. The intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables both structural and functional assessment during operation, permitting interactive adaptation to tissue deformation and avoidance of critical anatomical regions. Here, we report an MRI-guided robotic system for stereotactic neurointervention. A macro-micro hybrid pneumatic-hydraulic actuated stereotactic robot with a large range of motion and high precision is developed. This is coupled with a compact bioinspired soft actuator for target intervention. A global-focal MRI sequence is proposed for interactive navigation, closed-loop control, and precise targeting. Validation is performed with phantom, cadaveric, and in vivo animal studies, showing positional accuracies of 0.39, 0.68, and 0.14 millimeters, respectively, demonstrating superior performance compared to the current state of the art in robotic-assisted stereotactic neurointervention.",

Herein, we investigate the permeation of alkali chlorides (LiCl, KCl, and CsCl) through steric hindrance–free nanoporous membranes with tunable surface charge densities. Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm that electrostatic effects promote the dehydration of Cl − , the counterions to the membrane charge, at the positively charged membrane surface. This dehydration leads to a great tendency of Cl − to absorb to the membrane surface and be retained, compromises Cl − partitioning, and impedes salt cotransport. For negatively charged membranes, Cs + with its lower hydration energy undergoes greater electrostatic-driven dehydration and partition hindrance than K + , resulting in selective KCl transport. Our findings provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of ionic dehydration and transport impediments driven by electrostatic interactions at charged membrane surfaces, presenting an in-depth perspective for designing ion-selective membranes to separate similar ions based on charge effects.",

          "abstract": "The pseudouridine synthase DKC1 regulates internal ribosome entry site (IRES)–dependent translation and is up-regulated in cancers by the MYC family of oncogenes. The functional significance of DKC1 up-regulation and the mechanistic connection between pseudouridylation and IRES-mediated translation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that DKC1 drives an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program that supports amino acid metabolism and stress adaptation. We identify hnRNP A1, an IRES trans-acting factor, as a critical downstream mediator of DKC1 in sustaining ATF4 expression and IRES-dependent translation. Mechanistically, DKC1-mediated pseudouridylation at two specific 28 S ribosomal RNA sites is crucial for maintaining hnRNP A1 protein expression. In turn, hnRNP A1 binds and stabilizes ATF4 messenger RNA, preferentially promoting IRES-dependent translation of ATF4 variant 1. Furthermore, cellular stress induces hnRNP A1, which is necessary for stress-induced ATF4 protein expression. Collectively, our findings uncover an MYC-driven DKC1-hnRNP A1 axis that links IRES-dependent translation and ATF4-mediated metabolic adaptation, thereby supporting cancer cell survival under metabolic stress during tumor progression.",

          "abstract": "Year-to-year variance of agricultural productivity is an important determinant of food security. Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by 7   to   19 % ° C across crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming.",

Here, we present a bioinspired twist-hyperbolic metamaterial (THM) integrated with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for simultaneously impact buffering and self-powered sensing. The THM-TENG protector exhibits tunable stiffness (40 to 4300 newtons per millimeter), ~70% impact energy absorption, and achieves a specific energy absorption of ~0.25 joules per gram at a weight of only 10 grams. Through triboelectrification, the protector converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, enabling real-time monitoring of impact loads up to 1000 newtons (≤5 hertz). Integrated with a microcontroller unit, wireless transmission, and alarm systems, THM-TENG demonstrates dual functionality in UAVs: mitigating vibration while providing real-time force monitoring, positioning, and early warning, all without external power sources.

Compensated ferrimagnet spintronic devices with both a large anomalous Hall effect and a high coercivity would be simultaneously easy to read and difficult to erase. The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn 6 Sn 6 has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system toward magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed. Additionally, Cr doping markedly enhances the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, which can be attributed to a shift in the Fermi level. Our results extend the range of unique magnetic states observed in kagome materials, demonstrating that chemical doping is an effective strategy to tune and realize these states.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is hallmarked by phenotypic transitions enabling abnormal cell proliferation and invasion. The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2. Together, we propose that HSF2 acts as a stage-specific switch between proliferation and invasion in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV (PWH) experience persistent inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, increasing their risk for non-AIDS comorbidities. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizing Oscillibacter and reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels. THC-treated RMs maintained viral suppression despite reduced plasma ART levels, suggesting diminished ART-related toxicity. Our findings demonstrate phytocannabinoids to be a safe adjunct therapy alongside ART to mitigate chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in PWH.",

In this work, we present a method for micropatterning liquid metal particle (LMP) films with feature sizes as small as 5 micrometers by integrating electrostatically enabled colloidal self-assembly and microtransfer printing. The resulting cold-welded LMP micropatterns exhibit exceptional electromechanical properties, high conductivity (2.4 × 10 6 siemens per meter), stretchability (more than 1200%), and strain- and pressure-insensitive resistance, owing to their multiscale and dynamic morphologies. Demonstrations in highly stretchable strain sensors and cardiac mapping devices highlight the capabilities of this method for creating high-performance, highly stretchable electronic systems. Notably, balloon catheter–integrated LMP microelectrode arrays show low impedance under extreme deformations and enable high-resolution endocardial electrogram mapping inside the human heart. This method expands the potential of liquid metal–based stretchable electronics for a wide range of applications, including implantable biomedical devices and soft robotics.",

Yet the oxygenation history of Paleozoic deep oceans remains debated. Using thallium (Tl) isotope ratios in deep-marine mudrocks, we reconstruct the history of deep marine oxygenation from ~485 to 380 million years ago. Thallium isotopes can track bottom water oxygenation indirectly through their sensitivity to seafloor Mn oxide burial. We apply Tl isotopes to a global set of mudrocks, placing a particular focus on the Road River Group of Yukon, Canada. Our data reveal an oscillatory pattern in seawater Tl isotope ratios and, in turn, a dynamic ocean ventilation history. A long-lived deep ocean oxygenation episode is identified between ~405 and 386 million years ago. These short-term dynamics are superimposed on a muted positive ocean oxygenation trend over the entire Early and Middle Paleozoic. Sustained O 2 accumulation in global marine bottom waters occurred sometime after ~380 million years ago according to our dataset.",

First, EMU development is driven by the policy challenges thrown up by the different types of financial risk generated by the deep-seated structure of macroeconomic imbalances entailed in a single European market. Second, the introduction of a single currency profoundly transformed that financial risk, turning it from currency to sovereign credit risk. Finally, the third is the notion of corporate power, which implies that the corporate community has been the key constituency advocating for supranational–federal solutions to the policy challenges and that its power gradually tilts the balance towards such solutions. The article then divides the history of EMU into four distinct stages and shows how the corporate sector advocated for institutional solutions at odds with the preferences of powerful member states on the surplus side of the imbalances and how it ended up carrying the day.",
