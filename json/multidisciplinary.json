          "abstract": "Phylogenetics has a central role in evolutionary biology and genomic epidemiology 1 . Assessing phylogenetic confidence and reliability is therefore crucial and the methods that do this, such as those derived from Felsenstein’s bootstrap 2 , are among the most widely used in modern science. However, these methods require enormous computational capacity, and are unsuitable for large datasets. Furthermore, most of these methods emerge from a focus on the membership of clades (groupings of taxa), which makes their results difficult to interpret in the context of genomic epidemiology. Here we propose subtree pruning and regrafting-based tree assessment (SPRTA), an efficient and interpretable approach to assess confidence in phylogenetic trees. SPRTA shifts the paradigm of phylogenetic support measurement from evaluating the confidence in clades to evolution histories and phylogenetic placement—for example, assessing whether a lineage evolved from another considered lineage, which is particularly valuable in genomic epidemiology. We use SPRTA to investigate a global public SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree relating more than two million genomes, highlighting plausible alternative evolutionary origins of many SARS-CoV-2 variants, assessing reliability in the Pango outbreak lineage classification system 3 , and demonstrating the effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on inferred mutation rates. Our results show that SPRTA enables pandemic-scale and detailed probabilistic assessment of transmission and mutational histories. Our method introduces a new approach to assessing phylogenetic confidence, enhancing the interpretability of pandemic-scale phylogenetic analyses and improving our ability to prepare for and respond to future pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, play a defining role in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 1 . The microglial response to amyloid plaques in AD can range from neuroprotective to neurotoxic 2 . Here we show that the protective function of microglia is governed by the transcription factor PU.1, which becomes downregulated following microglial contact with plaques. Lowering PU.1 expression in microglia reduces the severity of amyloid disease pathology in mice and is linked to the expression of immunoregulatory lymphoid receptor proteins, particularly CD28, a surface receptor that is critical for T cell activation 3,4 . Microglia-specific deficiency in CD28, which is expressed by a small subset of plaque-associated PU.1 low microglia, promotes a broad inflammatory microglial state that is associated with increased amyloid plaque load. Our findings indicate that PU.1 low CD28-expressing microglia may operate as suppressive microglia that mitigate the progression of AD by reducing the severity of neuroinflammation. This role of CD28 and potentially other lymphoid co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptor proteins in governing microglial responses in AD points to possible immunotherapy approaches for treating the disease by promoting protective microglial functions.",

          "abstract": "Computer vision is central to many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, from autonomous vehicles to consumer devices. However, the data behind such technical innovations are often collected with insufficient consideration of ethical concerns 1–3 . This has led to a reliance on datasets that lack diversity, perpetuate biases and are collected without the consent of data rights holders. These datasets compromise the fairness and accuracy of AI models and disenfranchise stakeholders 4–8 . Although awareness of the problems of bias in computer vision technologies, particularly facial recognition, has become widespread 9 , the field lacks publicly available, consensually collected datasets for evaluating bias for most tasks 3,10,11 . In response, we introduce the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced ‘Feebee’), a publicly available human image dataset implementing best practices for consent, privacy, compensation, safety, diversity and utility. FHIBE can be used responsibly as a fairness evaluation dataset for many human-centric computer vision tasks, including pose estimation, person segmentation, face detection and verification, and visual question answering. By leveraging comprehensive annotations capturing demographic and physical attributes, environmental factors, instrument and pixel-level annotations, FHIBE can identify a wide variety of biases. The annotations also enable more nuanced and granular bias diagnoses, enabling practitioners to better understand sources of bias and mitigate potential downstream harms. FHIBE therefore represents an important step forward towards trustworthy AI, raising the bar for fairness benchmarks and providing a road map for responsible data curation in AI.",

          "abstract": "Methane is a potent but short-lived greenhouse gas and rapid reductions of its anthropogenic emissions could help decrease near-term warming 1 . Solid waste emits methane through the decay of organic material, which amounts to about 10% of total anthropogenic methane emissions 2 . Satellite instruments 3 enable monitoring of strong methane hotspots 4 , including many strongly emitting urban areas that include solid waste disposal sites as most prominent sources 5 . Here we present a survey of methane emissions from 151 individual waste disposal sites across six continents using high-resolution satellite observations that can detect localized methane emissions above 100 kg h –1 . Within this dataset, we find that our satellite-based estimates generally show no correlation with reported or modelled emission estimates at facility scale. This reveals major uncertainties in the current understanding of methane emissions from waste disposal sites, warranting further investigations to reconcile bottom-up and top-down approaches. We also observe that managed landfills show lower emission per area than dumping sites, and that detected emission sources often align with the open non-covered parts of the facility where waste is added. Our results highlight the potential of high-resolution satellite observations to detect and monitor methane emissions from the waste sector globally, providing actionable insights to help improve emission estimates and focus mitigation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and rare variant burden tests are essential tools for identifying trait-relevant genes 1 . Although these methods are conceptually similar, by analysing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank 2–4 , we show that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: (1) trait importance — how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and (2) trait specificity — the importance of a gene for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, whereas burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, whereas burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide 1 . Here, in the Breast Cancer-Anti-Progestin Prevention Study 1 (BC-APPS1; NCT02408770 ), we assessed whether progesterone receptor antagonism with ulipristal acetate for 12 weeks reduces surrogate markers of breast cancer risk in 24 premenopausal women. We used multilayered OMICs and live-cell approaches as readouts for molecular features alongside clinical imaging and tissue micromechanics correlates. Ulipristal acetate reduced epithelial proliferation (Ki67) and the proportion, proliferation and colony formation capacity of luminal progenitor cells, the putative cell of origin of aggressive breast cancers 2 . MRI scans showed reduction in fibroglandular volume with treatment, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, histology and atomic force microscopy identified extracellular matrix remodelling with reduced collagen organization and tissue stiffness. Collagen VI was the most significantly downregulated protein after ulipristal acetate treatment, and we uncovered an unanticipated spatial association between collagen VI and SOX9 high luminal progenitor cell localization, establishing a link between collagen organization and luminal progenitor activity. Culture of primary human breast epithelial cells in a stiff environment increased luminal progenitor activity, which was antagonized by anti-progestin therapy, strengthening this mechanistic link. This study offers a template for biologically informed early-phase therapeutic cancer prevention trials and demonstrates the potential for premenopausal breast cancer prevention with progesterone receptor antagonists through stromal remodelling and luminal progenitor suppression.",

Although considerable progress has been made in creating fibrous materials responsive to scalar stimuli such as voltage 8 , temperature 6 , humidity 2 and ion concentration 9 , these technologies often lack directional controllability and functional diversity 10–14 . Here we report a class of vector-stimuli-responsive magnetorheological fibrous materials, guided by our engineering model integrating the structural mechanics of textiles with the magnetics of soft magnetic materials. We mass-produced soft magnetic polymer composite fibres with optimized mechanical and magnetic properties, which we then assembled into concentric helical yarns. These yarns exhibited pronounced bending and stiffening properties controlled by the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, allowing for customized fabrics with various actuation and stiffening functionalities. We demonstrated innovative smart textiles derived from those fabrics, including an active ventilation fabric for personal moisture management, an integrated conformable gripper for handling objects of varying shapes and stiffness, and a compact remote-controllable haptic finger glove that replicates the sensation of fabric hardness and smoothness. Our work provides insights into stimuli-responsive fibrous materials, elevating them from scalar to sophisticated vector control, heralding an era of smart textile innovation.",

          "abstract": "Lithospheric thin zones, such as recently failed rifts, are generally assumed to be weak spots where magmatism and deformation can concentrate during rifting and large igneous province development 1–3 . Yet, the Turkana Depression in East Africa, the site of the failed 66-million-year-old Anza Rift, did not experience the widespread flood magmatism seen on the adjacent Ethiopian Plateau, despite being a lithospheric thin spot when the region encountered hot plume material around 45 million years ago 4 . Here we jointly invert surface-wave and receiver function data to constrain crustal and upper-mantle seismic structure below the Depression to evaluate lithospheric thermo-mechanical modification. Evidence for thick lower crustal intrusions, ubiquitous below the uplifted Ethiopian Plateau 5,6 , is comparatively lacking below the Depression’s failed Anza Rift system, which ongoing East African rifting is circumnavigating, not exploiting. The mantle lithosphere below the Depression has also retained its cool, fast-wavespeed ‘lid’ character, contrasting the Ethiopian Plateau. Volatile depletion during failed Anza rifting probably rendered the thinned lithosphere refractory without later rejuvenation. Subsequent rifting and magmatism thus initiated away from the still-thin Anza Rift, in regions where fertile lithosphere enabled melting and the sufficient lowering of plate yield strength. Areas of thinned lithosphere are thus not necessarily persistent weak zones where significant extension and magmatic provinces will develop.",

          "abstract": "Expressions of dissent against authority are an important feature of most societies, and efforts to suppress such expressions are common. Modern digital communications, social media, and Internet surveillance and censorship technologies are changing the landscape of public speech and dissent. Especially in authoritarian settings, individuals must assess the risk of voicing their true opinions or choose self-censorship, voluntarily moderating their behavior to comply with authority. We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship. However, the probability and time for an initially moderate, locally adaptive authority to suppress dissent depend critically on the population’s willingness to withstand punishment early on, which can deter the authority from adopting more extreme policies.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the number of close social connections increased substantially, at least by a factor of two. At the same time, societal opinions have become increasingly polarized in many Western countries. To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people—within their social networks—continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities. We discuss the implications of the presence of a phase transition in social polarization.",

          "abstract": "Local immigration raids expanded dramatically across the United States during the first 2 mo of 2025. Anecdotal accounts suggest that these raids increased student absences from schools because parents fear being separated from their children. This study evaluates this claim using a daily time series of school absences spanning the current and two prior school years from five school districts serving communities subject to recent and unexpected raids in California’s Central Valley. The results indicate that recent raids coincided with a 22 percent increase in daily student absences with particularly large increases among the youngest students. These increased absences underscore the broader policy relevance of this immigration enforcement in terms of their impact on schools, childhood stress, and opportunities to learn.",

          "authors": "Buxin Su, Weijie J. Su, Chendi Wang",
          "abstract": "The US Decennial Census serves as the foundation for many high-profile policy decision-making processes, including federal funding allocation and redistricting. In 2020, the Census Bureau adopted differential privacy to protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau subsequently posed an open question: Could stronger privacy guarantees be obtained for the 2020 US Census compared to their published guarantees, or equivalently, had the privacy budgets been fully utilized? In this paper, we address this question affirmatively by demonstrating that the 2020 US Census provides significantly stronger privacy protections than the officially published guarantees suggest at each of the eight geographical levels, from the national level down to the block level. This finding is enabled by our precise tracking of privacy losses using f -differential privacy, applied to the composition of private queries across these geographical levels. Our analysis reveals that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of noise to meet the specified privacy guarantees for the 2020 Census. Consequently, we show that noise variances could be reduced by 15.08% to 24.82% while maintaining nearly the same level of privacy protection for each geographical level, thereby improving the accuracy of privatized census statistics. We empirically demonstrate that reducing noise injection into census statistics mitigates distortion caused by privacy constraints in downstream applications of private census data, illustrated through a study examining the relationship between earnings and education.",

          "abstract": "Recent research in psychology, management, and more recently in economics, highlights the role of individual managers and their behavior in shaping employee performance. While emerging literature on harmful managerial behavior has focused primarily on severe forms of workplace mistreatment, especially various types of harassment, much less is known about its boundary conditions: How minor can a manager’s bad behavior be and still negatively affect employee performance? We study what appears to be a very minor workplace mistreatment—failing to deliver an expected birthday gift and greeting card on time—and examine its effect on subsequent employee performance. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences approach with detailed data from a national retail chain, we find that this small slight leads to over a 50% increase in employee absenteeism and a reduction of more than two working hours per month. Our analysis suggests that emotional responses to perceived workplace mistreatment drive the results. These findings indicate that even modest slights can meaningfully harm employee performance.",

          "abstract": "Lithium metal is widely recognized as the ultimate anode material for next-generation lithium batteries due to its superior specific capacity. However, microscopic crystallographic heterogeneity caused by crystal faces and grain boundaries leads to nonuniform lithium deposition, thereby undermining the stability of lithium metal anode. This study systematically investigates the intricate impact of grain boundaries on the structural characteristics, deposition behavior, and electrochemical properties of lithium metal. We demonstrate that grain boundaries serve as preferential nucleation sites, exacerbating morphological heterogeneity. Although eliminating preexisting grain boundaries from substrate facilitates homogeneous lithium nucleation and enhances electrochemical performance, this approach does not address the deposition issues originating from the intercrystalline regions of newly deposited grains. Furthermore, the continuous expansion of the intercrystalline network disrupts single-crystal structure and accelerates anode degradation, imposing a critical constraint on performance enhancement. This work unveils a previously overlooked intercrystalline-driven failure mechanism and provides insights for realizing dendrite-free lithium batteries.",

          "abstract": "Calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling plays a crucial role in plant immunity, regulating both pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) through cell-surface receptors and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) via intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs/CDPKs) serve as key Ca 2+ sensors and signal transducers in these processes. In this study, we demonstrate the relevance of two rice CPKs, OsCPK5 and OsCPK13, for rice blast resistance. Both are Ca 2+ -responsive kinases, with potential in planta heteromer formation enhancing their phosphorylation/signaling functions. Single oscpk5 and oscpk13 mutants exhibit impaired early PTI responses and enhanced susceptibility to rice blast fungus, suggesting that these kinases are essential for effective immunity. Surprisingly, although it is also defective in PTI, the oscpk5 / 13 double mutant displays enhanced resistance to rice blast. An NLR protein OsCPK5/13-ASSOCIATING RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1 (OsCARP1), which is physically associated with both OsCPK5 and OsCPK13, is genetically required for the heightened resistance of oscpk5 / 13. Furthermore, OsCARP1-induced cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana can be suppressed by the expression of OsCPK5 and OsCPK13. Based on these findings, we postulate that the positive blast resistance roles of OsCPK5 and OsCPK13 are guarded by OsCARP1, thus leading to OsCARP1-dependent ETI resistance in the oscpk5 / 13 double mutant or upon manipulation by still unknown pathogen effectors during infection. Our results offer insights into how plants counteract potential pathogen attack on key Ca 2+ signaling immune components.",

          "abstract": "Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies focusing on the electrical conductivity and thermal evolution of an early magma ocean at the base of Earth’s mantle have found that basal magma ocean (BMO) convection could have produced the ancient geomagnetic field. By advances in high-resolution dynamo modeling, we find that convection in a thin BMO-like spherical shell is able to sustain strong magnetic fields, including axial dipolar fields similar to current day field structure. However, integrating our dynamo results with improved thermal evolution models and taking the planet’s rapid rotation into account using rotating convective turbulence models implies that an Earth-like magnetic field was unlikely to have been generated in the BMO, a finding relevant to the interpretation of ancient paleomagnetic signatures, Earth’s global-scale dynamics, and long-term planetary evolution. Large uncertainties still remain, calling for refined models of deep Earth thermal and mineralogical processes, accurate determination of prefactors in convective scaling laws, and fully coupled core-BMO dynamo simulations. Nonetheless, our work highlights that BMO-type dynamos intrinsically require a larger product of electrical conductivity and velocity than core-type dynamos, and that they are similarly rotationally constrained, so that velocities are significantly reduced compared to nonrotating estimates.",

Computational protein design offers a route to nanoparticle scaffolds with structural and biochemical features tailored to specific vaccine applications. Although strategies for designing self-assembling proteins have been established, the recent development of powerful machine learning (ML)–based tools for protein structure prediction and design provides an opportunity to overcome several of their limitations. Here, we leveraged these tools to develop a generalizable method for designing self-assembling proteins starting from AlphaFold2 predictions of oligomeric protein building blocks. We used the method to generate six 60-subunit protein nanoparticles with icosahedral symmetry, and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of three of them revealed that they were designed with atomic-level accuracy. To transform one of these nanoparticles into a functional immunogen, we reoriented its termini through circular permutation, added a genetically encoded oligomannose-type glycan, and displayed a stabilized trimeric variant of the influenza hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain through a rigid de novo linker. The resultant immunogen elicited potent receptor-blocking and neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of ML–based protein modeling tools in the design of nanoparticle vaccines. More broadly, by eliminating the requirement for experimentally determined structures of protein building blocks, our method dramatically expands the number of starting points available for designing self-assembling proteins.",

We developed virus-inspired polymers for endosomal release (VIPER) to address systemic and intracellular delivery obstacles, but durable antitumor immunity remained elusive. Adjuvants stimulating innate immunity, such as stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists, can enhance vaccine potency but risks systemic toxicity and improper immune activation. We developed STING “drugamers” with cathepsin-cleavable linkers and dendritic cell (DC)-targeting moieties for intracellular delivery of STING agonists to DCs. We explored two different STING drugamer structures: a hydrophilic statistical polymer “polySTING” and a diblock polymer “NPSTING” that forms into nanoparticles. PolySTING achieved higher systemic STING agonist delivery, whereas NPSTING is more efficient in delivering STING agonists into inguinal lymph nodes (LNs). Both drugamer platforms enhanced STING activation and DC maturation compared to the free drug. When combined with VIPER, NPSTING generated more antigen-presenting DCs in the LNs and more antigen-responsive CD8 + T cells in the spleens, whereas polySTING generated more tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells and CD8 + DCs. Both VIPER–STING drugamer platforms demonstrated efficacy in a B16-OVA melanoma model and a MC38 colon cancer model. Combination treatment with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor results in tumor remission and tumor immunity in a subset of mice. This study highlights how an endosomolytic peptide vaccine platform combined with two structurally different drugamers induce superior antitumor responses through distinctive mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Agricultural landscapes provide material, nonmaterial, and regulating contributions that affect human well-being (nature’s contributions to people, NCP). The responses of these NCP to land-use patterns depend on supporting biota with different habitat requirements, generating trade-offs and synergies. Predictions from spatially explicit modeling of NCP trade-offs and synergies could inform land-use decisions, but these do not typically account for the effects of land-use patterns on the movement of NCP-providing species, nor for interactions among NCP providers. To explore spatial trade-offs and synergies in eight indicators of NCP, we used Bayesian models that allow for interactions among land uses and among NCP using data from 150 grassland sites across rural Germany. We found that spatial arrangements of forest and open habitat influenced many beneficial NCP: acoustic diversity, birdwatching potential, natural enemy abundance, and pollination. In particular, the amount and proximity of land uses in the surrounding landscape, especially forest and open habitat, drove the supply of most NCP. However, detrimental NCP provided by smaller-bodied taxa (herbivory and pathogen infection) responded weakly to landscape factors. Multiple NCP provided by a given taxon responded differently to their surrounding landscape (e.g., bird-provided beneficial caterpillar predation and detrimental seed predation), leading to trade-offs and synergies among NCP over short distances. These were caused by different rates and directions of response to amount and location of land uses. Resulting spatial predictions revealed that the ratio of beneficial to detrimental NCP was maximized in areas with a high (≥95%) area of grassland or mixed forest-grassland (70:30%), rather than purely forest-dominated areas. This suggests promoting seminatural vegetation in agricultural landscapes to provide greater-than-additive benefits to net NCP supply.",

Recently, it has been shown that RNA can phase-separate in the absence of any proteins. Unlike protein-based condensates, RNAs condensates are strongly influenced by magnesium ions which play crucial roles in their dynamics and thermodynamics, giving rise to base-specific lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs). The molecular basis and functional significance of sequence and ion-dependent LCST behavior RNA condensates have yet to be elucidated. Here, we use atomistic simulations to systematically dissect the driving forces underlying the sequence-, ion-, and temperature-dependent phase behaviors of RNA condensates. By choosing RNA tetranucleotides alongside their ssDNA counterpart and chemically modified analogs, we map equilibrium thermodynamic profiles and structural ensembles across various external conditions. Our results show that magnesium ions promote LCST behavior by inducing local disorder-order transitions within RNA structures. Additionally, the base chemistry and the 2’hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar further modulate this LCST response. In agreement with experiments, we find that the thermal stability of RNA condensates follows the order G n &gt; A n &gt; C n &gt; U n , governed by the balance of base stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, our simulations reveal that posttranslational nucleotide modifications can fine-tune the threshold of RNA self-assembly and the resulting condensate structures.",

The molecular mechanism of galectin-3-mediated fusion has not yet been elucidated in part due to the difficulty of studying glycan-GBP binding events in live cells. To overcome these challenges, we employ a proximity labeling strategy to identify the galectin-3 interactome. From this interactome dataset, we selected and validated CD9 and integrin beta 1 as functional counterreceptors of galectin-3 and showed that CD9 is glycosylated with an N-linked glycan at a rare noncanonical sequon. Furthermore, we present evidence that galectin-3 acts to physically alter the fluidity of the cellular membrane, and it does not activate canonical syncytialization signaling pathways. Overall, we report that galectin-mediated binding events and their corresponding functions in cell biology can be precisely regulated by select glycoproteins at specific glycosites.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer neurodegenerative disease (AD) has had a major impact worldwide, with no effective drugs for treatment. We discovered and reported earlier that neurotrophic factor-α1 (NF-α1)/carboxypeptidase E (CPE) reversed neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction in AD mouse models. We then predicted computationally and validated experimentally that CPE interacts with a pharmacophore of six residues on the 5-HT1E receptor (HTR1E) to activate the ERK-BCL2 signaling pathway leading to protection of human neurons against oxidative stress–induced cell death. We now report using this pharmacophore for in silico virtual screening of ~6 million small molecules to discover candidates with similar binding and neuroprotective properties as CPE. This in silico search identified a molecule (Z124) that was verified experimentally to bind to HTR1E with protective efficacy comparable to NF-α1/CPE but requiring a higher concentration. Next, we carried out R-group design optimization based on Z124 to identify 4 compounds predicted to have much better efficacy than Z124. These compounds were synthesized and tested for neuroprotective activity. All four compounds showed binding to HTLA-HTR1E cells comparable to CPE. We determined the Kd for two of these compounds: R9, 1.38 ± 0.2 nM, and R10, 2.1 ± 0.2 nM, to be over 15 times better than CPE. Furthermore, all four new compounds showed protective activity against oxidative stress–induced cytotoxicity in human HEK293 cells stably transfected with HTR1E, as well as human primary neurons. Mechanistically, R9 and R10 activated ERK phosphorylation and increased the mitochondria prosurvival protein, BCL2, making them excellent candidates for further development as a drug to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Self-control—the ability to pursue long-term goals over short-term temptations—is a critical faculty of human cognition, but the cognitive processes enabling self-control are not well understood. Traditional models have focused on impulse inhibition: effortfully inhibiting prepotent motor responses toward a temptation, yielding a stage-based evolution of choice. Other models emphasize dynamic competition between goal and temptation, yielding a more integrative evolution of choice. Although these models represent fundamentally different conceptions of self-control, current methods are inadequate for investigating real-time dynamics, leaving the question of which model best describes self-control unresolved. We investigate these models using mouse-tracking: a dynamic, real-time measure of decision-making in which we measure participants’ computer mouse movements as they navigate tradeoffs between immediate and delayed gratification (e.g., $5 today vs. $20 in 3 mo). We develop a quantitative approach that integrates the rich spatial and temporal information contained in mouse trajectories, and find evidence for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Notably, impulse inhibition is less frequent, occurring in only one-quarter of choices favoring larger later rewards over smaller sooner ones. We further find substantial individual variability on who relies on impulse inhibition, with more present-biased individuals more likely to use impulse inhibition to choose larger-later options. Finally, our approach reveals the diverse variability within impulse inhibition and dynamic competition, and accounting for this variability greatly strengthened models predicting out-of-sample choices. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying self-control and introduce a robust tool for quantifying real-time decision-making dynamics.",

LHFPL5 interacts with the tip-link component PCDH15 and the MET-channel component TMC1, suggesting that LHFPL5 regulates channel activation by mechanical force. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed MET in hair cells from mice expressing an LHFPL5 mutant protein lacking three N-terminal amino acids. These mutant mice suffer from recessive deafness, and MET is drastically impaired in cochlear hair cells. The resting open probability of the MET channels is increased in the mutants, while unitary channel conductance, adaptation, and tonotopic channel properties remain unaltered. Unlike in other LHFPL5 mutants, MET channel proteins are still present at normal levels in stereocilia of mutant mice. We conclude that LHFPL5 is required for maximal mechanical activation of MET channels in cochlear hair cells thereby affecting the hair bundle sensitivity to mechanical stimulation and thus the sound sensitivity of the auditory sense organ.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, therapeutic cancer vaccines have been extensively investigated, aiming to boost cancer-specific T cells crucial for antitumor activity. The effectiveness of these vaccines is often limited by insufficient immune activation and suboptimal antigen delivery. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important immune signaling protein that activates host defense genes against infection and cancer. Clinical evaluation of small-molecule STING agonists has shown tepid antitumor responses with immune-related toxicities, particularly when they are administered systemically. To overcome these limitations, we report a stimuli-responsive STING nanovaccine for treating human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers. The nanovaccine consists of di-amidobenzimidazoles (diABZI) conjugated to a STING-activating polymer, PSC7A, through an azobenzene linker as an adjuvant, and HPV16 E7 protein as an antigen. The nanovaccine is responsive to acidic pH and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which enhances antitumor immunity with reduced systemic toxicity. Upon intravenous injection, the STING nanovaccine (25 to 30 nm in diameter) achieved efficient codelivery of E7 protein and STING agonists to the myeloid cell populations in the secondary lymphoid organs and tumors. Interestingly, PSC7A uptake induces NQO1 expression in dendritic cells and macrophages for accelerated diABZI cleavage and STING activation. This results in efficient production of E7-specific CD8 + T cells and robust antitumor response in late-stage TC-1 and metastatic MLM3 tumor models. This study illustrates a systemic STING nanovaccine design that allowed not only tumor regression but also markedly reduced systemic toxicity for innate activation to achieve cancer-specific T cell immunity.",

However, the molecular details of such coupling frequently remain ambiguous. Radical S -adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzymes constitute one of the largest groups of metalloenzymes and catalyze various radical-mediated reactions. While radical SAM enzymes significantly accelerate the conserved radical initiation reaction, the reductive cleavage of SAM into 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dA•), the molecular mechanism of this rate acceleration is largely unexplored. Here, using MoaA, aradical SAM enzyme in the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis, as a model, we reveal the mechanism of substrate-triggered radical initiation. We first elucidated the intact active site structure of MoaA using solution NMR characterization of the C-terminal tail, which was disordered in the reported crystal structures, and its computational docking into the MoaA structure. Together with the comprehensive functional validation, we show that MoaA uses its conformationally flexible C-terminal tail with two conserved Gly residues (GG motif) at the C-terminus as a sensor to detect substrate guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding and trigger reductive SAM cleavage. Importantly, mutations that disrupt this regulatory mechanism cause Moco deficiency disease in humans. Comparison of these observations with other radical SAM enzymes provides insight into the general mechanism of substrate-triggered radical initiation in radical SAM enzymes.",

Structural elucidation of the PA2072 CHASE4 domain in its monomeric and complex states unveils an exquisite molecular switch governed by the oligomeric state.

          "abstract": "Research indicates that midbrain dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction error (RPE) signals involved in positive reinforcement learning. However, studies on dopamine’s role in negative reinforcement learning (NRL) are scarce. Learning to escape aversive stimuli is vital for survival and may differ significantly from positive reinforcement in behavior and neural mechanisms. This study employs footshocks as aversive stimuli to investigate neural activity, synaptic transmission, and intrinsic excitability in a NRL paradigm using fiber photometry and ex vivo electrophysiology. Results show that inescapable footshocks initially increase activity in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons, which later shifts to reflect shock termination as exposure increases. Electrophysiological observations reveal increased intrinsic excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission in SNc neurons, with decreased inhibitory transmission. After mice learn to escape the shock by nose-poking, dopaminergic activity shifts from shock termination to shock onset. Furthermore, inhibitory input increases, while excitatory input decreases after learning, with intrinsic excitability returning to baseline levels. This indicates that SNc dopaminergic neurons exhibit RPE-like signals in response to aversive stimuli, with their intrinsic excitability adjusting according to expectations of shock termination. These findings enhance our understanding of RPE encoding in negative reinforcement learning and may inform therapeutic strategies for disorders caused by environmental factors such as aversive stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Light pollution has been traditionally modeled using clear or completely overcast conditions. Usually, atmospheric conditions are more complex and involve variable cloudiness. To predict light pollution in a realistic atmosphere, we developed a model for computing the artificial night sky brightness over the sky hemisphere, considering the presence of different types of clouds and the cloud fraction. The model is applied to the city of Žilina, Slovakia, which has moderate levels of light pollution and a population of approximately 80,000. We performed simulations for various aerosol optical depths, distances from the city, cloud types, and cloud coverages (from clear to completely overcast). Results show that above the simulated city, the clouds can amplify the zenith artificial radiance by more than 15 times and the irradiance incident at ground level by more than 4 times compared to clear-sky conditions. Outside the city, however, the presence of clouds can have a screening effect, lowering the artificial zenith radiance. Additionally, an analysis performed in photopic units demonstrated that over the urban area, amplification caused by low clouds can generate amplification factors of up to 27 in zenith luminance and 17 in horizontal illuminance. These amplification factors are obtained for a moderately urbanized environment; in highly urbanized areas, even stronger amplification effects might be expected. The model can be used to explain observational data collected by light pollution monitoring networks, particularly at sites where the combination of amplifying and darkening effects of clouds generates ambiguous brightness outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale recording technology have spurred inquiries into the high-dimensional geometry of the neural code. However, characterizing this geometry from noisy neural responses, particularly in datasets with more neurons than trials, poses major statistical challenges. We address this problem by developing tools for the accurate estimation of high-dimensional signal geometry. We apply these tools to investigate the geometry of representations in the mouse primary visual cortex. Previous work has argued that these representations exhibit a power law, in which the i th principal component falls off as 1 / i . Here, we show that response geometry in V1 is better described by a broken power law, in which two different exponents govern the falloff of early and late eigenmodes of population activity. Our analysis reveals that later modes decay more rapidly than previously suggested, resulting in a substantially lower-dimensional representation that is concentrated in early modes. We thus characterize the stimulus encoding of these dominant population modes. We find properties of population coding in the mouse primary visual cortex that underscore its greater tractability relative to single-neuron characterization. Specifically, we find these modes encode visual features with far higher fidelity than single neurons, and these features are easier to characterize than the tuning of single neurons: both classical and deep network models of V1 achieve more than 25 % better predictive performance for eigenmodes than single neurons. Overall, our approach overturns prior results and reveals emergent structure in a population sensory representation.",

These functionalities often drive the creation and control of complex and dynamic fluidic architectures. Introduced here is a class of microfluidic network based on isotachophoresis (ITP), an electrokinetic process that can extract and purify samples, selectively transport, mix, and aliquot (split) samples in a system with no moving parts. Presented is a theoretical framework to describe these networks. The framework relies on the coupling between a one-dimensional description of ITP and two-dimensional, transient graphs to describe the dynamic evolution of ITP networks. We leverage this framework to create numerical simulations of branched ITP circuits. We build, control, and experimentally study a variety of ITP networks. These systems automatically split and merge ITP zones, enabling complex sample manipulation with minimal external control. The model captures the experimentally observed sample dynamics. We demonstrate an example system where an ITP network is used to control and quantify parallel CRISPR-Cas enzymatic reactions. The methods described here are generally applicable to highly complex topologies and may offer a basis for easily reconfigurable, electric field-driven microfluidic systems. Networks generally offer broad potential for automated chemical and biochemical analysis and lab-on-a-chip integration.",

While it is observed throughout the visual system, normalization may be particularly important in higher visual areas, where neurons have large receptive fields (RFs) that are frequently presented with multiple stimuli under natural viewing conditions. Yet it remains unclear how a population of neurons, with diverse selectivities and offset RFs, responds to complex scenes in which given stimuli engage different RFs more effectively than others. Here, we investigated how normalization varies with the spatial offset of stimuli from the centers of neurons’ RFs in the macaque monkey middle temporal area. We found that existing models of normalization perform poorly when stimuli appear in arbitrary RF locations. Instead, an intensity-weighted normalization model, in which intensity is defined as the product of stimulus contrast and a location-specific RF weight, is required to closely account for normalization. Intensity-weighted normalization furthermore explains a systematic increase in contrast sensitivity at sites closer to the field center. Finally, intensity-weighted normalization reveals that spontaneous activity contributes to normalization in a manner indistinguishable from experimental stimuli.",

Using DNA barcoding to test 109 chemically distinct LNPs in vivo, we found that replacing a neutral helper lipid with a neutral glycolipid reduced liver delivery and increased splenic delivery. Consistent with this differential tropism, these glycolipid nanoparticles caused differences in downstream cellular signaling in vivo compared to traditional LNPs.

          "abstract": "The HIV type 1 (HIV-1) accessory proteins Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif) and Viral Protein R (Vpr) are essential for efficient virus replication in vivo. Vif mediates degradation of host restriction factor APOBEC3G, while Vpr modulates the host cell proteome in ways that promote virion infectivity and viral gene expression. In cycling cells including CD4+ T cells, Vif and Vpr also severely impact cell cycle progression for reasons that remain unknown. Here, we combined live-cell imaging with virological assays to define the relative impacts of Vif and Vpr on the cell cycle and single-cell virion production. We demonstrate that Vif and Vpr’s effects on the cell cycle are markedly distinct, with Vif arresting cells in mitosis, while Vpr causes a G2 phase delay followed by endoreplication and reversion of cells into a “pseudo-G1” cell state lacking G2 markers. When coexpressed, Vpr’s capacity to bypass mitosis acts to suppress cytotoxicity associated with Vif-mediated cell cycle arrest, with the two proteins cooperating to extend the infected cell’s time in interphase as much as fivefold. Vpr-driven endoreplication also caused duplication of transcriptionally active proviral genomes, yielding a correlative ~twofold increase in per-cell viral gene expression. Based on these findings, we propose that Vif and Vpr coordinately regulate the cell cycle to prolong the infected cell’s lifespan and maximize single-cell virion output.",

          "abstract": "The Ordovician saw one of the greatest evolutionary radiations in the Earth’s history, precipitating the assembly of modern animal-dominated ecologies in the aftermath of the Cambrian Explosion. However, Ordovician nonmineralized faunas are rare and mostly sample ecologically marginal settings. We describe small carbonaceous fossils (SCFs), including semiarticulated elements preserving submicrometric detail, from epicratonic deposits of the Deadwood and Winnipeg formations (ND). The Osterberg SCFs, associated with biostratigraphically informative conodonts and graptolites, record two successive biotas of Cambrian-Tremadocian (the “lower Osterberg” biota) and Darriwilian (the “upper Osterberg” biota) ages, demonstrating a long-term persistence of high-quality, Burgess Shale-type microfossil preservation after the end of the Cambrian. Their components open a window on normal marine, well-oxygenated Ordovician shelf habitats, revealing taxa and functional morphologies unrecorded by coeval macrofossils. These include specialized grazing and predatory molluskan radulae, triturative crustaceomorph molars, the oldest known eurypterid-type cuticles, and microphagous priapulid worms. The Osterberg fossils attest to an Ordovician co-occurrence of cryptic taxa and feeding adaptations, reminiscent of the most ecologically modern Cambrian biotas, alongside classic later-Paleozoic forms like colonial zooplankton and biomineralized early vertebrates. By contrast, they do not record classic Burgess Shale-style taxa typical of marginal or deeper-water Ordovician assemblages. These results demonstrate a lasting presence of cryptic, modern-style shelf faunas throughout the earliest Paleozoic, suggesting that exceptional Ordovician macrofossil sites are unrepresentative of the broader state of their coeval biosphere.",

          "abstract": "Many existing approaches to generalizing statistical inference amid distribution shift operate under the covariate shift assumption, which posits that the conditional distribution of unobserved variables given observable ones is invariant across populations. However, recent empirical investigations have demonstrated that adjusting for shifts in observed variables (covariate shift) is often insufficient for generalization. In other words, covariate shift does not typically “explain away” the distribution shift between populations. As such, addressing the unknown yet nonnegligible shift in the unobserved variables given observed ones (conditional shift) is crucial for generalizable inference. In this paper, we present empirical evidence from two large-scale multisite replication studies indicating that covariate shift can help predict the strength of unknown conditional shift. Analyzing 680 studies across 65 sites, we find that even though the conditional shift is nonnegligible, its strength can often be bounded by that of the observable covariate shift. This pattern only emerges when the two sources of shifts are quantified by our proposed standardized, pivotal measures. We then interpret this phenomenon by connecting it to similar patterns that can be theoretically derived from a random distribution shift model. Finally, we demonstrate that exploiting the predictive role of covariate shift leads to reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification for target estimates in generalization tasks with partially observed data. Overall, our empirical and theoretical analyses highlight an alternative perspective on the problem of distributional shift, generalizability, and external validity.",

Here, we report our finding that manganese ion (Mn 2+ ) potentiates various TLR agonists, leading to robust activation of the TLR pathway and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway among innate immune cells. In particular, we have observed robust antitumor efficacy after intratumoral administration of a TLR3 agonist and Mn 2+ . To achieve systemic codelivery of TLR3 agonist and Mn 2+ , we have developed a low-molecular-weight poly(inosinic:cytidylic acid)-Mn 2+ coordination lipid nanoparticle (PLCMP). When administered intravenously in tumor-bearing mice, PLCMP successfully accumulated in tumor, induced innate immune activation, generated tumor-specific T cells, and exerted antitumor efficacy in TLR3- and STING-dependent manner without triggering overt toxicity. Moreover, PLCMP in combination with α-PD-1 therapy achieved long-lasting antitumor efficacy in multiple murine tumor models. Furthermore, vaccination with PLCMP carrying TC-1 tumor antigen peptide elicited strong antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses and remodeled the tumor microenvironment, resulting in robust therapeutic efficacy. Overall, these results show that simultaneous activation of the TLR3 and STING pathways via PLCMP provides a promising strategy for immunotherapy and vaccination against cancer.",

          "abstract": "The systematic variation in relative brain size among vertebrate classes remains poorly understood. Here, based on the expensive brain hypothesis, we propose that two broad constraints explain much of the variation: 1) the ability to produce large offspring, and so provide them with the energy required for constructing larger brains, and 2) the ability to sustain continuously high body temperatures, because cooler and varying brain temperatures reduce brain performance and thus fitness. We therefore predicted that encephalization (major evolutionary increases in brain size) only happened where changes in physiology or natural history created these abilities. First, comparative analyses across all major vertebrate classes (n = 2600 species) revealed that protecting or provisioning eggs or embryos is associated with larger newborns. Subsequent analyses at the class level confirmed that newborn size and adult brain size underwent correlated evolution in birds, mammals, and cartilaginous fishes, but not in other fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. Second, we found a positive relationship between mean body temperature and brain size within each class (albeit sometimes insignificant). Third, a combined analysis across all vertebrates revealed a positive interaction between the effects of body temperature and newborn size. In conclusion, encephalization became most pronounced in vertebrate lineages that can both produce large offspring, reflecting internal fertilization with matrotrophy, and sustain high body temperature, partly linked to endothermy.",

Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing were performed on carcinoma, polyp, and normal mucosa samples from multiple sites from seven patients with GAPPS (n = 54 samples). We comprehensively investigated genomic alterations (including copy number alterations and somatic mutations), clonal architecture, and transcriptome dynamics during carcinogenesis. Genomic evolutionary analysis showed that in GAPPS, somatic mutations of APC occur in carcinoma and polyp while mutations of KRAS additionally occur in carcinoma. We also found the co-occurrence of APC and KRAS mutations in carcinoma recurrently both across cases and within subclones of the same case. The co-occurrence of APC/KRAS mutations may contribute to the carcinogenesis of GAPPS.

          "abstract": "The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS–STING) pathway is an important DNA-sensing mechanism that increases T cell trafficking and activation in tumors and reverses the immunosuppressive phenotype of myeloid cells. Therefore, direct STING targeting using synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) is an attractive strategy for treating lymphocyte-depleted and myeloid cell–enriched tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM). However, inadequate bioavailability and poor cellular accumulation limit the clinical development of CDNs, particularly for noninvasive administration strategies. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) have emerged as promising modular constructs for creating therapeutic lead compounds for many diseases, including different forms of cancer. Here, we report the development of cGAS-activating SNAs that consist of gold nanoparticle cores functionalized with a shell of densely packed interferon-stimulatory DNA oligonucleotides (ISD 45 -SNAs). These nanostructures bind to cGAS, the sensor of cytosolic dsDNA upstream of STING, promoting the catalytic production of endogenous CDNs and downstream STING activation more potently than clinically tested CDNs. When administered intranasally or intratumorally to poorly immunogenic syngeneic GBM mouse models, ISD 45 -SNAs inhibit tumor growth more effectively than CDNs and promote long-term animal subject survival through specific cGAS–STING pathway activation. ISD 45 -SNAs induce a proinflammatory immune microenvironment enriched with effector T cells and proinflammatory macrophages. When coadministered with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), they abolish GBM tumor development and induce long-term antiglioma immunity. These studies establish ISD 45 -SNAs as an immune-stimulatory modality for triggering innate and adaptive immune responses and increasing ICI efficacy for GBM treatment.",

Tracking terrestrial DOM in the ocean has proven challenging due to factors such as the instability of terrestrial biomarkers, indistinguishable carbon isotopes from biogeochemical fractionation, and similar chemical composition between terrestrial and oceanic DOM. Here, we show that the terrestrial contribution to oceanic organic carbon pools is 1.7 to 2.5 times higher than previously assumed, highlighting the need to adjust global carbon cycle models. We derive these estimates by bridging high-performance liquid chromatography with ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the presence of terrestrial molecules that are transported from rivers to the ocean and estimate their contribution to oceanic DOM. We identified 269 molecular formulae (MF) that are likely transported from land to the ocean. These formulae exhibited resistance to biological and photochemical degradation in incubation experiments, and were widely distributed in global rivers, marginal seas, and open oceans, suggesting that they are ubiquitous in inland and ocean waters and have a similar source. By relating the abundances of terrestrially derived MF to dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and radiocarbon measurements, we estimated that 16.7 to 25.0% of oceanic DOM is likely derived from rivers.",

          "abstract": "RNA base editing has the capability to rewrite genetic codes while offering improved safety due to its reversibility and temporal-spatial tunability. The development of cytosine-to-uridine editors faces issues of DNA mutagenic activity of APOBECs and the large-size anchoring domains associated with immunogenicity due to their microbial origin. To address these issues, we took an approach by returning to the original formula of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), i.e., to convert ADAR2 to a cytosine deaminase acting on RNA by introducing 17 mutant substitutions derived from RESCUE-S—it is named ADAR2-mimic base editor for C-to-U RNA editing (AMBER). AMBER displays similar sequence contexts preference to that of RESCUE, and exhibits robust performance across various tested cell lines. By applying AMBER to correct several pathogenic transcript mutations, we achieved substantial editing with efficiency ranging from 8 to 38%. For example, for the Pah mutant (c.788T&gt;C) that caused phenylketonuria in mice, AMBER had an editing efficiency of 19.7% in HEK293T cells. Additionally, concurrent bystander editing of target transcripts was mitigated by two alternate strategies. To demonstrate its effectiveness in vivo, we applied AMBER in C57BL/6 mice, and observed gRNA-dependent editing with ~21% on-target efficiencies at 72 h post injection, which remained detectable up to 1 wk. RNA-sequencing analysis of the mouse liver transcriptome revealed minimal off-target effects and no significant changes to endogenous RNA editing events. These results highlight AMBER as a promising therapeutic tool for repairing T-to-C mutations, offering great potential for the treatment of genetic diseases.",

Nevertheless, fundamental questions persist regarding the precise mechanisms of FER-mediated signal transduction and its context-dependent functional specialization in multicellular processes. Here, we develop Ferovicin (FRV), a small-molecule inhibitor that specifically disrupts FER kinase activity, thereby enabling mechanistic dissection of FER. Cocrystallization and mutational analysis show that FRV selectively binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain of FER and inhibits its kinase activity. Assisted by the FRV tool and quantitative phosphoproteomics, we characterized a series of signaling pathways and networks regulated by RALF1 and FER. Notably, our analysis reveals that RALF1 activates FER through phosphorylation at Ser695, which subsequently inhibits H + -ATPase1/2 via phosphorylation at Ser899. This mechanism leads to apoplastic alkalinization and regulates cell expansion in the root meristem. Given the conservation of FRV binding sites in FER proteins across land plant species, FRV will serve as a valuable tool for dissecting FER signaling mechanisms as well as facilitating agricultural applications.",

Can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is paramount to understanding hard sphere jamming, a key model of disordered matter. We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent–like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson–Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class. Along the way, the physical origin of a dynamical Gardner transition is identified.",

          "abstract": "Memory consolidation refers to a process of engram reorganization and stabilization that is thought to occur primarily during sleep through a combination of neural replay, homeostatic plasticity, synaptic maturation, and pruning. From a computational perspective, however, this process remains puzzling, as it is unclear how to incorporate the underlying mechanisms into a common mathematical model of learning and memory. Here, we propose a solution by deriving a self-supervised consolidation model that uses replay and two-factor synapses to encode memories in neural networks in a way that maximizes the robustness of cued recall with respect to intrinsic synaptic noise. We show that the dynamics of this optimization make the connectivity sparse and offer a unified account of several experimentally observed signs of consolidation, such as multiplicative homeostatic scaling, task-driven synaptic pruning, increased neural stimulus selectivity, and preferential strengthening of weak memories. The model also reproduces developmental trends in connectivity and stimulus selectivity better than previous models. Finally, it predicts that intrinsic synaptic noise fluctuations should scale sublinearly with synaptic strength; we find support for this in a meta-analysis of published synaptic imaging datasets.",

Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of Thermus thermophilus MreD in complex with another essential Rod complex component, MreC. The structure reveals that a periplasmic-facing pocket of MreD interacts with multiple membrane-proximal regions of MreC. We use single-molecule FRET to show that MreD controls the conformation of MreC through these contacts, inducing a state primed for Rod complex activation.

These nonstandard amino acids are beneficial as they facilitate novel biochemical reactions. However, code expansion leads to ambiguity at the recoded stop codon, which can either be read-through or terminated. Pyrrolysine (Pyl) is encoded by the amber codon (TAG/UAG) and is widespread in archaea, where it is required for methylamine-mediated methanogenesis, an environmentally important metabolism. Mechanisms to conditionally suppress the amber stop codon for Pyl installation during protein synthesis have not been identified. In the model methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans, we demonstrate that the UAG codon encodes dual meaning as stop and Pyl. Our data suggest that expression of Pyl biosynthesis and incorporation genes is tuned to the cellular demand for Pyl, which might allow these archaea to navigate ambiguous stop decoding in response to environmental cues.",

Here, we reveal a PYLs–bHLH IVc–YSLs module that mediates ABA-dependent suppression of seed Fe accumulation in Arabidopsis . During seed maturation, ABA receptors PYLs directly interact with bHLH34/104/115 transcription factors, blocking their binding to YSL1/3 promoters to inhibit Fe transport. Conversely, Fe deficiency triggers bHLH104/115 to repress ABA2 , reducing ABA biosynthesis and PYL expression to derepress YSL1/3 expression—a feedback loop balancing Fe and ABA levels. Genetic analyses confirm that this module governs Fe loading, as ABA-deficient mutants ( aba2-1 , nced6-1 ) and pyr1 pyl124 quadruple mutants accumulate higher Fe, while bhlh34 104 115 phenocopies ysl1 ysl3 Fe deficiency. Our findings establish ABA as a dual regulator that safeguards Fe homeostasis by preventing toxicity during maturation while enabling adaptive Fe storage under deficiency. This mechanistic insight opens avenues for bioengineering crops with enhanced seed Fe content, addressing global nutritional challenges.",

The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum harbors 40 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, yet the specific and collective functions remain poorly understood. PKSs require activation by the phosphopantetheinyl transferase DiSfp, which converts inactive apoenzymes into functional holo forms. Disruption of the DiSfp gene abolished the production of PKS-derived metabolites across all developmental stages. Integrated phenotypic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses revealed impaired growth in liquid culture, defects in macropinocytosis, aberrant chemotaxis, and diminished spore formation, associated with altered expression of genes regulating these processes. Comparative metabolomic profiling of the mutant identified candidate polyketide metabolites across different developmental stages, providing a valuable resource for targeted identification and isolation of previously undescribed compounds.

However, while nanoparticle vaccines have elevated uptake, the impact of intracellular protein release and how this affects processing and downstream responses are not fully understood. Herein, we reveal how tuning unmodified antigen release rate, specifically through modulation of metal–organic framework (MOF) pore size, influences the type and extent of raised adaptive immunity. We use two MOFs in the NU-100x series with 1.4 nm difference in pore diameter, employ facile postsynthesis loading to achieve significant internalization of model protein antigen ovalbumin ( ca. 1.4 mg/mg), and observe distinct antigen release and intracellular processing profiles influenced by MOF pore size. We investigate how this difference in release biases downstream CD8 + , T H 1, and T H 2 T cell responses. Ovalbumin-loaded NU-1003 induced 1.8-fold higher CD8 + :CD4 + T cell proliferation ratio and displayed 2.2-fold greater ratio of CD4 + T H 1:T H 2 cytokines compared to ovalbumin-loaded NU-1000. Antigen released from NU-1000 in vivo exhibited stronger antigen-specific IgG responses, which is dependent on CD4 + T cells (up to ninefold stronger long-term antibody production and 5.9-fold higher IgG1:IgG2a ratio), compared to NU-1003. When translated to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, RBD-loaded NU-1000 induced 60.5-fold higher IgG1:IgG2a compared to NU-1003. Wild-type RBD-loaded NU-1000 immunization also induced a greater breadth of epitope recognition compared to NU-1003, as evidenced by increased binding antibodies to the Omicron RBD variant. Overall, this work highlights how antigen release significantly influences immunity induced by vaccines and offers a path to employ unmodified antigen release kinetics to drive personalized protective responses.",

          "abstract": "Biomanufactured fibers produced through fermentation processes provide a promising pathway to decouple textile production from agricultural land. This would free up arable land for food cultivation and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. Protein fibers from natural sources such as cocoon silk, collagen, and soy have attracted attention since the last century. However, commercial production declined with the rise of cheaper synthetic fibers and competition for food crops. Recently, renewed interest in protein fibers has emerged as a means to minimize plastic pollution, fueled by advances in fermentation, even though challenges related to yield, costs, and industrial spinning persist. Here, we studied a lyocell-based technique for spinning protein fibers using yeast biomass purified through an enzymatic method. We demonstrated that the enzymatic approach produces insoluble proteins that can be continuously spun for over 100 h of production time. Pilot-scale production exhibited stable spinning behavior with high viscosity and consistency quality. We achieved fiber fineness between 1.7 and 2.2 dtex, with strength values reaching 23 cN/tex, which is 50% higher than those of natural protein fibers such as wool. Life cycle assessment indicates that fermentation-based protein fibers require significantly less land and water than natural fibers while providing a reduced environmental footprint. Techno-economic analysis indicates a cost of $6 per kilogram at a production rate of 6,750 t annually. Adopting biomanufacturing-based protein fibers marks a significant advancement toward a future where fiber needs are fulfilled without compromising the planet’s capacity to nourish its growing population.",

Messina et al., Sci. Rep. 2 , 765 (2012)], we hypothesized that encapsulating lymphoid chemokines and cytokines in controlled-release biomaterials would allow for their sustained delivery to the local tissue microenvironment, promote immune T-cell and B-cell accumulation, and lead to the in situ formation of TLS-like structures. To test this hypothesis, we encapsulated CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and lymphotoxin-α1β2 in lipid-coated microparticles (MPs) and embedded them in a biodegradable thermosensitive hydrogel designed to gel rapidly and release encapsulated payloads at injection sites over several days. In mice, subcutaneous injections of chemokine/cytokine-releasing MPs in hydrogel led to a substantial increase in CD45 + immune cell accumulation within newly developed structures surrounding the residual hydrogel after 3 wk. This influx was accompanied by a marked increase in the numbers of CD19 + B cells and CD3 + T cells. Using a mouse model of melanoma, we further show these induced structures can suppress tumor growth by promoting tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. These findings indicate that chemokine/cytokine-releasing MPs in hydrogel can induce lymphoid structures resembling TLSs, highlighting their potential both as preclinical models for elucidating mechanisms regulating TLS formation and as platforms for therapeutic interventions against tumors.",

However, T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment leads to tumor cell escape and BiTE therapy resistance. Herein, we developed a drug-loaded bispecific T cell nanoengager (NanoBiTE) to overcome this obstacle. NanoBiTE is composed of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle encapsulating the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist PBF-509 as a core, with a lipid layer surface coating as a shell and modification with anti-CD19 and anti-CD3 antibodies for tumor and T cell binding, respectively. Like the traditional BiTE blinatumomab, NanoBiTE can engage T cells with CD19 + tumor cells to promote tumor cell lysis. However, unlike blinatumomab, which tends to induce T cell exhaustion, we showed that the release of PBF-509 from NanoBiTE suppressed the A2AR pathway and substantially improved tumor cell killing induced by NanoBiTE. Moreover, NanoBiTE treatment led to substantially reduced tumor burden in vivo in a humanized mouse model. Our results demonstrate that NanoBiTE is a safe and potent bispecific therapy that can also reduce T cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy.",

The main challenge is to predict drug-resistant mutations and design drugs that retain efficacy against such evolving targets. Our previous effort in computing the vitality value has provided a framework in assessing drug resistance. While promising, the approach lacked accuracy due to insufficient information about mutation tendencies and protein stability. In this study, we used the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database and observed that drug resistance, usually quantified as K i mutant / K i WT , exhibits a positive correlation with the Maximum Entropy energy, E M a x E n t . However, both drug resistance and vitality are also correlated with the number of mutations, indicating that the virus cannot easily gain resistance through specific mutational pathways and must sacrifice stability and function to escape inhibition. To overcome this number dependence, we looked for a system with less extensive mutagenesis and chose HCV protease. In this case, resistance substitutions cluster at low E M a x E n t values, reflecting a limited mutational space. This restricted landscape enables E M a x E n t to predict evolutionary pathways of resistance and to guide the identification of robust therapeutic candidates.",

          "abstract": "The β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases are pivotal elongation enzymes that catalyze the condensation of acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP with malonyl-ACP to produce β-ketoacyl-ACP. Among these, the homologous enzymes FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III) and the recently characterized BioZ play crucial roles, initiating the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and biotin, respectively. FabH primarily utilizes acetyl-CoA as the primer substrate, whereas BioZ exclusively condenses the longer glutaryl-CoA, which contains a charged ω-carboxyl group. Despite their similar catalytic mechanisms, the molecular bases for the strict substrate specificities remain undetermined. Here, we report crystal structures of the BioZ: glutaryl-CoA cocrystalized complexes and demonstrate the ability to swap the physiological functions and substrate specificities between FabH and BioZ. This functional interchange was achieved by grafting the β8-α9 loop plus residue Ala317 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens BioZ to Escherichia coli FabH, resulting in a shift in substrate preference from acetyl-CoA to glutaryl-CoA. The reverse manipulations of BioZ resulted in FabH activity. These data identify the structural elements as the minimal determinants of substrate specificity and enzyme function. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis by FabH and BioZ and offer a foundation for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies against these enzymes.",

          "abstract": "The population receptive field (pRF) approach to functional measurement of the sensory properties of magnetic resonance (MR)-identified locations in the human brain was extended to include the third dimension of binocular depth. In total, pRFs were extracted from nine different visual areas (V1, V2, V3, V3AB, V4, V5, V7, Ventral Occipital Cortex: VOC, Lateral Occipital Cortex: LOC) of the human cortex and, where possible, comparisons were made with electrophysiological recordings from homologous areas in the macaque cortex. Human and macaque V1 showed strikingly similar information profiles for the encoding of binocular depth. Further, both human and macaque V5 showed consistent changes in preferred binocular depth of the stimulus, dependent on whether the stimuli were binocularly correlated or anticorrelated. Across the nine areas of the visual cortex explored, the population profiles of pRFs for binocular depth showed evidence of a greater responsiveness to relative depth in higher visual cortical areas, again consistent with the findings from macaque electrophysiology. Overall, the pRF measures of cortical response were more sensitive to fine-scale differences of binocular depth, compared with many existing electrophysiological measures of tuning for binocular depth. Our results show that the pRF method can be extended beyond the characterization of RFs in retinotopic coordinates to reveal higher-order, derived visual properties. The parallels between noninvasive, MR-based measures of pRFs in humans and the electrophysiological recordings of single neurons in experimental animals make a further step toward validation of the pRF methodology.",

RANK, a cognate receptor for RANKL, is abundantly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells and controls vascular permeability by regulating the expression patterns of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. High RANKL expression was detected in perivascular C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 12-abundant reticular (CAR) stromal cells. Specific deletion of RANKL expression in CAR cells abrogated the vascular leakage, suggesting that perivascular RANKL is responsible for controlling permeability. In summary, our study revealed a role for RANK/RANKL signaling as a gatekeeper of bone marrow sinusoids in vivo.",

          "abstract": "To mount a robust and durable immune response, the antigen in a vaccine must be processed efficiently in the appropriate intracellular compartment. Here, we report an approach for optimizing the antigen processing pathway and efficiency by using the modular design of spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanostructures. We utilized the substrate specificity of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase1 (ERAP1), a protease known to generate major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) epitopes in the endoplasmic reticulum, to design two ERAP1-responsive peptide linkers (EPLs). The peptide linkers append the peptide antigen onto the SNAs to bias the processing pathway toward ERAP1 and to vary the antigen processing efficiency. The two EPLs varied ERAP1 antigen processing efficiency by 10-fold. Subsequently, the EPLs increased colocalization of the antigen with ERAP1 by up to ca. 58% when compared to an SNA that did not employ this linker. The EPL that drove more efficient cleavage, augmented antigen surface presentation by 30%, ex vivo CD8 + T cell proliferation by fivefold, and in vivo generation of proinflammatory and effector memory CD8 + T cells by 5% and 18%, respectively. Furthermore, the more efficiently processed EPL-containing SNA resulted in a 2.5-fold more effective inhibition of E.G7-OVA lymphoma tumors in vivo. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of the deliberate and rational design of vaccine structures to spatially bias antigen processing and elevate its processing efficiency to augment immune stimulation.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying heat transport in turbulent convection remains a challenge. The two competing models of heat transport predict that the nondimensional heat flux, known as the Nusselt number (Nu), is proportional to Ra 1 / 3 (classical scaling) and Ra 1 / 2 (ultimate-regime scaling), where Ra is the Rayleigh number. Some experiments and simulations report that the Nusselt number transitions from near classical scaling, Ra 0.30 , to a larger power law when the boundary layer turns turbulent near Ra ≈ 10 14 . However, others find Ra 0.30 scaling to continue for larger Ra. In this work, we perform a comparative study of Rayleigh-Bénard, compressible, and periodic convection in two and three dimensions using direct numerical simulations. We show that up to Ra = 10 16 in two dimensions and up to Ra = 10 13 in three dimensions, the positive and negative energy fluxes in Rayleigh-Bénard and compressible convection are nearly equal. However, in the distribution function, the positive fluxes have longer tails than the negative ones, and the differences between the positive and negative fluxes scale as Ra − 0.20 , which leads to Nu ∼ Ra 0.30 . The above robust and universal properties, even in the presence of a logarithmic layer in compressible convection, indicate a likely absence of the ultimate regime in turbulent thermal convection. In contrast, periodic convection, which is related to the ultimate regime, exhibits a predominantly positive heat flux.",

A recent theoretical model has proposed that out-of-equilibrium central dogma reactions involving mRNA and ribosomes play a significant role in this process. Here, we test this idea in the Escherichia coli model system using high-throughput fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic devices. We compare our experimental observations with predictions from a reaction–diffusion model that includes central dogma-related reactions and excluded volume interactions between ribosomal subunits, polysomes, and chromosomal DNA. Our results show that the nonequilibrium reactions of ribosomes cause them to aggregate at the midcell, and this process facilitates the separation of the two daughter chromosomes. However, the observed effects are weaker in live cells than our one-dimensional reaction–diffusion model predicts. Rather than relying solely on active mRNA–ribosome dynamics, our data suggest that the closing division septum via steric interactions and potentially entropic forces between two DNA strands coupled to cell elongation act as additional mechanisms to ensure faithful partitioning of the nucleoids to two daughter cells.",

Binding-based screening methods for GPCR ligands often require conformationally stable, purified receptors. However, obtaining large quantities of GPCRs in stable states, particularly with unoccupied extracellular ligand-binding pockets and especially in their active conformations, remains challenging due to the inherent dynamic nature of these receptors. To address this challenge, we propose a universal approach for stabilizing GPCRs in specific conformations. Using the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1R) as a model, we successfully stabilized M1R in its active conformation through de novo design of a fusion protein, and further demonstrated the generalizability of this strategy by applying it to other GPCRs. We screened a synthetic yeast display library of nanobodies against both the stabilized active-state and previously reported inactive-state M1R, identifying several nanobodies that specifically recognize each conformation. This method not only facilitates the stabilization of GPCRs in desired states but also provides valuable tools for developing more selective therapeutic agents, enhancing drug discovery efficiency and specificity.",

          "abstract": "The MEK–ERK pathway is a key driver of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis, and BRAF mutations, particularly BRAF V600E , can contribute to its activation. Although BRAF V600E mutations are rare in human HCC, they do occur, yet their physiologic impact in liver cells, especially when combined with frequent comutations in tumor suppressor genes, remains poorly understood. Moreover, the effect of BRAF inhibitors on HCC progression and metastasis is not well-defined. Therefore, we developed mouse models with hepatocyte-specific BRAF V600E expression and Trp53 or Cdkn2a deletion to assess tumor development, subtypes, and metastatic patterns. We found that BRAF V600E expression caused hepatomegaly, vascular congestion, and ductal reactions, and led to reduced liver function and early mortality. Codeletion of Trp53 or Cdkn2a markedly increased primary liver tumor incidence and enabled sarcomatoid metastasis. While the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 effectively reduced primary tumors and extended survival, it paradoxically increased sarcomatoid metastases. Mechanistically, PLX4720 and other RAF inhibitors induced TGFβ2 expression which promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced tumorigenicity. The effects of RAF inhibitors on TGFβ2 expression were validated in BRAF V600E -mutant human melanoma cells. We conclude that BRAF V600E drives diverse primary tumors but only one type of metastasis and that RAF inhibition, while effective against primary tumors, may promote metastasis through TGFβ2-mediated EMT. Although RAF inhibitors remain promising therapies, their unintended role in enhancing metastasis raises concerns that may extend beyond liver cancer to other BRAF V600E -driven malignancies.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells comprise a significant proportion of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and often have compromised expression or repression of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which prevents effective stimulation of interferon genes (STING) signaling. Here, we leverage the cancer cells and hijack their cellular machinery for increased production of cGAMP, differing from conventional strategies whereby synthetic STING agonists are delivered to immune cells in the TME as a bolus dose, are rapidly cleared and can cause systemic toxicity. Increasing evidence suggests that cGAMP derived from cancer cells can act on proximal immune cells, activating STING, contributing to an antitumor immune response. We used lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA coding for cGAS which catalyzes the production of cGAMP. We observed dramatic increases in extracellular and intracellular cGAMP when cancer cells were transfected with cGAS mRNA and genomic DNA, the substrate for cGAS. We confirmed that cGAS and cGAMP are functional due to activation of immune cells, through a combination of extracellular transfer and cell–cell contact mechanisms. Treatment of syngeneic murine melanoma with cGAS LNPs reduced tumor growth significantly and further benefit was observed upon combination with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1). Moreover, we found increased activation in CD8 + T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the TME post treatment with cGAS LNPs. These findings highlight how cancer cells can be used to actively contribute to their own elimination and may be a broadly applicable strategy for delivery of other reprogramming molecules to cancer cells and wider therapeutic combinations.",

We unequivocally unveil that Li + transport in SEI mainly follows a mechanism of successive displacement. We further reveal that in accordance with the spatial dependence of SEI structure across the thickness, the apparent Li + self-diffusivity continuously drops from the SEI–electrolyte side to the SEI–electrode side (6.7 × 10 −19 m 2 /s to 1.0 × 10 −20 m 2 /s), setting a quantitative gauging of both ionic transport behavior of the SEI layer against the underlying electrode and the rate-limiting step of battery operation.

Regulators of hepatic mobilization aside from vitamin A status itself are ill-defined. Here, we show that amino acid (AA) insufficiency by diet (low-protein, leucine-devoid diet) or drug (asparaginase, ASNase) elevated liver RBP4 without depleting hepatic retinoid stores. In addition, ASNase reduced liver TTR protein. Furthermore, circulating ROH–RBP4–TTR levels were attenuated, and retinoid levels in peripheral organs were perturbed. To understand the basis for elevated RBP4 in the liver, we isolated total and polysomal mRNA to assess gene-specific translation. ASNase significantly reduced Rbp4 mRNA translation, indicating that elevated hepatic RBP4 protein was not due to increased protein synthesis. In contrast, ASNase reduced Ttr mRNA abundance but not its translation. Global deletion of the AA insufficiency sensor, general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), lessened ASNase-induced RBP4 protein accumulation in the liver but did not rescue circulating ROH–RBP4 levels. These effects were replicated by chemical inhibition of GCN2 in ASNase-exposed primary hepatocytes. Finally, hepatocyte-specific knockout of autophagy-related 7, an enzyme involved in autophagy and protein secretion, fully rescued circulating ROH–RBP4–TTR and normalized liver RBP4 and TTR during ASNase.

          "abstract": "Metabolic pathways are typically dysregulated in cancer to support critical cellular processes. In response to metabolic disturbances, cancer cells preferentially manipulate stress sensors to enhance their adaptability. Sestrin 2 (SESN2), a highly conserved protein induced by various stressors, is implicated in this adaptation. Mutations and alterations of SESN2 are prevalent among cancer patients, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression. However, the functions and regulation of SESN2 in cancer, particularly in virus-induced cancer, remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that latent infection with Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) stabilizes and upregulates SESN2 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation across multiple cell lines. Notably, KSHV-encoded vCyclin, a homolog of cellular Cyclin D, directly interacts with SESN2 and promotes its stabilization by recruiting the deubiquitinase OTUB1, thereby blocking SESN2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Moreover, vCyclin- and OTUB1-mediated stabilization of SESN2 activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which supports the survival and growth of KSHV-driven primary effusion lymphoma cells. Importantly, the lysine at residue 74 of vCyclin is crucial for its cytosolic localization, OTUB1 recruitment, and subsequent SESN2 upregulation and AMPK activation. These findings unveil a regulatory mechanism for SESN2 involving vCyclin and OTUB1, positioning them as potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with AMPK dysregulation.",

Moreover, 6Y13 conferred complete protection in mice against lethal H7N9 challenge in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments. Structural analysis by cryoelectron microscopy indicated that 6Y13 binds to a unique conserved site on the HA head, distinct from the receptor-binding site and lateral patch. Nevertheless, 6Y13 efficiently blocked viral receptor binding without interfering with HA receptor binding, independent of Fc-mediated steric hindrance. Our findings provide a promising therapeutic candidate against pan-H7 subtype viruses and are beneficial for the design of H7 subtype influenza vaccine immunogens.",

          "abstract": "People acquire concepts through rich physical and social experiences and use them to understand and navigate the world. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), trained solely through next-token prediction on text, exhibit strikingly human-like behaviors. Are these models developing concepts akin to those of humans? If so, how are such concepts represented, organized, and related to behavior? Here, we address these questions by investigating the representations formed by LLMs during an in-context concept inference task. We found that LLMs can flexibly derive concepts from linguistic descriptions in relation to contextual cues about other concepts. The derived representations converge toward a shared, context-independent structure, and alignment with this structure reliably predicts model performance across various understanding and reasoning tasks. Moreover, the convergent representations effectively capture human behavioral judgments and closely align with neural activity patterns in the human brain, providing evidence for biological plausibility. Together, these findings establish that structured, human-like conceptual representations can emerge purely from language prediction without real-world grounding, highlighting the role of conceptual structure in understanding intelligent behavior. More broadly, our work suggests that LLMs offer a tangible window into the nature of human concepts and lays the groundwork for advancing alignment between artificial and human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Conductive folding metamaterials (CFMs) represent a class of cross-physical-domain new-type metamaterials. However, the inherently nonfoldable nature of intrinsic conductive materials and the incompatibility between conductivity and extreme foldability have posed formidable challenges for their design and fabrication. To overcome these limitations, we developed a laser–electric-field coupled biomimetic spinning (LECBS) technique, which couples laser induction with cocoon/lotus-root-inspired biomimicry in a fast electrospinning Taylor cone reaction. Using this approach, we report the fabrication of CFMs composed of hierarchically adaptive carbon nanofiber networks. The CFMs constitute a new class of artificially microstructured composites with extraordinary physical properties absent in nature, filling a critical gap in the metamaterials family. The resulting CFMs endure up to 10 7 cycles, and potentially unlimited cycles, of true folding without damage, in arbitrary directions and with unrestricted 360° flexibility. Simultaneously, they achieve electrical conductivities on the order of 10 3 S·m − 1 , nearly one order of magnitude higher than comparable systems without carbon nanotubes. Mechanistic studies reveal that LECBS can effectively modulate Taylor cone hydrodynamics and jet behavior through photo-electro-matter interactions, which yields thinner nanofibers, enhanced sliding freedom of nanofibers, and axial alignment of CNTs in carbon nanofibers. Real-time SEM observations demonstrate the formation of characteristic M-shaped creases with “separated layers–smooth arcs–slidable grooves” during folding, which successfully disperse stress, in excellent agreement with finite element simulations. This work not only represents a breakthrough in metamaterials but also a technological revolution, opening new opportunities for flexible and foldable electronics fields.",

          "abstract": "Modeling the conformational heterogeneity of protein–small molecule interactions is important for understanding natural systems and evaluating designed systems but remains an outstanding challenge. We reasoned that while residue-level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state, an entirely atomic-level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called PLACER (protein-ligand atomistic conformational ensemble resolver) trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. PLACER accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding. When given a description of the larger protein context, it builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein–small molecule docking. Because PLACER is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using PLACER to assess the accuracy and preorganization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a k cat / K M of 11,000 M −1 min −1 , considerably higher than any pre–deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that PLACER will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule–protein systems and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.",

These activity-dependent mechanisms induce changes in synaptic efficiency over both transient and extended timescales. Understanding the molecular basis of learning and memory is central to deciphering brain function and advancing therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that lipid bilayers with embedded gramicidin A ion channels can structurally reorganize when interrogated using a neurologically inspired electrical stimulation protocol, adopting metastable structures with enhanced STP response and emergent LTP or LTD. Specifically, voltage-induced electrocompression is found to restructure membranes, driving them into nonequilibrium steady states with enhanced stability and increased ionic conductivity, leading to stronger and persistent membrane ion conductance.

However, the precise regulatory mechanisms controlling LAP remain poorly understood. Here, we identify enkurin domain-containing protein 1 (ENKD1) as a key negative regulator of LAP during infection with these pathogens. Macrophages infected with L. monocytogenes (10403S), S. typhimurium (ATCC14028), or F. novicida (U112) exhibit significant ENKD1 downregulation. ENKD1-deficient macrophages display enhanced antibacterial activity, characterized by increased LAP, higher reactive oxygen species production, enhanced LC3 lipidation on phagosomes, and improved phagosome-lysosome fusion. In vivo, ENKD1 - deficient mice ex hibited improved bacterial clearance in the liver and spleen, with notable survival benefits. Mechanistically, ENKD1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), which mediates degradation of Run domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (RUBCN) through K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby dampening RUBCN’s role in LAP. Our findings reveal an ENKD1–TRIM21–RUBCN axis that suppresses LAP, providing insights into antibacterial immune regulation and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense against intracellular pathogens.",

Intense experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to establishing the rich nontrivial metallic and heavy fermion phases intertwined with such localized electronic states. Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV 2 O 4 , an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean-field theory to reveal a kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed interatomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund’s coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature “bad” metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV 2 O 4 . Simultaneously, it opens a path to achieving flat bands through electronic interactions in d -orbital systems with geometrical frustration, potentially enabling the realization of exotic phases of matter such as the fractionalized Fermi liquids.",

Such compounds achieve half-life extension of zanamivir, while recruiting polyclonal immunoglobulins of all isotypes regardless of specificity to infected cells for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Since the influenza A virus (IAV) NA is a tetramer, we produced VHH kappa adducts with 1, 2, or 4 zanamivir molecules attached in a site-specific manner, to allow multivalent engagement of NA. Administration of a VHH kappa adduct modified with 4 zanamivir molecules (VHH kappa –Zan 4 ) was ~10-fold more potent in protection against infection with IAV than VHH kappa –Zan carrying only a single zanamivir molecule. VHH kappa –Zan 4 can be given intranasally to confer full protection against a lethal IAV challenge. The neutralizing antibody titers in the respiratory mucosa and in the circulation, as well as the serum IgG antibody response against the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein, are higher in VHH kappa –Zan 4 treated mice that survived the lethal challenge than in controls infected with a sublethal dose of virus. VHH kappa –Zan 4 affords protection even when given intranasally weeks prior to a challenge with a lethal dose of IAV. This type of adduct can therefore be applied prophylactically and therapeutically and does not require prior immunization for protection against a lethal dose of IAV.",

Cuticle cracks have long been identified as essential for salt to reach the leaf surface but enable a potentially desiccating continuity between the brine and the gland interior. Using the secreting salt gland of Nolana mollis as a model system, we integrate mathematical modeling, imaging, and physiological measurements to examine the mechanical and biochemical processes required for efficient salt removal. We find that the subcuticular space between the concentrated surface brine and the more dilute secreting cell eases the energetic limits of active salt secretion by reducing the concentration gradient of salt across the cell membrane. We show that crack size plays a critical role in balancing the osmotic and pressure gradients required for salt removal without runaway foliar desiccation.",

These newly acquired features of postrepair chromatin are transmitted to daughter cells and manifest as heritable impairments of gene expression.

          "abstract": "In 2023, an unprecedented drought and heat wave severely affected Amazon waters, leading to high mortality of fishes and river dolphins. Five of 10 lakes monitored had exceptionally high daytime water temperatures (over 37°C), with one large lake reaching up to 41°C in the entire approximately 2-meter-deep water column and up to 13°C of diel variation. Modeling showed that high solar radiation, reduced water depth and wind speed, and turbid waters were the main drivers of the high temperatures. This extreme heating of Amazon waters follows a long-term increase of 0.6°C/decade revealed by satellite estimates across the region’s lakes between 1990 and 2023. With ongoing climate change, temperatures that approach or exceed thermal tolerances for aquatic life are likely to become more common in tropical aquatic systems.",

Forecasting these impacts requires mechanistic understanding of how Arctic sea ice responds to climate change, but this is limited by scarce long-term records. We present continuous 30,000-year reconstructions of sea-ice coverage from the Arctic Ocean based on measurements of two isotopes, thorium-230 and extraterrestrial helium-3, whose burial ratio changes with sea-ice coverage. We found that the central Arctic was perennially covered by sea ice during the last glaciation. Sea-ice cover retreated during the deglaciation approximately 15,000 years ago, culminating in seasonal sea-ice coverage in the warm early Holocene, before ice coverage increased into the late Holocene. Sea-ice changes closely correlate with biological nutrient consumption, supporting projections of a nutrient-starved central Arctic Ocean with continued sea-ice loss.",

Studies in murine models have identified that the anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG is dependent on sialylation of the N-linked glycan on the CH2 domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG), the type I IgG inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIB, and the type II Fc receptor dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN). We hypothesized that DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin, may directly interact with glycans on FcγRIIB, augmenting its ability to bind sialylated IgG. We found that Fc-engineering sialylated IgG1 to enhance its affinity for FcγRIIB resulted in a molecule that was more potent than IVIG in reducing the inflammatory sequelae of antibody or T cell–mediated autoimmune diseases, providing the basis for a class of potent anti-inflammatory therapeutics.",

Purine salvage represses DNPB to prevent excessive purine nucleotide synthesis through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We identified Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) as a DNPB regulator. During purine salvage, NUDT5 suppresses DNPB independently of its catalytic function but through interaction with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the DNPB pathway. The NUDT5-PPAT interaction promoted PPAT oligomerization, suppressed PPAT’s enzymatic activity, and facilitated disassembly of the purinosome, a metabolon that functions in DNPB. Disrupting the NUDT5-PPAT interaction overcame DNPB suppression during purine salvage, permitting excessive DNPB and inducing thiopurine resistance. Therefore, NUDT5 governs the balance between DNPB and salvage to maintain appropriate cellular purine nucleotide concentrations.",

By investigating chemical and genetic dependencies caused by mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1 (MTHFD1), we discovered a key role for Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) in regulating purine de novo synthesis. Genetic depletion and selective chemical degradation showed that a scaffolding role, rather than NUDT5 enzymatic activity, was causing this phenotype. NUDT5 interacted with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of purine de novo synthesis, to repress the pathway in response to increased purine abundance. Through this mechanism, loss of NUDT5 mediates resistance to purine analogs in cancer treatment and prevents adenosine toxicity in MTHFD1 deficiency.",

A key difficulty lies in discerning the different energy scales in this strongly interacting system, particularly the superconducting gap. Here, we report simultaneous tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. This approach allows us to identify two coexisting V-shaped tunneling gaps with different energy scales: a distinct low-energy superconducting gap that vanishes at the superconducting critical temperature and magnetic field, and a higher-energy pseudogap. The superconducting tunneling spectra display a linear gap-filling behavior with temperature and magnetic field and exhibit the Volovik effect, consistent with a nodal order parameter. Our work suggests an unconventional nature of the superconducting gap and establishes an experimental framework for multidimensional investigation of tunable quantum materials.",

In cereals, shortening dormancy provides rapid and even post-harvest germination, but increases the risk of weather-induced pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) with yearly harvest losses beyond 1 billion USD. Our understanding of how, why, when and where cereal dormancy diversification arose is fragmentary. Here, we show in the founder crop barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) that dormancy is primarily regulated through a mosaic of locus haplotypes comprising copy-number variation and inherent kinase activity of Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 ( MKK3 ). We provide evidence supporting the historical selection of specific MKK3 haplotypes that shape dormancy levels according to changing climatic pressures and outline a genetic framework for breeders to balance grain dormancy and PHS-avoidance.",

The structure revealed that mammalian seipin assembles into two distinct oligomeric forms: undecamers and dodecamers. Adig selectively bound to the dodecameric form and enhanced seipin assembly by bridging and stabilizing adjacent subunits. Functionally, this complex promoted lipid droplet development at both early and late stages. In transgenic mice, adipocyte-specific overexpression of Adig increased fat mass and enlarged lipid droplets, whereas Adig deletion disrupted triglyceride accumulation in brown adipose tissues.

From experimental and density functional theory calculations, we found that the coherent interfaces between face-centered-cubic and hexagonal-close-packing lattices with a negative excess energy were more stable than twin boundaries in supersaturated Ni(Mo) solution. The negative excess-energy interface can be produced at extremely high density in Ni(Mo) solution with average spacing as small as about 1 nanometer, which inhibits plastic deformation and elevates the strength close to the theoretical value of the alloys. The measured Young’s modulus of the Ni(Mo) alloys increases obviously with the interface density, reaching 254.5 gigapascals, well above that of the same compositional metallic glass and intermetallic compound (Ni 3 Mo).",

By contrast, inverse CISS involves the conversion of spin to a charge current. Using terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we directly measured an ultrafast charge current due to inverse CISS with picosecond time resolution. Polarity and polarization analysis of the THz emission map the induced charge current direction upon spin injection. We found that a charge current is generated along the spin orientation that changes direction with stereochemical configuration. These observations directly demonstrate the inherent coupling between spin and charge currents in chiral systems, offering key insights into their fundamental dynamics.",

Ctnnb1/Arid2 -driven cancers were much more likely to arise in zone 3. The zone 3 genes Gstm2 and Gstm3 were required for efficient HCC initiation, in part through inhibition of ferroptosis.

          "abstract": "Social networks are shaped by complex, intersecting identities that drive our connection preferences. These preferences create tie inequalities: Systematic differences in the number of links members of different groups accumulate. Understanding tie inequalities is critical because they contribute to disparities in social capital, with downstream consequences for access to opportunities and resources. Previous research has examined the impact of single-dimensional identities on tie disparities, but when multiple identities intersect, network disadvantages accumulate nonlinearly, disproportionately harming individuals belonging to several disadvantaged groups. However, how multidimensional connection preferences affect network dynamics and amplify or mitigate differences in ties remains unknown. Using a network model, we characterize the effects of multidimensional preferences and attribute correlation. We find that correlation creates counterintuitive tie inequalities unobservable in one-dimensional systems. We calibrate the model with high school friendship data and derive closed-form expressions for tie inequalities, which reproduce the empirical patterns with remarkable accuracy. Our findings have substantial implications for addressing intersectional inequalities in social networks.",

          "abstract": "Using original data from the Family Incarceration Costs Survey, we present national estimates of the direct financial costs of family member incarceration. We find that most Americans with an incarcerated family member provide them direct financial support. The median monthly direct expense among those who contribute is $172, which represents 6% of their household income. On average, Blacks and Hispanics incur higher direct expenses than whites despite their lower household incomes. Men and women contribute similar amounts, but these direct expenses reflect a larger share of women’s household income. Poor families’ direct expenses are comparable to those of affluent families and are similar to their spending on health care, utilities, and car-related costs. Together, these results suggest that familial incarceration is a prominent line item that strains marginalized families’ already-tight household budgets and is a substantial yet underappreciated mechanism through which mass incarceration has reshaped the texture of American poverty in recent decades.",

Lead-free double-perovskite semiconductors, such as Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , attract particular interest in this respect due to their structural phase transition and strong carrier-lattice coupling. Here, we reveal that the giant anisotropic photostriction in halide perovskites with tetragonal crystal structure provides an efficient nonthermal tool for generating coherent transverse phonons. Using time-domain Brillouin spectroscopy, we observe transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons with comparable amplitudes in the tetragonal phase of Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 below the temperature of 122 kelvins, while, in the cubic phase, only longitudinal phonons are generated. The polarization of the transverse phonons is dictated by the projection of the crystal c axis on the surface plane, which leads to a prominent anisotropic polarization response in the detection. The generated strain pulses correspond to soft transverse acoustic eigenmodes with a strong temperature dependence of dispersion, providing an additional degree of freedom for hypersonic manipulation.",

Direct monitoring of TUS responses is crucial for ensuring optimal outcomes. Blood-oxygenation-level–dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging has primarily been used for studying TUS effects in both human and nonhuman primate brains. However, the physiology and mechanisms underlying BOLD remain largely unknown due to its highly convoluted nature. To address these limitations, we developed a hybrid system for concurrent optoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging of TUS (OMRITUS) to comprehensively characterize the hemodynamic changes in murine brains. Our findings reveal paradoxical negative BOLD signals in the activated cortical regions, coupled with increased total hemoglobin levels simultaneously monitored with optoacoustic tomography. Multispectral optoacoustic readings further demonstrated a stronger increase in deoxygenated versus oxygenated hemoglobin, suggesting a potential molecular basis for the negative BOLD responses. OMRITUS enables the study of complex TUS-hemodynamic interactions, paving the way for precise neuromodulatory interventions.",

Here, we integrate satellite light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurements with machine learning to assess the Southern Ocean air-sea CO 2 fluxes between 2007 and 2020. We reveal that CO 2 outgassing south of 50°S was underestimated by up to 40% in previous studies. While the midlatitude Southern Ocean (30° to 50°S) strengthens as a carbon sink, the high-latitude region (50° to 90°S) shows Southern Annular Mode (SAM)–modulated alternation between uptake and outgassing. The air-sea CO 2 partial pressure difference (Δ p CO 2 ) increasingly dominates flux variability over wind-driven transfer velocity. We propose a framework involving three latitudinal loops with differing p CO 2 controls: (i) Antarctic (salinity/sea ice), (ii) polar front (atmospheric CO 2 /chlorophyll), and (iii) subpolar (sea surface temperature/CO 2 ). The findings underscore the winter processes’ critical role and necessitate year-round observations to understand Southern Ocean’s global carbon cycle impact.",

          "abstract": "The intrinsic trade-off between hardness and toughness presents a long-standing challenge for diamond-based materials, limiting their use in extreme environments. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy to overcome this limitation by engineering graphite precursors with mimosa-like microscale curvature. Under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions (15 gigapascals and 2300 kelvin), these precursors concentrate local stress, promoting nucleation of hexagonal diamond within a cubic diamond matrix and forming cubic-hexagonal heterostructures. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional hardness (169 gigapascals) and toughness (15.7 megapascals multiplied by square root of meter), representing 36 and 104% improvements over single-phase nanopolycrystalline diamond, respectively. This dual enhancement arises from stacking fault interlocking and semi/coherent boundaries that resist deformation, coupled with phase transformation and crack deflection that dissipate fracture energy. Our results demonstrate a microstructural design paradigm for mitigating the property trade-off in superhard materials and offer a scalable strategy for engineering robust diamond-based systems.",

Each Cldn establishes its respective TJ barrier, either autonomously or nonautonomously, exhibiting distinct ion conductivity and selectivity. Clustering algorithms revealed a previously unidentified classification of Cldns into four main classes with well-defined subclasses, moving beyond the conventional paracellular barrier–versus–channel-forming dichotomy. Our findings, including the in vivo Cldn dynamics, provide a framework for understanding TJ barrier diversity and plasticity, offering insights into organ-specific homeostasis and guiding therapeutic strategies targeting TJ barriers in health and disease.",

Multistep reasoning is enabled by our Agentic Iterative Monologue paradigm, which coherently interfaces agents with code-based tools, other specialized agents, and human designers. Design acceleration is facilitated by Feature-wise Linear Modulation–conditioned Maxwell surrogate solvers that support the generalized evaluation of metasurface structures. We use freeform dielectric metasurfaces as a model system and demonstrate with MetaChat the design of multiobjective, multiwavelength metasurfaces orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods.

We found that unintended edits, including short indels and SVs, were enriched in specific genomic and sequence contexts. We developed a predictive model, SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk Evaluation), which revealed 4.8% of the genome as SV prone, consisting of 562 SV hotspots. Donor repair-enhancing strategies suppressed SV formation in regions with moderate, but not high, predicted risk. Applying SCORE to the Sc2.0 synthetic yeast genome revealed a markedly altered SV landscape due to the removal of endogenous repetitive elements and the insertion of loxP sites.

However, functional organization of distinct BLA circuits and their contribution to stress-induced activation of the neuroendocrine response is unclear. We establish four major findings in adult male rats: (i) BLA projection neurons are necessary and sufficient for stress-induced neuroendocrine activation; (ii) projection populations have a heterogeneous spatial distribution across the BLA; (iii) diverse BLA populations targeting the prelimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral hippocampus are activated by acute stress, with the location of activated populations biased toward the medial basal amygdala; and (iv) inhibition of singular projections does not recapitulate global inhibition of BLA projection neurons. Together, this suggests that a network of BLA projection populations is broadly activated by acute stress and collectively contribute to neuroendocrine regulation.",

This study demonstrates a real-time Mandarin speech BCI that decodes monosyllabic units directly from neural signals. Using the 256-channel microelectrocorticographic BCI, we achieved robust decoding of a comprehensive set of 394 distinct syllables based purely on neural signals, yielding median syllable identification accuracy of 71.2% in a single-character reading task. Leveraging this high-performing syllable decoder, we further demonstrated real-time sentence decoding.

However, the atomic-level mechanism behind its efficiency remains unclear. The basal surfaces of AgI are polar and inherently unstable, necessitating a compensation mechanism, such as surface reconstruction, which may disrupt the favorable lattice match with ice. We combine noncontact atomic force microscopy with advanced computational modeling to determine the atomic structure of basal AgI surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum. The Ag-terminated (0001) surface exhibits a (2 × 2) reconstruction with ordered Ag vacancies, preserving a hexagonal arrangement of surface atoms that facilitates epitaxial ice growth. In contrast, the I-terminated (000 1 ¯ ) surface adopts a complex rectangular reconstruction, incompatible with continuous ice layer formation. These findings highlight the decisive role of surface atomic structure and indicate that the Ag-terminated basal plane is primarily responsible for efficient ice nucleation on AgI.",

By elucidating how cells sense and transduce mechanical cues, mechanobiology has fundamentally advanced our understanding of processes ranging from migration and differentiation to immune responses and tissue remodeling. These advances have driven the development of innovative biophysical tools and engineered biomaterials that enable precise modulation of the cellular microenvironment. Translating mechanobiological principles into clinical practice is giving rise to mechanomedicine, a previously unrecognized paradigm that integrates mechanical forces as key modulators of health and disease. This review highlights how mechanobiology informs therapeutic strategies across diverse domains, including cancer immunotherapy, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, and regenerative medicine. By bridging fundamental discoveries with translational applications, this review positions mechanobiology as a cornerstone of next-generation medical innovation, translating mechanistic insights into impactful clinical applications.",

To establish transcriptomic standards, we generated an integrated human fetal whole-brain atlas and a midbrain subatlas. Whole-brain analysis revealed strong region-specific signatures, underscoring the need for global mapping before refined midbrain annotation. We implemented this two-tier strategy, BrainSTEM (Brain Single-cell Two tiEr Mapping), to systematically reassess published single-cell datasets of human midbrain culture models. BrainSTEM confirmed the presence of bona fide midbrain cell types (“on-target”), but also revealed substantial populations aligning with nonmidbrain regions (“off-target”), inflating reported mDA yields across protocols. This unbiased framework enables rigorous evaluation of differentiation outcomes, clarifies current limitations of midbrain-directed models, and provides a foundation for refining protocols toward more faithful in vitro systems for PD research and regenerative applications.",

However, the “eraser” of α-TubK40me3 and the impact of α-TubK40me3 dynamic balance on cells are still unclear. Here, we report that KDM4A, a member of the histone demethylase family, binds α-tubulin through its catalytic core domain and demethylates α-tubulin. KDM4A knockout significantly enhances α-TubK40me3, inducing microtubule polymerization and mitotic defects. Furthermore, the overpolymerized microtubules and cell mitotic defects caused by KDM4A knockout are rescued by reducing α-TubK40me3 with overexpression of an α-tubulin mutant α-tubulin K40A or depolymerizing microtubules with nocodazole treatment in cells. Together, our study identifies KDM4A as an α-tubulin demethylase, and this demethylation is important for regulating microtubule polymerization and cell mitosis.",

ELT-induced excessive LTCC activity in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) RE neurons and its corresponding effects on persistent neuronal activation contribute to increasing susceptibility to aggression and self-harm. Activation of vGlut2 RE neurons projecting to ventral hippocampus (vCA1), but not medial prefrontal cortex, promotes these behaviors in control mice. Furthermore, we found that RE neurons modulate two distinct subsets of vCA1 neurons, with one projecting to the hypothalamus to drive aggression and another to the basal amygdala to mediate self-harm.

In particular, in the marine environment, dependency of ocean-going fish on specific coastal locations are rarely implemented in spatial planning. However, when essential nursery habitats are threatened, the resilience of fish populations is jeopardized. For technical reasons, former studies on Atlantic herring could not specify if fish, returning to spawning grounds, returned to sites of their own natal origin. Combining otolith microchemistry with genetics, we show that Atlantic herring perform natal homing with rates between 56 and 73%. The implicit number of strays adopted along migration maintain the gene flow between subpopulations, supporting the hypothesized “metapopulation” concept. With respect to increasing anthropogenic impacts, this study demonstrates the need for a goal-oriented coastal zone management to ensure productive ecosystems and a sustainable fishery in the future.",

Herein, we implanted an intracortical microelectrode array of 100 electrodes in the visual cortex of two blind volunteers. We recorded the neural activity around the electrodes while performing electrical stimulation to induce visual perceptions. Besides showing how stimulation parameters influence perceptual thresholds, perceived brightness, and the minimum interval required to distinguish separate stimuli, our results indicate that subjective visual experience can be accurately predicted from the recorded neural activity.

Constructing linear decoding models to translate brain activity induced by videos into semantic features of corresponding captions, we optimized candidate descriptions by aligning their features with brain-decoded features through word replacement and interpolation. This process yielded well-structured descriptions that accurately capture viewed content, even without relying on the canonical language network. The method also generalized to verbalize recalled content, functioning as an interpretive interface between mental representations and text and simultaneously demonstrating the potential for nonverbal thought–based brain-to-text communication, which could provide an alternative communication pathway for individuals with language expression difficulties, such as aphasia.",

In addition, we find that physiological levels of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) inhibit the DNA cleavage activity of the KELShedu system, suggesting that KELShedu’s activation depends on reduced intracellular NTP levels during phage invasion. Our research demonstrates that the KELShedu system responds to nucleotide depletion triggered by phage replication, leading to nonspecific degradation of cellular DNA and ultimately inducing abortive infection.

SA inhibited hypocotyl growth in a dose-dependent manner, with a more substantial effect in the Arabidopsis npr1 mutant, revealing NPR1’s role in maintaining growth under SA-accumulating conditions. In etiolated npr1 seedlings, auxin-responsive genes, including multiple SMALL AUXIN UP-REGULATED RNA ( SAUR ) and EXPANSIN genes, were down-regulated. Overexpression of SAUR19 or SAUR63 fully rescued SA-induced growth inhibition. We also identified EXECUTER1 (EX1), a mediator of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) signaling, as a contributor to this process.

          "abstract": "While seasonal snow cover extent (SCE), an essential climate variable, has broadly declined as a response to global warming, notable inconsistencies remain among long-term satellite-based estimates of SCE change during the Northern Hemisphere snow onset season. SCE datasets from a reanalysis-driven simple snow model serve as benchmarks and allow us to reconcile the trends from one prominent snow cover record with other recent studies. In particular, artificial increasing snow cover trends in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Snow Cover Extent Climate Data Record (CDR) during the onset season are related to changes in snow detection sensitivity. This artificial drift primarily affects September, October, and November snow cover but is detectible through February. Revised trends produced by merging the last decade’s CDR estimates with the offline model datasets reveal decreasing Northern Hemisphere trends in all months but January. This approach shows that offline snow models produce useful benchmarks that can expose biases in observational snow cover datasets with other cross-validation.",

          "abstract": "Ensemble forecasting is essential for quantifying forecast uncertainty and providing probabilistic weather predictions. However, the substantial computational demands of current global ensemble prediction systems based on conventional models limit ensemble sizes, hindering the representation of diverse weather scenarios. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have greatly reduced computational costs and improved deterministic forecasting. Nonetheless, applying ML to ensemble forecasting poses challenges in addressing uncertainties in initial conditions and models, which are the major sources of forecasting errors. To address these challenges, we introduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model that generates 6-hourly global ensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days ahead at a spatial resolution of 0.25°. Using a variational autoencoder framework, FuXi-ENS optimizes a loss function that combines the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) with the Kullback-Leibler divergence, enabling flow-dependent perturbations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms the ECMWF ensemble in key forecast metrics such as CRPS and Brier score.",

Although advances such as acoustic analogs of the Zel’dovich effect and the observation of negative resistance in low-frequency electromagnetic models have been reported, genuine positive signal gain, spontaneous emission of electromagnetic waves, and runaway amplification have not previously been verified. Here, we provide the first experimental demonstration that a mechanically rotating metallic cylinder acts as an amplifier of a rotating electromagnetic field mode. Moreover, when combined with a low-loss resonator, the system becomes unstable and operates as a generator seeded only by noise. The exponential runaway amplification of spontaneously generated electromagnetic modes is observed, establishing the electromagnetic analog of the Press-Teukolsky black hole bomb and paving the way to experimental tests of quantum friction from vacuum fluctuations.",

Peroxiredoxin 3 inactivation increases reactive oxygen species levels, induces cancer cell death in preclinical models, and shows promise in an ongoing clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma using direct pleural infusion. We report the identification of the minimal fragment of TS that contains tandem dehydro-alanine (DHA) moieties and maintains anticancer activity while losing interactions with three alternative targets of intact TS.

However, simultaneously achieving high efficiency and mechanical durability remains a challenge. A contributing factor is the interfacial inhomogeneity arising from molecular aggregation in planar carbazole-based hole-selective contacts (HSCs) on flexible substrates. Here, we develop a strategy of spatial steric hindrance that transforms planar carbazole core into a three-dimensional π-conjugated skeleton. This molecular reconfiguration suppresses intermolecular π-π stacking, yielding homogenized selective contacts and high-quality perovskite films. When integrated into flexible monolithic perovskite/CIGS tandem devices, this strategy enabled a champion stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.2% (certified 25.5%) for a 0.091–square centimeter device and 25.3% (certified 24.3%) for a centimeter-scale device, both representing high certified efficiencies reported to date for flexible two-terminal tandems. These devices demonstrated remarkable mechanical robustness, retaining their initial PCE after 10,000 bending cycles at a 10-millimeter radius, highlighting the potential of molecular-level interfacial engineering to realize high-efficiency, stable, and scalable flexible photovoltaics.",

However, it remains unclear how current policy is evaluated to explore more advantageous alternatives. Here, we show that during policy-based sequential actions in a rat reversal task, the dorsomedial striatum plays an essential role in pathway-specific manner. Recording and optical manipulation of the indirect pathway showed that late-onset activity following unrewarded suboptimal action represents a lowered valuation of the current action policy and a heightened bias to try the suboptimal action. The early-onset activity complementarily mediated policy-based suppression of unrewarded action. These results demonstrate the indirect pathway’s role in monitoring unreliability of current action policy and probing alternative one. This study extends conventional understanding of consequence-guided persistence with reward-oriented action policy and provides key insights regarding how the dorsomedial striatum enables proactive and flexible adaptation to environmental changes.",

The patch offered high penetration and antibacterial activity, while its ROS-sensitive core released EM/Man NPs to scavenge ROS, restore adenosine 5′-triphosphate production, and reestablish redox balance. The NPs further activated the adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase/Sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α axis to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, repolarizing macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. In diabetic mice, EM/Man MNs accelerated healing via bacterial clearance, immune reprogramming, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition while inhibiting scar formation through interleukin-17 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt suppression.

Our computational screening reveals both established and less-explored promising materials, including hafnium disulfide (HfS 2 ), which exhibits an in-plane refractive index above 3 and large anisotropy in the visible range. We confirm these properties through ellipsometry and develop a nanofabrication process for HfS 2 , demonstrating Mie-resonant nanodisks.

The structure reveals a PSI monomer core with eight subunits and 13 asymmetrically arranged LHCI proteins. Euglena LHCIs bind diadinoxanthin, which is one of the carotenoids typically associated with red-lineage LHCs and is not present in the canonical LHCI belt found in green-lineage PSI-LHCI structures. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Euglena LHCIs originated from LHCII-related clades rather than from the green-lineage LHCI group and that the nuclear-encoded PSI subunit PsaD likely originated from cyanobacteria via horizontal gene transfer. These observations indicate a mosaic origin of the Euglena PSI-LHCI. Our findings uncover a noncanonical light-harvesting architecture and highlight the structural and evolutionary plasticity of photosynthetic systems, illustrating how endosymbiotic acquisition and lineage-specific adaptation shape divergent light-harvesting strategies.",

However, the quantity of xenon in the ancient atmosphere remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed noble gases in Archean hydrothermal quartz fluid inclusions and show that a modern atmospheric 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratio was almost reached 2.7 Ga ago, implying intense mantle degassing during the first 1.7 billion years of Earth’s history, three orders of magnitude higher than today.

The builders constructed canals, measuring up to 35 meters wide and 5 meters deep, and a dam to supply them with lake water.

Here, we report measurements of the energy spectra in turbulent TC flow from unique “flying-wire” experiments where a rotating probe sweeps through the flow. In contrast with previous studies, which focused primarily on spectral power laws, we analyze spectral data collapse.

Diversity in reef-supporting regions is on average two- to threefold higher than in non–reef-supporting regions and has been remarkably stable over timescales of tens to hundreds of millions of years. This signal is present in both reefal and non-reefal facies within reef-supporting regions, suggesting that reefs enriched diversity in surrounding environments. Sepkoski’s “Modern Fauna,” an assemblage of higher taxa that includes gastropods, bivalves, and echinoids, has been a key component of reef-supporting regions since the Paleozoic, contrasting with its later rise to dominance in non–reef-supporting regions during the later Mesozoic-Cenozoic.",

Endorheic basins form where uplift on faults exceeds incision. A decrease in shortening after ~10 Ma allows rivers to compete with uplift and incise into endorheic basins at the plateau edge. Two modeled basin capture events at ~7 to 5 Ma and ~3.5 to 0.5 Ma, coupled with climate-driven discharge fluctuations, markedly increase rivers’ discharge, erosion, and sediment transport, facilitating canyon incision and highlighting the importance of basin captures in canyon formation along the northeastern edge of the Andean Plateau.",

Using presynaptic optical recordings of synaptic vesicle fusion, calcium influx in D1-MSN synapses together with postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings from SNr neurons, we found that DA inhibits D1-MSN GABA release in a frequency-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this effect was independent of DA receptors and instead required 5-HT1B receptor activation. Using two-photon serotonin biosensor imaging in slices and fiber photometry in vivo, we demonstrate that DA enhances extracellular serotonin in the SNr via inhibition of serotonin reuptake.

We find that at physiological loading rates, vinculin domains unfold at forces of 5 to 15 pN and refold rapidly when forces drop to 1 pN. This behavior is reminiscent of force-dependent switches in talin and α-catenin, suggesting vinculin domains also function as molecular switches. Unfolding induces large extension changes up to 150 nm in steps of 20 to 30 nm. These findings reveal that vinculin exhibits a previously unrecognized mechanical response, with dynamic folding/unfolding under force acting as a buffering mechanism. Given its role as a scaffold for many proteins, this mechanosensitive behavior supports a model where vinculin functions directly as a mechanotransducer, recruiting binding partners in a force-dependent manner.",

          "abstract": "Existing oral drug delivery modalities often fall short in medical emergencies due to the absence of readily deployable, internalized drug storage and delivery mechanisms that combine long-term standby with rapid activation. To address this challenge, we develop and validate a gastric retentive robotic capsule capable of autonomously prepositioning multiple drug doses within the stomach upon oral administration. This system maintains quiescence for extended periods while enabling on-demand, remote-triggered drug release within seconds during emergencies. In a canine (beagle) model, we demonstrate safe gastric residence and functionality for at least 10 weeks, including closed-loop emergency drug delivery modulated by external or onboard biometric sensors for unsupervised symptom detection. At the end of its service life, the capsule can be safely excreted on-demand through the administration of an alkaline solution. These findings establish such a system as a paradigm for emergency-prepared and responsive drug delivery, particularly in vulnerable patient populations.",

          "abstract": "Magnons, the quanta of spin waves, are magnetic excitations of matter spanning through the entire crystal’s Brillouin zone and covering a wide range of frequencies ranging from subgigahertz to terahertz. Magnons play a crucial role in many phenomena, such as the reduction of saturation magnetization with increasing temperature or the Bose-Einstein condensation. However, established experimental techniques cannot resolve magnons with wave vectors between 30 and 300 rad μm −1 . We address this gap by tailoring the Brillouin light scattering process with dielectric periodic nanostripes hosting Mie resonances. This approach enables access to the previously unmeasurable wave vector range while providing at the same time full wave vector resolution, all within a tabletop setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons as well as applications in computational and microwave devices. In addition, the same methodology can be applied to other excitations of matter, such as phonons, opening up possibilities in, e.g., mechanobiological studies.",

          "abstract": "Strain engineering, enabling the precise control over structure and functional properties, is a key strategy for the design of advanced materials. However, the mechanisms governing strain evolution and release at the nanoscale remain largely unexplored. In this study, we leverage in situ heating transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy to investigate the strain relaxation pathways of boehmite (γ-AlOOH) at 575 kelvin by revealing real-time structural dynamics. Through tracking the moiré pattern evolution, we identify distinct strain release mechanisms, including layer twisting, defect formation, and domain restructuring. Our neural network potential calculations reveal that energy fluctuations at small twist angles are dominated by an interference-like interaction modulation of hydrogen bonds between boehmite interlayers, with metastable twisted structures corresponding to local minima of the potential energy landscape. This work establishes a previously unidentified paradigm of two-dimensional layer twisting mediated by hydrogen bonding, offering insights into strain-driven transformation mechanisms, and thus may have broad implications for strain in material and earth sciences.",

          "abstract": "Tardigrades survive extreme environments partly through the damage suppressor (Dsup) protein, which protects DNA from ionizing radiation and oxidative stress. Dsup is largely unstructured but binds nucleosomes to shield DNA from damage. To investigate its protective role in a whole organism, we expressed the Ramazzottius varieornatus Dsup gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . Transgenic worms tolerated x-ray exposure and oxidative stress without apparent toxicity and exhibited a notable extension of life span. This effect was independent of the canonical DAF-2/DAF-16 longevity pathway and mitochondrial dynamics. Instead, Dsup expression markedly reduced mitochondrial respiration, providing a plausible mechanism for enhanced oxidative stress resistance and extended longevity. Our findings demonstrate that Dsup can confer stress resistance and longevity benefits across species, highlighting a unique protective strategy with potential implications for understanding aging and developing stress-resilient organisms.",

Most of these types are established early in embryogenesis and persist into adulthood. In indirectly developing sea urchins, however, the continuity between embryonic and adult stages is interrupted by a planktonic larval stage that undergoes complete metamorphosis. While gene regulatory networks controlling embryonic and larval lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of postmetamorphic cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell atlas of postmetamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, revealing conservation of regulatory mechanisms. We identified signatures of eight distinct cell type groups and analyzed 29 neuronal families, including 15 unique photoreceptor types. By combining transcriptomics, spatial analysis, and ultrastructure, we identified vertebrate neuronal and opsin homologs expressed across the juvenile. These findings show that the echinoderm body plan is predominantly head-like and exhibits an “all-brain” organization.",

While mammalian immunoglobulin M (IgM) typically forms a pentamer linked by the joining chain (J-chain), Xenopus laevis IgX can assemble into a J-chain–independent polymer. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of IgX, revealing its hexameric configuration. By incorporating the IgX tailpiece into human IgM, we achieved efficient IgM hexamer formation. Truncating IgM’s natural tailpiece to a range of 11 to 16 residues also substantially enhanced hexamerization efficiency. Furthermore, introducing a shortened IgM tailpiece to IgG resulted in effective IgG hexamer formation. We further show that the engineered IgM and IgG hexamers targeting CD20 demonstrated robust complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against several B lymphoma cells. In addition, the IgG-Fc hexamer functioned as a decoy, attenuating CDC in cell cultures. These findings deepen our understanding of polymeric immunoglobulin evolution and introduce innovative strategies for the development of IgM- and IgG-based biologics.",

          "abstract": "Offshore wind farms may induce changes in the upper ocean and near-surface atmosphere through coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Yet, the role of air-sea interactions mediated by offshore wind farms remains poorly understood. Using fully coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave model simulations for seasonally stratified conditions along the US East Coast, we show that simulated cumulative reductions in wind stress due to large-scale wind farm clusters lead to sea surface warming of 0.3° to 0.4°C and a shallower mixed layer. This warming drives upward heat fluxes, destabilizing the atmospheric boundary layer and enhancing wind stress, which partially offsets wake-induced wind deficits. These wake-ocean interactions influence near-surface meteorology and air-sea fluxes, suggesting that a coupled modeling approach may be necessary for assessing potential oceanographic impacts of offshore wind developments. However, ocean coupling exerts limited influence on winds at turbine-relevant heights or within downstream wakes, resulting in minimal impact on long-term energy. These findings suggest that models without ocean coupling may be adequate for wind energy applications.",

          "abstract": "The development of regioselective methods for C(sp 3 )─Br bond formation in unactivated alkenes remains a fundamental challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a nickel hydride–catalyzed method that enables regiocontrolled hydrobromination of both terminal and internal alkenes through strategic deployment of an N -fluoropyridinium oxidant. The method features two complementary approaches: direct hydrobromination of alkenes with high proximal selectivity and a chain-walking strategy that enables switchable site-selective functionalization in extended alkyl chains. Notably, temperature-controlled reaction parameters enable regiodivergent access to β- or γ-brominated products from identical alkenes with excellent selectivity. The protocol demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and enables late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium labeling, radical clock experiments, and density functional theory calculations, revealed a radical-mediated pathway featuring temperature-dependent regioselectivity in the chain-walking process. This unified method provides a versatile platform to access diverse alkyl bromides and offers fundamental insights into selective C─Br bond construction through direct and chain-walking pathways.",
