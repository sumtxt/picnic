Challenges include sufficient cardiomyocyte retention for a sustainable therapeutic impact without intolerable side effects, such as arrhythmia and tumour growth. We investigated the hypothesis that epicardial engineered heart muscle (EHM) allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells structurally and functionally remuscularize the chronically failing heart without limiting side effects in rhesus macaques. After confirmation of in vitro and in vivo (nude rat model) equivalence of the newly developed rhesus macaque EHM model with a previously established Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible human EHM formulation 8 , long-term retention (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the target heart wall by EHM grafts constructed from 40 to 200 million cardiomyocytes/stromal cells were demonstrated in macaques with and without myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In the heart failure model, evidence for EHM allograft-enhanced target heart wall contractility and ejection fraction, which are measures for local and global heart support, was obtained. Histopathological and gadolinium-based perfusion magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and functional vascularization. Arrhythmia and tumour growth were not observed. The obtained feasibility, safety and efficacy data provided the pivotal underpinnings for the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial on tissue-engineered heart repair. Our clinical data confirmed remuscularization by EHM implantation in a patient with advanced heart failure.",

          "abstract": "The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) 1 is the largest cause of uncertainty in long-term sea-level projections. In the last interglacial (LIG) around 125,000 years ago, data suggest that sea level was several metres higher than today 2–4 , and required a significant contribution from Antarctic ice loss, with WAIS usually implicated. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were warmer than today 5–8 , by amounts comparable to those expected by 2100 under moderate to high future warming scenarios. However, direct evidence about the size of WAIS in the LIG is sparse. Here we use sea salt data from an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise, adjacent to WAIS, to show that, during most of the LIG, the Ronne Ice Shelf was still in place, and close to its current extent. Water isotope data are consistent with a retreat of WAIS 9 , but seem inconsistent with more dramatic model realizations 10 in which both WAIS and the large Antarctic ice shelves were lost. This new constraint calls for a reappraisal of other elements of the LIG sea-level budget. It also weakens the observational basis that motivated model simulations projecting the highest end of projections for future rates of sea-level rise to 2300 and beyond.",

          "abstract": "The Casarabe culture (500–1400 ce ), spreading over roughly 4,500 km 2 of the monumental mounds region of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia, is one of the clearest examples of urbanism in pre-Columbian (pre-1492 ce ) Amazonia. It exhibits a four-tier hierarchical settlement pattern, with hundreds of monumental mounds interconnected by canals and causeways 1,2 . Despite archaeological evidence indicating that maize was cultivated by this society 3 , it is unknown whether it was the staple crop and which type of agricultural farming system was used to support this urban-scale society. Here, we address this issue by integration of remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses, which shows that the Casarabe culture invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals (to drain excess water during the rainy season) and newly documented savannah farm ponds (to retain water in the dry season). Phytolith analyses of 178 samples from 18 soil profiles in drained fields, farm ponds and forested settings record the singular and ubiquitous presence of maize ( Zea mays ) in pre-Columbian fields and farm ponds, and an absence of evidence for agricultural practices in the forest. Collectively, our findings show how the Casarabe culture managed the savannah landscape for intensive year-round maize monoculture that probably sustained its relatively large population. Our results have implications for how we conceive agricultural systems in Amazonia, and show an example of a Neolithic-like, grain-based agrarian economy in the Amazon.",

          "abstract": "Since the onset of the pandemic, many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, exhibiting substantial evolution in the virus’ spike protein 1 , the main target of neutralizing antibodies 2 . A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to infect an immunologically experienced population 1,3 . Because viral infection induces neutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune landscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data 4,5 , antibody pharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-specific relative number of susceptible individuals over time. We show that this quantity precisely matched historical variant dynamics, predicted future variant dynamics and explained global differences in variant dynamics. Our work strongly suggests that the ongoing pandemic continues to shape variant-specific population immunity, which determines a variant’s ability to transmit, thus defining variant fitness. The model can be applied to any region by utilizing local genomic surveillance data, allows contextualizing risk assessment of variants and provides information for vaccine design.",

          "abstract": "During normal cellular homeostasis, unfolded and mislocalized proteins are recognized and removed, preventing the build-up of toxic byproducts 1 . When protein homeostasis is perturbed during ageing, neurodegeneration or cellular stress, proteins can accumulate several forms of chemical damage through reactive metabolites 2,3 . Such modifications have been proposed to trigger the selective removal of chemically marked proteins 3–6 ; however, identifying modifications that are sufficient to induce protein degradation has remained challenging. Here, using a semi-synthetic chemical biology approach coupled to cellular assays, we found that C-terminal amide-bearing proteins (CTAPs) are rapidly cleared from human cells. A CRISPR screen identified FBXO31 as a reader of C-terminal amides. FBXO31 is a substrate receptor for the SKP1–CUL1–F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXO31, which ubiquitylates CTAPs for subsequent proteasomal degradation. A conserved binding pocket enables FBXO31 to bind to almost any C-terminal peptide bearing an amide while retaining exquisite selectivity over non-modified clients. This mechanism facilitates binding and turnover of endogenous CTAPs that are formed after oxidative stress. A dominant human mutation found in neurodevelopmental disorders reverses CTAP recognition, such that non-amidated neosubstrates are now degraded and FBXO31 becomes markedly toxic. We propose that CTAPs may represent the vanguard of a largely unexplored class of modified amino acid degrons that could provide a general strategy for selective yet broad surveillance of chemically damaged proteins.",

          "abstract": "Mitigating loss of genetic diversity is a major global biodiversity challenge 1–4 . To meet recent international commitments to maintain genetic diversity within species 5,6 , we need to understand relationships between threats, conservation management and genetic diversity change. Here we conduct a global analysis of genetic diversity change via meta-analysis of all available temporal measures of genetic diversity from more than three decades of research. We show that within-population genetic diversity is being lost over timescales likely to have been impacted by human activities, and that some conservation actions may mitigate this loss. Our dataset includes 628 species (animals, plants, fungi and chromists) across all terrestrial and most marine realms on Earth. Threats impacted two-thirds of the populations that we analysed, and less than half of the populations analysed received conservation management. Genetic diversity loss occurs globally and is a realistic prediction for many species, especially birds and mammals, in the face of threats such as land use change, disease, abiotic natural phenomena and harvesting or harassment. Conservation strategies designed to improve environmental conditions, increase population growth rates and introduce new individuals (for example, restoring connectivity or performing translocations) may maintain or even increase genetic diversity. Our findings underscore the urgent need for active, genetically informed conservation interventions to halt genetic diversity loss.",

          "abstract": "Evaporation or freezing of water-rich fluids with dilute concentrations of dissolved salts can produce brines, as observed in closed basins on Earth 1 and detected by remote sensing on icy bodies in the outer Solar System 2,3 . The mineralogical evolution of these brines is well understood in regard to terrestrial environments 4 , but poorly constrained for extraterrestrial systems owing to a lack of direct sampling. Here we report the occurrence of salt minerals in samples of the asteroid (101955) Bennu returned by the OSIRIS-REx mission 5 . These include sodium-bearing phosphates and sodium-rich carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and fluorides formed during evaporation of a late-stage brine that existed early in the history of Bennu’s parent body. Discovery of diverse salts would not be possible without mission sample return and careful curation and storage, because these decompose with prolonged exposure to Earth’s atmosphere. Similar brines probably still occur in the interior of icy bodies Ceres and Enceladus, as indicated by spectra or measurement of sodium carbonate on the surface or in plumes 2,3 .",

          "abstract": "Understanding whether risk preference represents a stable, coherent trait is central to efforts aimed at explaining, predicting and preventing risk-related behaviours. We help characterize the nature of the construct by adopting a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analytic approach to summarize the temporal stability of 358 risk preference measures (33 panels, 57 samples, 579,114 respondents). Our findings reveal noteworthy heterogeneity across and within measure categories (propensity, frequency and behaviour), domains (for example, investment, occupational and alcohol consumption) and sample characteristics (for example, age). Specifically, while self-reported propensity and frequency measures of risk preference show a higher degree of stability than behavioural measures, these patterns are moderated by domain and age. Crucially, an analysis of convergent validity reveals a low agreement across measures, questioning the idea that they capture the same underlying phenomena. Our results raise concerns about the coherence and measurement of the risk preference construct.",

We identified 162 genomic loci associated with a common genetic factor underlying various income measures, all with small effect sizes (the Income Factor). Our polygenic index captures 1–5% of income variance, with only one fourth due to direct genetic effects. A phenome-wide association study using this index showed reduced risks for diseases including hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression, asthma and back pain. The Income Factor had a substantial genetic correlation (0.92, s.e. = 0.006) with educational attainment. Accounting for the genetic overlap of educational attainment with income revealed that the remaining genetic signal was linked to better mental health but reduced physical health and increased risky behaviours such as drinking and smoking. These findings highlight the complex genetic influences on income and health.",

          "abstract": "The urgent calls for action on climate change underscore the importance of increasing sustainable behavior among individuals who have traditionally veered away from it, such as those on the political right. Utilizing data from four geopolitical regions across 24 countries, we explore whether vulnerability to natural disasters, brought on by either experiencing or anticipating a natural disaster, is a crucial factor. We find that as vulnerability to natural disasters increases, sustainable consumption intentions significantly increase among rightists in Western Europe, Israel, and the United States. Environmental motives, rather than economic or trend motives, are found to drive this effect. This suggests that, for rightists, the expectation of being directly impacted by climate change can override their established attitudes and foster more sustainable behavior with the goal of helping the environment. In contrast, the same increase in sustainable consumption intentions is weaker among leftists, who already embrace sustainable behavior. Interestingly, in Central and Eastern Europe, this interplay between political ideology and vulnerability to natural disasters is absent, highlighting the unique postcommunist context of this region. These findings underscore the necessity of tailored strategies for promoting sustainable behavior across regional contexts and provide vital insight into how sustainable consumption may increase among groups that have traditionally resisted it. In a quasiexperiment, we test the potential of an intervention using messages that highlight recent natural disasters in one’s locality and demonstrate its effectiveness in pushing rightists toward sustainable consumption.",

While both goals can encourage research with significant depth and scope, the latter can also pressure scholars to maximize publication metrics. Commercial publishing companies have capitalized on the centrality of publishing to the scientific enterprises of knowledge dissemination and academic recognition to extract large profits from academia by leveraging unpaid services from reviewers, creating financial barriers to research dissemination, and imposing substantial fees for open access. We present a set of perspectives exploring alternative models for communicating and disseminating scientific research. Acknowledging that the success of new publishing models depends on their impact on existing approaches for assigning academic credit that often prioritize prestigious publications and metrics such as citations and impact factors, we also provide various viewpoints on reforming academic evaluation.",

          "abstract": "In mixed-gender couples, men are older than women on average. Scholars and laypeople presume that this arrangement reflects mirrored preferences such that men desire younger partners and women desire older partners. Nevertheless, relevant published data on in-person romantic evaluations—that is, studies where adults interact in person and report their initial attraction to each other—are nearly nonexistent. We examined the association of a partner’s age with romantic desire ( N = 9,084 dyadic reports) among N = 6,262 blind daters who used a matchmaking service in hopes of finding a long-term partner. Preregistered tests revealed that people were (slightly) attracted to younger partners on average—and this association did not differ by gender. Conclusions were identical if we examined a) age difference from one’s own age, and b) a dataset limited to women 40-and-under and mixed-gender dates. Furthermore, participant’s self-reported “upper-age limits” played no meaningful role: Participants had a modest preference for youth overall, but it did not matter whether the partner’s age fell below or above this personal maximum. We discuss the implications of the nonexistent initial-attraction gender difference for the age difference in mixed-gender couples.",

          "authors": "Orly Bareket, Susan T. Fiske",
          "abstract": "Traditional gendered arrangements—norms, roles, prejudices, and hierarchies—shape every human life. Associated harms are primarily framed as women’s issues due to more severe consequences women face. Yet, gendered arrangements also shape men ’s relationships, career paths, and health. Current work on gender equity overlooks men’s perspectives. Despite benefits they gain from out-ranking women, men’s position paradoxically entraps them in restrictive roles, compelling them to prioritize dominance. An inclusive framework challenges prevailing narratives by considering personal costs borne by men. Identifying with a man’s traditional role is a mixed privilege, as five gendered arrangements show for men who subscribe to them: 1. Masculine norms can restrict men’s choices and are associated with adverse health trajectories; 2. Some men’s disengagement from communal roles denies them positive outcomes associated with caring for others; 3. Hostile sexism fosters antipathy, fueling tension in some men’s interactions with women; 4. Benevolent sexism forces some men into scripted interactions, preventing genuine connections and burdening them with unrealistic breadwinner and protector roles; 5. Societal shifts in gender hierarchies can elicit threat responses in men, depending on intersections with social class and racial identities. Understanding costs to men calls for more empirical research. Gender equity for men, whose circumstances differ from those of women, would enable men to make informed choices and achieve better outcomes for themselves—paralleling the progress women have made in many areas of life. Striving for equity for all genders can ultimately enhance overall human well-being.",

          "abstract": "Funding of curiosity-driven science is the lifeblood of scientific and technological innovation. Various models of funding allocation became institutionalized in the 20th century, shaping the present landscape of research funding. There are numerous reasons for scientists to be dissatisfied with current funding schemes, including the imbalance between funding for curiosity-driven and mission-directed research, regional and country disparities, path-dependency of who gets funded, gender and race disparities, low inter-reviewer reliability, and the trade-off between the effort and time spent on writing or reviewing proposals and doing research. We discuss possible alternative models for dealing with these issues. These alternatives include incremental changes such as placing more weight on the proposals or on the investigators and representative composition of panel members, along with deeper reforms such as distributed or concentrated funding and partial lotteries in response to low inter-reviewer reliability. We also consider radical alternatives to current funding schemes: the removal of political governance and the introduction of international competitive applications to a World Research Council alongside national funding sources. There is likely no single best way to fund curiosity-driven research; we examine arguments for and against the possibility of systematically evaluating alternative models empirically.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly incorporated into scientific workflows. However, we have yet to fully grasp the implications of this integration. How should the advancement of large language models affect the practice of science? For this opinion piece, we have invited four diverse groups of scientists to reflect on this query, sharing their perspectives and engaging in debate. Schulz et al. make the argument that working with LLMs is not fundamentally different from working with human collaborators, while Bender et al. argue that LLMs are often misused and overhyped, and that their limitations warrant a focus on more specialized, easily interpretable tools. Marelli et al. emphasize the importance of transparent attribution and responsible use of LLMs. Finally, Botvinick and Gershman advocate that humans should retain responsibility for determining the scientific roadmap. To facilitate the discussion, the four perspectives are complemented with a response from each group. By putting these different perspectives in conversation, we aim to bring attention to important considerations within the academic community regarding the adoption of LLMs and their impact on both current and future scientific practices.",

          "abstract": "Life is invasive, occupying all physically accessible scales, stretching between almost nothing (protons, electrons, and photons) and almost everything (the whole biosphere). Motivated by seventeenth-century insights into this infinity, this paper proposes a language to discuss life as an infinite double cascade of machines making machines. Using this simplified language, we first discuss the micro-cascade proposed by Leibniz, which describes how the self-reproducing machine of the cell is built of smaller submachines down to the atomic scale. In the other direction, we propose that a macro-cascade builds from cells larger, organizational machines, up to the scale of the biosphere. The two cascades meet at the critical point of 10 3 s in time and 1 micron in length, the scales of a microbial cell. We speculate on how this double cascade evolved once a self-replicating machine emerged in the salty water of prebiotic earth.",

          "authors": "Shuting Yan, Tamar Schlick",
          "abstract": "Frameshifting is an essential mechanism employed by many viruses including coronaviruses to produce viral proteins from a compact RNA genome. It is facilitated by specific RNA folds in the frameshift element (FSE), which has emerged as an important therapeutic target. For SARS-CoV-2, a specific 3-stem pseudoknot has been identified to stimulate frameshifting. However, prior studies and our RNA-As-Graphs analysis coupled to chemical reactivity experiments revealed other folds, including a different pseudoknot. Although structural plasticity has been proposed to play a key role in frameshifting, paths between different FSE RNA folds have not been yet identified. Here, we capture atomic-level transition pathways between two key FSE pseudoknots by transition path sampling coupled to Markov State Modeling and our BOLAS free energy method. We reveal multiple transition paths within a heterogeneous, multihub conformational landscape. A shared folding mechanism involves RNA stem unpairing followed by a 5 ′ -chain end release. Significantly, this pseudoknot transition critically tunes the tension through the RNA spacer region and places the viral RNA in the narrow ribosomal channel. Our work further explains the role of the alternative pseudoknot in ribosomal pausing and clarifies why the experimentally captured pseudoknot is preferred for frameshifting. Our capturing of this large-scale transition of RNA secondary and tertiary structure highlights the complex pathways of biomolecules and the inherent multifarious aspects that viruses developed to ensure virulence and survival. This enhanced understanding of viral frameshifting also provides insights to target key transitions for therapeutic applications. Our methods are generally applicable to other large-scale biomolecular transitions.",

          "abstract": "The sense of hearing originates in the cochlea, which detects sounds across dynamic sensory environments. Like other peripheral organs, the cochlea is subjected to environmental insults, including loud, damage-inducing sounds. In response to internal and external stimuli, the central nervous system directly modulates cochlear function through olivocochlear neurons (OCNs), which are located in the brainstem and innervate the cochlear sensory epithelium. One population of OCNs, the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons, target spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the primary sensory neurons of the ear. LOCs alter their transmitter expression for days to weeks in response to noise exposure (NE), suggesting that they could tune SGN excitability over long time periods in response to auditory experience. To examine how LOCs affect auditory function after NE, we characterized OCN transcriptional profiles and found transient LOC-specific gene expression changes after NE, including upregulation of multiple neuropeptide-encoding genes. Next, by generating intersectional mouse lines that selectively target LOCs, we chemogenetically ablated LOCs and assayed auditory responses at baseline and after NE. Compared to controls, mice with reduced LOC innervation showed greater NE-induced functional deficits 1 d later and had worse auditory function after a 2-wk recovery period. The number of remaining presynaptic puncta at the SGN synapse with inner hair cells did not differ between control and LOC-ablated animals, suggesting that the primary role of LOCs after NE is likely not to protect but instead to compensate, ensuring that SGN function is enhanced during periods of need.",

Diverse HGs preserve in the sediment and have been widely used as evidence of past nitrogen fixation, and structural variation has been suggested to preserve taxonomic information and reflect paleoenvironmental conditions. Here, by comprehensive HG identification and screening of HG biosynthetic gene clusters throughout cyanobacteria, we reconstruct the convergent evolutionary history of HG structure, in which different clades produce the same HGs. We find that rudimentary HG biosynthetic machinery was already present in cyanobacteria before the emergence of heterocytes for functions unrelated to nitrogen fixation and identify HG analogs produced by specific and distantly related nonheterocytous cyanobacteria. These structurally less complex molecules represent precursors of HGs, suggesting that HGs arose after a genomic reorganization and expansion of ancestral biosynthetic machinery, enabling the rise of cyanobacterial heterocytes in an increasingly oxygenated atmosphere. Our results open a chapter in the potential use of diagenetic products of HGs and HG analogs as fossils for reconstructing the evolution of multicellularity and division of labor in cyanobacteria.",

          "abstract": "Wildlife populations are not static. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect individuals, which lead to spatiotemporal variation in population density and range. Yet, dynamics in density and their drivers are rarely documented, due in part to the inherent difficulty of studying long-term population-level phenomena at ecologically meaningful scales. We studied the spatiotemporal density dynamics in a recolonizing large carnivore population, the wolverine Gulo gulo , across the Scandinavian Peninsula over nine years. We fitted open-population spatial capture-recapture models to noninvasive genetic sampling data collected across Norway and Sweden to estimate annual density surfaces and their drivers. This approach allowed us to model sex-specific changes in wolverine density and the effect of landscape-level environmental determinants over time. Our results revealed that, as wolverines successfully recolonized many parts of their historical range in Scandinavia, the relationship with spatial determinants of density has changed over time. We also found support for sex-specific responses of the Scandinavian wolverine to the environmental determinants of density and differences in the temporal dynamics of their relationships, indicating disproportionate recolonization ability and anthropogenic pressures. We observed significant changes in the relationship of female wolverine density with several determinants during the study period, suggesting still ongoing expansion of female wolverines whereas males might have already reached the range limits. These findings show that the Scandinavian wolverine population is still recovering from centuries of persecution and severe range contraction. Our study sheds light on the dynamics and challenges of recolonizing large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes across time and space.",

          "abstract": "The rise and spread of ancient Indian Ocean Rim (IOR) trade networks profoundly impacted southern Africa. Control over this trade played a critical role in the rise and maintenance of complex societies of the second millennium CE such as Mapungubwe and Great Zimbabwe. While the African origins of this trade lie in the first millennium CE, understanding its earliest phases and subsequent development in the far south has been hampered by a general paucity of research. The recovery of Persian Gulf ceramic sherds and Asian glass beads from the Letaba region of northeastern South Africa demonstrates that communities up to 400 km inland were already part of IOR trade by the 10th century. Although glass beads have been found at several late first millennium CE sites throughout the region, glazed wares are much rarer by comparison. In southern Africa, archaeological sites with Persian Gulf ceramics largely date to between the 9th and 10th centuries with a distribution limited to the Limpopo River’s main tributaries. This distribution poses new questions about early IOR trade routes into the southern African interior and suggests Xai-Xai in southern Mozambique as a possible entry point for early IOR trade.",

In this paper, we reexamine the parsimony principle in light of these scientific and technological advancements. We review recent developments, including the surprising benefits of modeling with more parameters than data, the increasing appreciation of the context-sensitivity of data and misspecification of scientific models, and the development of new modeling tools. By integrating these insights, we reassess the utility of parsimony as a proxy for desirable model traits, such as predictive accuracy, interpretability, effectiveness in guiding new research, and resource efficiency. We conclude that more complex models are sometimes essential for scientific progress, and discuss the ways in which parsimony and complexity can play complementary roles in scientific modeling practice.",

          "abstract": "The ε4 variant of human apolipoprotein E ( APOE4 ) is a key genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and elevated all-cause mortality in humans. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that can mitigate the harmful effects of APOE4 has significant implications. In this study, we find that inactivating the VHL-1 (Von Hippel–Lindau) protein can suppress mortality, neural and behavioral pathologies caused by transgenic human APOE4 in Caenorhabditis elegans . The protective effects of VHL-1 deletion are recapitulated by stabilized HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor), a transcription factor degraded by VHL-1. HIF-1 activates a genetic program that safeguards against mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteostasis imbalance, and endolysosomal rupture—critical cellular events linked to neural pathologies and mortality. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Vhl reduces cerebral vascular injury and synaptic lesions in APOE4 mice, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Thus, we identify the VHL–HIF axis as a potent modulator of APOE4 -induced neural pathologies and propose that targeting this pathway in nonproliferative tissues may curb cellular damage, protect against neurodegeneration, and reduce tissue injuries and mortality.",

          "abstract": "Enzyme–enzyme interactions are fundamental to the function of cells. Their atomistic mechanisms remain elusive mainly due to limitations of in-cell measurements. We address this challenge by atomistically modeling, for a total of ≈80 μs, a slice of the human cell cytoplasm that includes three successive enzymes along the glycolytic pathway: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). We tested the model for nonspecific protein stickiness, an artifact of current atomistic force fields in crowded environments. The simulations reveal that the human enzymes co-organize in-cell into transient submetabolon complexes, consistent with previous experimental results. Our data both reiterate known specificity between GAPDH and PGK and reveal extensive direct interactions between GAPDH and PGM. Our simulations further reveal, through force field benchmarking, the critical role of protein solvation in facilitating these enzyme–enzyme interactions. Transient interenzyme interactions with μs lifetime occur repeatedly in our simulations via specific sticky protein surface patches, with interactions often mediated by charged patch residues. Some of the residues that interact frequently with one another lie in or near the active site of the enzymes. We show that some of these patches correspond to a general mode to interact with several partners for promiscuous enzymes like GAPDH. We further show that the non-native yeast PGK is stickier than human PGK in our human cytoplasm model, supporting the idea of evolutionary pressure to reduce sticking. Our cytoplasm modeling paves the way toward capturing the atomistic dynamics of an entire enzymatic pathway in-cell.",

These Aβ aggregates are increasingly successfully targeted with clinical therapies at later stages of the disease, but the fundamental molecular steps in early stage disease that trigger the initial nucleation event leading to the conversion of monomeric Aβ peptide into pathological aggregates remain unknown. Here, we show that the Aβ peptide can form biomolecular condensates on lipid bilayers both in molecular assays and in living cells. Our results reveal that these Aβ condensates can significantly accelerate the primary nucleation step in the amyloid conversion cascade that leads to the formation of amyloid aggregates. We show that Aβ condensates contain phospholipids, are intrinsically heterogeneous, and are prone to undergo a liquid-to-solid transition leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. These findings uncover the liquid–liquid phase separation behavior of the Aβ peptide and reveal a molecular step very early in the amyloid-β aggregation process.",

          "abstract": "SOX9 is a crucial transcriptional regulator of cartilage development and homeostasis. Dysregulation of SOX9 is associated with a wide spectrum of skeletal disorders, including campomelic dysplasia, acampomelic campomelic dysplasia, and scoliosis. Yet how SOX9 variants contribute to the spectrum of axial skeletal disorders is not well understood. Here, we report four pathogenic variants of SOX9 identified in a cohort of patients with congenital vertebral malformations. We report a pathogenic missense variant in the transactivation middle (TAM) domain of SOX9 associated with mild skeletal dysplasia and scoliosis. We isolated a Sox9 mutant mouse with an in-frame microdeletion in the TAM domain ( Sox9 Asp272del ), which exhibits skeletal dysplasia including kinked tails, rib cage anomalies, and scoliosis in homozygous mutants. We find that both the human missense and the mouse microdeletion mutations resulted in reduced SOX9 protein stability in cell culture, while Sox9 Asp272del mutant mice show decreased SOX9 expression in the growth plate and annulus fibrosus tissues of the spine. This reduction in SOX9 expression was correlated with the reduction of extracellular matrix components, such as tenascin-X and the Adhesion G-protein coupled receptor ADGRG6. In summary, our work identified and modeled a pathologic variant of SOX9 within the TAM domain and demonstrated its importance for SOX9 protein stability. Our work demonstrates that SOX9 stability is important for the regulation of ADGRG6 expression, which is a known regulator of postnatal spine homeostasis, underscoring the essential role of SOX9 dosage in a spectrum of axial skeleton dysplasia in humans.",

Herein, we unveil a transition from delayed bubble coalescence to rapid bursting within about one millisecond in salty solutions. The key aspect in understanding this transition lies in the combined influences of surface deformation and ion surface excess instead of characterizing the ions alone. Only with a sufficiently deformed region trapped between the colliding bubble and fluid surfaces can the coalescence inhibition effect be maintained to cause the bouncing behavior. Thus, we quantify a consistent upper limit of ion transfer content required for instant coalescence under different salty conditions. Furthermore, we present numerical ranges associated with different bubble behaviors in terms of E o , R e , and W e and determine the critical values to predict bubble dynamics. Our findings shed light on the bubble coalescence principle in saline water and allow access to the regulation of coalescence time based on the requirement of technological applications.",

          "abstract": "The cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria is composed of a phospholipid bilayer made up of a diverse set of lipids. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is one of the principal constituents and its production is essential for growth in many bacteria. All the enzymes required for PG biogenesis in Escherichia coli have been identified and characterized decades ago. However, it has remained poorly understood how gram-positive bacteria perform the terminal step in the pathway that produces this essential lipid. In E. coli, this reaction is mediated by three functionally redundant phosphatases that convert phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) into PG. Here, we show that homologs of these enzymes in Bacillus subtilis are not required for PG synthesis. Instead, we identified a previously uncharacterized B. subtilis protein, YqeG (renamed PgpP), as an essential enzyme required for the conversion of PGP into PG. Expression of B. subtilis or Staphylococcus aureus PgpP in E. coli lacking all three Pgp enzymes supported the growth of the strain. Furthermore, depletion of PgpP in B. subtilis led to growth arrest, reduced membrane lipid staining, and accumulation of PGP. PgpP is broadly conserved among Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. Homologs are also present in yeast mitochondria and plant chloroplasts, suggesting that this widely distributed enzyme has an ancient origin. Finally, evidence suggests that PgpP homologs are essential in many gram-positive pathogens and thus the enzyme represents an attractive target for antibiotic development.",

          "abstract": "ClpXP is a two-component mitochondrial matrix protease. The caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase chaperone subunit X (ClpX) recognizes and translocates protein substrates into the degradation chamber of the caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) for proteolysis. ClpXP degrades damaged respiratory chain proteins and is necessary for cancer cell survival. Despite the critical role of ClpXP in mitochondrial protein quality control, the specific degrons, or modifications that tag substrate proteins for degradation by human ClpXP, are still unknown. We demonstrated that phosphorylated serine (pSer) targets substrates to ClpX and facilitates their degradation by ClpXP in biochemical assays. In contrast, ClpP hyperactivated by the small-molecule drug ONC201 lost the preference for phosphorylated substrates. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry combined with biochemical assays showed that pSer binds the RKL loop of ClpX. ClpX variants with substitutions in the RKL loop failed to recognize phosphorylated substrates. In intact cells, ClpXP also preferentially degraded substrates with pSer. Moreover, ClpX substrates with the pSer were selectively found in aggregated mitochondrial proteins. Our work uncovers a mechanism for substrate recognition by ClpXP, with implications for targeting acute myeloid leukemia and other disorders involving ClpXP dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Microbial mats are stratified communities often dominated by unicellular and filamentous phototrophs within an exopolymer matrix. It is challenging to quantify the dynamic responses of community members in situ as they experience steep gradients and rapid fluctuations of light. To address this, we developed a binary consortium using two representative isolates from hot spring mats: the unicellular oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacterium Synechococcus OS-B′ (Syn OS-B′) and the filamentous anoxygenic phototroph Chloroflexus MS-CIW-1 (Chfl MS-1). We quantified the motility of individual cells and entire colonies and demonstrated that Chfl MS-1 formed bundles of filaments that moved in all directions with no directional bias to light. Syn OS-B′ was slightly less motile but exhibited positive phototaxis. This binary consortium displayed cooperative behavior by moving further than either species alone and formed ordered arrays where both species aligned with the light source. No cooperative motility was observed when a nonmotile pilB mutant of Syn OS-B′ was used instead of Syn OS-B′. The binary consortium also produced more adherent biofilm than individual species, consistent with the close interspecies association revealed by electron microscopy. We propose that cyanobacteria and Chloroflexota cooperate in forming natural microbial mats by colonizing new niches and building robust biofilms.",

          "abstract": "Electric fields in terrestrial environments are used by caterpillars to detect their predators, as foraging cues by pollinators, and facilitate ballooning by spiders. This study shows that electric fields facilitate transportation and detection of hummingbirds in a guild of tropical phoretic mites. Hummingbird flower mites feed on nectar and pollen and complete their life cycle inside flowers. Mites colonize new flowers by hitching rides on hummingbird beaks. Flower mites emerge from hummingbird nostrils and disembark when the beak touches a flower. We tested whether flower mites are attracted to unmodulated electrostatic, or to modulated electric fields with amplitudes and frequencies in the range of those previously reported for hummingbirds. In a laboratory setup, mites were only attracted to modulated electric fields. In a choice experiment between positive or negative polarities, mites almost instantaneously chose positive charges, but only when the field was modulated. Mites display questing behavior, moving their front legs toward an electrostatic source. In experiments where we removed one or both front leg tarsi, we show that modulated fields are detected by sensory structures present in the front legs. We also show that flower mites use electrostatic attraction to bridge the gap to the beaks of hummingbirds, for a few milliseconds becoming one of the fastest terrestrial organisms. Our results confirm that hummingbird flower mites evolved an additional sensory modality — electroreception — to quickly detect hummingbirds and use electrostatics to facilitate transportation onto their hosts.",

          "abstract": "The design of new alloys is a multiscale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically slow and reserved for human experts. Machine learning can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural and chemical features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multimodal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities. The concerted effort of the multiagent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multiobjective design tasks and opens avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.",

DTNE constructs a manifold distance matrix using a modified personalized PageRank algorithm, thereby preserving topological structure while enabling diverse single-cell analyses. This approach facilitates distribution-based cellular relationship analysis, pseudotime inference, and clustering within a unified framework. Extensive benchmarking against mainstream algorithms on diverse datasets demonstrates DTNE’s superior performance in maintaining geodesic distances and revealing significant biological patterns.

Investigating the complex, multiscale-graded structures found in animal tissue provides valuable insights that can help address this challenge. The human meniscus root–bone interface is an exemplary model, renowned for its exceptional fatigue resistance, toughness, and interfacial adhesion properties throughout its lifespan. Here, we investigated the multiscale graded mineralization structure and their strengthening mechanisms within the 30-micron soft–hard interface at the root–bone junction. This graded interface, featuring interdigitated structures and an exponential increase in modulus, undergoes a phase transition from amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to gradually matured hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals, regulated by location-specific distributed biomolecules. In coordination with collagen fibril deformation and reorientation, the in situ tensile mechanical experiments and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that immature ACP particles debond from the collagenous matrix and translocate to dissipate energy, while the progressively matured HAP crystals with high stiffness pins propagating cracks, thereby enhancing both the toughness and fatigue resistance of the interface. To further validate our findings, we built biomimetic soft–hard interfaces with phase-transforming mineralization which exhibited boosted strength, toughness, and interface adhesion. This interface model is generalizable to other material joints and provides a blueprint for developing robust soft–hard composites across various applications.",

          "abstract": "Measuring and interpreting errors in behavioral tasks is critical for understanding cognition. Conventional wisdom assumes that encoding/decoding errors for continuous variables in behavioral tasks should naturally have Gaussian distributions, so that deviations from normality in the empirical data indicate the presence of more complex sources of noise. This line of reasoning has been central for prior research on working memory. Here, we reassess this assumption and find that even in ideal observer models with Gaussian encoding noise, the error distribution is generally non-Gaussian, contrary to the commonly held belief. Critically, we find that the shape of the error distribution is determined by the geometrical structure of the encoding manifold via a simple rule. In the case of a high-dimensional geometry, the error distributions naturally exhibit flat tails. Using this insight, we apply our theory to visual short-term memory tasks, and find that it can account for a large array of experimental data with only two free parameters. Our results challenge the dominant view in the mechanisms and capacity constraints of working memory systems. They instead suggest that the Bayesian framework, which explains various aspects of perceptual behavior, also provides an excellent account of working memory. Overall, our results establish a direct connection between neural manifold geometry and behavior, and call attention to the geometry of the representation as a critically important, yet underappreciated factor in determining the character of errors in human behavior.",

          "abstract": "The crowded bacterial cytoplasm is composed of biomolecules that span several orders of magnitude in size and electrical charge. This complexity has been proposed as the source of the rich spatial organization and apparent anomalous diffusion of intracellular components, although this has not been tested directly. Here, we use biplane microscopy to track the 3D motion of self-assembled bacterial genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (bGEMs) with tunable size (20 to 50 nm) and charge (−3,240 to +2,700 e) in live Escherichia coli cells. To probe intermolecular details at spatial and temporal resolutions beyond experimental limits, we also developed a colloidal whole-cell model that explicitly represents the size and charge of cytoplasmic macromolecules and the porous structure of the bacterial nucleoid. Combining these techniques, we show that bGEMs spatially segregate by size, with small 20-nm particles enriched inside the nucleoid, and larger and/or positively charged particles excluded from this region. Localization is driven by entropic and electrostatic forces arising from cytoplasmic polydispersity, nucleoid structure, geometrical confinement, and interactions with other biomolecules including ribosomes and DNA. We observe that at the timescales of traditional single molecule tracking experiments, motion appears subdiffusive for all particle sizes and charges. However, using computer simulations with higher temporal resolution, we find that the apparent anomalous exponents are governed by the region of the cell in which bGEMs are located. Molecular motion does not display anomalous diffusion on short time scales and the apparent subdiffusion arises from geometrical confinement within the nucleoid and by the cell boundary.",

The ubiquitous human pathogen, Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), encodes a protein (UL12.5) that induces the release of mitochondrial nucleic acid into the cytosol, which activates immune-sensing pathways and reduces productive replication in nonneuronal cells. HSV-1 establishes latency in neurons and can reactivate to cause disease. We found that UL12.5 is required for HSV-1 reactivation in neurons and acts to directly promote viral lytic gene expression during initial exit from latency. Further, the direct activation of innate immune-sensing pathways triggered HSV-1 reactivation and compensated for a lack of UL12.5. Finally, we found that the induction of HSV-1 lytic genes during reactivation required intact RNA- and DNA-sensing pathways, demonstrating that HSV-1 can respond to and active antiviral nucleic acid–sensing pathways to reactivate from a latent infection.",

Mx proteins arose within the Dynamin superfamily of proteins (DSP), which mediate critical cellular processes, such as endocytosis and mitochondrial, plastid, and peroxisomal dynamics. Despite their crucial role, the evolutionary origins of Mx proteins are poorly understood. Through comprehensive phylogenomic analyses with progressively expanded taxonomic sampling, we demonstrate that Mx proteins predate the interferon signaling system in vertebrates. Our analyses find an ancient monophyletic DSP lineage in eukaryotes that groups vertebrate and invertebrate Mx proteins with fungal MxF proteins, the largely uncharacterized plant and algal Dynamin 4A/4C proteins, and representatives from several other eukaryotic lineages, suggesting that Mx-like proteins date back close to the origin of Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analyses also find host-encoded and nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses-encoded DSPs interspersed in four distinct DSP lineages, indicating recurrent viral theft of host DSPs. Our analyses thus reveal an ancient history of viral and antiviral functions encoded by the Dynamin superfamily in eukaryotes.",

The synthesis of this sp 2 carbon phase is demonstrated, and other carbon phases are described for possible future synthesis from graphyne without breaking graphyne bonds. While measurements and theory indicate that the reacting graphyne becomes nonplanar because of sheet wrinkling produced by dimensional mismatch between reacted and nonreacted sheet regions, sheet planarity is regained when the reaction is complete. Although the observed elimination of triple bonds to make parallel planar sp 2 carbon sheets likely requires ordered transformation within each sheet, diffraction data for reacted multisheet stacks indicate that the relative lateral positions of neighboring sheets are disordered, as predicted, since no crystalline diffraction peak (other than for the intersheet spacing) is observed.",

LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases) within the Switch II domain while PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin (Ub) and indirectly induces phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases. Herein we have crossed LRRK2 [R1441C] mutant knock-in mice with PINK1 knock-out (KO) mice and report that loss of PINK1 does not impact endogenous LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation nor do we see significant effect of mutant LRRK2 on PINK1-mediated Rab and Ub phosphorylation. In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, protein phosphatase family member 1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signaling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioral studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 R1441C mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor transcription. This is not exacerbated in double-mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation and/or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism toward PD. Our data suggest that reversal of defects downstream of ciliogenesis offers a common therapeutic strategy for LRRK2 or PINK1 PD patients, whereas LRRK2 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials are unlikely to benefit PINK1 PD patients.",

          "abstract": "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (mC) in DNA, contributing to the regulation of gene transcription. Diverse mutations of TET2 are frequently found in various blood cancers, yet the full scope of their functional consequences has been unexplored. Here, we report that a subset of TET2 mutations identified in leukemia patients alter the substrate specificity of TET2 from acting on mC to thymine. This neomorphic activity results from substitutions at key residues involved in the interactions with the mC base, including Asn1387 and His1904. Recombinant human TET2 proteins harboring the mutation of these residues can catalyze the oxidation of thymine to 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 5-formyluracil (fU). Exogenous expression of the mutant TET2 Asn1387Thr (N1387T) in HEK293T cells leads to hmU accumulation, with levels further increased in cells lacking the glycosylase SMUG1. Endogenous knock-in of N1300T, the murine equivalent of N1387T, in mouse embryonic stem cells induces hmU production, causing DNA lesions and transcriptional activation of DNA damage response genes. N1300T cells accumulate more additional mutations with extended culture and exhibit heightened sensitivity to ATR inhibition compared to Tet2 knockout cells. Our study reveals that certain patient-derived TET2 mutations can acquire unexpected gain-of-function activities beyond impairing mC oxidation, offering a fresh perspective on the diverse molecular etiology of mutant TET2-related leukemogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial receptors feed into multiple signal transduction pathways that regulate a variety of cellular processes including gene expression, second messenger levels, and motility. Receptors are typically activated by signal binding to ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Cache domains are omnipresent LBDs found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, including humans. They form the predominant family of extracytosolic bacterial LBDs and were identified in all major receptor types. Cache domains are composed of either a single (sCache) or a double (dCache) structural module. The functional relevance of bimodular LBDs remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the PacF chemoreceptor in the phytopathogen Pectobacterium atrosepticum that recognizes formate at the membrane-distal module of its dCache domain, triggering chemoattraction. We further demonstrate that a family of formate-specific sCache domains has evolved from a dCache domain, exemplified by PacF, by losing the membrane-proximal module. By solving high-resolution structures of two family members in complex with formate, we show that the molecular basis for formate binding at sCache and dCache domains is highly similar, despite their low sequence identity. The apparent loss of the membrane-proximal module may be related to the observation that dCache domains bind ligands typically at the membrane-distal module, whereas studies have failed to find ligands bound in the membrane-proximal module. This work advances our understanding of signal sensing in bacterial receptors and suggests that evolution by reducing complexity may be a route for shaping diversity.",

Here, we investigate the elasticity of CaPv using ab initio machine-learning force fields (MLFF). At room temperature, the elasticity of tetragonal CaPv determined by MLFF molecular dynamics (MD) agrees well with experimental measurements after considering temperature induced variations in the hydrostatic structure, proving the effectiveness of the method. We use the MLFF MD in the NPT ensemble to establish the tetragonal–cubic phase boundary and confirm that in the lower mantle CaPv is in the cubic phase. The elasticity of cubic CaPv shows distinct temperature dependence at different ranges: it is linear at high temperatures, whereas it exhibits anomalous precursor softening near the tetragonal–cubic phase boundary. The temperature interval of precursor softening widens as the pressure increases and overlaps with the temperature profile of subducted cold slabs near the core–mantle boundary. While cubic CaPv is seismically invisible along the average mantle geotherm, it may induce low-velocity zones with negative temperature anomaly, leading to the view that the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) may be caused by subducted oceanic crust rich in CaPv with temperature lower than ambient mantle. A cool, rigid LLSVP may help explain the preferential formation of mantle plumes at its margins, as well as its weaker seismic anisotropy.",

          "abstract": "Lignin degradation by biocatalysts is a key strategy to develop a plant-based sustainable carbon economy and thus alleviate global climate change. This process involves synergy between ligninases and auxiliary enzymes. However, auxiliary enzymes within secretomes, which are composed of thousands of enzymes, remain enigmatic, although several ligninolytic enzymes have been well characterized. Moreover, it is a challenge to understand synergistic lignin degradation via a diverse array of enzymes, especially in bacterial systems. In this study, the coexpression network of the periplasmic proteome uncovers potential accessory enzymes for B-type dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DypBs) in Pseudomonas putida A514. The catalytic network of the DypBs-based multienzyme complex is characterized. DypBs couple with quinone reductases and nitroreductase to participate in quinone redox cycling. They work with superoxide dismutase to induce Fenton reaction for lignin oxidation. A synthetic enzyme cocktail (SEC), recruiting 15 enzymes, was consequently designed with four functions. It overcomes the limitation of lignin repolymerization, exhibiting a capacity comparable to that of the native periplasmic secretome. Importantly, we reveal the synergistic mechanism of a SEC-A514 cell system, which incorporates the advantages of in vitro enzyme catalysis and in vivo microbial catabolism. Chemical analysis shows that this system significantly reduces the molecular weight of lignin, substantially extends the degradation spectra for lignin functional groups, and efficiently metabolizes lignin derivatives. As a result, 25% of lignin is utilized, and its average molecular weight is reduced by 27%. Our study advances the knowledge of bacterial lignin-degrading multienzymes and provides a viable lignin degradation strategy.",

While spike proteins on viral surfaces are attractive targets for preventing viral entry, they mutate frequently, making it difficult to develop effective therapeutics. Here, we used a structure-guided strategy to engineer an inhibitor peptide against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, called CeSPIACE, with mutation-tolerant and potent binding ability against all variants to enhance affinity for the invariant architecture of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). High-resolution structures of the peptide complexed with mutant RBDs revealed a mechanism of mutation-tolerant inhibition. CeSPIACE bound major mutant RBDs with picomolar affinity and inhibited infection by SARS-CoV-2 variants in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (IC 50 4 pM to 13 nM) and demonstrated potent in vivo efficacy by inhalation administration in hamsters. Mutagenesis analyses to address mutation risks confirmed tolerance against existing and/or potential future mutations of the RBD. Our strategy of engineering mutation-tolerant inhibitors may be applicable to other infectious diseases.",

In the course of a Myxococcus xanthus predator evolution experiment, we identified a class of genotypes leading to enhanced predation against diverse species. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that this phenotype is linked to the constitutive activation of a predation-specific program. Functional analysis of the mutations accumulated across the evolutionary time in a two-component system and Acyl-CoA-manipulating enzymes revealed the critical roles of fatty acid metabolism and antioxidant gene induction. The former likely adapts the predator to metabolites derived from the prey while the latter protects predatory cells from reactive oxygen species generated by prey cells under stress and released upon lysis during predation.

          "abstract": "Cellular actin networks exhibit distinct assembly and disassembly dynamics, primarily driven by multicomponent reactions occurring at the two ends of actin filaments. While barbed ends are recognized as the hotspot for polymerization, depolymerization is predominantly associated with pointed ends. Consequently, mechanisms promoting barbed-end depolymerization have received relatively little attention. Here, using microfluidics-assisted three-color single-molecule imaging, we reveal that cyclase-associated protein (CAP), long known for its roles in nucleotide exchange and pointed-end depolymerization, also acts as a processive depolymerase at filament barbed ends. CAP molecules track barbed ends for several minutes, inducing depolymerization rates of up to 60 subunits per second. Importantly, CAP modulates barbed-end dynamics even under cytosol-mimicking assembly promoting conditions. We further show that CAP can colocalize with both formin and capping protein (CP) at barbed ends. CAP enhances formin processivity by 10-fold, allowing CAP–formin complexes to track fast-elongating barbed ends. In contrast, CAP destabilizes CP-bound barbed ends and accelerates dissociation of CP by fourfold. Our findings, combined with CAP’s previously reported activities, firmly establish CAP as a key regulator of cellular actin dynamics.",

          "authors": "Alexander Gehrke, Karen Mulleners",
          "abstract": "Airborne insects generate a leading edge vortex when they flap their wings. This coherent vortex is a low-pressure region that enhances the lift of flapping wings compared to fixed wings. Insect wings are thin membranes strengthened by a system of veins that does not allow large wing deformations. Bat wings are thin compliant skin membranes stretched between their limbs, hand, and body that show larger deformations during flapping wing flight. This study examines the role of the leading edge vortex on highly deformable membrane wings that passively change shape under fluid dynamic loading maintaining a positive camber throughout the hover cycle. Our experiments reveal that unsteady wing deformations suppress the formation of a coherent leading edge vortex as flexibility increases. At lift and energy optimal aeroelastic conditions, there is no more leading edge vortex. Instead, vorticity accumulates in a bound shear layer covering the wing’s upper surface from the leading to the trailing edge. Despite the absence of a leading edge vortex, the optimal deformable membrane wings demonstrate enhanced lift and energy efficiency compared to their rigid counterparts. It is possible that small bats rely on this mechanism for efficient hovering. We relate the force production on the wings with their deformation through scaling analyses. Additionally, we identify the geometric angles at the leading and trailing edges as observable indicators of the flow state and use them to map out the transitions of the flow topology and their aerodynamic performance for a wide range of aeroelastic conditions.",

          "abstract": "The chloroplast genome encodes key components of the photosynthetic light reaction machinery as well as the large subunit of the enzyme central for carbon fixation, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphat-carboxylase/-oxygenase (RuBisCo). Its expression is predominantly regulated posttranscriptionally, with nuclear-encoded RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) playing a key role. Mutants of chloroplast gene expression factors often exhibit impaired chloroplast biogenesis, especially in cold conditions. Low temperatures pose a challenge for plants as this leads to electron imbalances and oxidative damage. A well-known response of plants to this problem is to increase the production of RuBisCo and other Calvin Cycle enzymes in the cold, but how this is achieved is unclear. The chloroplast RBP CP29A has been shown to be essential for cold resistance in growing leaf tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana . Here, we examined CP29A–RNA interaction sites at nucleotide resolution. We found that CP29A preferentially binds to the 5′-untranslated region of rbcL , downstream of the binding site of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein MATURATION OF RBCL 1 (MRL1). MRL1 is an RBP known to be necessary for the accumulation of rbcL . In Arabidopsis mutants lacking CP29A, we were unable to observe significant effects on rbcL , possibly due to CP29A’s restricted role in a limited number of cells at the base of leaves. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants of tobacco NtCP29A exhibit cold-dependent photosynthetic deficiencies throughout the entire leaf blade. This is associated with a parallel reduction in rbcL mRNA and RbcL protein accumulation. Our work indicates that a chloroplast RNA–binding protein contributes to cold acclimation of RbcL production.",

          "abstract": "As an essential micronutrient, phosphorus plays a key role in oceanic biogeochemistry, with its cycling intimately connected to the global carbon cycle and climate change. Authigenic carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) has been suggested to represent a significant phosphorus sink in the deep ocean, but its formation mechanisms in oceanic low-productivity settings remain poorly constrained. Applying X-ray absorption near edge structure, transmission electron microscopy, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analyses, we report a unique mineral assemblage where CFA crystals coat phillipsite in abyssal sediments of the East Mariana Basin and the Philippine Sea. This finding suggests that phillipsite provides an ideal microenvironment for CFA formation due to its ability to release calcium cations and its strong adsorption capacity for phosphate anions. The feasibility of such a mechanism was confirmed by long-term (10 mo) laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the CFA forming in the sediment of abyssal plains is found to be enriched in rare earth elements (REE). The previously unrecognized mechanism of CFA formation may therefore not only contribute to the cycling of phosphorus in oceanic low-productivity environments but may also represent a significant sink of REE.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic stress can enhance the development of multiple human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of chronic stress in esophageal carcinogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study uncovered that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism significantly promotes esophageal carcinogenesis under chronic stress conditions. Our findings indicate that the persistent elevation of glucocorticoids induced by chronic stress stimulates cholesterol uptake, contributing to esophageal carcinogenesis. The activated glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) enrichment at the promoter region of High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2) facilitates its transcription. As a transcription coactivator, HMGB2 enhances Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1 (SREBF1) transcription and regulates cholesterol metabolism through LDL particle uptake into cells via Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR). These results emphasize the significant impact of chronic stress on esophageal carcinogenesis and establish cholesterol metabolism disorder as a crucial link between chronic stress and the development of ESCC. The implications suggest that effectively managing chronic stress may serve as a viable strategy for preventing and treating ESCC.",

          "abstract": "The L-type Ca 2+ channel (Ca V 1.2) is essential for cardiac excitation–contraction coupling. To contribute to the inward Ca 2+ flux that drives Ca 2+ -induced-Ca 2+ -release, Ca V 1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune Ca V 1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca 2+ channel trafficking in nonmyocytes; however, whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on Ca V 1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including Na V 1.5 and the human ether-à-go-go–related gene (hERG) potassium channel. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with Ca V 1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac Ca V 1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, superresolution imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with Ca V 1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/Ca V 1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of β -adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated Ca V 1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs Ca V 1.2 superclustering. Isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal Ca V 1.2 expression, Ca 2+ currents, and Ca 2+ transients in ventricular myocytes were strengthened by 14-3-3 overexpression and attenuated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with Ca V 1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during β -adrenergic stimulation.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is impacting forests in complex ways, with indirect effects arising from interactions between tree growth and reproduction often overlooked. Our 43-y study of European beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) showed that rising summer temperatures since 2005 have led to more frequent seed production events. This shift increases reproductive effort but depletes the trees’ stored resources due to insufficient recovery periods between seed crops. Consequently, annual tree ring increments have declined by 28%, dropping from a stable average of 1.60 mm y −1 between 1980 and 2005 to 1.16 mm y −1 thereafter. Importantly, this growth decline occurred without an accompanying trend in summer drought, indicating that altered reproductive patterns—not moisture stress—are driving the reduction. This creates a “perfect storm”: Increased reproductive effort drains resources, viable seed output falls due to the loss of mast-seeding benefits via pollination and lower seed predation, and the ongoing growth decline reduces current carbon uptake and future reproductive potential. These compounding factors threaten the sustainability of Europe’s most widespread forest tree. Our findings unveil a critical yet underrecognized indirect mechanism by which climate change endangers forest ecosystems, emphasizing the need to consider interactions between demographic processes when assessing species vulnerability to climate change.",

          "abstract": "Hsp70, Hsp90, and ClpB/Hsp100 are molecular chaperones that help regulate proteostasis. Bacterial and yeast Hsp70s and their cochaperones function synergistically with Hsp90s to reactivate inactive and aggregated proteins by a mechanism that requires a direct interaction between Hsp90 and Hsp70 both in vitro and in vivo. Escherichia coli and yeast Hsp70s also collaborate in bichaperone systems with ClpB and Hsp104, respectively, to disaggregate and reactivate aggregated proteins and amyloids such as prions. These collaborations are dependent on direct interactions between ClpB/Hsp104 and Hsp70. We explored the possibility that E. coli homologs of Hsp70, Hsp90, and ClpB, referred to as DnaK, Hsp90 Ec , and ClpB, respectively, in combination with two DnaK cochaperones, DnaJ and GrpE, could promote protein disaggregation and reactivation under conditions where bichaperone systems are ineffective. Our results show that Hsp90 Ec is able to overcome the inhibition of protein disaggregation and reactivation observed when the concentration of DnaK is approaching physiological concentrations. We found that ATP hydrolysis and substrate binding by all three chaperones are essential for the collaborative function. The work further shows that ClpB acts early in protein reactivation with DnaK and its cochaperones; E. coli Hsp90 acts at a later stage after ClpB.

          "abstract": "In mammals, the four subunit isoforms HCN1–4 assemble to form functional homotetrameric and heterotetrameric hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) ion channels. Despite the outstanding relevance of HCN channels for organisms, including generating electrical rhythmicity in cardiac pacemaker cells and diverse types of brain neurons, key channel properties are still elusive. In particular, the unitary conductance, γ, of HCN channels is highly controversial. We analyzed the unitary conductance at femtosiemens resolution of all four homotetrameric channels of the mouse, mHCN1–4. All conductance values are in the range of 1 pS which is exceptionally small compared to most other ion channels. Surprisingly, the conductance among the isoforms differs up to threefold (γ mHCN2 = 1.54 pS &gt; γ mHCN1 = 0.84 pS &gt; γ mHCN3 = 0.54 pS ≈ γ mHCN4 = 0.51 pS) though the residues in the two narrow parts of the pore, the selectivity filter and the inner gate, are conserved. Mutagenesis and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the differences in the conductance are generated by different amounts of negative charges in the outer channel vestibule, which control ion accumulation. In line with these results, heterotetrameric channels exhibit intermediate unitary conductance values with respect to the homotetrameric channels. Our approach demonstrates how HCN channels can be functionally differentiated at the single-channel level, paving the way to target specific channels with selective drugs.",

          "abstract": "Toxoplasma bradyzoites reside in tissue cysts that undergo cycles of expansion, rupture, and release to foster chronic infection. The glycosylated cyst wall acts as a protective barrier, although the processes responsible for formation, remodeling, and turnover are not understood. Herein, we identify a noncanonical chitinase-like enzyme TgCLP1 that localizes to micronemes and is targeted to the cyst wall after secretion. Genetic deletion of TgCLP1 resulted in a thickened cyst wall that decreased cyst turnover, blocked the export of virulence effectors into host cells, and resulted in failure to persist during chronic infection. Genetic complementation with a series of mutants revealed that the GH19 glycosidase domain was crucial for regulating glycosylation of several glycoproteins in the cyst wall. Overall, our findings reveal that TgCLP1 is a multifunctional survival factor that modifies glycoproteins within the cyst wall to modulate export of virulence effectors and regulate turnover of tissue cysts.",

          "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy–infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) is a photothermal scanning probe technique that combines nanoscale spatial resolution with the chemical analysis capability of mid-infrared spectroscopy. Using this hybrid technique, chemical identification down to the single molecule level has been demonstrated. However, the mechanism at the heart of AFM-IR, the transduction of local photothermal heating to cantilever deflection, is still not fully understood. Existing physical models only describe this process in few special cases but not in many of the types of sample geometries encountered in the practical use of AFM-IR. In this work, an analytical expression for modeling the temperature and photothermal expansion process is introduced, verified with finite element simulations, and validated with AFM-IR experiments. This method describes AFM-IR signal amplitudes in vertically and laterally heterogeneous samples and allows studying the effect of position and size of an absorber, pump laser repetition rate and pulse width on AFM-IR signal amplitudes and spatial resolution. The analytical model can be used to identify optimal AFM-IR experimental settings in conventional and advanced AFM-IR modes (e.g., tapping mode, surface-sensitive mode). The model also paves the way for signal inversion based superresolution AFM-IR.",

          "abstract": "The question of what mechanisms maintain tropical biodiversity is a critical frontier in ecology, intensified by the heightened risk of biodiversity loss faced in tropical regions. Ecological theory has shed light on multiple mechanisms that could lead to the high levels of biodiversity in tropical forests. But variation in species abundances over time may be just as important as overall biodiversity, with a more immediate connection to the risk of extirpation and biodiversity loss. Despite the urgency, our understanding of the primary mechanisms driving fluctuations in species abundances has not been clearly established. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework based around life history; the schedule of birth, growth, and mortality over a lifespan, and its systematic variation across species. We develop a mean field model to predict expected fluctuations in abundance for a focal species in a larger community, and we quantify empirical life history variation among 90 tropical forest species in a 50 ha plot in Panama. Putting theory and data together, we show that life history provides a critical piece of this puzzle, allowing us to explain patterns of abundance fluctuations more accurately than previous models incorporating demographic stochasticity without life history variation, and without introducing unobserved couplings between species and their environment. This framework provides a starting point for more general models that incorporate multiple factors in addition to life history variation, and suggests the potential for a fine-grained assessment of extirpation risk based on the impacts of anthropogenic change on demographic rates across life stages.",

DOX-induced DNA damage activates Tp53 class mediators across ovarian cell types. In the mesenchyme, cotreatment with AMH halts theca progenitor differentiation and reduces apoptotic gene expression. In preantral granulosa cells, DOX upregulates the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a and dysregulates Wnt signaling, which are ameliorated by AMH cotreatment. Finally, AMH induces Id3 , a gene involved in DNA repair, which is necessary to prevent the accumulation of DNA lesions marked by γ-H2AX.

To address this challenge, we proposed a triethylamine (TEA)-mediated protonation–deprotonation strategy that enabled the adjustable-proportion self assembly of dual drugs without chemical modification, achieving nearly 100% drug loading capacity. Molecular dynamic simulations, supported by experiment evidence, elucidated the underlying self-assembly mechanism. Specifically, TEA facilitated the deprotonation of Doxorubicin (Dox) and α-Tocopherol succinate (α-tos), causing Dox to transition from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state, while simultaneously increasing the hydrophilicity of α-tos. This allowed for a fine-tuned balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the two compounds, enabling their precise self assembly into a carrier-free nanomedicine (DT) with a tailored drug ratio. The engineered DT demonstrated the ability to accumulate at the tumor sites and release its therapeutic drugs in a controlled manner. The combination of Dox and α-tos synergistically generated reactive oxygen species and modulated the expression of tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9, leading to superior antitumor efficacy without significant metastasis, while maintaining excellent safety profiles. Our findings provided unique perspectives on the design of carrier-free nanomedicine for cancer therapy, thereby laying a solid foundation for its potential clinical translation.",

Although the disulfide bond formed between Cys57 and Cys146 in the active state has been well studied, the role of the reduced cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, in SOD1 filament formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of reduced cysteine residues by determining and comparing cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) and C6A/C111A SOD1 filaments under thiol-based reducing and metal-depriving conditions, starting with protein samples possessing enzymatic activity. The C6A/C111A mutant SOD1 formed filaments more rapidly than the WT protein. The mutant structure had a unique paired-protofilament arrangement, with a smaller filament core than that of the single-protofilament structure observed in WT SOD1. Although the single-protofilament form developed more slowly, cross-seeding experiments demonstrated the predominance of single-protofilament morphology over paired protofilaments, regardless of the presence of the Cys6 and Cys111 mutations. These findings highlight the importance of the number of amino acid residues within the filament core in determining the energy requirements for assembly. Our study provides insights into ALS pathogenesis by elucidating the initiation and propagation of filament formation, which potentially leads to deleterious amyloid filaments.",

          "abstract": "In the pregenomic era, scientists were puzzled by the observation that haploid genome size (the C-value) did not correlate well with organismal complexity. This phenomenon, called the “C-value paradox,” is mostly explained by the fact that protein-coding genes occupy only a small fraction of eukaryotic genomes. When the first genome sequences became available, scientists were even more surprised by the fact that the number of genes (G-value) was also a poor predictor of complexity, which gave rise to the “G-value paradox.” The proposed explanations usually invoke mechanisms that increase the information content of each individual gene (protein–protein interactions, intrinsic disorder, posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, etc.). Less attention has been paid to mechanisms that increase the amount of genetic material but do not increase (or not to the same extent) the amount of information encoded in the genome, such as gene duplication and domain shuffling. Proteins belonging to the same family and/or sharing the same domains often carry out similar or even redundant functions. We thus hypothesized that an organism’s number of different protein families and domains should be suitable predictors of organismal complexity. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed that the number of protein families, clans, domains, and motifs increases from simple to progressively more complex organisms. In addition, these metrics correlate with the number of cell types better than and independently of the number of protein-coding genes and several previously proposed predictors of organismal complexity. Our observations have the potential to represent a resolution to the G-value paradox.",

          "abstract": "Classical tissue recombination experiments demonstrate that cell-fate determination along the anterior–posterior axis of the Müllerian duct occurs prior to postnatal day 7 in mice. However, little is known about how these cell types are maintained in adults. In this study, we provide genetic evidence that a balance between antagonistic retinoic acid (RA) and estrogen signaling activity is required to maintain simple columnar cell fate in adult uterine epithelium. Transdifferentiation of simple columnar uterine epithelium into stratified cervicovaginal-like epithelium was observed in three related mouse genetic models, in which RA signaling was perturbed in the postnatal uterus. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified the transformed epithelial cell populations and revealed extensive immune cell infiltration resulting from loss of RA signaling. Surprisingly, disruption of RA signaling led to dysregulated expression of a substantial number of estrogen target genes, suggesting that these two pathways may functionally oppose each other in determining and maintaining uterine epithelial cell fate. Consistent with this model, neonatal exposure to the strong synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol, downregulated expression of a group of RA target genes and led to epithelial stratification and immune cell infiltration in wild-type uterus. Treating RA receptor triple conditional knockout pups with fulvestrant, an estrogen antagonist, reestablished the balance between the two signaling pathways, and effectively prevented the transformation of mutant simple columnar epithelia to metaplastic stratified epithelia. These findings implicate an essential role for RA signaling in maintaining uterine cytodifferentiation by antagonizing estrogen signaling in the postnatal uterus.",

          "abstract": "Large herbivores are in decline in much of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, and true apex carnivores like the lion ( Panthera leo ) decline in parallel with their prey. As a consequence, competitively subordinate carnivores like the African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) are simultaneously experiencing a costly reduction in resources and a beneficial reduction in dominant competitors. The net effect is not intuitively obvious, but wild dogs’ density, survival, and reproduction are all low in areas that are strongly affected by prey depletion. To assess whether these correlations are causal, we tested the hypothesized mechanism, using data from 13 wild dog packs in two ecosystems to relate the energetic costs and benefits of hunting to variation in prey density, while controlling for the effects of local lion density, pack size, the number of dependent pups, and the level of protection. All of these variables affected the energetic costs and benefits of hunting. In areas with low prey density, the magnitude of movements and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (a measure of energy expenditure) both increased, the mass of killed prey decreased, and the number of kills per day did not change detectably. Programs to reduce or reverse the decline of large herbivore populations should be an effective means of improving the status of endangered subordinate competitors like the wild dog, and should be a high priority. Our results demonstrate the utility of research that integrates data from biomonitoring with direct, long-term observation of endangered species, their competitors, and their resources.",

This accomplishment was a precursor to an unprecedented burgeoning of large language models (LLMs) in the life sciences. That was just the beginning.

Unlike multimodal LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude, which process text, audio, and images, these large language of life models (LLLMs) are multiomic. That is to say, they are not only multimodal but pertain to different layers of molecular biology.

This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation.

We tracked these rearrangements over time to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter variants that avoided essential genes. We characterized 29 clones with multiple rearrangements, finding an impact of deletions on expression of genes in the variant but not on nearby genes. This genome-scrambling strategy enables large deletions, sequence relocations, and the insertion of regulatory elements to explore genome dispensability and organization.",

          "abstract": "On 3 October 2023, a multihazard cascade in the Sikkim Himalaya, India, was triggered by 14.7 million m 3 of frozen lateral moraine collapsing into South Lhonak Lake, generating an ~20 m tsunami-like impact wave, breaching the moraine, and draining ~50 million m 3 of water. The ensuing Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million m 3 of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impact of this event prompts urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters. Insights into multihazard evolution are pivotal for informing policy development, enhancing Early Warning Systems (EWS), and spurring paradigm shifts in GLOF risk management strategies in the Himalaya and other mountain environments.",

G -factors reached magnitudes as high as 1.30 for drop-cast films and 1.06 for patterned films, approaching theoretical limits. By controlling the evaporation geometry, various domain shapes and sizes were achieved, with homochiral domains exceeding 6 square millimeters that transition smoothly between left- and right-handed chirality.

Loss of Casz1 resulted in transdifferentiation of IHCs into OHCs, without affecting OHC production. However, long-term OHC survival was compromised in Casz1 mutant mice. In addition, the transcription factor Gata3 was down-regulated in Casz1 -deleted IHCs and overexpressing Gata3 partially rescued IHC properties, OHC numbers, and hearing in Casz1 -deleted mice.

After movement cessation, replays avoided the animal’s previous path for 3 seconds. Chains of replays avoided self-repetition over a shorter timescale. We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input.

In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat’s own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics.

Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.",

Unlike CODH, the multidomain ACS undergoes large conformational changes to form an internal connection to the CODH active site, accommodate the CoFeSP for methyl transfer, and protect the reaction intermediates.

Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression. This mechanism may also explain why SVTg suppression induces aversion and increases fear. The translational relevance of these findings is supported by evidence in the rat, monkey, and human brainstem, establishing SVTg as a key hub for reward processing, emotional valence, and motivation.",

We found that Uty regulates spermatogonial proliferation, revealed a role for Zfy2 in promoting meiotic sex chromosome pairing, and uncovered unexpected effects of Y genes on the somatic testis transcriptome. In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants.

RAD51 recombinase, the central component of several crucial processes in repairing DNA and protecting genome integrity, forms filaments on DNA, which are tightly regulated. One of these RAD51 regulators is FIGNL1 (fidgetin-like 1), which prevents RAD51 genotoxic chromatin association in normal cells and persistent RAD51 foci upon DNA damage. The cryogenic electron microscopy–imaged structure of FIGNL1 in complex with RAD51 reveals that FIGNL1 forms a nonplanar hexamer and encloses RAD51 N terminus in the FIGNL1 hexamer pore. Mutations in pore loop or catalytic residues of FIGNL1 render it defective in filament disassembly and are lethal in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our study reveals a distinct mechanism for removing RAD51 from bound substrates and provides the molecular basis for FIGNL1 in maintaining genome stability.",

Derived HSD17B2 isozymes, which are absent in high-testosterone males but preferentially expressed in low-testosterone males, converted testosterone to androstenedione faster than the ancestral isozyme.

A combined suite of characterizations, including ammonia temperature-dependent desorption, neutron powder diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, reveal isolated ammonia adsorption on T8 as “single Al” in the straight channel and bridged ammonia adsorption on T6 and T4 as an “Al pair” (Al T6 -O-Si T5 -O-Al T4 ) in the straight-sinusoidal intersection.",

          "abstract": "Chirality, a pervasive form of symmetry, is intimately connected to the physical properties of solids, as well as the chemical and biological activity of molecular systems. However, inducing chirality in a nonchiral material is challenging because this requires that all mirrors and all roto-inversions be simultaneously broken. Here, we show that chirality of either handedness can be induced in the nonchiral piezoelectric material boron phosphate (BPO 4 ) by irradiation with terahertz pulses. Resonant excitation of either one of two orthogonal, degenerate vibrational modes determines the sign of the induced chiral order parameter. The optical activity of the photo-induced phases is comparable to the static value of prototypical chiral α-quartz. Our findings offer new prospects for the control of out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena in complex materials.",

          "abstract": "Pathways to achieving net zero carbon emissions commonly involve deploying reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy crops across millions of hectares of land. It is often assumed that by helping to mitigate climate change, these strategies indirectly benefit biodiversity. Here, we modeled the climate and habitat requirements of 14,234 vertebrate species and show that the impact of these strategies on species’ habitat area tends not to arise through climate mitigation, but rather through habitat conversion. Across locations, reforestation tends to provide species more habitat through both land-cover change and climate mitigation, whereas habitat loss from afforestation and bioenergy cropping typically outweighs the climate mitigation benefits. This work shows how and where land-based mitigation strategies can be deployed without inadvertently reducing the area of habitat for global biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "Increased antibody affinity over time after vaccination, known as affinity maturation, is a prototypical feature of immune responses. Recent studies have shown that a diverse collection of B cells, producing antibodies with a wide spectrum of different affinities, is selected into the plasma cell (PC) pathway. How affinity-permissive selection enables PC affinity maturation remains unknown. We found that PC precursors (prePCs) expressing high-affinity antibodies received higher levels of T follicular helper cell (T FH cell)–derived help and divided at higher rates compared with their lower-affinity counterparts once they left the germinal center. Our findings indicate that differential cell division by selected prePCs accounts for how diverse precursors develop into a PC compartment that mediates serological affinity maturation.",

However, biogeochemical models lack observational data, leading to oversimplified representation of carbon cycling by migrating organisms, such as Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ). Using a numerical model informed by 1 year of acoustic observations in the East Antarctic, we estimated the total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux from krill fecal pellets to be 9.68 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day (mg C m −2 day −1 ). A maximum of 25% of krill migrated to depths &gt;200 m with a strong seasonality component, transporting &lt;10% of the total krill POC flux (1.28 mg C m −2 day −1 ) to the deep ocean. Accurate carbon flux estimates are essential to inform climate policy and mitigation strategies, and models that include vertical migration will overestimate carbon export if this seasonality is not captured.",

Image-based transcriptomics approaches offer an avenue to study such behaviors, yet these approaches have been hindered by the massive density of bacterial messenger RNA. To overcome this challenge, we combined 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision that bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.",

Dysregulated lysosomal activity and cholesterol metabolism activate pathogenic inflammation, but their relevance to PAH is unclear. Nuclear receptor coactivator 7 ( NCOA7 ) deficiency in endothelium produced an oxysterol and bile acid signature through lysosomal dysregulation, promoting endothelial pathophenotypes. This oxysterol signature overlapped with a plasma metabolite signature associated with human PAH mortality. Mice deficient for endothelial Ncoa7 or exposed to an inflammatory bile acid developed worsened PAH. Genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency was driven by single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11154337, which alters endothelial immunoactivation and is associated with human PAH mortality. An NCOA7-activating agent reversed endothelial immunoactivation and rodent PAH. Thus, we established a genetic and metabolic paradigm that links lysosomal biology and oxysterol processes to endothelial inflammation and PAH.",

Yet, the mechanistic links between land-use intensity and stability-driving mechanisms remain unclear, with functional traits likely playing a key role. Using 13 years of data from 300 sites in Germany, we tested whether and how trait-based community features mediate the effect of land-use intensity on acknowledged stability drivers (compensatory dynamics, portfolio effect, and dominant species variability), within and across plant and arthropod communities. Trait-based plant features, especially the prevalence of acquisitive strategies along the leaf-economics spectrum, were the main land-use intensity mediators within and across taxonomic and trophic levels, consistently influencing dominant species variability. Functional diversity also mediated land-use intensity effects but played a lesser role. Our analysis discloses trait-based community features as key mediators of land-use effects on stability drivers, emphasizing the need to consider multi-trophic functional interactions to better understand complex ecosystem dynamics.",

Feldspar thermal disequilibrium textures indicate that they were carried from their crustal staging area. Bulk and mafic minerals have very high FeO and low MgO to FeO total ratios, which are partially reproduced by thermodynamic models involving high-degree fractional crystallization of a gabbroic assemblage and possibly also assimilation of iron-rich basement.

          "abstract": "Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluids has been an elusive goal for centuries. Even with modern computers, anything beyond the simplest turbulent flows is too chaotic and multiscaled to be directly simulatable. An alternative is to treat turbulence probabilistically, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Such PDFs are neither chaotic nor multiscale, yet remain challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here, we overcome the dimensionality problem by encoding turbulence PDFs as highly compressed “tensor networks” (TNs). This enables single CPU core simulations that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a 5 + 1 dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of O ( 10 6 ) and O ( 10 3 ) , respectively, compared to standard finite-difference algorithms. A future path is opened toward something heretofore thought infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that can usefully be described probabilistically.",

However, traditional holography presents 3D scenes with unnatural defocus and severe speckles due to the limited space bandwidth product of the spatial light modulator (SLM). Here, we introduce Motion Hologram, a holographic technique that accurately portrays photorealistic and speckle-free 3D scenes. This technique leverages a single hologram and a learnable motion trajectory, which are jointly optimized within a deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrated that the proposed technique could achieve a 4- to 5-dB PSNR improvement of focal stacks in comparison with traditional holography and could successfully depict speckle-free, high-fidelity, and full-color 3D displays using only a commercial SLM. We believe that the proposed method promises a prospective form of holographic displays that will offer immersive viewing experiences for audiences.",

We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors. This study offers a reinforced strategy against antigen-loss immune-evasive tumor.",

Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultrahigh precision, below 0.01‰, but its accuracy is often worse than 5‰ due to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements. To eliminate this problem, we exploit optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a high-fidelity dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. We demonstrate the sub–per-mil accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results for CO line intensity and for HD line shape, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10 −4 level. We see potential for our approach in atmospheric remote sensing, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and establishment of primary gas standards.",

However, currently, inducing room-temperature nonequilibrium polariton condensation in perovskite microcavities requires optical pulsed excitations with high excitation densities. Here, we demonstrate continuous-wave optically pumped polariton condensation with an exceptionally low threshold of ~0.53 W cm −2 and a narrow linewidth of ~0.5 meV. Polariton condensation is unambiguously demonstrated by characterizing the nonlinear behavior and coherence properties. We also unveil the trapping potential landscape strategy to facilitate polariton relaxation and accumulation.

However, the precise role and underlying mechanisms of palmitoylation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of macrophages remain elusive. Here, we found that M. tuberculosis infection induced the expression of zinc-finger DHHC domain–type palmitoyl-transferases (ZDHHCs), particularly ZDHHC2, in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, ZDHHC2 deficiency in mouse macrophages impaired the immunity against M. tuberculosis and reduced the production of various proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of ZDHHC2 in mediating the palmitoylation of B-RAF and C-RAF, affecting their autophagic degradation and stabilizing protein levels. The increased abundance of B-RAF and C-RAF subsequently increases the activity of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, affecting the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages. These findings suggest that ZDHHC2 is a potential target for treating tuberculosis.",

Our findings reveal previously unrecognized threats to exploited and endangered fishes and marine mammals, exposing noteworthy gaps in existing management and recovery strategies. By integrating the less obvious yet no less substantial effects arising from species interactions into cumulative effects assessments, our approach provides a robust tool to guide more comprehensive and effective management and conservation efforts for marine species.",

In this study, we find that both preclinical murine and clinically available human PD-L1 antibodies limit DC migration. We show that cis interactions between PD-L1 and CD80 are critical for promoting migration and define specific regions within these proteins necessary for migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 significantly impedes DC migration in a B16 melanoma tumor model. Last, we outline how blocking cis PD-L1:CD80 interactions or mutation of the intracellular domain of PD-L1, in an imiquimod-induced murine model of psoriasis, limits DC migration to the lymph node, decreases interleukin-17 production by CD4 + T cells in the lymph node, and reduces epidermal thickening.

          "abstract": "Through selective breeding, humans have driven exceptional morphological diversity in domestic dogs, creating more than 200 recognized breeds developed for specialized functional tasks such as herding, protection, and hunting. Here, we use three-dimensional reconstructions of dog skulls to ask whether these function-oriented kennel-club groups reflect differences in morphology that correspond to those functions. We analyzed 117 canid skulls, representing 40 domestic dog breeds and 18 wild subspecies, using geometric morphometric techniques and k -means clustering. Results show near-full overlap in kennel-club groups and with natural species, except for companion dogs having extreme snout shape. When categorized by task-specific historic function (i.e., bite work and scent work), this morphology overlap remains. These results indicate that, despite producing extreme morphological diversity, humans have not produced breeds specialized for functional tasks.",

However, accurate measurement remains challenging, particularly in countries such as India where ground monitors are scarce despite high expected exposure and health burdens. This lack of precise measurements impedes understanding of changes in pollution exposure over time and across populations. Here, we develop open-source daily fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) datasets at a 10-kilometer resolution for India from 2005 to 2023 using a two-stage machine learning model validated on held-out monitor data. Analyzing long-term air quality trends, we find that PM 2.5 concentrations increased across most of the country until around 2016 and then declined partly due to favorable meteorology in southern India. Recent reductions in PM 2.5 were substantially larger in wealthier areas, highlighting the urgency of air quality control policies addressing all socioeconomic communities. To advance equitable air quality monitoring, we propose additional monitor locations in India and examine the adaptability of our method to other countries with scarce monitoring data.",

However, direct optical inspection of integrated chips remains a missing metrology gap that hinders quick feedback between design and fabrications. Here, we demonstrate that photothermal nonlinear scattering microscopy can be used for direct imaging and resolving of integrated optoelectronic chips beyond the diffraction limit. We reveal that the inherent coupling among deep-subwavelength nanostructures supporting leaky resonances allows for the pronounced heating effect to access reversible nonlinear modulations of the confocal reflection intensity, yielding optical resolving power down to 80 nm (~λ/7). The versatility of this approach has been exemplified by imaging silicon grating couplers and metalens with minimum critical dimensions of 100 nm, as well as central processing unit chip with 45-nm technology, unfolding the long-sought possibility of in situ, nondestructive, high-throughput optical inspection of integrated optoelectronic and nanophotonic chips.",

Although the incorporation of dynamic interactions enhances self-healing capabilities, it simultaneously weakens the hydrogels’ strength. External stimuli such as heating, while accelerating the healing process, may also lead to dehydration. Developing a stable repair strategy that combines rapid healing and high mechanical strength is challenging. Here, we introduce “salt-welding” for high-strength hydrogels with rapid room temperature self-healing. This is achieved through dynamic borate ester bonds in a salt-responsive poly(methacrylamide) hydrogel. The process involves “salt-fusion” to convert fractures into a viscous liquid for swift healing, followed by “salt-concretion” to toughen the hydrogel. The hydrogels achieve a posthealing strength of 23 megapascals in 95 minutes at room temperature, with near 100% healing efficiency. Leveraging their tunable mechanical strength and rapid healing rate, the hydrogel can be tailored for applications as a reparable wear-resistant material and damping device.",

Most existing approaches addressing this trade-off require controlled “labels,” i.e., metamaterials or contrast agents, to be deposited close to the objects and to either remain static or be tracked precisely during imaging. We propose a “blind-label” approach for acoustic subwavelength imaging. The blind labels are randomly distributed acoustic scatterers with deep-subwavelength sizes whose exact locations and trajectories are not necessary information in image reconstruction. The proposed method achieves the resolution of 0.24 wavelengths in ultrasound imaging experiments and 0.2 wavelengths in simulations, providing over 10 times improvement compared to the diffraction limit. We also elucidate the influence of scatterer size and concentration on imaging performance. The proposed “blind-label” approach relaxes the restrictions of existing acoustic subwavelength imaging technologies relying on controlled labels, therefore substantially improving the practicality of acoustic subwavelength imaging in biomedical ultrasound imaging, sonar, and nondestructive testing.",

We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe 2 ) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~20 moiré cells. Unexpectedly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd 7 MoTe 2 superconductor. In addition, the critical current further exhibits a notable V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe 2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moiré junctions.

Immunocompromised individuals from conditions such as primary immune disorders, HIV, or posttransplant immunosuppressive therapies are particularly vulnerable because of EBV’s transformative capability. EBV remodels B cell metabolism to support energy, biosynthetic precursors, and redox equivalents necessary for transformation. Most EBV-driven metabolic pathways center on mitochondria. However, how EBV regulates B cell mitochondrial function and metabolic fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that EBV boosts cardiolipin (CL) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial cristae biogenesis, via EBV nuclear antigen 2/MYC-induced CL enzyme transactivation. Pharmacological and CRISPR genetic analyses underscore the essentiality of CL biosynthesis in EBV-transformed B cells. Metabolomic and isotopic tracing highlight CL’s role in sustaining respiration, one-carbon metabolism, and aspartate synthesis. Disrupting CL biosynthesis destabilizes mitochondrial matrix enzymes pivotal to these pathways. We demonstrate EBV-induced CL metabolism as a therapeutic target, offering synthetic lethal strategies against EBV-associated B cell malignancies.",

These capsule flippases collectively transport more than 100 types of capsule precursors. To determine whether they can substitute for one another, we developed a high-throughput approach to systematically examine nearly 6000 combinations of flippases and substrates. CPS flippases fall into three groups: relaxed, type-specific, and strictly specific. Cargo size and CPS acetylation affect transport, and we isolated additional gain-of-function flippase variants that can substitute for the peptidoglycan flippase YtgP (MurJ). We also showed that combining flippase variants in a single cassette allows various CPS precursors to be flipped, which may aid glycoengineering.

While extensive research has explored cellular responses to hypoxia, understanding how cells respond to physiologically high O 2 levels remains uncertain. To address this problem, we investigated respiratory epithelia as their contact with air exposes them to some of the highest O 2 levels in the body. We asked how the O 2 level in air controls differentiation of airway basal stem cells into the ciliated epithelial cells essential for clearing airborne pathogens from the lung. Through a metabolomics screen and 13 C tracing on primary cultures of human airway basal cells, we found that the O 2 level in air directs ciliated cell differentiation by increasing mitochondrial citrate export. Unexpectedly, disrupting mitochondrial citrate export elicited hypoxia transcriptional responses independently of HIF1α stabilization and at O 2 levels that would be hyperoxic for most tissues. These findings identify mitochondrial citrate export as a cellular mechanism for responding to physiologically high O 2 levels.",

Our recent studies revealed that promoter-proximal Pol II is destabilized via the ubiquitin E3 ligase cullin 3 (CUL3) upon loss of transcription elongation factor SPT5. Here, we investigate how CUL3 recognizes chromatin-bound Pol II as a substrate. Using an unbiased proteomic screening approach, we identify armadillo repeat-containing 5 (ARMC5) as a CUL3 adaptor required for VCP/p97-dependent degradation of SPT5-depleted, chromatin-bound Pol II. Genome-wide analyses indicate that ARMC5 targets promoter-proximal Pol II in a BTB domain–dependent manner. Further biochemical analysis demonstrates that interaction between ARMC5 and Pol II requires the transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), supporting a phospho-dependent degradation model. We propose that defective, promoter-proximal Pol II that lacks SPT5 is rapidly eliminated from chromatin in a noncanonical early termination pathway that requires CDK9-dependent interaction with the CUL3-ARMC5 ubiquitin ligase complex.",

A combined two-layer bi-kinase/substrate phospho-code allows for sensitized signaling initiation already by near-resting elevations of Ca 2+ concentration. Subsequently, it facilitates further signal wave proliferation with minimal Ca 2+ amplitude requirement, triggering protective defense responses throughout the plant.

Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories, as in a single-dial combination lock, while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.",

Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future.",

Our results indicate that packing domains are not physical manifestation of TADs. Using electron microscopy, we found that only 20% of packing domains are lost upon RAD21 depletion. The effect of RAD21 depletion is restricted to small, poorly packed (nascent) packing domains. In addition, we present evidence that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion generates nascent domains that undergo maturation through nucleosome posttranslational modifications.

However, little is known for the X chromosome’s impact on the brain anatomy, microstructure, and functional networks. We examined 1045 complex brain imaging traits from 38,529 participants in the UK Biobank. We unveiled potential autosome–X chromosome interactions while proposing an atlas outlining dosage compensation for brain imaging traits. Through extensive association studies, we identified 72 genome-wide significant trait-locus pairs (including 29 new associations) that share genetic architectures with brain-related disorders, notably schizophrenia. Furthermore, we found unique sex-specific associations and assessed variations in genetic effects between sexes. Our research offers critical insights into the X chromosome’s role in the human brain, underscoring its contribution to the differences observed in brain structure and functionality between sexes.",

To resolve this, we interrogate an interval from ~527 to 519 Ma, encompassing multiple proposed global oceanic oxygenation events. We integrate the spatial and temporal distribution of shallow water, in situ reef metazoans, and trilobites, with high-resolution multi-proxy redox data through the highly biodiverse Siberian Platform. We document primarily dysoxic water column conditions, suggesting that early Cambrian metazoans, including motile skeletal benthos, had low oxygen demands. We further document oxygenation events coincident with positive carbon isotope excursions that led to modestly elevated oxygen levels. These events correspond to regional increases in species richness and habitat expansion of mainly endemic species, offering a potentially globally applicable model for biodiversification during the Cambrian Radiation.",

Subcutaneous transplantation of islets with R-VECs reversed hyperglycemia in diabetic mice, with high levels of human insulin detected within recipient serum and relapses of hyperglycemia following graft removal. Examination of retrieved grafts demonstrated that engrafted human islets were mainly vascularized by the cotransplanted R-VECs, which had anastomosed with the host microcirculation. Notably, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that R-VECs, when cocultured with islets, acquired islet EC-specific characteristics.

Our findings reveal that regional estimates substantially understate sea level rise in parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, projecting more than double the expected rise by 2050. Additionally, temporally variable (nonlinear) VLM, driven by factors such as hydrocarbon and groundwater extraction, can increase uncertainties in 2050 projections by up to 0.4 meters in certain areas of Los Angeles and San Diego.

An intriguing application of such soft robot control is to mimic whiskers and digitize soft body motion through whisker dynamics. The challenge herein is to simultaneously monitor the directions, speed, force, and slip information of the whisker motion. The existing whisker-like sensors cannot detect slip information effectively. To address this challenge, this study develops a multitasking electronic brush (e-brush) composed of bundle of whiskers powered by reservoir computing (RC). Four pressure sensors are integrated into the brush to monitor its motion, speed, force, slip, and target surface. These sensors can provide long-term, low-pressure detection as low as 50 pascals, allowing for the precise monitoring of brush movements. A RC algorithm is developed to extract multiple brush motion parameters, including the slip. As a proof of concept for multitasking e-brush, the motion trajectory of handwriting is successfully detected.",

Under unstressed conditions, the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) in clade A interact with and inhibit SnRK2s in subgroup III, which are released from the PP2C inhibition via pyrabactin resistance 1–like (PYL) abscisic acid receptors. However, how SnRK2s are released under osmotic stress is unclear. Here, we outline how subgroup I SnRK2s sense molecular crowding to interrupt PP2C-mediated inhibition in plants. Severe hyperosmotic stress triggers condensate formation to activate the subgroup I SnRK2s, which requires their intrinsically disordered region. PP2Cs interact with and inhibit subgroup I SnRK2s, and this interaction is disrupted by phase separation of SnRK2s. The subgroup I SnRK2s are critical for severe osmotic stress responses. Our findings elucidate a mechanism for how macromolecular crowding is sensed in plants and demonstrate that physical separation of signaling molecules can segregate negative regulators to initiate signaling.",

This study investigates the anti-icing properties of polar bear fur. Here, we show that polar bear fur exhibits low ice adhesion strengths comparable to fluorocarbon-coated fibers, with the low ice adhesion a consequence of the fur sebum (hair grease). Lipid analyses reveal the presence of cholesterol, diacylglycerols, anteisomethyl-branched fatty acids, and the unexpected absence of squalene. Quantum chemical calculations predict low ice adsorption energies for identified lipids and high adsorption for squalene, suggesting that sebum composition is responsible for the observed anti-icing properties.

Here, we demonstrate that infection of leafhopper vectors with rice orange leaf phytoplasma (ROLP) activates the mild melanization response in hemolymph. ROLP-encoded effector protein SRP1 is highly expressed in leafhopper hemolymph, where it competitively binds to SP2, thereby inhibiting SP2-mediated cleavage of prophenoloxidase into active phenoloxidase. Consequently, microinjection of SRP1 effectively suppresses the melanization response and enhances ROLP propagation. The histidine residue at position 23 of SRP1 is essential for SRP1-SP2 interaction, and the mutation of this position abolishes its ability to inhibit such SP2-meidated cleavage, ultimately promoting melanization response and inhibiting ROLP propagation.

This constraint cannot be overcome without using a quantum resource. Here, we show that this constraint can be overcome using a two-mode squeezed state. Quantum-correlated ultrashort pulses, generated by parametric down-conversion, enhance the sensitivity of far-infrared detection beyond the classical limit, achieving a twofold reduction in measured noise.

To shed light on the evolutionary emergence of the vertebrate brain, we compared anterior neuroectoderm development across deuterostome species, using available single-cell datasets from sea urchin, amphioxus, and zebrafish embryos. We identified a conserved gene co-expression module, comparable to the anterior gene regulatory network (aGRN) controlling apical organ development in ambulacrarians, and spatially mapped it by multiplexed in situ hybridization to the developing retina and hypothalamus of chordates. Using functional approaches, we show Wnt signaling regulating this co-expression module in amphioxus, like the aGRN in echinoderms, and that its overactivation suppresses forebrain identity. This suggests a previously undescribed role for Wnt signaling in amphioxus in determining the position of the forebrain. We propose this Wnt-regulated gene co-expression module as a possible mechanism by which the brain set antero-dorsally early in chordate evolution.",

          "abstract": "Heteroarene skeletal editing is gaining popularity in synthetic chemistry. Transmuting single atoms generates molecules that have distinctly varied properties, thereby fostering potent molecular exchanges that can be extensively used to synthesize functional molecules. Herein, we present a convenient protocol for nitrogen-carbon single-atom transmutations in isoquinolines, which is inspired by the Wittig reaction and enables easy access to substituted naphthalene derivatives. The reaction uses an inexpensive and commercially available phosphonium ylide as the carbon source to furnish a wide range of substituted naphthalenes. The key to the success of this transformation is the formation of a triene intermediate through ring opening, which undergoes 6π-electrocyclization and elimination processes to afford the naphthalene product. Furthermore, this strategy enables the facile synthesis of 13 C-labeled naphthalenes using 13 CH 3 PPh 3 I as a commercial 13 C source and facilitates modifying the directing group for C─H functionalization.",

          "abstract": "Quantum simulators with hundreds of qubits and engineerable Hamiltonians have the potential to explore quantum many-body models that are intractable for classical computers. However, learning the simulated Hamiltonian, a prerequisite for any quantitative applications of a quantum simulator, remains an outstanding challenge due to the fast increasing time cost with the qubit number and the lack of high-fidelity universal gate operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we demonstrate the Hamiltonian learning of a two-dimensional ion trap quantum simulator with 300 qubits. We use global manipulations and single-qubit–resolved state detection to efficiently learn the all-to-all–coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum resources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number. We further demonstrate a physically guided learning scheme with the quantum sample complexity independent of system sizes by carefully fitting the anharmonic trap potential. Our work paves the way for wide applications of large-scale ion trap quantum simulators.",

          "abstract": "Ice core measurements reveal dipole-like snow accumulation trends over West Antarctica throughout the 20th century, with an increase of &gt;2000 billion metric tons over the Antarctic Peninsula and Ellsworth Land but a decrease of ~500 billion metric tons over Marie Byrd Land. Although atmospheric teleconnections were frequently revealed, linking variability between tropics and higher latitudes on interannual and decadal timescales, centennial-scale teleconnection is absent from literature. Here, using statistical analysis and numerical experiments, we reveal that changes of tropical oceans throughout the 20th century drive the long-term Antarctic snowfall trend. A pronounced warming over the tropical Atlantic and a moderate cooling over the equatorial Pacific have driven an adjustment of moisture transport and thus snowfall pattern in West Antarctica. Our study reveals a centennial tropical-polar teleconnection, producing long-term trends with opposing changes across the regions. Remote forcing from the tropics increased the mass accumulation over Antarctica, balanced rapid iceshelf thinning in recent decades, contributing to global sea-level changes.",

          "abstract": "Ketogenesis is a dynamic metabolic conduit supporting hepatic fat oxidation particularly when carbohydrates are in short supply. Ketone bodies may be recycled into anabolic substrates, but a physiological role for this process has not been identified. Here, we use mass spectrometry–based 13 C-isotope tracing and shotgun lipidomics to establish a link between hepatic ketogenesis and lipid anabolism. Unexpectedly, mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consumed ketone bodies to support fatty acid biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) elongation. While an acetoacetate intermediate was not absolutely required for ketone bodies to source DNL, PUFA elongation required activation of acetoacetate by cytosolic acetoacetyl–coenzyme A synthetase (AACS). Moreover, AACS deficiency diminished free and esterified PUFAs in hepatocytes, while ketogenic insufficiency depleted PUFAs and increased liver triacylglycerols. These findings suggest that hepatic ketogenesis influences PUFA metabolism, representing a molecular mechanism through which ketone bodies could influence systemic physiology and chronic diseases.",
