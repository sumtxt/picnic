          "authors": "Jacob N. Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Large-scale, centrally funded measurement systems on the economy, education, the environment, and public health enable rapid scientific research and support robust policy feedback. They provide frameworks for assessing policy effectiveness, flagging emerging problems, and informing planning processes. The online information environment—a critical domain of human interaction—has not yet been similarly instrumented. This article first reviews key measurements in other domains and outlines why existing tools for studying online environments are insufficient. It then lays out the consequences of the measurement gap, identifies key data-collection tasks, discusses the scale of resources required to meet them, and addresses the implications of generative AI for the instrumentation task. I argue that modest but strategic investments in scaled measurement infrastructure could unlock transformative research capabilities and facilitate an evidence-driven approach to policymaking that could improve how we govern online spaces.",

          "authors": "Baron L. Pineda",
          "abstract": "Technological advancements in internet communications have led to changes in how young people’s behavior is monitored and shaped in their families and schools. The debate about the impacts of the rise of internet use and the creation of a new generation of digital natives is polarized: Some believe that internet restrictions on youth are undemocratic and counterproductive, and others connect internet use to social problems among youth—such as shortened attention spans, apathy, and increased vulnerability to predatory behavior. This article analyzes life history interviews of young people that focus on their use of technology and how it is regulated by their parents. I show how the social norms associated with the digital lives of youth can vary and evolve, often in unpredictable ways. This suggests that governance efforts likely need to be dynamic and capable of changing in ways that keep pace with new forms of sociality.",

          "title": "The Myths of Platform Governance: How Tech Works to Create Online Trust and Safety",
          "authors": "Sudhir Venkatesh",
          "abstract": "Platform governance is often conceptualized in terms of external rules or algorithmic systems. This article shifts the analytic focus inward, examining how governance teams within technology firms create social order through their everyday practices. Drawing on organizational sociology and cultural analysis, I argue that internal governance is shaped less by formal policy than by the underlying “myths” that structure how practitioners understand harm, responsibility, and effectiveness. These organizational myths—rooted in engineering culture and reinforced by institutional routines—shape not only how governance work is carried out, but also what counts as legitimate intervention. By analyzing the symbolic and practical dimensions of governance labor, I show how cultural logics embedded within platform teams produce specific orientations to risk, fairness, and authority. Understanding these logics is essential for researchers and practitioners seeking to explain—and ultimately influence—the ways in which social order is maintained online.",

          "authors": "Toby Shulruff",
          "abstract": "Policymakers struggle to craft effective strategies for governing online platforms. Their efforts are often referred to as attempts to regulate “black-boxed” tech in a sector that has long been described as the “Wild West.” But historical perspectives from practitioners in the trust and safety field offer a more nuanced understanding. Data from the History of Trust and Safety Project reveal that governance precedents and cross-sectoral initiatives date back at least two decades and address issues including fraud, spam, child sexual abuse material, and extremist content. This collaborative work occurred in and among government agencies, media, civil society organizations, academia, and the platforms themselves. The Wild West and black-box metaphors are not helpful points of departure for regulatory debates with decades-old precedents. Governance should be informed by what has been tried before and by a clearer understanding of the technical and social forces that have shaped the present state of play.",

          "abstract": "Platform governance that is driven by external policymakers and researchers is often disconnected from how and when technology companies actually make decisions about their products. This misalignment creates challenges for meaningful oversight and regulation, as external actors cannot see the internal processes that shape platform design and governance. This article explores the internal dynamics of product development, from prototyping through iteration, and how governance considerations are incorporated or excluded at various stages. Arguing for a reintegration of social science and academic expertise into product decision-making, I propose an updated framework that bridges external governance objectives with the realities of platform power and product design.",

          "abstract": "Social media data have become a mainstay of social science research since the first application programming interfaces (APIs) debuted in the mid-2000s. Over time, platforms have radically altered their data offerings, substantially determining the kinds of research that can be conducted. This article presents historical and normative analyses of the current state of platform data precarity, defined by Freelon (2018) as the post-API age . We recount a periodized history of social media data access spanning nearly 20 years, characterize the data access options currently offered by six prominent platforms, and make recommendations for improving platform data access. Our primary aim is to help social media researchers understand how access to social media data has evolved over the years and consider how platforms might help them conduct more rigorous research moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Prominent online platforms have recently engaged in highly visible pullbacks in their commitments to promoting purpose-driven organizational cultures and to developing diverse workforces. These changes have been framed as a move back to a profit-centered business model, but they have also been perceived as government regulation in decline. We argue that there is strong evidence that associates purpose-driven organizational cultures and diverse workforces with organizational vitality, profitability, and growth. The association holds for organizations generally but is particularly true for online platforms, whose success is linked to innovation and change. Thus, there is a strong bottom-line business argument for creating and sustaining purpose-driven organizational cultures and for developing diverse workforces, irrespective of whether they are mandated by external authorities.",

          "abstract": "Middleware is software that can give users increased control over their social media experience, allowing them to protect their privacy, customize their recommendations, and understand the spread and impact of content they create. We believe middleware could complement policy efforts and reforms made by social media platforms to improve user experiences on social media, while avoiding freedom of expression questions that plague the regulation of online platforms. We describe and examine middleware as it exists in the world, demonstrating that even while middleware is a viable solution to some contemporary problems attendant to social media, there are still open questions about who middleware helps and who it harms. We suggest Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation of middleware and show that U.S. Code 47 section 230(b) anticipated categories of middleware that would be protective of users’ control over their online experiences.",

          "abstract": "Concerned about the power that social media now wield, a chorus of tech-minded reformers have called for a return to the internet’s foundational design principles of interoperability and end-user control. This group argues for “middleware”—online tools like browser extensions and consumer-facing protocols that would enable people to take control of their online experiences across the web. This article argues that the campaign for middleware is laudable but mostly speculative and inapposite. It proceeds on the disproven theory that consumers can control their online experiences in today’s networked information economy. As such, it distracts reformers from solutions that would redress the structural asymmetries that define today’s market for consumer-facing services, including social media. This article argues that it is time to give up the illusory promise of user control and attend above all to enacting enforceable restrictions on service designs and commercial surveillance practices.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of user engagement has dominated debate over the governance of online platforms, and critics use the term to assign crass commercial interests to social media companies. We argue that social media engagement is a multifaceted ideal that serves both economic and ideological functions for platforms. We show how Facebook’s early leadership used the concept to reconcile the competing demands of expansion, revenue generation, and community-building. In doing so, they synthesized three distinct ideas: the Silicon Valley belief that network expansion correlated with network strength , the ad industry’s contention that media should promote emotional investment from viewers, and the academic claim that civic participation is the most important democratic virtue. Even as the contradictions that these claims yield have come to the foreground, the multiple logics of engagement have proven difficult to evade, and it continues to shape discussions of platform governance.",

          "abstract": "I examine the relationship between social media platforms and news organizations as it has evolved over the past two decades, showing that platform governance has affected individual users and news publishers in ways that often result in damage to democratic societies. I argue that the contraction of traditional journalism and rise of democratic backsliding around the globe call for a reconsideration of platform governance models that might help to reinvigorate news production. A better synthesis of traditional journalism’s public interest values and social media’s engagement model requires a restructuring of platform algorithms that focuses on long-term user value, enhanced press freedom protections, and renewed economic support for news production. Supporting news represents a global imperative as democratic stability becomes increasingly threatened, social media companies come under increasing strain and scrutiny as public actors, and generative AI further imperils news production.",

          "abstract": "The dynamic three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human genome (the 4D nucleome) is linked to genome function. Here we describe efforts by the 4D Nucleome Project 1 to map and analyse the 4D nucleome in widely used H1 human embryonic stem cells and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We produced and integrated diverse genomic datasets of the 4D nucleome, each contributing unique observations, which enabled us to assemble extensive catalogues of more than 140,000 looping interactions per cell type, to generate detailed classifications and annotations of chromosomal domain types and their subnuclear positions, and to obtain single-cell 3D models of the nuclear environment of all genes including their long-range interactions with distal elements. Through extensive benchmarking, we describe the unique strengths of different genomic assays for studying the 4D nucleome, providing guidelines for future studies. Three-dimensional models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure showed connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription and DNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, which will facilitate the discovery of potential effects of genetic variants, including variants associated with disease, on genome structure and function.",

          "abstract": "The development of complex multicellular human in vitro systems holds great promise for modelling disease and advancing drug discovery and tissue engineering 1 . In the liver, despite the identification of key signalling pathways involved in hepatic regeneration 2,3 , in vitro expansion of human hepatocytes directly from fresh patient tissue has not yet been achieved, limiting the possibility of modelling liver composite structures in vitro. Here we first developed human hepatocyte organoids (h-HepOrgs) from 28 different patients. Patient-derived hepatocyte organoids sustained long-term expansion of hepatocytes in vitro and maintained patient-specific gene expression and bile canaliculus features and function of the in vivo tissue. After transplantation, expanded h-HepOrgs rescued the phenotype of a mouse model of liver disease. By combining h-HepOrgs with portal mesenchyme and our previously published cholangiocyte organoids 4–6 , we generated patient-specific periportal liver assembloids that retain the histological arrangement, gene expression and cell interactions of periportal liver tissue, with cholangiocytes and mesenchyme embedded in the hepatocyte parenchyma. We leveraged this platform to model aspects of biliary fibrosis. Our human periportal liver assembloid system represents a novel in vitro platform to investigate human liver pathophysiology, accelerate drug development, enable early diagnosis and advance personalized medicine.",

          "abstract": "Ageing erodes human immunity, in part by reshaping the T cell repertoire, leading to increased vulnerability to infection, malignancy and vaccine failure 1–3 . Attempts to rejuvenate immune function have yielded only modest results and are limited by toxicity or lack of clinical feasibility 1,3–5 . Here we show that the liver can be transiently repurposed to restore age-diminished immune cues and improve T cell function in aged mice. These immune cues were found by performing multi-omic mapping across central and peripheral niches in young and aged animals, leading to the identification of Notch and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) pathways, together with interleukin-7 (IL-7) signalling, as declining with age. Delivery of mRNAs encoding Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), FLT3L and IL-7 to hepatocytes expanded common lymphoid progenitors, boosted de novo thymopoiesis without affecting haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) composition, and replenished T cells while enhancing dendritic cell abundance and function. Treatment with these mRNAs improved peptide vaccine responses and restored antitumour immunity in aged mice by increasing tumour-specific CD8 + infiltration and clonal diversity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. These effects were reversible after dosing ceased and did not breach self-tolerance, in contrast to the inflammatory and autoimmune liabilities of recombinant cytokine treatments 6,7 . These findings underscore the promise of mRNA-based strategies for systemic immune modulation and highlight the potential of interventions aimed at preserving immune resilience in ageing populations.",

          "authors": "Richard Wolff, Nandita R. Garud",
          "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species that are continually evolving within and across hosts 1,2 . The ability to identify adaptations common to many human gut microbiomes would show not only shared selection pressures across hosts but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, the extent to which adaptations have spread across human gut microbiomes is relatively unknown. Here we develop a new selection scan statistic named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) that can detect sweeps of adaptive alleles spreading across host microbiomes by migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with a beneficial variant. Application of the statistic to around 30 of the most prevalent commensal gut species from 24 human populations around the world showed more than 300 selective sweeps across species. We find an enrichment for selective sweeps at loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism, indicative of adaptation to host diet, and we find that the targets of selection differ significantly between industrialized populations and non-industrialized populations. One of these sweeps is at a locus known to be involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin—a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of industrialized diets. In summary, our results indicate that recombination between strains fuels pervasive adaptive evolution among human gut commensal bacteria, and strongly implicate host diet and lifestyle as critical selection pressures.",

          "abstract": "Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds 1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control 3 . By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control 4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms 5 . An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.",

Recent blood-based biomarkers enable scalable assessment of ADNCs 1 . Here we measured phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 in 11,486 plasma samples from a Norwegian population-based cohort of individuals over 57 years of age as a surrogate marker for ADNCs. The estimated prevalence of ADNCs increased with age, from less than 8% in people 58–69.9 years of age to 65.2% in those over 90 years of age. Among participants aged 70 years or older, 10% had preclinical Alzheimer’s disease, 10.4% had prodromal Alzheimer’s disease and 9.8% had Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Furthermore, among those 70 years of age or older, ADNCs were present in 60% of people with dementia, in 32.6% of those with mild cognitive impairment and in 23.5% of the cognitively unimpaired group. Our findings suggest a higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease dementia in older individuals and a lower prevalence of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in younger groups than previously estimated 2 .",

          "abstract": "The human reproductive tract is essential for species perpetuation and overall health. Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, the disruption of which can cause lifelong issues, including infertility 1–5 . Here we present an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development to provide insights beyond those that are possible with smaller-scale, organ-focused studies. We describe potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs and pinpoint previously unknown genes involved in Müllerian duct emergence and regression and urethral canalization of the penis. By combining histological features with gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, we define transcription factors and signalling events potentially involved in the regionalization of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. We also refine how the HOX code is established in distinct reproductive organs and reveal that the expression of thoracic HOX genes is increased in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our findings further indicate that epithelial regionalization of the fallopian tube and epididymis, which probably contribute to sperm maturation and capacitation, is established during development. By contrast, later events are necessary for regionalization of the uterocervical canal epithelium. Finally, on the basis of single-cell data and fetal-derived organoids, we show that the fetal uterine epithelium is vulnerable to oestrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalization and differentiation at the cellular level, our study provides valuable insights into causes and potential treatments of developmental reproductive disorders.",

          "abstract": "A collaborative group can often outperform a single individual in complex problem solving, even when information is limited. This phenomenon, called collective intelligence, can be achieved by engineering a central planner who assigns subtasks distributed across the group. But such algorithms cannot explain how natural populations, which often lack sophisticated central control, can nonetheless evolve collective intelligence. In fact, the process of social learning by imitating successful peers will typically reduce diversity and inhibit collective intelligence. Here, we consider a prediction task where the true outcome each round is a continuous quantity that depends linearly on a large number of random causal factors. Each individual can observe only one factor, and the collective prediction is generated by aggregating personal predictions across individuals. We propose two classes of reward structures that guarantee the emergence of collective intelligence through social learning. One scheme provides greater rewards to those individuals (called experts) whose personal predictions are more accurate. The other scheme provides greater rewards to those individuals (called reformers) whose predictions have greater potential to reduce the collective error, even though their personal predictions may be far from the truth. Although both of these payoff structures can provably maintain diversity and establish collective intelligence, we show that rewards based on collective error are more robust to diverse problem settings than rewards based on personal accuracy. Our results show that identifying reformers is more effective than identifying experts in promoting the emergence of collective intelligence.",

Urban dark-eyed juncos differ in bill shape and size in Los Angeles in comparison to local wildlands. We measured juncos that hatched before, during, and after COVID-19 restrictions at a Los Angeles college campus. Birds that hatched during and soon after COVID-19 restrictions had bills that resembled those of local wildland birds. Yet, bills rapidly returned to pre-COVID-19 morphology in birds hatched in the years following pandemic restrictions. Thus, human activity (and lack thereof) underlies rapid morphological change in an urban bird.",

Though seasonal variation in cognitive performance is often attributed to “forgetting” of learned material, no large-scale studies have systematically investigated seasonal variation in general cognitive skills (e.g., executive functioning) on standardized laboratory-based assessments in school-age youth compared to adults. Across four datasets with geographic, demographic, mental health, and measurement variation (total n = 23,251), we quantify cyclical, seasonal variation in children’s cognitive performance using generalized additive models with cyclic cubic splines. In school-age children but not young adults, we found consistent cognitive performance minima following school vacation (July–September in the United States; November–January in Singapore) across nearly all cognitive domains investigated. These results demonstrate a generalizable small-magnitude effect of lower cognitive performance aligning with school vacation even after adjusting for socioeconomic status or ADHD diagnosis. We contextualize summer cognitive minima relative to environmental and developmental effects, noting that the largest effect size is still seven times smaller than effects of the socioeconomic environment on cognition, and provide recommendations for future data collection and analysis of behavior across the calendar year.",

It develops a formal framework that accounts for how climate change has affected each county’s economy by altering current and past weather, both locally and elsewhere around the country. The results show that climate change is already reducing annual U.S. income by 0.32% [95% CI: −0.17 to 0.82%] by altering counties’ current, local temperatures, with losses concentrated in the Great Plains and Midwest. Accounting for effects on past temperatures and on temperatures in other counties increases income losses to 12% [2.0 to 22%] and makes them more widely distributed, with suggestive evidence that trade networks propagate effects around the United States. Central estimates can change with different indices of nonlocal weather or models of cross-county heterogeneity. Calculations like those developed here could be updated annually as a way of measuring and communicating the progress of climate change.",

While static-network analyses offer valuable insights, understanding how structure and function coevolve under external interventions is critical for explaining system-level adaptation. Using a unique dataset of clandestine criminal networks, we combine empirical observations with computational modeling to test the impact of various interventions on network adaptation. Our analysis examines how networks with specialized roles adapt and form emergent structures to optimize cost–benefit trade-offs. We find that emergent sparsely connected networks exhibit greater resilience, revealing a security–efficiency trade-off. Notably, interventions can trigger a “criminal opacity amplification” effect, where criminal activity increases despite reduced network visibility. While node isolation fragments networks, it strengthens remaining active ties. In contrast, increasing a node’s connectivity (analogous to social reintegration) can unintentionally boost criminal coordination, increasing activity or connectivity. Failed interventions often lead to temporary functional surges before reverting to baseline. Surprisingly, stimulating connectivity destabilizes networks. Effective interventions require precise calibration to node roles, connection types, and external conditions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about connectivity and intervention efficacy in complex adaptive systems across diverse domains.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin, a hormone linked to reproduction and health, may mediate life-history trade-offs across the human life course. Yet, how oxytocin naturally varies with age remains poorly understood. Here, working with the Tsimane, forager-horticulturalists of lowland Bolivia, we collected the largest sample of oxytocin measurements to date (n = 1,242 samples, n = 405 individuals, age = 2 to 84 y, 51% female), and i) examined how oxytocin varies throughout the life course in females and males, and ii) investigated potential drivers of age- and sex-specific variation. Our sample provides rare insight into the relationship between oxytocin and age in a context where energy is limited and trade-offs between reproduction and somatic maintenance are more salient. We found that oxytocin follows a nonlinear sex-specific trajectory throughout the life course. In females, oxytocin levels were high during the reproductive years and declined in the early to midforties, a pattern largely explained by breastfeeding and, to a lesser extent, childcare and good self-rated health. In males, oxytocin was low in early adulthood but high in old age, and although higher oxytocin was linked to good self-rated health, this did not explain the rise in oxytocin in later life. These findings suggest that oxytocin is instrumental for reproduction and caregiving in females and may also be associated with health in both males and females. Together, our work highlights oxytocin’s broader biological significance across the human life course, suggesting that it may play a pivotal role in coordinating age- and sex-specific trade-offs involving reproduction and health.",

          "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is a key epigenetic modification that regulates transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression. While most current understanding of methylation-sensitive TF binding derives from studies focused exclusively on fully methylated CpG sites, alternative forms—such as non-CpG and hemimethylation—are increasingly recognized as widespread and functionally important, particularly in embryonic stem cells and neurons. However, the direct impact of these alternative methylation contexts on TF–DNA interactions remains poorly defined, largely because current binding assays introduce methylation enzymatically, which precludes strand-specific and position-resolved measurements. Here, we systematically profile the methylation sensitivity of 18 human TFs spanning 11 structural families using chemically synthesized DNA libraries containing position-specific 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in CpG, non-CpG, and hemimethylated contexts, measured via high-throughput protein-binding microarrays. Our results reveal extensive TF sensitivity to methylation state, position, and strand orientation, including strong binding of several TFs to non-CpG and hemimethylated sites. The presence of 5mC can dramatically alter TF–DNA interactions: transforming low-affinity sites into high-affinity ones by enabling new contacts or silencing otherwise favorable motifs through steric hindrance. Genomic analyses further show that the methylation-sensitive sequences identified in vitro are represented within enhancers and regulatory elements, exhibiting distinct methylation patterns across cell types. Together, our findings uncover a previously hidden layer of methylation-dependent TF–DNA recognition, broadening the understanding of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation.",

Recent work suggests that the function of enhancers is influenced by their genomic sequence context more than previously thought, further complicating our understanding of their contribution to diversity. To address these issues, we investigated the regulation of the RCO homeobox gene, which contributed to the evolution of complex leaves following its tandem duplication from LMI1 . By characterizing seventeen regulatory alleles at the LMI1 / RCO locus that we generated by genome editing, we found that the evolved RCO enhancer is subject to pronounced negative regulation that helps delimit the RCO expression domain. While the LMI1 enhancer was strictly required for LMI1 gene expression, the same was not true for the RCO enhancer, which caused only partial loss of function when deleted. We mapped both positively and negatively acting sequences within the RCO enhancer, validated them in reporter gene assays and showed that a repressive sequence arose in association with a nested duplication within the evolved RCO enhancer. This repressive sequence played a key role in shaping the specific RCO expression domain that underlies its role in leaf complexity, and we provide evidence that it helped to prevent potential pleiotropic effects arising from evolutionary diversification or RCO expression. Our findings highlight the regulatory features of a diversity-linked enhancer and show that the evolution of repressive sequences is a powerful force in regulatory evolution.",

The traditional elastic equations are correct to linear elastic order.

The earlier revision included volumetric nonlinear elasticity through the use of embedded coordinates and included the disregistry as well as removing the divergence. However, the revised model had a larger self-energy than the traditional model, which we now find to arise from similar divergent terms for the line force. The present model modifies the line force field to remove the divergent terms. The resultant total energy in the modified model has a lower energy than the traditional model.",

NCAM2 belongs to the Immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules with roles in intercellular adhesion and signaling.

          "abstract": "Directional sensing enables eukaryotic cells to detect spatial gradients of extracellular ligands, allowing them to orient and migrate within complex environments. Prevalent models explain this computation through a circuit where signaling species with distinct diffusion constants act incoherently on a downstream readout. Here, we propose a fundamentally different mechanism of directional sensing based on simple receptor-level processes. Our model integrates three ubiquitous receptor processes-lateral diffusion, basal ligand-independent activation, and active receptor degradation, THAT together synergize to generate robust directional sensing. In the absence of diffusion, active receptor degradation and basal activity implement an integral feedback that adapts active receptor levels to a ligand-independent set point while depleting receptors in relatively ligand-rich regions. Diffusion then redistributes receptors from regions of relatively low ligand exposure to regions with higher ligand exposure. This creates a spatial mismatch between activity and feedback that drives asymmetric receptor activity relative to the set point. The model predicts an optimal diffusion constant that maximizes polarization, reveals that receptors can encode relative rather than absolute ligand concentrations, and identifies the optimal basal activity that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in stochastic regimes. A survey of kinetic parameters across receptor families suggests that this diffusion-degradation synergy constitutes a broadly applicable, receptor-level mechanism for directional sensing.",

          "abstract": "Entry of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) into host cells is mediated by the viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc. Structural details and assembly mechanism of Gn and Gc on the surface of RVFV remain unclear. Here, we stabilized the GnGc with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody RVFV-140 and determined a near-atomic resolution structure of the GnGc hexamer in complex with the fragment antigen binding (Fab) domain of RVFV-140 (Fab140). Our structure showed that RVFV-140 recognizes a ternary epitope and crosslinks two adjacent Gn heads within the hexamer, thus preventing the prefusion to postfusion transition of the glycoproteins. The intraglycoprotein and interglycoprotein interactions within the GnGc hexamer involve van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which are mainly located between Gn heads, and Gn domain C and Gc domain III. Assembly of the GnGc hexamer requires dramatic conformational changes in the loops L231-L244, D280-Q286, Q380-D386, and A427-Y429 of Gn and the hinge region between domains I and II of Gc. The construction of viral capsomeres with the hexameric structure of recombinant GnGc shows that the capsomeres interact primarily through residues 693 to 713 in domain I of Gc. These interactions vary depending on the local environment of each capsomere.",

The two subsystems, R and S , interact with one another as they evolve under Hamiltonian or stochastic dynamics, without external intervention. In this setting, we must account for the backaction of S on R , which is absent in the nonautonomous setting.

          "abstract": "Surgery remains the mainstay treatment for many kinds of solid tumors, while tumor recurrence frequently occurs. Adjuvant therapy can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve the prognosis of surgery. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy can be leveraged as an alternative adjuvant therapy to clear residual cancer cells and prevent tumor recurrence. However, systemic administration of CAR-T often results in insufficient tumor infiltration and side effects to normal organs. Given that platelets can preferentially accumulate at postsurgical wounds, we proposed that conjugating platelets to CAR-T cells may enhance the accumulation of the CAR-T cells within the surgical bed after the resection of solid tumors. In this study, we conjugated platelets to B7-H3.CAR-T cells via click chemistry. In postsurgical human pancreatic cancer mouse models, platelet-CAR-T cells showed enhanced tumor infiltration and elevated antitumor cytokine levels, resulting in superior suppression effects on tumor recurrence, compared with CAR-T cells. Additionally, platelet-CAR-T cells showed enhanced efficacy in inhibiting metastasis and prolonging the survival time of the mice in postsurgical triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. Mechanistic studies revealed that platelet activation could improve the CAR-T cell activity and persistence, as evidenced by an upregulation of genes associated with T cell infiltration and a downregulation of genes related to T cell exhaustion. Finally, we further validated the biosafety profile and efficacy of platelet-CAR-T in a postsurgical patient-derived xenograft TNBC-bearing humanized mouse model. The results suggested that the CAR-T cell strengthened by platelet engineering is a promising adjuvant therapy against postsurgical tumor recurrence.",

          "abstract": "Interannually highly variable and synchronized production of large seed crops by perennial plants, called masting, drives resource pulses and famines with cascading effects on food webs. While the spatial scale of masting synchrony is well documented, it remains unclear how synchrony differs between years of seed abundance and failure, and how such dynamics extend across species and space. These gaps are important to resolve, as they determine the magnitude and spatial extent of masting effects on food webs. Using a 36-y dataset from 431 sites spanning seven dominant tree species in temperate Europe, we provide evidence that seed failures are more spatially synchronized than mast peaks, indicating that regional coherence in seed production is structured primarily by reproductive failure. Among-species synchrony was localized. This suggests that in temperate forests, mobile seed consumers are unlikely to experience coordinated starvation–satiation cycles, in contrast to highly synchronous tropical dipterocarp systems. From an applied perspective, failure years affect seed availability over broad regions, limiting sourcing options for afforestation and restoration, and underscoring the value of spatially explicit masting forecasting. Because mast peaks and failures differ fundamentally in their food web consequences, our findings highlight the need to better understand and anticipate the ecological impacts of synchronized seed scarcity.",

However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose a deep diffusion model for satellite data (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. Specifically, DDMS employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, achieving more accurate forecasts of convective growth and dissipation over longer lead times. Additionally, it combines geostationary satellite brightness temperature data and domain knowledge from meteorological experts, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves effective convection nowcasting up to 4 h, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km 2 ), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 min; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary games provide a flexible mathematical framework for many problems in biology and social evolution. Prisoners’ dilemma, and in particular, the important special case of donation games, represents social dilemmas where cooperation is mutually beneficial, yet defection is preferred by selfish agents. In evolutionary games on networks, the agents interact over a population structure. The existence of population structures that promote cooperative behavior is a fascinating and active research topic. Previous research establishes structures promoting cooperation in the limit of weak selection where the benefit-to-cost ratio β exceeds 1.5. The existence of such structures for medium and strong selection for 1 &lt; β &lt; 2 and for weak selection for 1 &lt; β &lt; 1.5 has been a long-standing open question. First, we answer the open questions in the affirmative: For every selection strength and every β &gt; 1 , we construct networks promoting cooperation. Second, we present a robustness result with respect to β and selection strength: Our structures promote cooperation for a range of these parameter values rather than specific parameter values. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with simulation results on small population structures that show the effectiveness of our construction over well-studied population structures.",

This study employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics, coupled with isotope labeling, to shed light on the metabolism of salicinoids—potent antiherbivore phenolic defenses present in the Salicaceae family—in the poplar-specialized leaf beetle, Chrysomela tremulae . C. tremulae was found to produce a range of metabolites from salicortin and utilize the essential amino acid tryptophan and its breakdown products, namely kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and 4-hydroxyquinoline, to form novel conjugates with the salicinoid metabolite saligenin, which are then excreted in the feces of the beetles. Saligenin and its conjugates are not toxic to C. tremulae and similar metabolic pathways were found in other poplar herbivores. Experimental analyses of the gut microbiota revealed that there is no microbial contribution to the formation of tryptophan metabolite–saligenin conjugates. The production of such substances by insect herbivores may be a critical adaptation that enables specialists to survive on a diet high in salicinoid defense compounds. Therefore, identifying the underlying detoxification mechanisms creates opportunities to develop targeted anti-insect agents for protecting salicaceous trees.",

This study introduces an approach by examining the temporal dynamics of brain functional networks postimplantation to identify predictors of outcomes and explore brain plasticity. Twenty-nine CI candidates and 23 normal-hearing individuals participated. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy measured brain activity during audio-only and visual-only speech tasks at 1 mo and 1 y postimplantation, with speech understanding assessed after 1 y. Brain community dynamics were analyzed using multilayer modularity and network switching rates to capture temporal reorganization. Lower network switching rates shortly after implantation were associated with better long-term speech performance. Evidence of cross-modal plasticity—reflecting preimplant neural reorganization—was observed in early recordings, indicated by increased module allegiance between the posterior temporal (PT) region and visual cortices, which diminished after 1 y. Additionally, interhemispheric connectivity in the PT showed significant improvement between sessions, reducing disparities between CI users and normal-hearing individuals. These findings highlight dynamic functional connectivity as a meaningful neural correlate of outcome variability, with potential relevance for guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies and optimizing auditory and speech outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Many regions of the world have seen an increase in highly destructive wildfires, driven by well-documented increases in burned area and growth of housing in the wildland–urban interface (WUI), which exposes more homes to fire. However, it is unclear whether wildfires are also becoming more destructive due to changes in wildfire behavior or in the development patterns of exposed communities. Here, we assessed trends in wildfire building exposure and destruction rates in the conterminous United States from 2002 to 2022. We mapped destroyed and surviving buildings within 100 m of all wildfires that destroyed 10 or more buildings (n = 362) and assessed trends relative to major ecoregions and vegetation types. We used logistic regression to assess relationships between destruction rates and landscape factors. We found that 10% of exposed buildings were destroyed in 2002–2012, but this percentage increased to 32% in 2013–2022. This increase was largely due to greater building exposure in evergreen forests in the northwestern United States, where exposed buildings were more than 3.4 times as likely to be destroyed as those in grass and shrublands. However, annual destruction rates also significantly increased in all other vegetation types and were correlated with development type, weather, and burn severity. These results indicate that increasing wildfire destruction in the United States has resulted not only from increased exposure but from rising rates of building destruction, potentially indicating more extreme wildfire behavior. This finding underscores the need to better understand how fuel management, community planning, and hardening buildings can reduce vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "The vertebrate nervous system is traditionally parceled topographically into central and peripheral divisions. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) in turn is commonly viewed functionally as a set of nerves and ganglia transmitting input and output signals between the central nervous system (CNS) and other bodily systems to regulate physiology and behavior. Here, we collate and analyze neuroanatomical data on putative directed and weighted axonal connections between peripheral ganglia in a mammal (rat). The resulting network reveals a sparse but broad intra-PNS neuronal architecture with over 100 connections among 52 of the 84 sensory and autonomic ganglia identified. Local network differentiation of the associated 52×52 connection matrix (connectome) was examined with cluster analysis. It identified 22 modules (subsystems or subnetworks) within a six-level nested hierarchy, including seven first-order modules and 14 end modules, spatially distributed from rostral to caudal along the CNS–body axis. Global features of the intra-PNS neuronal network based on node (ganglion) centrality measures identified two hubs (the bilateral myenteric plexus ganglia that control digestive tract functionality), no rich club, and small-world properties comparable to those reported for the rat brain. These findings suggest that the PNS is not merely a series of parallel nerves and associated ganglia but instead forms a structured and recurrently connected neuronal network. Its full extent and functional relevance remain to be elucidated using contemporary structure–function neuroscience approaches.",

          "abstract": "Lupus nephritis (LN), which is characterized by the accumulation of DNA-containing immune complexes (ICs), is the leading cause of death in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While growing evidence highlights the central role of CD103 + T cells in shaping the immune landscape of regional tissues, mechanisms driving the cell differentiation in LN remain largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an increased frequency of CD4 + CD103 + T cells within the kidneys of SLE patients. Importantly, glomerular endothelial cells (ECs) from human LN tissues were found to promote the differentiation of CD4 + CD103 + T cells by upregulating B lymphocyte–induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1). Genetic knockdown of Blimp-1 in CD4 + T cells resulted in a reduced frequency of renal CD4 + CD103 + T cells and alleviated LN in humanized SLE chimeras. Mechanistically, LN-associated ECs, triggered by circulating DNA from SLE patients, exhibited elevated CD38 expression via the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. This facilitated the transfer of CD38 into CD4 + T cells through an exosome-dependent mechanism, leading to the depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels in CD4 + T cells. The resulting NAD + depletion impaired the PARP1-mediated ADP-ribosylation of early growth response protein 1 (EGR1), which, in turn, enhanced Blimp-1 transcription and promoted CD103 + T cell differentiation. Targeting the cGAS/STING-CD38-EGR1 axis effectively reduced renal CD103 + T cell accumulation and inhibited LN progression in humanized SLE chimeras. Thus, ECs facilitate NAD + depletion to drive CD103 + T cell differentiation, presenting a cellular mechanism underlying LN pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management of human LN.",

While end resection has been extensively studied in the repair of endonuclease-induced DSBs, little is known about how resection proceeds at DSBs generated during DNA replication. We previously established a system to generate replication-dependent double-ended DSBs at the sites of nicks induced by the Cas9 D10A nickase in the budding yeast genome. Here, we suggest that these DSB ends form in an asymmetric manner, with one being blunt or near blunt and the other bearing a 3′ ssDNA overhang of up to the size of an Okazaki fragment. We find that Mre11 preferentially binds blunt ends and is required to evict Ku from these DSB ends and to promote end resection. In contrast, the ends predicted to have 3′ overhangs have minimal Ku binding, and resection at these break ends can proceed in a mostly Mre11-independent manner through either the Exo1 or Dna2-Sgs1 long-range resection mechanisms. These findings indicate that resection proceeds differently at replication-dependent DSBs than at canonical DSBs and reveal that Ku selectively binds blunt ends, potentially explaining why replication-dependent DSBs are poorly repaired by nonhomologous end joining.",

          "abstract": "This perspective addresses two of humanity’s greatest challenges: feeding a growing population and conserving biodiversity. We begin by examining the legacy of Nikolai Vavilov, who pioneered the improvement of crops such as wheat and beans by hybridizing them with their wild relatives. This strategy used wild species biodiversity to introduce new genetic variation into crops, making them more resilient and productive. Its adoption around the world greatly increased food security and brought lasting benefits to humanity. However, since the 1990 s, well-intentioned laws shifted the governance of biodiversity from a shared global resource to the sovereign control of nation states, with serious unintended consequences. These changes have disrupted the collection, preservation, exchange, and use of biodiversity, all of which are central to Vavilov’s strategy for crop improvement and to biodiversity science more broadly. Efforts at reform have been frustrated as the issues became moralized, inhibiting the open dialogue needed for change. Using foundational concepts shared by science and good governance, we propose seven empirically grounded principles for reform, to help realign biodiversity governance with its intended aims. We then illustrate one possible framework—underpinned by global financing to protect biodiversity hotspots—that would align incentives and work in synergy with the principles to foster practical reform. The principles, together with frameworks that align incentives, would create the conditions for stronger biodiversity conservation and research, agricultural development, global food security, and all the associated benefits to humanity.",

To expand our current understanding of the role of this population, we combine anatomical and functional approaches to question the influence of VIP cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a region key for navigation and spatial memory. From our anatomical tracing study, our findings reveal that neurons located in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) specifically project onto MEC interneurons, with a strong preference for MEC VIP cells. Additionally, MEC VIP cells receive input from the hippocampus, the subicular complex, and the retrosplenial cortex, suggesting a specialized role for MEC VIP cells in spatial memory. Indeed, we find that MEC VIP cells exhibit increased c-Fos expression in a spatial memory task and show that chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons impairs task performance. Together, these data reveal a specific projection of head-direction (HD) information onto MEC interneurons and confirm that MEC VIP-expressing cells play a critical role in spatial memory.",

Previous studies have linked the function of a single Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KZFP), ZFP189, in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the regulation of transposable elements (TEs), immune genes, and social behaviors. Here, we expand the scope of inquiry to explore the relationship between collective PFC KZFP function and social behaviors by altering the function of the cognate KZFP interacting protein TRIM28 within the PFC of male and female mice. We reprogrammed natural TRIM28 WT by replacing the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive domain with a synthetic, enhanced transcriptional activation domain VP64-p65-Rta (TRIM28 VPR ) or by excising the transcriptional regulatory domain (TRIM28 NFD ). Upon intra-PFC viral-mediated delivery of TRIM28 variants, we observed that inversion of TRIM28 transcriptional control via HSV-TRIM28 VPR selectively produced deficits in social behaviors, without affecting nonsocial behaviors. RNA sequencing of manipulated PFC revealed that HSV-TRIM28 VPR drove transcriptional escape of all classes of TEs, particularly those located within intronic and enhancer regions proximal to downregulated immune genes. HSV-TRIM28 VPR -mediated social deficits were reversible by intra-PFC repletion of interferon cytokines. These data point to PFC KZFP–TRIM28 interactions as necessary to stabilize genomic TEs to enable cis -regulation of key immune gene expression, which enhances organismal capacity for complex, prosocial behaviors.",

However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. In reinforcement learning, a world model refers to a predictive model that learns the environment’s dynamics and enables agents to simulate future trajectories in a latent space, thereby improving sample efficiency and long-horizon planning. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multicompartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a spiking world model (Spiking-WM), which integrates a spiking state-space model, a spiking convolutional encoder, and a fully connected spiking network for policy learning, to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units. Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset, Texas Instruments/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multicompartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Indeed, our study demonstrate that inhibition of valosin-containing protein (VCPi) induces EV release and necroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC), but does not achieve a synergistic effect with immunotherapy. Mechanistically, VCPi delays the degradation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a critical regulator of necroptosis and endosomal trafficking. Knockdown of MLKL reduces VCPi-mediated necroptosis, EV release, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) recycling. VCPi leads to MLKL accumulation, which recruits the retromer complex and GTPase-activating protein TBC1D5 to inactivate Rab7A. This redirects PD-L1-loaded vesicles to the cell surface via the retromer complex, thereby resulting in immunosuppression. Notably, targeting the retromer complex enhances the therapeutic efficacy of combined VCP inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 therapy in CRC, offering a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. Our study elucidates the role of the retromer complex in mediating PD-L1 recycling during VCPi-induced necroptosis and reveals that dual inhibition of VCP and the retromer complex potentiates immunotherapy efficacy in CRC.",

However, it remains unclear whether other transcriptional programs operate beyond the central androgen/AR signaling in promoting WD development. We found that mesenchyme-specific deletion of the transcription factor Gata2 resulted in defective epididymal coiling in the corpus and caudal regions. The defective coiling did not result from androgen signaling deficiency, as there were no abnormalities in testicular androgen production, AR/ Ar expression, or androgen-responsive genes, and dihydrotestosterone supplementation did not restore epididymal coiling in cultured WDs. Instead, Gata2 deletion led to the loss of epididymal identity, as evidenced by the reduced expression of epididymal mesenchymal markers. The epididymal defect persisted into adulthood, with the uncoiled corpus and caudal epididymis exhibiting abnormal epithelial morphology and lumen environments, resulting in an unfavorable environment for sperm storage. Our results demonstrate the androgen-independent role of mesenchymal GATA2 in promoting epididymal development and highlight the importance of proper fetal development in male reproduction.",

          "abstract": "The magnitude and shape of phenotypic variation depends on properties of the genotype-to-phenotype (GP) map, which itself can evolve over time. The evolution of GP maps is particularly interesting in variable environments, as GP maps can evolve to bias variation in the direction of past selection, increasing the evolvability of the population over time. However, the degree and manner in which environmental variation shapes GP maps and influences evolutionary dynamics may depend on properties of the fitness landscape. To explore how evolutionary dynamics are affected by variable environments across a wide range of different pairs of fitness landscapes, we evolved GP maps to produce spatial-temporal gene expression patterns that matched two-dimensional patterns generated by different elementary cellular automata rules. We found remarkable variation in how populations evolved in variable environments. In some cases, changing the environment helped populations find higher fitness peaks; in others, it hindered them. The evolution of evolvability also depended on the fitness landscape pair. In some experiments, the ability to generate adaptive phenotypic variation upon environment change increased over time, while in some others, populations found shared areas between fitness landscapes. On the other hand, environmental variability consistently resulted in higher fitness landscape exploration, average fitness, and mutational robustness compared to evolution in static environments, which we hypothesize are tightly connected. In conclusion, work presented here sheds light on important general consequences of environmental variability, while also demonstrating dependency on properties of fitness landscapes, which future research on the evolution of evolvability should consider.",

          "abstract": "The predictive coding hypothesis proposes that top–down predictions are compared with incoming bottom–up sensory information, with prediction errors signaling the discrepancies between these inputs. While this hypothesis explains the presence of prediction errors, recent experimental studies suggest that prediction error signals can emerge within a local circuit, that is, from bottom–up sensory input alone. In this paper, we test whether local circuits alone can generate predictive signals by training a recurrent spiking network using local plasticity rules. Our network model replicates experimentally observed features of prediction errors, such as biphasic neural activity patterns and context dependency. Our findings shed light on how synaptic plasticity can shape prediction errors and enable the acquisition and updating of an internal model of sensory input within a recurrent neural network.",

          "abstract": "Preventing autoantibody secretion by rendering self-reactive B cells functionally silent through clonal anergy has long posed the question of why fill the circulating B cell repertoire with cells that cannot secrete antibody? Here we address this question from the perspective of B cells that comprise 5 to 10% of the human circulating repertoire, expressing self-reactive surface immunoglobulins employing the IGHV4-34 heavy chain variable element. Using gene targeting to construct mice expressing a representative human IGHV4-34 antibody on the surface of many B cells, we show these cells are prevented from autoantibody secretion by B cell clonal anergy marked by downregulation of surface IgM, induction of tolerance-response mRNAs, and exclusion from the marginal zone and B1 cell subsets. This functionally tolerant state is overridden when the IGHV4-34 B cells cross-react with a virus, which stimulates the self-reactive B cells to hypermutate in germinal centers. Within 16 d of infection, 99% of daughter cells have acquired one of five heavy chain mutations that diminish binding to self but preserve virus binding, and 33% had combined 2 or 3 of these mutations to make their antibodies genetically self-tolerant and virus specific. These results demonstrate, from the perspective of a pathologically important human autoantibody class and the world’s most successful virus vaccine, how human antibody specificity is sculpted in the progeny of anergic B cells to yield antibodies that bind a virus but not self.",

          "abstract": "While the public health burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection has lessened due to natural and vaccine-acquired immunity, emergence of less virulent variants, and antiviral medications, COVID-19 continues to take a significant toll. There are thousands of new hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths per week in the United States, many of whom develop long COVID. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here, we report an untargeted, longitudinal plasma metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. Targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a preexisting contributor to disease trajectory—patients that show aberrant one-carbon metabolite levels and that are homozygous for the MTHFR C677T, have higher incidence of severe COVID. Our results raise the possibility that MTHFR variant status may inform precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Motile cilia are eukaryotic organelles with essential chemo- and mechanosensing functions across evolution, from single cell organisms to humans. Motile cilia of the mammalian nervous, respiratory, and reproductive systems are characterized by unique motility proteins to generate fluid flow essential for transporting metabolites and removing mucus. The molecular mechanism underlying motile cilia assembly remains unknown. Here, we use high-resolution imaging, proteomics, in situ cryotomography, and single-molecule motility assays to identify mammalian KIF27, a motor protein of the Kinesin-4 family and homologue of the Hedgehog pathway regulator COS2/KIF7, as a key regulator of motile cilia assembly in vivo. We show that KIF27 promotes the integrity of the transition zone (TZ), a diffusion barrier situated at the cilium base. Loss of KIF27 results in specific and profound defects in axonemal structure and disrupts cilia beating, which collectively lead to organismal phenotypes that recapitulate primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We show that the motile properties of KIF27 are dispensable for its function in motile cilia assembly. Instead, KIF27 acts as a microtubule scaffold to regulate the TZ architecture and enable correct ciliary incorporation of motility-generating proteins. Given that KIF27 orthologues exist in different evolutionarily lineages, we propose that the ancestral activity of KIF27/KIF7 kinesins was to form a microtubule-associated scaffold for protein–protein interactions pertinent to cilia formation and signaling. The transition-zone-associated KIF27 activities may represent a general building principle for the motile cilia assembly in diverse species and cell types.",

          "abstract": "Cement-based products sequester CO 2 in the atmosphere throughout their life cycle. The extent of sequestration highly depends on the context. We implement a bottom–up model of different cement end-use applications (buildings, pavements, bridges, pipelines, and other infrastructure) in the United States and Mexico to estimate the in-use and end-of-life carbon uptake in cement. We show that carbon uptake in 2024 could sequester approximately 13% of process emissions associated with cement consumption, which is around 6.7 Mt CO 2 . We observe a four-fold variation in the uptake per square area across all the states due to regional differences in the distribution of building types, concrete mix designs, and climates. The building sector uptake is almost twice as large as infrastructure systems. In Mexico, the current stock of cement-based products sequesters around one-quarter of the industry’s annual process emissions, implying the importance of local differences in end-use context, which can dramatically alter the extent of carbon uptake. Where prudent, enhancing carbon uptake in cement-based products is a valuable strategy to move toward carbon neutrality in the construction sector. The findings in this paper provide a fundamental shift in understanding how anthropogenic materials interact with the carbon cycle, which changes how national greenhouse gas inventories are calculated.",

However, the extent to which EV ncRNAs resemble overall cellular RNAs and the benefits to host cells of packaging them into EVs remain unknown. Here, we purified EVs from the culture media of mouse and human cells and characterized their RNA components using high-throughput sequencing and Northern blotting. We report that EVs are enriched for numerous aberrant ncRNAs, including ncRNA fragments, ncRNAs that have failed to mature, and short structured introns. Many RNAs contain oligouridine tails, a modification that can promote degradation by DIS3L2, an exoribonuclease that degrades defective structured ncRNAs. Both the numbers of EVs released and the fractions of tailed RNAs in EVs increase on DIS3L2 depletion, indicating that EV packaging of aberrant ncRNAs occurs in competition with DIS3L2 decay. Multiple type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are upregulated on DIS3L2 depletion, and cells treated with a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor that reduces exosome biogenesis show moderate ISG upregulation, an effect that is enhanced in DIS3L2-depleted cells and accompanied by accumulation of aberrant ncRNAs in cellular RNA. Thus, DIS3L2 degradation and packaging of aberrant RNAs into vesicles may prevent these RNAs from activating innate immune sensors and triggering an interferon response.",

Here, using Cd as a model system, we demonstrate that the formation of a metastable intermediate, Cd 2 SO 4 (OH) 2 , plays a crucial role in facilitating the efficient electrochemical reduction of low-concentration Cd(II) to metallic Cd 0 in acidic solutions. A combination of experimental and theoretical analyses reveals that in situ generated OH − at the cathode, in conjunction with bulk-phase SO 4 2− , drives the formation of this metal-inorganic complex, which mediates electron transfer by overcoming redox limitations. By optimizing flow dynamics and incorporating hierarchical electrode configurations, we enhance intermediate formation and achieve 96.81% Cd recovery from real AMD, with effluent Cd concentrations below 0.5 mg L −1 . Economic analysis estimates a net-positive return of 2.32 CNY per ton of treated AMD. Life cycle assessment further shows that the electroextraction process substantially outperforms lime neutralization with respect to all major environmental indicators. This work establishes a mechanistically driven, economically viable, and environmentally superior strategy for recovering valuable metals from AMD, advancing the prospects of circular resource recovery and sustainable wastewater management.",

          "abstract": "We all likely agree that tactile experience contributes to the emergence of the feeling of ownership over one’s own body. Is the opposite true? We answered this question by testing whether and how the sense of body ownership gates our tactile experience. In two experiments, we exploited a well-known multisensory illusion (Rubber Hand Illusion) to induce participants to feel a fake hand as belonging to their body, while their own hand was left in a disembodiment state (illusory-phases). After each illusory phase, a tactile stimulus was delivered to either the fake (embodied) hand or the real (disembodied) hand (testing-phases). Experiment 1 shows that the illusory phase significantly modulates the subjective feeling of touch experienced in the testing-phase, increasing tactile sensations when participants observed the fake (embodied) hand being touched (visual-touch), and decreasing them when the real (disembodied) hand was touched (real-touch). Experiment 2 investigated, by using TMS-EEG, the neural mechanism supporting this diametrical modulation of subjective feeling of touch, focusing on alpha-band oscillatory networks as the neural correlate of somatosensory awareness. S1 alpha-band connectivity fully matches the behavioral results, significantly increasing in visual-touch and decreasing in real-touch. In both experiments, a greater embodiment experienced in the illusory-phase significantly predicted higher behavioral and neurofunctional responses to visual-touch and lower responses to real-touch in the testing-phase. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the sense of body ownership exerts a top-down modulation on tactile awareness and may do so by increasing or decreasing the strength of the somatosensory network involved in tactile awareness.",

          "abstract": "In sign languages, linguistic information is transmitted through the simultaneous movement of several bodily articulators. This study investigates cortical tracking of sign language and whether experience and knowledge of sign language can modulate the tracking. We used a camera with a depth sensor to record videos of semispontaneous sign language narratives while tracking articulators’ movement in 3D space. These videos served to characterize the temporal periodicity of the sign language visual signal and as stimuli for the experiment. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded the neurophysiological activity of two groups of hearing participants—proficient signers and sign-naive individuals—while they watched videos in a known and unknown sign language. Coherence between the preprocessed MEG data and the visual linguistic signal extracted from different articulators was used as measure of brain-language tracking. The results show that neural activity tracks sign language input in delta frequency band (0.5 to 2.5 Hz), reflecting the slower periodicity associated with articulator movements. Both groups of participants show similar tracking in occipital areas, reflecting low-level visual processing of the videos. Proficient signers show stronger synchronization compared to sign-naive controls for linguistically relevant articulators in the right temporal cortex. Proficient signers also show greater tracking for the known compared to the unknown sign language. These findings confirm that cortical tracking of language is a feature of language processing beyond the auditory domain, and is modulated by language experience.",

Moso bamboo ( Phyllostachys edulis )—with its exceptional daily growth rates of up to 114.5 cm, prolonged IcM activity spanning 45 to 60 d, and large, accessible culm structure—provides an ideal system for building a comprehensive IcM cell atlas. Here, we integrated a chromosome-level genome assembly of Moso bamboo with a high-resolution anatomical atlas to delineate three critical developmental stages of IcM activity: the initial cell division phase (ID), the rapid cell division phase (RD), and the rapid cell elongation phase (RE). By combining single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics, we reconstructed a dynamic single-nucleus transcriptomic continuum spanning from proliferative to elongation states. Multiomics integration, along with in situ hybridization and ultrastructural imaging, identified IcM cells as short-columnar cells adjacent to elongating ground tissue parenchyma (Gp) cells, with the IcM1 subpopulation functioning as stem-like cells essential for maintaining the proliferative capacity. Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis revealed transcriptional transitions from stem-like IcM states to differentiated Gp cells. Functional experiments revealed that clrGene008562 , a WOX2 homolog, enhances callus regeneration, indicating its potential role in promoting cell division and differentiation processes relevant to IcM development. These findings provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular framework for understanding IcM function and offer valuable multiomics resources for advancing meristem research in bamboo and other Poaceae species.",

However, charging infrastructure expansion is a multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration of the existing infrastructure, spatiotemporal distribution of charging demands, power-grid capacity, and budget constraints. To approach this complex problem, we present charge-map , a data-driven simulation-optimization framework, focused on ensuring meaningful charging experience for individual EV owners. charge-map integrates three modules: an agent-based simulation module that estimates spatiotemporal distribution of charging demands by modeling EV adopter mobility and charging behavior; an optimization module that determines optimal new charging station/charger locations and capacities, while minimizing expected detour distances and wait-times with a limited number of new stations; and a power module that determines how to connect the stations to the power grid while maintaining its stability. Using the state of Virginia (consisting of 95 counties and 38 independent cities) as a case study, our results show that charge-map can meet the demand of ∼ 198,600 predicted EVs with 1,305 new public charging stations and 2,164 new chargers. It reduces average detour distances for charging by 66% and wait-times at stations by 72% compared to the existing infrastructure. Furthermore, transformer capacity requirement analysis reveals that only 1.8% of residential transformers require upgrades, while over 80% of commercial charging locations can be supported with modest transformer infrastructure (25 to 50 kVA). This indicates that targeted investments can facilitate cost-effective EV integration. Consequently, charge-map provides policymakers and urban planners with crucial data-driven insights for effective EV charging infrastructure expansion.",

In the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , polymorphic TgrB1 and TgrC1 proteins are used to bind sister cells and exclude cheaters, but it remains unknown how cells continually generate their extreme genetic diversity. Here, we created a collection of chromosome-length, whole genome sequences from 10 D. discoideum isolates and sister species to understand the evolution of the large tgr gene family. Our dataset includes AX2-214, a widely used D. discoideum lab strain, as well as complete genomes for two Chlamydia -like endosymbionts harbored within amoebae. We find that tgrB1 and C1 lie in a hypermutational hotspot, with haplotypes that undergo repeated intralocus recombination, duplications, transpositions, and inversions. These structural dynamics are highly localized adjacent to tgrB and C , resulting in the gain and loss of dozens of genes. The tgrBC genes themselves frequently duplicate and recombine, leading to the rapid generation of unique tgrBC repertoires. In the broader tgr gene family, some genes (e.g., tgrN ) are single copy and syntenic across all the genomes, whereas others (e.g., tgrA ) prolifically duplicate at similar rates to Dictyostelium transposons. Thus, the tgr genes are among the most rapidly evolving families genome-wide. We propose that the intense diversification within the tgrBC locus can help explain how these genes acquire such extreme levels of polymorphism, with parallels to the MHC immune genes in mammals and other allorecognition systems. This collection of amoeba genomes is also a useful resource for future comparative genomics and molecular evolution studies in Amoebozoa.",

          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) gradually demonstrate their potential to boost productivity and become integral tools for problem-solving in daily life worldwide, understanding the linguistic inequalities they introduce is becoming increasingly important. Prior research has primarily focused on static analyses of disparities in existing knowledge and capabilities of LLMs across languages. However, LLMs are continuously evolving, acquiring new knowledge to provide current, relevant responses and deliver precise, expert-level answers in specific domains. Investigating linguistic inequalities within this dynamic learning process is, therefore, also essential. In this paper, we explore inequalities in new knowledge learning by LLMs across different languages and four key dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, prioritization, and robustness. Through extensive experiments in both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, with proprietary and open-source models, we reveal four key findings: 1) LLMs face greater challenges in efficiently and accurately learning new knowledge in lower-resource languages; 2) knowledge learned by LLMs tends to be more easily transferred to higher-resource languages than to lower-resource ones; 3) new knowledge in higher-resource languages is more likely to be retained and prioritized; and 4) LLMs are more robust against incorrect or misleading information in higher-resource languages. We further analyze the underlying causes of these inequalities from linguistic perspectives, pretraining characteristics, and tokenizer design, and propose a preliminary mitigation strategy through the lens of linguistic neurons. This work highlights the urgent need to recognize and address emerging linguistic inequalities in the development of LLMs.",

          "abstract": "Models for prebiotic syntheses often have many steps, each separately validated by laboratory experiments. The challenge then asks whether these steps work together in natural geological environments, absent human intervention. Here, we analyze a six-step Discontinuous Synthesis Model (DSM) for the prebiotic formation of RNA, proposed to be the first informational molecule to support Darwinian evolution, and life, on Earth and/or Mars. DSM requires that borate in multiple steps guide the formation of pentoses from simple carbohydrates and control phosphorylation, in all cases by binding adjacent HO-groups on key intermediates. However, adjacent HO-groups must react in two other steps, which borate might inhibit. Experiments here show that borate does not inhibit these two other steps, but rather facilitates them. This makes the six-step DSM a “no human intervention” route from simple precursors (1 to 3 carbons, 0 to 2 nitrogens) to oligomeric RNA with predominately 3’,5’-linkages at least 6 nucleotides long, but possibly much longer. The process i) exploits privileged chemistry in ii) intermittently irrigated aquifers constrained by basalt that iii) have borate iv) above a redox-neutral mantle v) having access to an atmosphere transiently reduced by a Vesta-sized impactor. In a possible coincidence, such an impact occurred most likely ca. 4.3 billion years ago (Ga), ~100 Mya before some molecular clocks date the divergence of the three kingdoms of life on Earth (4.2 Ga), and ca. 200 Mya before isotopically “light” carbon is reported in zircons dated at 4.1 Ga. This carbon may be the oldest trace of life ever proposed.",

However, gene deletion studies failed to identify a clear functional role for OCLN, despite multiple phenotypic alterations. Importantly, previous studies targeting exon 3 allowed expression of a splice variant starting at exon 4 (isoform 4), that expresses the full carboxy-terminal tail. Here we show that the OCLN carboxy terminus forms a complex with the light intermediate chain (LIC) of dynein to link tight junction cargo to the minus end directed motor protein. Mutational analysis revealed S471 phosphorylation promotes binding to the LIC while S490 phosphorylation is required for trafficking. Expressing OCLN S490A mutant prevented endothelial cell proliferation and collateral angiogenesis. Ocln gene deletion targeting exon 5, preventing full-length and isoform 4 expression, resulted in embryonic lethality. In summary, OCLN links tight junction cargo to the dynein motor, regulating trafficking in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and contributing to both vascular endothelial growth factor-induced vascular permeability and collateral angiogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Strong coupling photonics, in which coupling strengths significantly exceed decay factors, holds great promise for applications in energy conversion and information processing. However, the effective and scalable design of strongly coupled polaritonic structures requires precise determination of the transition boundaries between strong and weak coupling regions. Traditional trial-and-error methods and classical machine learning (ML) algorithms struggle to achieve this due to the inherent difficulty in measuring decay factors during coupling. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid ML framework that integrates physics-informed modeling with uncertainty quantification. This approach enables accurate determination of strong–weak coupling transition boundaries—even with inaccessible decay factors. By leveraging this capability, our method facilitates efficient and large-scale design of strongly coupled polaritonic structures with sparse data, achieving a computational speedup of ~10 4 times compared to conventional simulations. Guided by this framework, we experimentally constructed a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) polariton coupling structure and observed strong coupling via near-field spectroscopy. This work establishes a generalizable optimization methodology for strongly coupled photonic devices, opening a broad avenue for polariton-enhanced energy conversion and optical information modulation.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions via calcium-mediated nitrogen fixation holds considerable promise but is impeded by fundamental gaps such as poor gas–liquid interface stability, sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, and instability of the critical intermediate calcium nitride. To systematically address these barriers, we i) introduced a high surface-area Ni-based anode specifically selected for enhancing HOR kinetics and minimizing solvent oxidation; ii) substituted the conventionally used tetrahydrofuran solvent with dimethoxyethane (DME) to significantly improve chemical stability; and iii) developed a tailored flow cell configuration to enhance gas–liquid mass transport and stabilize reaction intermediates. Employing in-situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we provided direct evidence of stabilized calcium nitride formation, elucidating the crucial roles of solvent stability and electrode composition in sustaining reactive intermediates. As a result of these combined innovations, our system demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 34.35 ± 1.76% in short-term tests and sustaining ~20% FE over extended continuous operation (~56 h). At elevated current densities, the improved gas–liquid interface stability enables robust ammonia production, reaching partial current densities of approximately 219 mA cm − 2 at ~29% FE. Isotope-labeling studies with 15 N 2 confirmed the direct electroreduction of N 2 , while kinetic analyses underscored the impact of anode material selection on HOR efficiency and overall electrochemical stability. These insights establish critical mechanistic understanding and clear design principles for future calcium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen fixation systems, enabling stable, efficient, and selective ammonia synthesis.",

In this study, APV assembly and release is achieved in nonimmune cells by transfecting a single-chain heterotrimer (SCT) peptide major histocompatibility complex I (pMHCI) construct containing an ESCRT- and ALIX-binding region (EABR) sequence appended to the cytoplasmic tail; this EABR sequence recruits ESCRT proteins to induce the budding of APVs displaying SCT pMHCI. A comparison of multiple pMHCI constructs shows that inducing the release of APVs by the addition of an EABR sequence generalizes across SCT pMHCI constructs. Purified pMHCI/EABR APVs selectively stimulate IFN-γ release from T cells presenting their cognate T cell receptor, demonstrating the potential use of these vesicles as a form of cell-free immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Multicellular organisms utilize epithelial folding to achieve remarkable three-dimensional forms. During embryonic development, stereotypical epithelial folds emerge from underlying active cellular and molecular processes including cell shape change and differential cell growth. However, the origin of epithelial folding in early animals and how folding may be harnessed in synthetic systems remain open questions. Here, we identify a modality of behavior-induced epithelial folding and unfolding arising from cilia–substrate adhesion and ciliary walking in the basal animal Trichoplax adhaerens (phylum Placozoa). We show that T. adhaerens is capable of exhibiting dynamic nonstereotyped folding states, providing a 3D perspective to an organism previously only characterized in its 2D state. We correlate these folding states to local substrate geometry, revealing that the animal conforms to available substrate surface area, promoting the maintenance of a folded state. Using 4D fluorescence light sheet microscopy, we characterize fold geometry, curvature evolution during unfolding, and the nonstereotypy of unfolding behavior. Through repeated unfolding trials, we reveal the robustness and timescales associated with unfolding behavior and employ scaling analysis and toy model simulations to establish how collective ciliary activity can robustly drive unfolding. In this way, despite lacking any folding–unfolding “pathway,” transitions between folding and unfolding states emerge as a function of the animal’s environment and motility. Our work reveals a remarkable behavior exhibited by a brainless, nerveless animal, and demonstrates the capacity for 3D–2D transitions in folding epithelial sheets using ciliary activity.",

Accurate representation of these impacts requires accounting for the effects of prolonged sequences of hot days on mortality, the change in that mortality due to anthropogenic forcing, and the potential compensating effects of adaptation to heat. Here, we revisit the August 2003 heat wave in France, a canonical event in a region with rich climate and mortality data, to understand these influences. We find that standard heat–mortality exposure–response functions underpredict excess deaths in August 2003 by 55% but that accounting for the temporally compounding effects of hot days better matches observed mortality. After accounting for compounding effects and applying a machine learning approach to single-event climate attribution, we attribute 6,079 deaths in August 2003 to climate change. Finally, we show that recent adaptation to heat in France has reduced the projected death tolls of future 2003-like events by more than 75%.",

Here, we showed that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) failed to enhance adult neurogenesis and cognition in the mice with defective touch perception due to loss of a mechanotransduction channel Piezo2 in Merkel cells. Moreover, we found an EE-activated neuraxis, in which the dentate gyrus received tactile input through a circuit that originated from the somatosensory cortex (S1) and relayed via dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Defective touch perception diminished the S1 to SNc afferent, thereby reducing dopamine release. Notably, stimulation of the S1 to SNc afferent restored EE-induced adult neurogenesis and cognition in the mice with defective touch perception.

Lower production means that millions of people are losing out on potential food, income, and livelihoods. Rebuilding these stocks to maximize sustainable production can contribute toward ending hunger and malnutrition but requires active and effective fisheries management. Yet, for fish stock recovery plans to be implemented, recovery benefits, targets, and timeframes need to be quantified. Here, using 1,211 individual reef sites and 23 jurisdictions identified globally as being below maximum sustainable production levels, we show that reefs have the potential to increase sustainable yields by nearly 50% if allowed to recover toward their maximum production levels. For individual jurisdictions, this recovery represents from 20,000 up to 162 million additional sustainable servings of reef fish per year in comparison to current sustainable production, meeting recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people a year. However, such growth and food provisioning will require fish stocks to double their standing biomass (increase by a median of 32 t/km 2 ). Recovery timeframes range from 6.4 y under the most stringent scenario (a moratorium) to 49.7 y under the maximum harvest scenario that results in recovery. We find that locations with the greatest potential for sustainable gains in yield are among those with the greatest food and micronutrient deficiencies, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in recovering fish assemblages to achieve their maximum sustainable potential.",

To overcome this, we engineered dual-targeted and dual-costimulated CAR T cells (CD19/28ζ-M5BBζ) that recognize CD19+ B cells, thereby promoting peripheral expansion and increasing the pool of solid tumor-directed CAR T cells available for tumor infiltration without the need for lymphodepletion. In immunocompetent C57BL/6 mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma, these dual-targeted CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced peripheral expansion, improved anti-tumor efficacy, and increased survival without added dysfunction or toxicity compared to single antigen-targeted CAR T cells. We translated our findings to human CAR T cells by developing a pancreatic/xenograft model with CD19 + B cells in the periphery and again demonstrated that treatment with dual CAR T cells showed significantly enhanced tumor clearance and survival compared to single antigen-targeted CAR T cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that dual-targeted CAR T cells boost peripheral expansion, and anti-tumor efficacy, providing a strategy for enhancing outcomes for patients treated with clinical CAR T products targeting solid tumors.",

SPNS1 deficiency inhibits infection of EV-A71 and 9 of 11 examined enteroviruses.

However, there have been no guaranteed routes of microfluidics that can achieve widespread adoption in mainstream chemistry and biomedical research. Inspired by the cooperative multiple cilia of biological organisms and tissues to generate flow, we propose an open microfluidic platform, lab on an end (LoE), to pump spatially and temporally continuous flow for multifunctional micromanipulation with the acoustohydrodynamic pillar array as an end effector. LoE brings together the micromanipulation of individual entities, liquid operations, and cell processing onto an acoustic end effector. These operations are mainly driven by acoustic radiation and two unique frequency-dependent microstreaming profiles: out-of-plane vortex near a single pillar and in-plane transmission flow surrounding the entire pillar array. Applications in embryo engineering, local morphological phenotyping of Caenorhabditis elegans for neuron research, efficient chemical reactions, and multifunctional cell processing indicate that the LoE could potentially lead to breakthroughs in understanding and using microfluidics. Its capability of integrating multiple sequential processes, inherent high accessibility, easy use, and low cost provide an end-to-end solution to mainstream chemistry and biomedical research.",

          "abstract": "Wildfire smoke, once rare, is a hazard that populations across the globe are increasingly exposed to repeatedly. Evidence of acute health effects of wildfire particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is growing, but less is known about long-term effects related to repeated exposures. Using a cohort of 1,250,083 Kaiser Permanente Southern California members aged ≥60, we estimated the association between all-cause mortality and 3-y exposure to five different census tract–level wildfire smoke metrics (mean daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 , mean daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 during the peak wildfire week, number of days with daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 &gt; 0 μg/m 3 , number of weeks with average wildfire-specific PM 2.5 &gt; 5 μg/m 3 , and number of smoke waves). We applied a discrete-time approach with pooled logistic regressions, adjusting for sex, age, race and ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, requiring an interpreter, calendar year, and census tract–level poverty and population density. When comparing those highly exposed (95th percentile) to those minimally exposed (5th percentile), we found an increased odds of mortality across all five wildfire smoke metrics. Mean daily wildfire PM 2.5 was the metric most strongly associated with mortality (odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09). We observed greater vulnerability to the long-term effects of smoke for individuals under age 75, or with Black or Other racial/ethnic identity, or living in a census tract with higher poverty. Identifying the most harmful long-term wildfire smoke metric and most-at-risk populations can help focus attention for developing effective adaptation strategies in a changing climate.",

In a randomized, double-blind crossover study of 110 young women, we examined how exogenous estradiol (E2) modulates threat neurocircuitry, timed precisely to ovarian phase. E2 increased engagement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and, in the early luteal phase, reduced central and corticomedial amygdala reactivity to threat in women with little trauma history, but not those with PTSD. Fluctuations in E2 therefore modulate neural responses to threat, and sensitivity to these fluctuations may underlie women’s heightened vulnerability to stress-related disorders.",

A popular mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), could serve to develop such a therapy, provided we can better understand the nature and importance of the autoantibodies involved. Here, we report the finding of autoantibody-secreting extrafollicular plasmablasts in EAE induced with specific myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that these cells produce nonaffinity-matured IgG antibodies. These include pathogenic antibodies competing for shared binding space on MOG’s extracellular domain. Interestingly, the synthetic anti-MOG antibody 8-18C5 can prevent the binding of pathogenic antibodies from either EAE mice or people with MOG antibody disease. Moreover, an 8-18C5 variant carrying the NNAS mutation, which inactivates its effector functions, can reduce EAE severity and promote functional recovery. In brief, this study provides not only a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response in EAE models but also a proof of concept for a therapy to antagonize pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between magnetism and flat-band (FB) instability is a central theme in quantum materials research. A striking example is the emergence of magnetic order in a nominally nonmagnetic compound when a flat band is tuned near the Fermi energy ( E F ). In this study, we investigate this phenomenon in the Pauli paramagnet SrCo 2 As 2 , where an FB associated with Co e g orbitals lies close to E F . Remarkably, a minute substitution of the nonmagnetic element Pd onto the Co site ( ∼ 2%) induces antiferromagnetic order with a transition temperature as high as T N = 25 K. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent magnetic and transport measurements, complemented by zero-field neutron diffraction, reveal a helical magnetic order for x ≤ 0.10 in Sr(Co 1− x Pd x ) 2 As 2 , transitioning to a complex ferromagnetic state at higher Pd concentrations. Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical band structure calculations demonstrate that electron doping shifts the flat band closer to E F , significantly enhancing the Stoner parameter. This enhancement drives a strong ferromagnetic instability, leading to helical magnetic ordering dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic interactions. The emergence of robust magnetic ordering through substitution with nonmagnetic elements is a unique phenomenon that underscores the pivotal role of flat-band instability in tuning magnetism in itinerant systems.",

For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the “dynamical climate” of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, its variant, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness have been achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. In addition, two real-world ecological benchmark datasets: the microbial time-series dataset and global population dynamics database, are tested to demonstrate the applicability of the meta-learning framework to the real world. A number of issues affecting the prediction performance are addressed.",

By characterizing key protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions, we reveal the coordination of pseudouridylation activity across the two protomers which explains the predominance of two-hairpin structures in eukaryotic H/ACA snoRNAs. Moreover, we found that several mutations in H/ACA proteins associated with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) directly impair pseudouridine formation suggesting how these mutations disrupt RNA modification and ribosome biogenesis in this disease. Additionally, we uncover coordinated structural changes between Nop10, Nhp2, and the N-terminal extensions of Cbf5 in the 3′ protomer that resemble active and inactive conformations and may regulate H/ACA snoRNP activity.

          "abstract": "Physical exercise affects multiple physiological processes, including those regulated by hormones, such as energy balance, stress responses, and pain perception. The prohormone precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gives rise to β-endorphin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, β-lipotropin, and the melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which act through melanocortin (MC1-5) and opioid receptors to influence these key physiological responses. Here, we identified a mechanism by which full-length POMC interacts with small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in the circulation. In healthy adults, the fraction of plasma POMC associated with sEVs increased fourfold following intense exercise, despite unchanged POMC and sEV concentrations. POMC-positive sEVs contained leukocyte or megakaryocyte/platelet markers, suggesting hematopoietic origin. A substantial subset of circulating sEVs expressed MC1–MC5 and μ-opioid receptors, and coimmunoisolation assays demonstrated binding of unprocessed POMC to MC1 and MC3 receptors. Molecular modeling indicated that POMC undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes that favor MC binding, a finding corroborated by in vitro binding assays under acidic conditions. Functionally, addition of POMC-positive sEVs to B16-F10 melanoma cells induced melanogenesis, consistent with POMC-derived MSH activity. The sEV-associated POMC had higher rates of transport than unbound POMC in assays mimicking the blood–brain barrier. These findings establish that exercise-induced, pH-dependent binding of POMC to circulating sEVs may facilitate hormone precursor transport and potentially influence transfer across the blood–brain barrier. This mechanism represents a separate paradigm for endocrine regulation, providing insight into how exercise modulates sEV interactions with systemic hormone distribution and signaling.",

In this study, we identify consistent signatures of criticality during neural network training and provide theoretical evidence that such scaling behavior arises naturally from information-driven self-organization: a dynamic balance between the maximum entropy principle that promotes unbiased exploration and mutual information constraint that relates updates with task objective. We numerically demonstrate that the power-law exponent of updates remains stable throughout training, supporting the presence of self-organized criticality. Furthermore, we show that the loss landscape exhibits exponential ruggedness under small perturbations, transitioning to power-law ruggedness at larger scales, in the absence of mini-batch noise, indicating an intrinsic geometric landscape. We also observe a power-law distribution in the intervals between large updates, indicating an intermittent learning process. Together, these findings suggest that neural network learning reflects a nonequilibrium process governed by the fundamental trade-off between randomness and relevance, highlighting its dynamic nature and offering insights into the interpretability of AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Tumor cells heavily depend on proteasome-mediated protein turnover, making the proteasome an attractive therapeutic target. Clinically, proteasome inhibitors are effective against hematologic cancers but show limited success with solid tumors, and the reasons for this difference are not well understood. Activation of yes-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ, the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, is a key mechanism behind drug resistance in cancers. Here, we demonstrate that proteasome stress acts as an upstream signal of the Hippo pathway in solid tumor cells. When the proteasome is inhibited, RAP2 undergoes ubiquitination and becomes inactive, which in turn disrupts the RAP2–MAP4Ks–NF2–LATS1/2 signaling pathway, leading to the activation of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ activation promotes cell survival and resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Conversely, blocking YAP/TAZ can overcome this resistance and restore cancer cell sensitivity to these drugs. In diffuse-type gastric cancer—an aggressive solid tumor with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options—combined inhibition of the proteasome and YAP/TAZ effectively suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, this study identifies proteasome stress as an upstream signal of the Hippo pathway and provides a mechanistic basis for combination cancer therapy.",

We show that early-stage strain accumulation in intercalation cathodes occurs during the period of interparticle charge transfer and redox reactions stemming from asynchronous coupling and decoupling between chemical (de)intercalation and physical grain motion. This interplay drives heterogeneous redox activity, localized charge equilibration, and multiscale strain cascades that propagate through an asynchronous network of chemical-mechanical interactions.

By simultaneously broadening the Cmcm -phase stability window and enhancing lattice symmetry through lead alloying, we extended the high performance from a single temperature point to a wide temperature range of ~250 kelvin in rock salt–like Cmcm SnSe crystals rendered n-type through chlorine doping. An average ZT of ~3.0 was achieved between 673 and 923 kelvin, with a conversion efficiency of ~19.1% under a temperature difference of ~572 kelvin.",

Being biocompatible, the SPCs support single-cell cultivation and clonal expansion over long periods of time thereby overcoming a fundamental limitation of droplet microfluidics platforms.

To achieve processivity, multiple catalytic cycles must occur before substrate dissociation, making rapid turnover rates essential. Src family kinases processively phosphorylate multisite substrates. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified a transient intermediate state within the Src conformational ensemble, positioned between its active and inactive states. This intermediate state facilitates the rapid release of adenosine diphosphate following adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, ensuring efficient catalytic turnover. Depletion of the intermediate state abrogated processive phosphorylation by Src, Lck, and Hck, impairing function. These findings reveal that the conformational ensemble of Src family kinases has evolved to incorporate a transient state that underpins their capacity for processive substrate phosphorylation.",

Here, we describe organic salts that maintain the same ionic conductivity mechanism across transitions between three states of matter, from an initial isotropic liquid to a liquid crystalline state and then to a crystalline solid. We achieved this property by minimizing the ion-pairing interactions between mobile ions and highly diffuse counterions that assemble in a stepwise manner to preserve conformational flexibility across phase transitions. This state-independent ionic conductivity opens up opportunities to exploit liquid-like ionic conductivity in organic solids.",

By integrating millions of photonic neurons on a chip, varying network dimension through proposed optical latent space, and Bayes-based training algorithms, LightGen experimentally implemented high-resolution semantic image generation, denoising, style transfer, three-dimensional generation, and manipulation.

Enhanced signaling between enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the gut epithelium and mucosal sensory nerve fibers likely contributes to this sex bias. We identified an estrogen-responsive paracrine pathway in which two enteroendocrine cell types, peptide YY (PYY)–expressing L cells and serotonergic EC cells, communicate to increase gut sensitivity in females. We demonstrate that estrogen signaling up-regulates the bacterial metabolite short-chain fatty acid receptor Olfr78 on colonic L cells, increasing PYY release and their sensitivity to acetate. Elevated PYY acts on neighboring EC cells by means of NPY1R, thereby enhancing serotonin release and gut pain. We propose that hormonal fluctuations, in conjunction with internal (stress) or environmental (diet) factors, amplify this local estrogen-responsive colonic circuit, resulting in maladaptive gut sensitivity.",

We show that the citrus canker pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri ( Xcc ) mobilizes cell wall sugars by hijacking a fruit-ripening program through the type III effector PthA4, which activates the ripening coordinator CsLOB1. CsLOB1 induces approximately 100 genes, many encoding enzymes involved in cell wall breakdown. In the nonfruiting species Nicotiana benthamiana , CsLOB1 likewise promotes Xanthomonas growth, showing that its activity is not strictly dependent on a ripening program. Transcriptomics and reporter assays revealed PthA4-dependent activation of the Xcc xylan CUT system, triggered by host-derived xylose and including a type II–secreted xylanase. Thus, PthA4-driven cell wall remodeling activates bacterial xylan use, establishing a TIII–TII effector feedforward loop that fuels Xcc proliferation.",

However, there is limited understanding of how Pol II transcribes through nucleosomes while supercoiling DNA. Here, we determined that Pol II generates a torque of 9 pN·nm alone and 13 pN·nm with TFIIS, making it a powerful rotary motor. When Pol II encounters a nucleosome, passage becomes more efficient on a chromatin substrate than on a single-nucleosome substrate, demonstrating that chromatin significantly buffers torsional stress during transcription. Furthermore, topoisomerase supercoiling relaxation allows Pol II to transcribe through multiple nucleosomes. Our results reveal a role of chromatin beyond the more conventional view of it being just a roadblock to transcription.",

These rocks consist of coarse-grained olivine, magnesium- and iron-carbonates, silica, and phyllosilicates, including some of the oldest materials exposed within Jezero. We infer these rocks formed by olivine accumulation in an igneous system of layered intrusions, followed by exposure to water and carbon dioxide that caused extensive carbonation of the silicate minerals.

A long-standing limitation in radiochemistry for PET imaging has been the lack of general methods for radiolabeling trifluoromethyl (CF 3 ) groups at C(sp 3 ) sites, despite their growing prevalence in bioactive molecules and radiopharmaceuticals. Here, we present a general approach for late-stage installation of either a [ 18 F]CF 3 or [ 11 C]CF 3 group at a C(sp 3 ) site. This method leverages unusual copper-mediated radiotrifluoromethylation of alkyl halides and alkyl carboxylic acids by halogen atom transfer and photoredox catalysis, respectively. More than 50 complex molecules and pharmaceutical agents were efficiently labeled with fluorine-18 ( 18 F) or carbon-11 ( 11 C).

The conserved AvrBs2 family effectors are among the most important virulence factors in xanthomonads, but how AvrBs2 promotes infection remains elusive. We found that AvrBs2 is a glycerophosphodiesterase-derived synthetase that catalyzes uridine 5′-diphosphate-α- d -galactose into a sugar phosphodiester, bis-(1,6)-cyclic dimeric α- d -galactose-phosphate, which is referred to as xanthosan. Xanthosan is synthesized by AvrBs2 in host cells and released into apoplastic spaces. Xanthomonas bacteria uptake xanthosan through the XanT transporter and hydrolyze it through the XanP phosphodiesterase for nutrition. AvrBs2, XanT, and XanP form a xanthosan “generation-uptake-utilization” system to provide a dedicated nutritional strategy to feed xanthomonads. Furthermore, elucidation of the AvrBs2-XanT-XanP virulence mechanism inspired us to develop an “anti-nutrition” strategy that should be applicable to control a wide variety of Xanthomonas diseases.",

A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. Here, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in dc electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. On one hand, CID takes place via direct resonant electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In the second regime, plasmon damping takes place through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy. This mechanism also leads to adsorbate-induced changes in dc resistivity. These findings provide previously unidentified insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.",

Necroptosis, a regulated necrotic cell death pathway controlled by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), has emerged as a potential driver of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disorders. We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression. Spatial profiling of human PSC biopsies revealed that necroptosis primarily affects cholangiocytes, while apoptosis was more frequent in hepatocytes and nonbiliary cells. In vitro, necroptosis inhibition protected cholangiocytes, and RIPK1 deletion conferred resistance to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. In a murine model of PSC, pharmacological RIPK1 inhibition reduced cholestatic injury, hepatic inflammation, and biliary fibrosis. Multiomic analyses comprehensively demonstrated reprogramming toward wild-type–like profiles following treatment. These findings identify necroptosis as a critical effector in PSC and highlight RIPK1 inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach, opening the door to targeted necroptosis-based therapies for this otherwise untreatable disease.",

The induction of auxin signaling by immune receptors for antiviral immunity is poorly understood despite its notable role in plant defense against viral pathogens. Here, we report that plant NLR Sw-5b initiates and amplifies auxin signaling through auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAAs)–ARF19 and YUC8–transport inhibitor response1/auxin-signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) modules to promote callose-mediated antiviral defense. Upon recognizing viral effector, Sw-5b associates with and relieves repressors Aux/IAAs on transcription factor ARF19. ARF19 then activates callose synthase gene GSL5/8 to deposit callose at plasmodesmata, inhibiting viral cell-to-cell spread. Meanwhile, ARF19 activates auxin biosynthesis gene YUC8 to boost auxin production; this further amplifies callose deposition signaling via TIR1/AFB receptors and Aux/IAAs-ARF19–glucan synthase-like (GSL) module, thereby restricting the virus in localized cell death. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism by which plant immune receptors induce phytohormone signaling pathways to combat pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks, widely recognized for their role in machine learning, are also transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modeling with classical dynamical systems as well as enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.",

However, ECM-driven metabolic alterations that promote chemoresistance in PDAC are so far unexplored. Here, we use in vitro–generated ECM bioscaffolds that recapitulate cell-ECM interactions and induce broad metabolic alterations in PDAC cells. High-throughput integration of multiomics datasets coupled with metabolic tracing showed that the ECM enhances the generation of guanylates in PDAC cells, the accumulation of which alleviates oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage, and boosts PDAC cell proliferation. These events are guided by the guanosine monophosphate (GMP)–producing enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), the expression of which correlated with that of matrisomal and DNA repair genes in samples from patients with PDAC. We propose that targeting ECM-driven metabolic processes, such as the enhanced IMPDH activity, may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with PDAC to bypass the negative side effects of direct targeting of the ECM itself.",

How these asymmetric egress points are built into the quaternary assembly of the virion is unknown. Here, we capture the structure and dynamics of a partially expanded virus disassembly intermediate, poised to release its spring-loaded genomic RNA. The structure shows highly localized density of RNA underneath surface fivefold axes on one-half of the viral particle. This polarity in RNA distribution is associated with a unique interchain isopeptide bond (glutamic acid–lysine), which flanks conserved high-affinity RNA binding sites. This singular isopeptide bond at the asymmetric egress site confers an essential “loaded-die” feature that is critical for steering genomic RNA egress into the host cell for virus propagation.",

BPC shows high sensitivity, selectivity, and biocompatibility, enabling real-time visualization of redox fluctuations in living cells and zebrafish with minimal cytotoxicity. In pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)– and acetaminophen (APAP)–induced models of epilepsy and liver injury, BPC revealed notable alterations in Cys, Hcy, and O 2 •− levels, providing mechanistic insights into redox dysregulation.

Here, we advance the characterization of mixtures of MPs by leveraging their spontaneous adsorption and self-organization at liquid crystal (LC)-aqueous interfaces. We show that surface-sensitive interparticle interactions mediated by the LC can drive mixtures of colloidal MPs into assembly patterns that are accurately recognized using computer vision approaches. In particular, we show that we can identify MP composition (polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate) in complex samples that contain natural organic matter and have been weathered using ultraviolet light. In addition, we explore how computer vision methods classify MP samples, generating fresh insights into the physical processes that control colloidal dynamics and assembly at fluid interfaces. Overall, our results advance efforts to develop characterization methods for colloidal-scale MPs that are broadly accessible (e.g., to citizen scientists).",

          "abstract": "Tanning bed users have a significantly increased risk of melanoma, but it remains unclear how indoor tanning drives melanomagenesis. To better understand the etiology of melanoma associated with tanning bed use, we described the patterns of melanoma in patients with quantifiable tanning bed usage and performed exome sequencing of melanocytes from normal skin of a subset of these patients. Tanning bed users were more likely to have melanoma on body sites with low cumulative levels of sun damage and to have multiple melanomas. The melanocytes in skin from tanning bed users had higher mutation burdens and higher proportions of cells with pathogenic mutations—these differences were most prominent over body sites that experience comparatively less exposure to natural sunlight. We conclude that tanning bed radiation induces melanoma by increasing the mutation burden of melanocytes and by mutagenizing a broader field of melanocytes than are typically exposed to natural sunlight.",

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities. This non–cell-autonomous fragmentation ensures rapid apoptotic cell clearance, crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis in physiological settings.",

Cartilage tissue has limited self-repair capacity, and although allogeneic transplantation has potential, a less invasive delivery method could enhance the efficacy of cell-based therapies. The aim of this study was to develop iPSC-derived “minimal injectable unit” chondrogenic micropellets (MIUChons) for delivery via intra-articular injections for OA therapy. To create transplantable allogeneic cartilage tissue, we optimized good manufacturing practice or clinical-grade production of iPSC-derived injectable chondrogenic spheroids and tested them in OA animal models. MIUChons were delivered to damaged cartilage through a single injection. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that MIUChon treatment effectively reduced cartilage degeneration and deterioration. In addition, injecting MIUChons into the intra-articular cavity improved arthritis symptoms. Overall, MIUChons offer a strategy for treating cartilage deterioration via intra-articular injection in patients with OA.",

          "abstract": "For more than two centuries, digoxin has been used to treat heart failure by increasing the strength of cardiac contraction and, more recently, is used for heart rate control. The proposed, yet unproven, mechanism underlying digoxin’s positive inotropic effect is as follows: By inhibiting the Na + -K + ATPase (NKA), digoxin partially dissipates the transmembrane Na + gradient, which is used by the Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX1) to extrude Ca 2+ from myocytes, thus causing accumulation of cytosolic Ca 2+ and therefore increased cardiac contractility. Here, we demonstrate that digoxin critically relies on a specific allosteric regulation of NCX1, known as Na + -dependent inactivation, to exert its positive inotropic effect, establishing the precise mechanism of action of this historic drug. These findings identify a distinct molecular target for the development of positive inotropes that avoid the undesirable effects associated with the blockade of NKA. As the structural information for the region involved with NCX1 Na + -dependent inhibition is well resolved, we provide the mechanistic foundation for drug development.",

Specifically, SLFN14 binds to the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), thereby preventing HIV-1 Tat-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter and causing an arrest of viral transcription. Furthermore, this P-TEFb–targeted inhibiting activity also allows SLFN14 to regulate the transcription of a subset of cellular genes. Thus, our data identify SLFN14 as an inhibitor of the important transcription elongation factor P-TEFb complex, which unveils the crucial role of SLFN14 in both cellular antiviral defense and other important cellular processes that rely on the function of this complex.",

In this work, we develop an analytical model connecting diurnal cloud biases to emergent mean state radiative biases. With the use of satellite observations, we demonstrate that there are errors in the time of day that clouds are occurring in ESMs that would cause bias in shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) that is greater than 45% of the total SWCRE bias, but such errors in the cloud diurnal cycle are masked by other compensating errors, indicating that these ESMs are getting the right answer for the wrong reasons.",

We find that Casp8 −/− Ripk3 −/− mice have increased brain parasite burden in comparison to controls and succumb to infection despite the generation of robust immune responses. We observed that neurons, astrocytes, and CD8 + T cells had high rates of parasite interactions in Casp8 −/− Ripk3 −/− mice compared to wild-type mice. While Casp8 deficiency in neurons and astrocytes did not affect control of infection, deletion of Casp8 in CD8 + T cells led to impaired survival, increased parasite burden, and direct infection of CD8 + T cells in the brain.

In contrast to the positive regulatory role observed in mammals, we show that TOR signaling is dispensable for heat-induced SG formation in plants. Furthermore, heat stress induces the sequestration of TOR and its core complex components, RAPTOR1B and LST8, into SGs. TOR activity is rapidly suppressed by heat stress, independently of SG formation. In contrast, TOR reactivation following heat stress relief is dependent on the rate of SG disassembly, implicating SG recovery dynamics as a key regulator of TOR reactivation.

In this study, we show that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of TSK recognizes the N-terminal tails of histone variants H2A.X and H2A.W—key for DNA repair in euchromatin and heterochromatin, respectively—but not the H2A.Z variant. A unique motif containing multiple basic and acidic residues (BAR motif) in H2A.Z prevents TSK binding. Moreover, disrupting TSK-H2A.X/W binding impairs TSK-mediated DNA repair. Genetic analyses reveal functional complementation between H2A.X and H2A.W in DNA repair, with the H2A.X N terminus being essential.

Within each subsystem, 5-HT neurons were functionally homogeneous, whereas across different subsystems, they were functionally heterogeneous. We further demonstrate that each 5-HT subsystem functions as a distinct module playing a role in multiple tasks, rather than being exclusive to one function. Moreover, the involvement of multiple parallel 5-HT subsystems, rather than a single subsystem, is fundamental to the accomplishment of a specific task.

Through single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of lamprey, fish, bird, and mammalian retinas, we demonstrate cross-species conservation of cis-regulatory codes in all retinal cell classes despite extensive turnover of cis-regulatory regions. Conservation manifests as clustering of high-affinity transcription factor binding sites in cell class–specific open chromatin regions. Thus, the retina’s cellular Bauplan is controlled by cis-regulatory codes, which predate the divergence of extant vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Oil-water separation is critical for energy and manufacturing industries, including crude refining and oil recycling, yet remains challenging for nanoscale emulsions where gravity-based methods are ineffective. Conventional demulsification techniques using immersed electrodes are limited by low electric field strengths to avoid shorting, requiring toxic demulsifiers and water-intensive desalting. Here, we propose a non-Laplacian electrocoalescence strategy using space-charge emitter electrodes with an air gap, enabling corona-based charge injection to achieve electric fields up to 8 kilovolts per centimeter and an eightfold enhancement over conventional methods. The enhanced electrostatic field enables a 64-fold increase in dipole-dipole attraction forces, leading to accelerated droplet coalescence and separation across water fractions ranging from 2 to 20%, without chemical demulsifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate a scalable, flow-through space-charge emitter system capable of continuous demulsification of nanoscale emulsions. This approach provides a sustainable, chemical-free solution to address critical environmental and economic challenges in oil-water separation processes.",

          "abstract": "Gradient biomaterials that exhibit spatially varying physical, chemical, or biological properties can be used in various applications such as tissue engineering, organoid development, mechanobiology, and spatially controlled drug delivery. However, current fabrication methods often suffer from limited gradient precision, restricted material compatibility, and poor reproducibility. Here, we introduced gradient regulation via acoustofluidic dynamic engineering (GRADE), a programmable system to generate high-fidelity gradient biomaterials across different material systems. By incorporating focused interdigital transducers with the pulsed surface acoustic wave actuation, GRADE can achieve tunable and directional acoustic streaming (0 to 22 millimeters per second), which allows accurate regulation of the gradient magnitude and length. Its open microchannel design enables nondestructive extraction of centimeter-scale gradients and supports device reuse, enhancing practicality and scalability. In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform’s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication. It shows broad potential to advance both fundamental research and translational biomedical applications.",

Understanding how these conserved modules mediate the interactions between Phytophthora effectors and host targets to manipulate plant immunity is crucial.

Transposon insertion induced truncation of WY(L) module, enabling PcAvh337b to target Arabidopsis cMyc binding protein 1 (AtMBP-1). While the existence of AtMBP-1 has been debated, this study demonstrates that alternative transcription initiation and translation can generate AtMBP-1, further revealing that AtMBP-1 compromises plant immune responses as a susceptibility factor. AtMBP-1 homeostasis is antagonistically regulated by N-terminal acetyltransferases A and C (NatA and NatC). By modulating AtMBP-1–Nat complexes, PcAvh337b enhances NatA-mediated acetylation of AtMBP-1 to protect AtMBP-1 from ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting P. capsici infection. These findings reveal a pathogenic mechanism through which an effector regulates AtMBP-1–Nat modules to suppress plant defense responses, highlighting virulence mechanisms diversification driven by effector dynamics.",

These neurons drive sensitization through a C4da-Goro circuit, where Neurexin modulates presynaptic GABA B receptor signaling to control nociceptive excitability.

Here, we reveal that the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional regulator basic helix-loop-helix 35 (bHLH35) is required for plant acclimation to a specific set of MFSC conditions that includes a combination of salinity, excess light, and heat, occurring simultaneously (but not to each of these stresses applied individually or in any other combination). Under the three-stress combination, bHLH35 interacts with no apical meristem/transcription activator factor/cup-shaped cotyledon 69 (NAC069), binds the promoter of lateral organ boundaries domain 31 (LBD31) , and regulates the expression of transcripts involved in flavonoid metabolism and ethylene signaling. Our findings uncover a high degree of specificity in plant responses to stress combination, suggesting that different conditions of MFSC could require the function of specific genetic programs for acclimation.",

Results reveal a deceptive global equilibrium. While TP flux declines in the Northern Hemisphere, driven by dam trapping, particularly in Western Europe (−16.2%) and Eastern Asia (−8.7%), it rises in the Southern Hemisphere due to increased fertilizer use and deforestation, especially in Southern Africa (+15%) and the Malay Archipelago (+20.3%). Notably, the number of small rivers with rising TP flux is nearly double that of large rivers. This growing TP export from small rivers and Southern Hemisphere basins may intensify eutrophication, expand hypoxic zones, and threaten fishery yields.

By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both periodic and quasi-periodic optical skyrmions, revealing a large degree of topological control. In a misaligned composite nanostructure, the rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved, which is explained by a lattice model.

Here, we examined the role of athlete-derived plasma extracellular vesicles (AEVs) in neuronal ferroptosis and motor function recovery after SCI. In a murine model, AEVs markedly inhibited ferroptosis and improved motor outcomes.

This homogeneous sensor is based on a self-assembled DNA nanosphere loaded with tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). The sensor operates in an “off-on” mode, in which bacterium-aptamer binding triggers a conformational change in the DNA nanosphere, releasing TCPP and generating an enhanced ECL signal. The inclusion of cerium nanoparticles boosts signal intensity through electrocatalytic reactions, improving sensitivity with a detection limit of ≤100 colony-forming units per milliliter. Integrated with a microfluidic chip, the system enables multibacterial detection in just 45 minutes.

          "abstract": "Organic thin-film transistors (TFTs) are of interest for flexible displays, sensors, and circuits. For all these applications, the TFTs must have a large on/off current ratio and a high transit frequency. A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current. Here, we lift this fundamental compromise and demonstrate organic TFTs that exhibit a complete absence of detrimental short-channel effects for channel lengths down to 300 nm, making it possible to simultaneously achieve the largest on/off current ratio (10 10 ) and the highest transit frequency (40 MHz) reported to date for flexible organic TFTs, despite the fact that these TFTs operate at very low voltages (≤3 V). These organic TFTs therefore meet the fundamental static and dynamic performance requirements for flexible, high-frequency, low-voltage, low-power electronic systems.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between light and matter can be enhanced by spatially concentrating the light field and extending photon dwell time. Plasmonic structures can provide strong light confinement but suffer from ohmic losses. Recent advances in dielectric nanostructures enable strong light localization without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we demonstrate a nanolaser that colocalizes photons and excited carriers within a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter yields a subdiffraction-limited mode volume and a subwavelength carrier volume without lateral quantum confinement. We observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, where enhanced mode localization produces stronger carrier confinement. By suppressing carrier surface recombination, this platform not only enables continuous-wave lasing at room temperature but also achieves a substantially reduced lasing threshold. We quantify the intensified interaction with an interaction volume, generalizing mode volume to a broad class of active media.",

Standard approaches to property estimation rely on detailed modeling of the measurement apparatus and a priori assumptions on their working principles. Even small deviations can greatly affect reconstruction accuracy and prediction reliability. Here, we demonstrate that quantum reservoir computing embodies a powerful alternative for witnessing quantum entanglement and, more generally, estimating quantum features from experimental data. We leverage the orbital angular momentum of photon pairs as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable informationally complete single-setting measurements of their polarization. Our approach does not require fine-tuning or refined knowledge of the setup, at the same time outperforming conventional approaches. It automatically adapts to noise and imperfections while avoiding overfitting, ensuring robust reconstruction of entanglement witnesses and paving the way to the assessment of quantum features of experimental multiparty states.",

Here, we determined the cell-intrinsic role of DOT1L in mature mouse CD8 T cells. After conditional deletion of Dot1L in vitro, CD8 T cells retained in vivo proliferative capacity and antitumor reactivity. Moreover, Dot1L knockout CD8 T cells showed increased antigen-specific cytotoxicity toward tumor cells in vitro. Mechanistically, loss of DOT1L resulted in an altered cell state with loss of T cell and gain of innate-like features. These transcriptional changes were mediated by loss of DOT1L methyltransferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show that in mature CD8 T cells, ablation of DOT1L activity is well tolerated and reprograms them to gain innate-like memory cell characteristics and enhance intrinsic cytotoxic capacity.",

Further investigation revealed that dephosphorylation of METTL3 S2 disrupted the METTL3–eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit H (eIF3H) interaction, thereby suppressing the translation of oncogenes involved in replication stress responses, including bromine domain protein 4 ( BRD4 ) and serpin family E member 2 ( SERPINE2 ), ultimately enhancing sensitivity to OXA. In addition, clinical investigation showed that METTL3 S2 phosphorylation was highly correlated with the response to GC OXA chemotherapy. In summary, base editor screen provides a versatile approach for exploring the role of phosphorylation sites in cancer chemotherapy.

Here, we present a regiospecific topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition for synthesizing crystalline covalent helical polymers via a single–crystal–to–single–crystal transformation. Building on our prior glycine-proline–based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit. This minor change induced a helicity reversal (left- to right-handed) and a substantial reduction in pitch (8.9 to 4.9 Å). Single-crystal x-ray diffraction revealed that this profound reordering is driven by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (C─H⋯O and O─H⋯N), acting as supramolecular bridges between helices, enabling denser packing. Consequently, the glycine-hydroxyproline–based polymer exhibited markedly enhanced mechanics, with a Young’s modulus of 18.57 ± 2.01 GPa and hardness of 1.09 ± 0.13 GPa, surpassing natural collagen. This study provides insights into controlling polymer topology and mechanics through subtle modifications, establishing a powerful paradigm for the design of next-generation helical materials with tailored functionalities.",

Comprehensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses show that the stability arises from a synergistic combination of Zintl phase formation between phosphorus and lithium atoms, noncovalent interhelical interactions, and geometric protection offered by the distinctive helical architecture. The nanoribbons show tunable optical properties dependent on temperature, thickness, and polarization state. It is demonstrated that these properties enabled nanoribbon-based hydrogels with self-healability and highly efficient photothermal conversion, showing a general approach for stabilizing active low-dimensional materials and paving the way for applying phosphorus-based nanostructures in biomedical engineering and quantum technologies.",

A dynamic, continuously tunable electro-mechano-acoustical model explains the mechanism and predicts frequency with R 2 = 0.990 . In emission, a 25.34-decibel sound pressure level gain was observed at resonance, enabling controllable, frequency-selective voice amplification for personalized output. In sensing, the LIG piezoresistive readout delivers sensitive transduction, while resonance matching amplifies weak, high-frequency cardiac sounds. Wearable tests on healthy volunteers and patients recorded clear S1/S2 and pathological murmurs. Integrated with AuscNet-H, a deep learning algorithm designed for heart sound classification, the system achieved 99.375% accuracy across four clinical classes.

Here, we proposed spectral fingerprint PCR (sf-PCR), which leverages three-dimensional fluorescence spectral fingerprints to profile biomarker expression patterns. These fingerprints capture both the position and intensity of fluorescence peaks, increasing information density and offering a breakthrough in spectral overlap. In addition, sf-PCR exhibits linear superimposability and decodability, providing a solid foundation for data interpretability. Using a 10-plex sf-PCR model, we demonstrated sf-PCR’s capacity to fundamentally overcome spectral overlap limitations.

Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25° to 95°C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release. Nucleation, expansion, and movement of microbubbles generate shear stresses capable of dislodging polymer protrusions at surface defect sites. This sweeping action, combined with the unbalanced surface tension forces at the three-phase contact line, generates O-shaped ring structures composed of accumulated polymers, which ultimately fragment leading to the release of MNPs into the aquatic environment.

It argues that governments adjust the social policy generosity when related issues become more salient. However, this only occurs under two conditions: when the broader public is in favour of more government spending, and only for welfare policies that favour large groups of beneficiaries (e.g. pensions, healthcare, and education) but not for smaller programmes (e.g. unemployment). Drawing on a dataset of 14 Western European countries between 2002 and 2018, findings largely confirm these expectations. I find no evidence of government responsiveness in unemployment compensation. Pensions and healthcare show responsiveness only when the public favours more spending. For education, I find symmetric effects: governments respond to important education issues by mirroring citizen preferences. These results contribute to the welfare state literature by introducing a generalizable framework that links public opinion and welfare generosity across different policies.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary populism is widely understood as a response to rising inequality and insecurity engendered by the neoliberal reshaping of labour and financial markets since the 1980s. Less is known about what populist governments do once in office. To address this question, we undertake a cross-national study which combines recently created datasets on populism and legal change. We find that populist governments, compared to non-populist ones, strengthen workers’ rights and weaken those of shareholders. However, a closer look at the types of labour and corporate laws adopted by populists tells a more nuanced story. Populist governments (both left- and right-wing) avoid taking steps to restore legal rights to trade unions, while the laws they adopt in the corporate sphere have the effect of protecting pro-populist business elites. This finding is consistent with the view of populism as less a rejection of neoliberalism than a mutation or adaptation of it.",
