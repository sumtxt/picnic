Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS–STING signalling 3 . However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1 4 , in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS–STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.",

          "abstract": "Volcanic crises, driven by renewed magma inflow and migration, result in surface deformation and seismicity that can provide unique insights into the structure of volcanic systems and magmatic processes. Although the highly explosive volcanoes of Santorini and Kolumbo 1,2 in the Greek Aegean Sea are just 7 km apart, their potentially coupled deep magmatic feeding systems are only poorly understood 3,4 . The 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis of Santorini simultaneously affected both volcanic centres, providing insights into a complex, multistorage feeder system. Here we integrate onshore and marine seismological data with geodetic measurements to reconstruct magma migration before and during the crisis. Gradual inflation in the Santorini caldera, beginning in mid-2024, preceded the January 2025 intrusion of a magma-filled dike sourced from a mid-crustal reservoir beneath Kolumbo, indicating a link between the two volcanoes. Joint inversion of ground and satellite-based deformation data indicates that approximately 0.31 km 3 of magma intruded as an approximately 13-km-long dike, reactivating principal regional faults and arresting 3–5 km below the seafloor. The 2024–2025 resurgence of magmatic activity beneath both volcanic centres and their apparent coupling provides insights into the dynamic interplay of magma storage, transport and reservoir failure beneath neighbouring volcanoes.",

          "abstract": "Chromosomal linkages formed through crossover recombination are essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis 1 . The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes 2 . Imperatively, the biased resolution of double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates into crossovers 3,4 occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologues during the pachytene stage 5,6 . However, the role of the SC in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into non-crossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, the stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs effectively coupling synapsis to dHJ formation and desynapsis to resolution. However, dHJ protection and CRC maintenance can occur without end-to-end homologue synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution to ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes.",

          "authors": "Adrian Henggeler, Lucija Orlić, Daniel Velikov, Joao Matos",
          "abstract": "Holliday junctions (HJs) are branched four-way DNA structures that link recombining chromosomes during double-strand break repair 1 . Despite posing a risk to chromosome segregation, HJs accumulate during meiotic prophase I as intermediates in the process of crossing-over 2,3 . Whether HJs have additional regulatory functions remains unclear. Here we establish an experimental system in budding yeast that enables conditional nucleolytic resolution of HJs after the establishment of meiotic chromosome synapsis. We find that HJ resolution triggers complete disassembly of the synaptonemal complex without disrupting the axis–loop organization of chromosomes. Mechanistically, HJs mediate the continued association of ZMM proteins with recombination nodules that form at the axes interface of homologous chromosome pairs. ZMM proteins, in turn, promote polymerization of the synaptonemal complex while simultaneously protecting HJs from processing by non-crossover pathways. Thus, reciprocal feedback between ZMMs, which stabilize HJs, and HJs, which retain ZMM proteins at future crossover sites, maintains chromosome synapsis until HJ-resolving enzymes are activated during exit from prophase I. Notably, by polymerizing and maintaining the synaptonemal complex structure, the HJ–ZMM interplay suppresses de novo double-strand break formation and recombination reinitiation. In doing so, this interplay suppresses the DNA damage response, enabling meiotic progression without unrepaired breaks and supporting crossover assurance.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumour derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells 1,2 . Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis 3,4 . Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity 5 . Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.",

          "abstract": "Barley is one of the oldest cultivated crops, with a complex evolutionary and domestication history 1 . Previous studies have rejected the idea of a single origin and instead support a model of mosaic genomic ancestry 2,3 . With increasingly comprehensive genome data, we now ask where the haplotypes — the building blocks of this mosaic — originate, and whether all domesticated barleys share the same wild progenitors or whether certain wild populations contribute more heavily to specific lineages. To address these questions, we apply a haplotype-based approach to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and domesticated barley. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 archaeological specimens, tracing the spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes and identifying wild contributors during domestication and later gene flow events. Ancient DNA supports our genome-wide findings from modern samples. Our results suggest that a founding domesticated population emerged in the Fertile Crescent during a prolonged period of pre-domestication cultivation. A key practical insight is that the high haplotype differentiation among barley populations — arising independently, or layered on top, of selection — poses challenges for mapping adaptive loci.",

We performed genome-wide screens in human primary CAR T cells, with readouts capturing key aspects of T cell biology, including proliferation, target cell recognition, activation, apoptosis and fratricide, and exhaustion. Screening hits were prioritized using a new in vivo CROP-seq 2 method in a xenograft model of human leukaemia, establishing several gene knockouts that boost CAR T cell efficacy. Most notably, we discovered that RHOG knockout is a potent and unexpected CAR T cell enhancer, both individually and together with FAS knockout, which was validated across multiple in vivo models, CAR designs and sample donors, and in patient-derived cells. Demonstrating the versatility of the CELLFIE platform, we also conducted combinatorial CRISPR screens to identify synergistic gene pairs and saturation base-editing screens to characterize RHOG variants. In summary, we discovered, validated and biologically characterized CRISPR-boosted CAR T cells that outperform standard CAR T cells in widely used benchmarks, establishing a foundational resource for optimizing cell-based immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated 1 . Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another 2,3 . This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures 4–7 . Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke 8 to generate a structurally frustrated 9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling.",

          "abstract": "The concentration of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions must be tightly controlled to maintain cellular homeostasis 1,2 . However, mechanisms for collective control of these proteins, which tend to localize to membraneless condensates, are less understood than pathways mediated by membrane-bound organelles 3,4 . Here we report ‘interstasis’, a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins.",

          "abstract": "Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings 1–8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry 9–11 . Here we show precise qubit operation of silicon two-qubit devices made with standard semiconductor tooling in a 300-mm foundry environment. Of the key metrics, single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceed 99% for all four devices, and the state preparation and measurement fidelities reach up to 99.9%, as evidenced by gate set tomography. We report spin lifetime and coherence up to T 1 = 9.5 s, $${T}_{2}^{* }=40.6\\,{\\rm{\\mu }}{\\rm{s}}$$ T 2 * = 40.6 μ s and $${T}_{2}^{{\\rm{Hahn}}}=1.9\\,{\\rm{ms}}$$ T 2 Hahn = 1.9 ms . We determine that residual nuclear spin-carrying isotopes contribute substantially to operational errors, identifying further isotopic purification as a clear pathway to even higher performance.",

          "abstract": "Social norms approaches have been widely applied in health promotion as a cost-effective behaviour-change strategy, but have been little evaluated as a whole. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using social norms messaging in developed countries targeted at changing health behaviours among 16+-year-olds to evaluate their effectiveness. Relevant studies were identified through searches in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, TRIP, Cochrane and grey literature sources. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis standardized effect sizes to Cohen’s d , assessed heterogeneity with I ² and applied robust Bayesian meta-analysis to adjust for publication bias. Searches resulted in 89 studies ( n = 85,759), which exhibited a small effect of social norms messaging on health behaviours (Cohen’s d = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.19], P &lt; 0.001). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for publication bias. We conducted moderator analyses, finding no significant differences from the overall effect for different types of social norms message, delivery modalities, health domains or target populations. The review is limited by the lack of studies assessing whether normative information changed participant perceptions, inconsistent use of manipulation checks, and high heterogeneity across studies in terms of target behaviour, population and intervention delivery, affecting the robustness of conclusions. Our analysis suggests that when appropriately controlling for publication bias, social norms messages are not effective at improving health behaviours. Thus, future attempts at improving public health should focus on alternative approaches.",

          "abstract": "Whether the risks of maternal and paternal suicide attempt during and after pregnancy differ remains unclear. Here, in this nationwide register-based study in Sweden (2,196,276 pregnancies), we defined the year before conception, pregnancy and the year after birth and estimated week-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs). We identified 7,469 (1.39 per 1,000 person-years) suicide attempts among mothers and 8,338 (1.62 per 1,000 person-years) among fathers. Compared with the corresponding week in the preconception period, mothers had a lower risk of suicide attempt during and after pregnancy (with the lowest IRR of 0.14 (0.11–0.17) at first week postpartum); fathers’ risk of suicide attempt remained largely stable before childbirth, but a lower risk was observed during the first 10 postpartum weeks (IRRs ranging from 0.69 (0.58–0.81) to 0.91 (0.84–0.99)), followed by a higher risk in the later postpartum period (IRRs ranging from 1.10 (1.01–1.21) to 1.72 (1.33–2.24)). Compared with fathers, mothers had a lower risk of suicide attempt during and after pregnancy (for example, IRR of 0.22 (0.18–0.28) at first week postpartum). Compared with the general population, the sex difference of suicide attempt is reversed during and after pregnancy, suggesting pregnancy or childbirth may have a more pronounced association with suicide attempt among mothers than fathers.",

          "authors": "Kathleen Segerson",
          "abstract": "There are a variety of contexts in which “pitching in” to address environmental or resource management problems could benefit from individuals or firms working not just on their own but also working together collaboratively as a group. Examples include working together on promoting conservation or habitat protection, the sharing of information, or the development of less polluting products or production processes. However, to date, the literature on environmental policy has considered only the incentives for individual parties (e.g., firms, landowners, or individuals) to take steps (i.e., exert “effort”) to reduce pollution or meet resource management goals where those steps impact that party’s own environmental footprint or performance. Missing from the literature is any consideration of the ability of one party to undertake activities that instead help another improve the latter’s performance. Such help could be either a substitute for or a complement to one’s own effort. This paper presents an analysis showing that traditional policy approaches based on individual performance cannot generally efficiently incentivize both effort and help, but a (properly designed) collective approach where rewards or punishments are based on group performance can. This suggests an additional rationale for the use of collective approaches as a potentially important tool for promoting sustainability that has not been recognized in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Climate policy design must balance emissions mitigation with concerns for fairness, particularly as climate change disproportionately affects the poorest households within and across countries. Integrated Assessment Models used for global climate policy evaluation have so far typically not considered inequality effects within countries. To fill this gap, we develop a global Integrated Assessment Model representing national economies and subnational income, mitigation cost, and climate damage distribution and assess a range of climate policy schemes with varying levels of effort sharing across countries and households. The schemes are consistent with limiting temperature increases to 2 °C and account for the possibility to use carbon tax revenues to address distributional effects within and between countries. We find that carbon taxation with redistribution improves global welfare and reduces inequality, with the most substantial gains achieved under uniform taxation paired with global per capita transfers. A Loss and Damage mechanism offers significant welfare improvements in vulnerable countries while requiring only a modest share of global carbon revenues in the medium term. The poorest households within all countries may benefit from the transfer scheme, in particular when some redistribution is made at the country level. Our findings underscore the potential for climate policy to advance both environmental and social goals, provided revenue recycling mechanisms are effectively implemented. In particular, they demonstrate the feasibility of a welfare improving global climate policy involving limited international redistribution.",

          "authors": "Isaac Slaughter, Axel Peytavin, Johan Ugander, Martin Saveski",
          "abstract": "Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,078 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 46.1% in reposts, 44.1% in likes, 21.9% in replies, and 13.5% in views after being attached. Over the posts’ entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.6% fewer reposts, 13.3% fewer likes, 6.9% fewer replies, and 5.5% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep and less “viral,” but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.",

          "abstract": "The Axarquía region in southern Spain, a hotspot of avocado and mango production in Europe, underwent an extreme water crisis in 2019–2024. Reservoir levels dropped below the 8% outlet threshold and groundwater in the main aquifer dropped to sea level in several locations, risking seawater intrusion. Socioeconomic impacts ranged from substantial crop losses to a potential long-term decline in regional economic viability. We examine the main drivers of this crisis using a coupled human and natural systems approach, combining an examination of water and land governance with analysis of time series (dam inflows and outflows, meteorological variables, reservoir, and groundwater levels) and spatial data (irrigated land use, groundwater bodies, water entitlement location, and volume). Our results show two severe meteorological droughts in close succession immediately preceding rapid declines in reservoir and groundwater reserves. Emergency measures delayed dam depletion but likely exacerbated groundwater extraction. Reservoir data disaggregating inflows, outflows, and uses (irrigation and urban) show an increasing trend in dam water use for irrigation in 2000–2022 associated with increasing irrigated area. Water management planning since 1998 reveals important inconsistencies within and between plans pointing to large uncertainties in freshwater availability and extraction and aquifer overdraft even during nondrought periods. The Axarquía case exhibits many symptoms of water crises faced by agriculturally significant regions globally. It highlights the necessity for integrated basin-scale land–water management, caps on irrigated area, flexible extraction quotas, real-time metering at all extraction points, and effective enforcement mechanisms, substantiating management lessons derived from major drought-affected regions worldwide.",

          "authors": "Derek E. Holliday, Yphtach Lelkes, Sean J. Westwood",
          "abstract": "Affective polarization is a corrosive force in American politics. While numerous studies have developed interventions to reduce it, their capacity for creating lasting, large-scale change is unclear. This study comprehensively evaluates existing interventions through a meta-analysis of 77 treatments from 25 published studies and two large-scale experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals that the average effect of treatments on animosity is modest (a 5.4-point shift on a 101-point scale), and decays within two weeks. We experimentally test whether stacking multiple treatments in one sitting or repeating them over time as “booster shots” enhances their impact. We find no evidence that multiple or repeated exposures produce substantially larger or more durable reductions in partisan animosity. This reveals the uneven utility of these interventions. They serve as valuable tools for testing the psychological mechanisms of polarization, but our findings indicate they are not, on their own, a scalable solution for reducing societal-level conflict. We conclude that achieving lasting depolarization will likely require a shift in focus, moving beyond individual-level treatments to address the elite behaviors and structural incentives that fuel partisan conflict.",

          "authors": "Zachary Horne, Mert Kobaş, Andrei Cimpian",
          "abstract": "Scientific explanation is one of the most sophisticated forms of human reasoning. Nevertheless, here we hypothesize that scientific explanation is susceptible to some of the same biases that influence everyday thinking—particularly during the initial stages of theory building, when scientists are first grappling with complex phenomena and are thus more likely to rely on explanatory “guesses.” Specifically, we investigated whether scientific explanation exhibits an inherence bias—a tendency to explain phenomena through inherent or intrinsic features rather than extrinsic factors such as context or relations. Consistent with this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of major explanatory transitions across the history of Western science revealed that initial scientific explanations systematically favored inherent properties, while subsequent explanations incorporated extrinsic factors more consistently. Seven experiments with lay participants (both adults and children; N = 1,673) and two experiments with practicing scientists from top departments worldwide ( N = 275) provided converging evidence for this bias and identified the psychological mechanisms involved. When explaining unfamiliar phenomena, even leading scientists showed a robust tendency to overweight inherent properties and underweight extrinsic factors relative to established scientific understanding.

          "abstract": "There is conflicting evidence on whether testosterone affects economic preferences such as risk taking, fairness, and altruism, with most evidence coming from correlational studies or small testosterone administration studies. To credibly test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale, preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial with 1,000 male participants—10 to 20 times larger than typical prior studies. Participants were randomly allocated to receive a single dose of either placebo or intranasal testosterone, and carried out a series of economic tasks capturing social preferences, competitiveness, and risk preferences. We find no evidence of a treatment effect for any of our nine primary outcome measures, and no strong evidence of an association between basal salivary testosterone and economic preferences within men. These results fail to conceptually replicate previous high-impact publications reporting positive findings in smaller samples, calling into question the idea that short-term testosterone fluctuations are important drivers of men’s economic preferences. Our results do not rule out the possibility that different effects might emerge under alternative dosages, administration protocols, or task timings, or that behavioral effects differ between men and women. The potential for developmental or long-term effects of testosterone also remains an open question for future research, though such effects are ethically challenging to investigate experimentally in humans.",

          "abstract": "Disparities in air pollution exposure by socioeconomic status (SES) are well documented. However, there is much less evidence on the inequitable consequences of water pollution and policies affecting water pollution gaps. This study uncovers the distributional impact of China’s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010), which triggered spatially differentiated water pollution abatement for a population of almost 1.3 billion. We document that the policy reduced water pollution overall, targeting areas based on pollution level. Since high pollution areas tend to be wealthier, this policy concentrated firm water pollution abatement and reductions in polluting firm entry in higher-SES areas. While pollution fell, the policy further widened the gap in health and economic outcomes, particularly for those without tap water access: Disparities in risks of tumor, cardiovascular disease, labor supply, and wages increased. Our findings demonstrate that policy-induced changes in water pollution can interact with unequal access to defensive infrastructure to exacerbate SES gaps in outcomes. The analysis also suggests that consideration of heterogeneous pollution vulnerability across the population may affect the overall benefits of a policy.",

In addition, its moderate temperature enables its atmosphere to host a range of carbon and oxygen species (H 2 O, CH 4 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 ). In this paper, we present a panchromatic emission spectrum of WASP-80 b, the first gas giant around a late K/early M-dwarf star and the coolest planet for which the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a complete emission spectrum spanning 2.4 to 12 μ m, including NIRCam F322W2 (2.4 to 4 μ m) and F444W (4 to 5 μ m), and MIRI LRS (5 to 12 μ m). We report confident detections of H 2 O, CH 4 , CO, and CO 2 , and a tentative detection of NH 3 . We estimate WASP-80 b’s atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio and compare them with estimates for other gas giants. Despite the relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars, we find that WASP-80 b’s composition is consistent with other hot gas giants, suggesting that the formation pathway of WASP-80 b may not be dissimilar from hot gas giants around higher-mass stars.",

Cells infected with the RR vaccine candidate led to the formation of virus-like particles that, due to the failure of being secreted, increase vaccine safety, in contrast to the wild type virions. The replicon maintained the production of RNAs encoding at least proteins S, M, and N for several days. Intranasal immunization with the RR of transgenic mice, expressing human ACE2, elicited respiratory mucosal immunity. Immunization protected against challenge with SARS-CoV-2, inducing IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike (S) protein, the receptor binding domain, N and M proteins, and cellular immune responses (CD4 + , CD8 + , and long-term memory T cells). Coinfection of cells with the RR vaccine and a full-length SARS-CoV-2 led to a significant inhibition of replication of full-length virus, increasing the safety of the RR vaccine. The RR vaccine induced a minor inflammatory reaction in the absence of major side effects and was stable at different temperatures.

Here, we combined time-resolved functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging to investigate temporal profiles of the reciprocal modulation between EIB and functional network dynamics during working memory tasks in healthy subjects. We quantified EIB kinetics by measuring excitatory (Glx) and inhibitory (GABA+) levels and assessed their temporal coupling with dynamic functional connectivity states, revealing a dependence that scales with cognitive load. Notably, we found that as cognitive challenges intensify, brain networks transition toward more specialized and enduring connectivity configurations, accompanied by imbalances that favor excitation, changes that may impact cognitive adaptability. Fluctuations in EIB and functional connectivity occurred on comparable timescales and were both associated with individual differences in cognitive performance. Importantly, this experimental approach demonstrates a close synergy between EIB kinetics, brain network dynamics, and cognitive performance, defining the groundwork for exploring healthy and aberrant cognitive states.",

          "abstract": "Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have revolutionized pest management, but their benefits have been reduced by evolution of practical resistance in at least 31 cases. To delay evolution of resistance, farmers have shifted from crops producing one Bt protein to crops called pyramids that produce two or more Bt proteins or other traits targeting each pest. Here, we focus on resistance to transgenic corn pyramids in the western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera ) and northern corn rootworm ( Diabrotica barberi ), which cost farmers in the United States $2 billion yearly in yield losses. We analyzed 998 relevant data values for 2005 to 2023 from 12 published field studies. The results support the hypothesis that rootworm resistance to Bt proteins Cry3Bb and Gpp34/Tpp35Ab reduces the efficacy of pyramids that produce one or both of these proteins and an RNA interference trait (DvSnf7) targeting rootworms, despite no apparent strong cross-resistance between the Bt proteins and DvSnf7. The reduced efficacy of pyramids producing Bt proteins and DvSnf7 entails increased root injury and emergence of adult beetles. Efficacy of DvSnf7 was substantially lower for reducing root injury than emergence. Because root injury decreases yield, the increased root injury has immediate practical consequences. More sustainable control may be achieved by deploying pyramids with traits that are each highly effective against rootworms, increasing the abundance of host plants that do not target rootworms, and combining transgenic corn with crop rotation and other control tactics in integrated pest management programs.",

This feature complicates cultivation and postharvest processing for many crops, yet the molecular mechanisms governing this specific sclerification process remain unclear. By genome editing screening, we identified a MYB family gene named S HORT and S OFT T HORN 1 ( SST1 ) that specifically promotes the development of sclerenchyma cells at Citrus thorn tips. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of SST1 results in the formation of short and soft thorns with significantly reduced secondary wall thickening at the tips, while leaving stem growth unaffected. SST1 directly activates NST1 and SND1 , driving a hierarchical transcriptional regulatory network for secondary wall biosynthesis. Moreover, SST1 homologs in various species are specifically expressed in thorns, suggesting a potential conserved role. Our results uncover the molecular basis for hard plant protective structures, and modulation of this pathway could be an effective strategy for optimizing cultivation practices.",

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, animals make optimal decisions to ensure their well-being. Faced with limited food sources, they often seek foods that provide the nutrients they require to maintain homeostasis. Under extreme circumstances (e.g., infection), they may exhibit ingestive behaviors, such as seeking out substances (e.g., toxins) that suggest self-medication. Few studies, however, have investigated the mechanisms that ensue self-medication. Here, we report the selective intake of antioxidants by Drosophila melanogaster during a period of heat stress or sleep deprivation. This preference was alleviated by prefeeding them vitamin C or dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before exposure to stress. Heat stress led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the gut, which was alleviated by the intake of vitamin C. Heat stress reduced vitamin C in hemolymph, whereas the consumption of vitamin C or DHA increased it. Furthermore, the intake of vitamin C ameliorated the intestinal barrier dysfunction and extended the survival of flies that had been exposed to chronic heat stress. The heat-induced preference for vitamin C appears to develop independently of the known peripheral chemosensory receptors for this micronutrient. We propose that fruit flies possess an interoceptive mechanism that mediates the detection of vitamin C to overcome environmental challenges.",

We demonstrate that spr-5; met-2 double mutant worms have a severe chemotaxis defect caused by the ectopic expression of germline genes in somatic tissues. Despite this behavioral defect, we observe few embryonic lineage alterations and the normal complement of neurons. This raised the possibility that the abnormal chemotaxis behavior may be due to ongoing defects in terminally differentiated cells rather than alterations in development. Consistent with this possibility, we find that shutting off the ectopic expression of germline genes specifically in neurons rescues chemotaxis in spr-5; met-2 mutants. Remarkably, shutting off the ectopic germline expression in spr-5; met-2 adult worms, that had a chemotaxis defect earlier in development, is also sufficient to rescue chemotaxis behavior. These results suggest that ongoing inappropriate transcription in neurons can block normal behavior despite the chemotaxis neurons being intact.",

On the theoretical side, Φ ID reveals the existence of previously unreported modes of collective information flow, providing tools to express well-known measures of information transfer, information storage, and dynamical complexity as aggregates of these modes, thereby overcoming some of their known theoretical shortcomings. On the empirical side, we validate our theoretical results with computational models and examples from over 1,000 biological, social, physical, and synthetic dynamical systems.

Integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Life Cycle Costing (LCC), we quantified the environmental impacts alongside capital and operational costs, net present costs, and break-even prices of each route. The results reveal significant variation across the schemes, with Schemes #1 and #2 exhibiting the highest impacts and costs due to intensive use of chloroform and diethyl ether, while Scheme #8 demonstrated the lowest impacts and costs, benefitting from higher batch output, greener solvents, and process intensification. Scenario analyses showed that solvent recovery improves sustainability only when high recovery rates are combined with clean electricity; otherwise, the additional energy demand may offset benefits. Scale-up analysis confirmed that higher production scales substantially reduce per-gram impacts and costs, supporting economies of scale. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent management, energy sourcing, the use of sustainability assessment at the earliest stages of innovation, and process design in aligning green chemistry with economic viability. The proposed integrated LCA-LCC framework provides transferable insights to guide sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing and supports the development of evidence-based policy for greener antiviral drug production.",

          "abstract": "Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic “triangular keyhole” shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular keyhole shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and find that the hindgut deforms in two stages: An initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.",

          "abstract": "Canonical bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) detect cues by sensors with opposing kinase and phosphatase activities to alter the level of phosphorylation of cognate response regulators to mediate responses. We previously identified the Campylobacter jejuni BumSR TCS as the founding member of a bacterial TCS family in which the sensor solely functions as a phosphatase. Sensing specific intestinal metabolites inhibits BumS dephosphorylation of phospho-BumR (P-BumR) to impact BumR as a transcriptional regulator of genes influencing host colonization. Since BumS lacks kinase activity, BumR must depend upon a noncognate phosphodonor in the bacterium to form P-BumR. Through a genetic screen and selection, physiological assays, and biochemical analysis, we identified acetyl phosphate (AcP) and carbamoyl phosphate (CP) as natural in vivo phosphodonors for BumR. In C. jejuni , AcP and CP are products of metabolic pathways fueled by amino acids favored by the bacterium as carbon sources for growth. Producing and utilizing AcP and CP as bona fide BumR phosphodonors allows BumSR to integrate different types of inputs for signal transduction. Microbiota-generated gut metabolites are cues for BumS to control its phosphatase activity for P-BumR and inform about the spatial location of C. jejuni in host intestines. In contrast, AcP and CP are cues for BumR that directly influence P-BumR levels and activity and inform about the richness of favored carbon sources in intestinal niches for optimal energy generation and metabolism. Our study reveals how a bacterial TCS strategically integrates information from multiple cues through both essential components for optimal signal transduction.",

          "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) entry into host cells begins with interactions between the viral envelope proteins hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) and sialic acid moieties on the cell plasma membrane. These interactions drive IAV’s lateral diffusion along the cell membrane and trigger membrane morphological changes required for endocytosis. However, directly visualizing these dynamic processes, which are crucial for IAV entry, has been challenging using conventional microscopy techniques. In this study, we enabled live-cell observation of nanoscale morphological dynamics of IAV and the cell membrane by reducing the mechanical invasiveness of atomic force microscopy (AFM). A customised cantilever with less than half the spring constant of conventional cantilevers enabled virus-view AFM imaging that preserved IAV–membrane interactions. By combining virus-view AFM with confocal microscopy, we performed correlative morphological and fluorescence observations of IAV lateral diffusion and endocytosis in living cells. Variations in diffusion coefficients of single virions suggested heterogeneity in sialic acid density on the cell membrane. NA inhibition decreased diffusion coefficients, while reduced sialic acid density increased them. The timing of clathrin accumulation at virion binding sites coincided with a decrease in diffusion coefficients, a relationship that was maintained independent of NA activity or sialic acid density.

          "abstract": "While air heat waves often grab headlines, riverine heat waves have gone quietly unnoticed because rivers are commonly perceived as cool refuges. Analysis of riverine heat waves has been hindered by fragmented datasets, despite a proliferation in water-temperature monitoring with sensors and satellites. Here, we analyze riverine heat wave events by training one single deep learning (long short-term memory) model and reconstructing consistent and continuous daily water temperatures (WT) in 1471 sites in the Contiguous United States (1980–2022). We show that riverine heat waves occur at about half the frequency (2.3 versus 4.6 events/year), a third intensity (2.6 versus 7.7 °C/event), but almost double the duration (7.2 versus 4.0 d/event) of air heat waves. Riverine heat wave events have increased at double to quadruple rates of air heat wave events, amounting to an additional 1.8 events/year in frequency, 0.43 °C/event in intensity, 3.4 d/event in duration, and 7 to 15 additional thermal stress days for aquatic ecosystems in 2022 compared to 1980. Rising riverine heat waves have outpaced those of air heat waves in 65 to 76% of the sites, particularly in regions experiencing accelerated warming (e.g., the Rockies). Riverine heat wave trends are driven predominantly by climate-induced changes such as warming and dwindling snowpacks and water flow. Human activities do play important roles: large dams elongate, whereas agriculture reduces heat waves. These results highlight anthropogenic climate change as the primary external driver, whereas human-induced structural changes as the secondary internal modulators of river response to heat disturbance. The widespread rise of riverine heat waves threatens aquatic ecosystems and water-energy-food security, underscoring the need for their global characterization and risk assessment.",

          "abstract": "R-loops are an important class of non-B DNA structures that form co-transcriptionally. Using in vitro transcription and unbiased quantitative sequencing readouts, we show that the addition of single-strand DNA binding proteins co-transcriptionally can drive a 3- to 5-fold increase of R-loop frequency without significant changes to R-loop distribution. We propose that this is caused by stabilizing and preventing the collapse of short nascent R-loops. This suggests that R-loop formation is highly dynamic and highlights single strand binding proteins as players in cellular R-loop regulation. We further show that nontemplate strand DNA nicks are powerful initiators of R-loop formation, increasing R-loop frequencies by up to two orders of magnitude. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the nontemplate strand in nick-initiated structures is often flayed away from the RNA:DNA hybrid and engaged in self-pairing, creating unique forked R-loop features. DNA nicks, one of the most frequent DNA lesions in cells, are therefore potential hotspots for opportunistic R-loop initiation and may cause the formation of a distinct class of R-loops. Overall, this work highlights the importance of the displaced single-strand on R-loop initiation and dynamics.",

This interaction drives highly specialized transcription in the subsynaptic or NMJ myonuclei within mature myofibers leading to clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Here, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to delineate the transcriptional response of myonuclei to denervation. Through snRNA-seq on skeletal muscle from two independent mouse models of denervation, sciatic nerve transection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we identify a multimodal transcriptional response of NMJ-enriched genes and an alteration in cholesterol homeostasis in myofibers. Gramd1 , a family of genes involved in nonvesicular cholesterol transport, are enriched at the NMJ in innervated muscle and upregulated in both models of denervation by the NMJ and extrasynaptic myonuclei. In vivo gain and loss of function studies indicate that Gramd1 genes regulate myofiber sizes. Mechanistically, we did not detect obvious changes in AChR clustering due to Gramd1 knockdown but revealed a role in autophagy after denervation. We uncovered a dynamic transcriptional response of myonuclei to denervation and highlight a critical role for Gramd1 to maintain myofiber sizes.",

          "abstract": "Creativity in the arts, such as painting and musical performance, hinges on the ability to produce a wide spectrogram of perceptual experiences. In music, it has long been believed that the timbre of tones can be altered by nuanced movements of performers. Previous studies have described relationships between fundamental elements of auditory perceptions (e.g., loudness, tempo) and physical movements (e.g., force, speed), but it remains unknown whether and how delicate features of perceptual experiences such as tone timbre are manipulated through dexterous motor skills. Here, we bridge this gap using a twofold experimental approach. First, our listening test revealed that the timbral qualities pianists intended to express in piano playing were perceived as intended by both pianists and musically untrained individuals, with pianists showing a greater perceptual sensitivity to different timbres. Second, through a motor behavioral experiment using a noncontact, high-resolution sensing system, we identified five specific movement features in piano touch that were intricately linked to three categories of perceived timbre; weight, clarity, and brightness. Furthermore, the direct manipulation of a specific key movement feature resulted in systematic changes in perceived timbre, providing evidence for a causal relationship. The result indicates that pianists share common motor skills to modify perceived tone timbre by manipulating specific movement features. Our findings underscore the pivotal roles of subtle physical gestures in creating the rich timbral palette of piano tones, advancing our understanding of the intersection between motor control and artistic expression.",

Here, we demonstrate the widespread occurrence of nonconventional introns (71.8% of all introns) in the Euglena agilis genome and identify consensus motifs at these nonconventional exon–intron boundaries. We assessed the splicing efficiency of nonconventional introns and variants with point mutations via genomic knock-in within the second exon of Glucan synthase-like 2 in Euglena gracilis and genetically defined the sequence signature (5′-N 3 CDG-/-CH′GN 5–6 |R exon -3′) required for their proper splicing.

Here, we use FMAPB2 to precompute pair interaction energies and then use the latter to drive simulations of dense protein solutions. The resulting MAEPPI (many-protein atomistic energy from precomputed pair interaction) enables simulations of atomistic proteins at the speed of Lennard-Jones particles. On snapshots sampled from the simulations, we directly calculate the SAS profile.

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a clinically important herpesvirus that has coevolved for millions of years with its human host, and establishes lifelong persistent infection. A substantial proportion of its 235 kb genome is dedicated to manipulating host immunity through targeting antiviral host proteins for degradation or relocalization. Quantitative proteomics of the infected cell has extensively characterized these processes, but the cell-free virion has been less well studied. We therefore carried out proteomic analysis of a clinical HCMV strain (Merlin) virion. This revealed 18 novel components, including the viral protein gpUL141, which is recognized as an NK immune-evasin that targets several host proteins (CD155, CD112, and TRAILR) when expressed within the cell. Coimmunoprecipitation of gpUL141 from virions identified interactions with viral entry glycoproteins from the trimer (gH/gL/gO), pentamer (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A), and gH/gpUL116 complexes, as well as gB. Only interactions with gH/gB occurred in the absence of other viral proteins. Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/Golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytium formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.",

          "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases and biological invasions pose increasing threats to public and ecosystems health. Proactive measures—such as prevention and surveillance taken before initial detection of the pathogen or species—are essential to ensure minimal spread prior to first detection. We developed an optimization model to determine where, when, and how much effort should be allocated to prevention versus surveillance. The model accounts for imperfect detection, system dynamics, spatial heterogeneity in risk and costs and is scalable to large landscapes. We found that the most cost-effective strategy is to maintain the prevention and surveillance efforts at stable equilibrium for the majority of the time, with deviations occurring only initially to steer the system toward the equilibrium. The equilibrium effort is jointly determined by the introduction risk, management costs, and total budget. Application of this model to chronic wasting disease in New York State suggests that the optimal strategy could reduce the cumulative disease cases before initial detection by an average of 22% compared to current practice. The optimal surveillance strategy could detect the disease on average over 8 mo earlier than the current strategy.",

Of the virus-encoded proteins, multifunctional EBOV VP35 (eVP35) is necessary for host immune evasion and viral RNA synthesis. Previous proteomics studies identified an interaction between eVP35 and the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb 2 (MIB2). Here, we show how an NNLNS (Asn-Asn-Leu-Asn-Ser) motif (residues 201 to 205) within eVP35 serves as a binding site for MIB2. This motif is critical for eVP35-dependent inhibition of MIB2-mediated interferon induction. It is also important for EBOV RNA synthesis as MIB2 binding to eVP35 inhibited EBOV minigenome activity. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of the eVP35 protein and the role of host factors in EBOV infection.",

Here, we provide a reference genome for the highly invasive fern Lygodium microphyllum and compare the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of its gametophyte and sporophyte life phases. Under ambient conditions, we found differential regulation and splicing of developmental genes (homeobox and MADS-box clades) may play a role in the genomic determination of the haploid and diploid life stages. We generated a base pair-resolution methylome of a fern gametophyte, and determined that methylation patterns are remarkably similar between vegetative tissues despite their morphological and functional differences. We further explored the physiological and transcriptomic responses of gametophytes and sporophytes to freezing stress, the most likely abiotic factor limiting further range expansion of this invasive species. While controlled by the same genome, we show that life phases and tissues use alternative molecular pathways in response to freezing and greater physiological resilience in the gametophyte life stage to this stressor. Our results underscore the need to incorporate both life phases when developing effective mitigation strategies, as differential responses to environmental stressors between phases reveal opportunities for management approaches (e.g., targeting gametophytes in addition to sporophytes).

Incurring AL during sensitive developmental periods such as childhood may affect health outcomes later in life, but longitudinal measures to test these life course effects are lacking. This study tested associations between childhood AL and adult cardiometabolic health in a large sample of youth repeatedly measured across ages 9 to 16, and their adult cardiometabolic health at age 30. AL scores were calculated at each age by summing across sex- and age-standardized values for biomarkers representing immune (C-Reactive Protein, Epstein–Barr Virus antibodies), neuroendocrine (cortisol, DHEA-s), and cardiometabolic indicators (body mass index; BMI). Adult cardiometabolic health was measured using a composite sum score of sex-standardized systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio. Multiple approaches aggregating repeated AL scores were tested, including mean, maximum, oldest available AL score across childhood, and a version omitting BMI from the index. Childhood AL was significantly associated with adult cardiometabolic health ( P &lt; 0.001), with higher AL predicting worse cardiometabolic outcomes at age 30 in all models, regardless of how AL was defined. Sensitivity analyses to address potential bias from missing observations using 20 imputed datasets were consistent with unimputed models. Follow-up analyses suggested risk for adult cardiometabolic outcomes was primarily associated with C-reactive protein, DHEA-s, and childhood BMI. In this cohort study, physiological dysregulation experienced in early life had lasting consequences. These results underscore the importance of childhood as a sensitive period during which cumulative stress exposure can shape long-term health trajectories.",

Clinical bedaquiline resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rapidly emerged, primarily due to mutations in the transcriptional repressor Rv0678 that result in upregulation of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump MmpS5/MmpL5 (MmpS5L5). Here, to understand how MmpS5L5 effluxes bedaquiline, we determined the structure of the MmpS5L5 complex using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a trimeric architecture distinct from the canonical tripartite RND efflux pumps of gram-negative bacteria. Structure prediction modeling in conjunction with functional genetic analysis indicates that it uses a periplasmic coiled-coil tube to transport molecules across the cell wall. Structure-guided genetic approaches identify MmpL5 mutations that alter bedaquiline transport; these mutations converge on a region in MmpL5 located in the lower portion of the periplasmic cavity, proximal to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, suggesting a route for bedaquiline entry into the pump. While currently known clinical resistance to bedaquiline is due to pump upregulation, our findings that several MmpL5 variants increase bedaquiline efflux may presage the emergence of additional modes of clinical resistance.",

We show that Insep loss leads to early larval lethality with small brains and these phenotypes can be rescued by expressing IER3IP1 indicating that their biological function is conserved through evolution. The Insep deficient neuroblasts fail to complete cytokinesis and show excessive accumulation of Rab11 vesicles in the cytoplasm. Similarly, IER3IP1 depletion in human cells leads to cytokinesis failure and accumulation of Rab11 vesicles. Insep and IER3IP1 localize to Rab11 vesicles and interact with Rab11. The pathogenic mutations in IER3IP1 perturb its localization to Rab11 vesicles.

The evolutionary relationship between EmcB and other deubiquitinases is currently unknown. Here, we show that EmcB defines a broad family of bacterial deubiquitinases divergently evolved from the eukaryotic Ovarian Tumor (OTU) family of deubiquitinases. Our data indicate that the emcB gene has an internal gene rearrangement that resulted in a circular permutation of the OTU fold. Proteins with a region homologous to the deubiquitinase domain of EmcB were identified in numerous members of the bacterial order Legionellales. Proteins with an EmcB-related deubiquitinase domain demonstrated cysteine protease activity that cleaved ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related modifiers. Most of the bacteria encoding EmcB-related proteins had components of the Dot/Icm Type IVB secretion system that delivers EmcB into host cells. Indeed, many of these EmcB-related proteins were translocated into eukaryotic cells by the Dot/Icm system of Legionella pneumophila , consistent with their predicted roles as bacterial effector proteins that target host pathways. Comparison of EmcB family deubiquitinases revealed a two-domain architecture of EmcB comprising a deubiquitinase domain and a ubiquitin binding module that confers enzyme specificity for certain polyubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin binding region in EmcB was found to be necessary for efficient inhibition of RIG-I signaling. Thus, these EmcB-related proteins represent a large family of deubiquitinating enzymes that arose by divergent evolution in Legionellales , likely enabling these bacteria to infect different host cells by targeting signaling pathways regulated by ubiquitin.",

We used diet data from 13 species, 57 populations, and over 500 individuals to examine predictors of niche breadth and interindividual diet variation at a landscape scale. Then, to test whether these patterns are conserved across scales, we explored the same questions using a single population sampled over 5 y and mark-recapture data from individuals sampled at least three times. We found that woodrats exhibited a continuum of dietary specialization that included species-level dietary generalists and specialists. Specialist species maintained narrow population-level niche breadths with little evidence of interindividual diet variation. In contrast, generalist species consisted of populations with varying degrees of dietary specialization and interindividual diet variation. Across sampling scales, increased population-level niche breadth was explained by both increased interindividual diet variation and increased diet richness. These results are consistent with the Niche Variation Hypothesis and suggest that diet breadth is constrained by costs of both specialization and generalization.",

          "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) can be both activators and repressors of gene transcription. This can manifest as “duality,” where the transcriptional response increases (activation) with TF concentration in one context but decreases (repression) in another context, or as “nonmonotonicity,” where, in the same context, the response increases in part of the concentration range and decreases outside that range. Here we use biophysical models of gene regulation to investigate how duality and nonmonotonicity relate to the interactions between a TF, Polymerase and the regulatory DNA. We distinguish two modes of TF action on Polymerase: “coherent,” with interactions either positive or negative, and “incoherent,” where interactions are a mix of both. For TFs that act incoherently from a single TF–DNA binding site, nonmonotonicity can arise, but only under nonequilibrium models. For single-site models, we show that nonmonotonicity can never happen under the common thermodynamic models of gene regulation, which consider equilibrium conditions and ignore the dissipative nature of the transcription process. Moreover, we show that merely changing the TF–DNA binding affinity, while keeping other features fixed, can tune the response between activation and repression, with responses either evaluated as a function of TF concentration or site number. Using the mammalian Sp1 as a case study and synthetically designed target sequences, we find experimental evidence for nonmonotonicity, and activation or repression tuned by affinity, which we interpret as evidence of incoherent action. Our work highlights the importance of moving from a TF-centric view to a systems view when reasoning about transcriptional control.",

A [4Fe-4S] subcluster of the H-cluster is synthesized by housekeeping iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, and then dedicated hydrogenase maturation enzymes, together with components of the glycine cleavage system, build and deliver a [2Fe] subcluster to generate the full H-cluster. Here, we report that the Escherichia coli iron-sulfur carrier protein NfuA supports in vitro maturation of fully active [FeFe]-hydrogenase, with H 2 production rates comparable to that of the in vivo - matured Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [FeFe]-hydrogenase ( Cr HydA). Inclusion of NfuA in the in vitro maturation process improves its efficacy by delivering the iron essential for formation of the [Fe II (cys)(CN)(CO) 2 ] – synthon at the dangler iron site of the HydG auxiliary cluster. NfuA serves an additional role in reconstituting and maintaining the catalytically essential iron-sulfur clusters on the maturase enzymes HydE, HydF, and HydG. Further inclusion of a high CO affinity myoglobin variant (Mb H64L ) sequesters free CO generated during the maturation process, minimizing formation of the CO-inhibited H ox -CO enzyme state, significantly increasing hydrogenase activity. The addition of NfuA and Mb H64L to the fully defined maturation system thus results in an in vitro [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation system that generates highly active enzyme while providing insights into factors important to in vivo maturation.",

One possibility is to explore genetic modifiers that improve muscle regeneration and function. The beneficial effects of the overexpression of Jagged-1 were described in escaper golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs that had a near-normal life and validated in dystrophin-deficient zebrafish. To clarify the underlying biology of JAG1 overexpression in dystrophic muscles, we generated a transgenic mouse (mdx 5cv - JAG1 ) model that lacks dystrophin and overexpresses human JAG1 in striated muscles. Skeletal muscles from mdx 5cv - JAG1 and mdx 5cv mice were studied at 1-, 4-, and 12-mo time points. JAG1 expression in mdx 5cv - JAG1 increased by 3 to 5 times compared to mdx 5cv . Consequently, mdx 5cv - JAG1 muscles were significantly bigger and stronger than dystrophic controls, along with an increased number of myofibers. Proteomics data show increased dysferlin in mdx 5cv - JAG1 muscles and an association of the histone methyltransferase Nsd1 with the phenotype. Our data support the positive effect of JAG1 overexpression in dystrophic muscles.",

C4d and LilrB2 colocalize at excitatory synapses in the human cerebral cortex as well as with beta amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). C4d, as well as C4, increase with age and more so in AD. To examine whether C4d-PirB interactions can drive pruning, dendritic spines—the postsynaptic structure of excitatory synapses—were monitored on L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex: A significant decrease in dendritic spine density occurred in WT with C4d exposure, but KO of PirB completely prevented this loss. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for C4d in pruning and imply that different complement cascade components may collaborate to engage both neuronal and glial-specific effectors of synaptic pruning.",

However, the potential coupling of compartmentalization chemistry with the intrinsic chemical activity of prebiotic compartments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that anion–π interactions, which are largely overlooked in the chemistry of phase transition, can drive the formation of micron-sized assemblies. These structures further recruit cations to form anion–π–cation triads. Such assemblies mediate spontaneous oxygenation reactions through their electrochemical environments. This process provides a plausible prebiotic pathway for bioenergetics and molecular oxygen generation on early Earth, leading to the formation of primitive pigments via the oxidation of small molecules and the nontemplated selection of protocells through oxidation-dependent lipid degradation. Our findings highlight a simple yet functionally significant noncovalent interaction that introduces chemical functions into self-assembly and phase transition chemistry, delivering generalizable principles for engineering electrochemically active supramolecular assemblies and a conceptual framework in understanding abiotic evolution and selection.",

          "abstract": "G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large class of membrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to a wide range of external signals and as such constitute major drug targets. While oligomerization has been shown to play a well-established role in modulating signaling for class C GPCRs (e.g., the glutamate and GABA receptors), the functional relevance of oligomerization for class A receptors, such as the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR), remains unclear. Here, we have examined the influence of the membrane mimetic environment on the dimerization propensity of β 1 AR using a combination of pulsed Q-band double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and single-molecule fluorescence brightness measurements in an Anti-Brownian Elektrokinetic trap. While β 1 AR is predominantly monomeric in docecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) micelles, reconstitution of β 1 AR in lipid nanodiscs preferentially favors symmetric parallel dimers. Using nanodiscs of different diameters we observed a clear size-dependent increase in the dimer fraction, reaching over 50% of the β 1 AR molecules in large (~12.5 nm diameter) nanodiscs. Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate, an analog of cholesterol, suppresses β 1 AR dimerization in lipid nanodiscs, recapitulating the behavior in DDM micelles. This work provides quantitative evidence that β 1 AR possesses an intrinsic, membrane sensitive predisposition for dimerization, and highlights the importance of spatial membrane constraints in the modulation of class A GPCR dimerization.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and m 6 A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) across multiple time points postinjury revealed a strong correlation between m 6 A modifications and genes enriched in microglia/macrophages. Furthermore, the m 6 A demethylase ALKBH5 was identified as a key regulator of dynamic m 6 A patterns at the injury site. ALKBH5 suppression in microglia/macrophages exacerbated neuroinflammation in vitro and worsened neurological deficits in controlled cortical impact (CCI) models. MeRIP-qPCR and RNA pull-down assays revealed SOCS3 was a downstream target of ALKBH5-mediated m 6 A demethylation. This demethylation stabilized Socs3 mRNA and enhanced its protein expression, which in turn suppressed neuroinflammation via inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Conversely, SOCS3 depletion impaired functional recovery after injury.

Fast turnover of nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2) filaments is necessary to keep up with cell motility and shape changes. The turnover mechanisms are not fully understood and differ for two main mammalian paralogs—NM2A and NM2B—whereas paralog copolymerization adds complexity to this process by enabling the intrinsically fast NM2A to dynamize the intrinsically slow NM2B. Here, we show that the nonhelical tail, the C-terminal phosphorylation sites, and surprisingly, the motor domain of the NM2A heavy chain synergistically accelerate the turnover of NM2B in trans and cell motility, suggesting that these three mechanisms collectively control NM2A’s own dynamics. Conversely, the phosphomimetic NM2B tail facilitates only local turnover of endogenous wild type NM2B but not its global redistribution unless the NM2A motor is combined with the phosphomimetic NM2B tail. Collectively, we reveal the cooperation between the motor activity and the NM2 tail-targeting turnover mechanisms in regulating the NM2 filament turnover in trans and cell motility.",

Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU , impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes.

Here, we combine nutrient analysis of fish samples with national household surveys from across East and West Africa to understand the importance of dried fish in diets. We find that small portions of dried fish contribute over 15% of recommended intakes for multiple essential dietary nutrients (calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, and vitamins B12 and D), with low heavy metal concentrations, and are consumed weekly by ~one-third of households in six countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) (~144 million people). Dried fish consumption was more prevalent than fresh fish, reaching 54% more people, particularly those in poor households and near to marine coastlines or urban centers. The widespread prevalence of nutritious dried fish suggests that these foods and their distribution networks play critical roles in food security and nutrition, even in households distant from fisheries or urban centers. Dried fish can fill nutrient gaps across the tropics but will require policies that mitigate negative effects of overfishing, environmental changes, and competition with international markets, while providing postharvest support to fish processors.",

Mice lacking FGF21 had decreased food intake, body weight, and body temperature compared to wild-type mice following influenza virus inoculation, indicating reduced tolerance to the infection. Conversely, pharmacologic administration of FGF21 after viral infection protected mice against these pathologic changes. Pair feeding studies showed that neither the induction of FGF21 nor the hypothermia was secondary to decreased food intake. Notably, mice selectively lacking FGF21’s coreceptor protein, βKlotho, in noradrenergic neurons were also more susceptible to influenza virus infection, including hypothermia. We show that FGF21 acting on noradrenergic neurons, including those in the locus coeruleus region, stimulates energy expenditure and thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Our findings reveal an FGF21-regulated neuronal pathway that protects mice against influenza infection and suggest the potential utility of using FGF21 pharmacologically to improve outcomes after influenza infection.",

We found productive infection of WD-HAE requires apical inoculation of hMPV, with infectious spread dependent on progeny viruses shedding into mucus secretions overlaying the apical surface of WD-HAE. A potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against hMPV fusion protein—mAb364 (also termed MPV364)—prevented initial infection by hMPV and halted spread of established hMPV infection when dosed directly to the apical surface of WD-HAE. Conversely, mAb364 delivered to the basal compartment was unable to curb established infections, even at 100-fold greater concentrations. Intranasal delivery of mAb364 to hamsters with established hMPV infections reduced viral titers by ~four logs within 2 d and alleviated key pathological outcomes of hMPV infection. These results are consistent with hMPV infection and continued spread occurring via the apical surface of the respiratory epithelium, and underscore delivery of neutralizing mAbs to the respiratory tract as an effective intervention against established hMPV infections.",

This regimen establishes highly protective HA-specific mucosal immune memory responses in the respiratory tract. Intranasal HA boosters resulted in significantly reduced viral replication compared to parenteral mRNA-LNP boosters in both young and old mice. Correlation analysis revealed that slightly increased levels of nasal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) are significantly associated with a reduced viral burden in the upper respiratory tract. Intranasal boosting with bivalent H1 HA induced mucosal immunity against vaccine-matched and mismatched heterologous influenza viruses. Additionally, a heterosubtypic intranasal H5 HA booster elicited H5-reactive mucosal humoral responses in H1-surviving mice.

Linked to severe encephalitis and high mortality, BoDV-1 currently lacks licensed treatments or vaccines. The BoDV-1 polymerase complex, comprising the large (L) and phosphoprotein (P) subunits, is crucial for viral replication and transcription, making it a promising target for antiviral intervention. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of the apo BoDV-1 L-P complex, revealing a unique “mitten-shaped” architecture. The structure characterizes key domains involved in RNA synthesis, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, polyribonucleotidyltransferase, and an inactive methyltransferase domain. While no RNA or NTPs were visible, we observed distinct conformational states, showing large-scale rearrangements of the P tetramer and L domains, as well as remodeling of the RNA template, nucleoside triphosphates, and nascent RNA entrances and/or exits, upon introducing RNA and NTPs. These findings highlight the dynamic structural changes probably associated with polymerase activity and advance the understanding of the BoDV-1 polymerase mechanisms, offering a basis for developing targeted antiviral strategies against this deadly pathogen.",

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-wasting disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and inflammation caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Chronic inflammation in DMD exacerbates the complications associated with disease progression. Since the lymphatic system plays a crucial role in regulating and resolving inflammation, our primary goal was to investigate whether lymphatics were dysregulated in skeletal muscle of DMD animals. We used the D2.mdx murine and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine models, as well as mouse and rat lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) to determine the role of dystrophin in lymphatic structure and function in skeletal muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from control LMCs showed dystrophin expression, and protein results demonstrated that the 427-, 140-, and 71-kDa dystrophin isoforms were detectable in the LMCs from control mice, whereas the 427 kDa isoform was undetectable in LMCs derived from D2.mdx mice. Microlymphangiography and magnetic resonance lymphangiogram results showed a significant decrease in lymph transport in D2. mdx mice and GRMD dogs, respectively. Isolated flank lymphatic vessels from D2. mdx mice exhibited an increase in tonic contraction and a significant decrease in the phasic contractile frequency and amplitude, supporting lymphatic vessel dysfunction. The gene expression profile and immunofluorescence analyses of dystrophic muscle revealed inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in dystrophic muscle. Skeletal muscle tissues that showed improvement in function after adeno-associated virus-microdystrophin treatment also showed significant improvement in inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in GRMD dogs. Thus, these results show a linkage between lymphatic function and DMD pathogenesis that merits further investigation in DMD patients.",

While AAV9-delivered SMN1 gene therapy (e.g., Zolgensma) improves survival, long-term motor outcomes remain variable. This study integrates bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define immune dysregulation in SMA. We analyzed peripheral blood from infants with SMA (n = 7 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 4 for scRNA-seq, &lt;25 mo of age) along with age-matched healthy controls (n = 4 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 6 for scRNA-seq). We profiled differentially expressed genes, immune pathways, cell–cell interactions, and gene regulatory networks. SMA samples showed distinct transcriptomic signatures and elevated immune activation compared to controls. NECTIN1 was identified as a transcriptomic biomarker of disease progression, while HSPA7 was validated from prior reports. A 6- to 7-mo inflection point marked a transition from metabolic regulation to immune activation in SMA infants. NF-κB–related inflammatory gene expression was significantly elevated post–gene therapy relative to both pretreatment and healthy controls, with IL1B and RNF19B emerging as key transcriptomic mediators. scRNA-seq revealed early dysfunction and G1-phase arrest in CD4+ T-cells, along with a switch to RELB -mediated noncanonical NF-κB signaling. In symptomatic infants, CD8+ T-cells showed higher proliferation and exhaustion, with co-upregulation of TBX21 and EOMES , genes consistent with chronic stimulation and a trajectory toward terminal differentiation. Immune dysregulation is a central feature of SMA and may influence treatment response. These findings support future development of adjunct immunomodulatory strategies to enhance gene therapy efficacy and suggest that immune signatures may correlate with motor function outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including motility, biofilm formation, secretion, cell cycle progression, and development, and also contributes to the virulence of many bacterial pathogens. While the genes encoding c-di-GMP cyclases and hydrolases are readily identifiable in microbial genomes, known c-di-GMP receptor domains are quite few, with only PilZ and MshEN broadly distributed across bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate cell size and natural competence. We demonstrated that CdgR proteins exhibit sequence and structural similarity to the Bacillus subtilis late competence development protein ComFB, a conserved protein of unknown function associated with bacterial competence. This prompted us to hypothesize that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also serve as c-di-GMP receptors. Here, we comprehensively investigated the ComFB protein family and demonstrated that ComFB proteins are evolutionarily widespread among bacteria and function as a novel family of c-di-GMP receptors. We showed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive bacteria ( B. subtilis , Thermoanaerobacter brockii ) and Gram-negative pathogens ( Vibrio cholerae , Treponema denticola ) bind c-di-GMP with high affinity. Several ComFB proteins also bind cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), suggesting that ComFB represents a widely distributed bacterial protein family with dual specificity for c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP. Our physiological studies further showed that ComFB plays vital roles in controlling motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner in two phylogenetically distant bacteria, B. subtilis and the gram-negative Shewanella oneidensis , attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.",

Sub-Neptunes are expected to be the most diverse family of the exoplanet population, potentially including rocky gas dwarfs, water worlds, and mini-Neptunes, with a wide range of atmospheric, surface, and interior conditions. With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways, and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass–metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H 2 O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H 2 O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H 2 dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with supercritical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.",

Detecting biosignature gases via exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy is in principle within JWST’s reach. We reflect on JWST’s early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra—already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate three dimensional (3D) atmospheric processes—can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST’s quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive “silver bullet” biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow “parallel interpretations” that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context. Looking ahead, future telescopes and innovative observational strategies will be essential for the reliable detection of biosignature gases.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive study of its chemical composition and long history of medicinal use, the occurrence of glycosylated cannabinoid derivatives in Cannabis sativa has not been documented to date. Here, we identified glycosylated cannabinoids and their common intermediate olivetolic acid (OA) in various C. sativa tissues and cultivars. We moreover identified four UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from C. sativa with OA glycosylating activity. Enhancing the water solubility of cannabinoids through glycosylation holds potential for pharmaceutical development and cosmetic applications. However, glycosylation of pathway intermediates such as OA may divert metabolic flux away from cannabinoid production, complicating efforts to engineer glycosylated forms. To resolve this, we applied FuncLib design to an AlphaFold-predicted structure of one of the identified enzymes CsUGT14, generating active-site variants. Through functional screening, we identified mutants that display increased specificity toward cannabinoid end products over the OA intermediate. Moreover, we recognized a single point mutation that dictates OA positioning within the active site, thereby altering isomer formation. These findings expand the known repertoire of natural cannabinoids and provide a rare example of crystallography-free enzyme design to improve stability, substrate selectivity, and isomer specificity. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for the tailored biosynthesis of soluble glycosylated cannabinoids in heterologous systems.",

This behavior, known as quasispecies dynamics, applies to SARS-CoV-2 which exhibits intrahost genetic and functional heterogeneity while evolving at a high rate in the human population. In the present study, we describe a remarkable reduction in mutant spectrum complexity (intrahost viral genome heterogeneity) in SARS-CoV-2 isolates of late relative to early COVID-19 waves, as they reached Madrid (Spain) from 2020 until 2022. In contrast, the consensus (average) sequence of the corresponding isolates displayed a continuing divergence from the initial Wuhan-Hu-1 virus as the pandemic advanced. The mutant spectrum complexity developed upon replication in Vero E6 cells of the isolates from the first and sixth COVID-19 waves, as well as of biological clones retrieved from them, was similar. Therefore, the mutant spectrum complexity reduction observed in vivo was not due to an increased accuracy of the viral replicative machinery, but rather to other factors related to viral epidemiology or pathogenesis. Such possible factors and their implications for viral trait modifications in the course of a viral pandemic are discussed. The results establish that mutant spectrum complexity of genetically variable viruses can be an epidemiologically evolvable trait.",

Using a mouse model of ROP and samples from DR patients, we found that the highly homologous and homeostatic erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factors ETS-related gene (ERG) and Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) are downregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) of retinal capillaries prior to their regression in early stages of these diseases. We developed a mouse model of inducible EC-specific overexpression of Erg and found it mitigates capillary regression, retinal neuron death, neovascularization, and visual defects in the ROP model. Erg overexpression also reduces capillary regression in early stages of a murine DR model. We next found that simultaneous deletion of endothelial Erg and Fli1 is sufficient to promote regression of the pathological retinal capillaries that arise in late stages of the ROP model. Altogether, our data demonstrate that deletion of homeostatic endothelial ETS factors promotes capillary regression, while maintenance of even one of these factors prevents regression.

Notably, a single-copy, highly conserved mitochondria-localized physiological gene underwent a significant duplication, resulting in one copy being recruited into the venom system and acquired cytotoxicity against wasps' hosts. Through this neofunctionalization process, we observed several key evolutionary changes, including loss of ancestral mitochondrial localization and enzyme activity, acquisition of a secretory signal peptide, shift in expression pattern, positive selection, and the establishment of evolutionary acquired protein–protein interactions. Additionally, we found that another duplicate copy was specialized in wasps' ovary and repurposed for oogenesis regulation.

This prohibitin complex can facilitate the spatial organization of proteins and lipids, thus maintaining cellular metabolism and homeostasis, but its architecture remains largely unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a prohibitin complex at 2.8 Å resolution, which contains 11 PHB1–PHB2 heterodimers. This complex displays a bell-like cage, consisting of a lid and a wall, which creates an intermembrane space-facing compartment for the MIM. The lid of the cage is stably assembled, and it is responsible for the prohibitin complex formation. In contrast, the wall of the cage is flexible and exhibits lateral openings, providing a channel for intramembrane exchange of proteins and lipids. These findings provide a structural basis for understanding the scaffold role of the prohibitin complex in organizing intramembrane proteins and lipids.",

          "abstract": "Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to adapt to environmental changes, with root gravitropism playing a pivotal role in nutrient and water acquisition. Our study reveals that SnRK2 kinases (SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3) are critical regulators of root gravitropism through their direct phosphorylation of the auxin transporter PIN2 at S259. We demonstrate that SnRK2s-mediated phosphorylation modulates both the polar localization and transport activity of PIN2. Importantly, SnRK2s function antagonistically to the AGCVIII kinase PID, which phosphorylates PIN2 at a distinct site (S258), establishing a regulatory balance essential for adaptive root growth. Structural modeling and phosphorylation assays further suggest that SnRK2s-mediated phosphorylation at S259 sterically hinders access of PID to S258, providing a mechanistic basis for their antagonistic relationship. These findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism, by which plants fine-tune root developmental programs to adapt to environmental stimuli, highlighting the evolutionary significance of multilayered kinase-mediated regulation in plant adaptation.",

Driver proteins operate within complex interaction networks, and their activity is conditioned by neighbor proteins. Understanding the interplay between driver mutations and the expression of their neighbor proteins can provide insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets. We assessed associations between expression of neighbor proteins and driver mutation status, comparing both between and within cancer types. We further evaluated if neighbors were enriched in significant associations with multiple drivers and characterized the impact of neighbor expression on overall survival for all cancer types. We found a significant correlation between the number of driver associations (DA) a neighbor gene has and the number of sign-coherent survival associations, particularly for neighbors enriched in positive associations, where high neighbor expression correlated with increased driver mutations and poorer survival. We identified 119 neighbors enriched in positive DA with at least two unfavorable survival associations and 25 neighbors enriched in negative DA with at least two favorable survival associations. Our study systematically identified neighbors associated with driver mutation status. Complementary evidence from survival analysis and the literature suggests that neighbors enriched in DA can be further explored as drug target candidates.",

Enhanced susceptibility can be driven directly by mutations in genes essential for control of the virus or indirectly via the production of autoantibodies against components of host defense. While the impact of viruses on individuals carrying these genotypes permitted their identification and has been amply studied, little is known about the impact of these human genotypes on the natural history of viruses, including not only persisting but also emerging viruses. We envisage several scenarios, including the possibility that genetically susceptible individuals serve as patient zeros, superspreaders, or mutation incubators, or that genetically resistant individuals even permit the selection of new viral mutants. Viruses are continually shared between individuals and even host species, where they can benefit from adaption to new environments. Current human viruses, as well as novel viruses from animal reservoirs, will continue to threaten the human population. Improvements in the scale of human genomic sequencing and analysis will permit testing hypotheses about the impact of human genetics on the origin and trajectory of viral infections, including future pandemics, which may ultimately help to prevent or curtail impending outbreaks.",

We quantified the effects of Triad zoning on biodiversity in (sub)montane eutrophic European beech forests. Using a European-wide multitaxon database and a “virtual” landscape approach (i.e., by resampling empirical data), we evaluated how the proportion of Triad management categories affected the landscape-level species diversity of birds, saproxylic beetles, vascular plants, epiphytic bryophytes, lichens, and wood-inhabiting fungi, as well as multitaxonomic diversity. The results varied greatly among taxonomic groups. Multitaxonomic diversity peaked in landscapes composed of 60% unmanaged and 40% intensively managed forests. While intensive management can benefit some taxa through the creation of open habitats, unmanaged forests are the backbone of biodiversity conservation, underlining the need to safeguard the remaining old-growth forests under natural dynamics, and to extend the current area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Extensive forest management, however, did not contribute to biodiversity conservation as expected. As withdrawing such a high proportion of European forest landscapes from management is unfeasible given the increasing demand for timber, efforts are needed to increase the presence of structural features supporting biodiversity into extensively managed forests.",

          "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease caused by a single pathogen, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. A deeper understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis metabolism could uncover specific vulnerabilities and inform the development of new treatments. Sulfur, essential for bacterial growth and survival, fuels key pathways including redox buffering and coenzyme production. Although previous studies suggest that M. tuberculosis utilizes various substrates to meet its sulfur requirements, the primary sources of sulfur exploited during in vivo infection remain unclear. Here, we reveal that M. tuberculosis acquires inorganic sulfate through the SubI-CysTWA transporter during macrophage infection. Using nanoSIMS (high spatial resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analysis, we observed significant sulfate-derived 33 S enrichment in intracellular bacteria, correlating with metabolic activity. Deletion of subI abolished sulfate uptake, impairing bacterial growth in vitro and reducing M. tuberculosis survival in murine macrophages and lungs of infected mice. Finally, our data demonstrate that sulfate acquisition is essential for maintaining mycobacterial redox balance and resisting nitrosative stress in vitro and in vivo. Thus, unlike many intracellular pathogens, M. tuberculosis depends on an energetically costly inorganic sulfate assimilation pathway to survive in the nutrient-limited host environment. These findings challenge prior assumptions that organic reduced sulfur sources, such as methionine, fuel M. tuberculosis sulfur metabolism during infection. Since animal cells lack a sulfate assimilation pathway, uncovering the critical role of SubI-CysTWA-mediated sulfate import in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis highlights this pathway as a promising pathogen-specific therapeutic target. Targeting this system could either directly impair M. tuberculosis survival during infection or sensitize bacilli to antibiotic-induced oxidative stress by disrupting redox homeostasis.",

Robust methylation requires rapid hydrolysis of the methylation by-product S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by S -adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy). Ahcy is essential for maintaining methylation potential; however, the mechanisms governing its enzymatic activity, particularly in response to cellular stress, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show Ahcy is a redox-sensitive enzyme that is inhibited by oxidation of a conserved cysteine, C195, in vitro resulting in elevated SAH levels upon oxidative stress in vivo. We leveraged High-Throughput Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to directly quantify Ahcy enzymatic activity and observed that H 2 O 2 -induced oxidation significantly reduced its catalytic efficiency. Notably, while C195 is essential for enzymatic activity in Drosophila melanogaster and humans, this residue is not conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans Ahcy that is also insensitive to H 2 O 2 . Structural analysis revealed that C195 is positioned near NAD + in the active site, close to a second cysteine residue that is also lacking in C. elegans Ahcy. Ahcy oxidation is neuroprotective in a Drosophila light stress model that increases oxidative stress. Moreover, Ahcy knockdown suppresses light stress–induced gene expression changes in photoreceptors, although this response is uncoupled from changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels, which were previously reported to alter in response to Ahcy knockdown in cultured cells. Thus, the one-carbon metabolism enzyme Ahcy senses changes in cellular redox homeostasis through a conserved cysteine residue that alters its activity, enabling rapid changes in gene expression that enable a neuroprotective response.",

However, our understanding of these interactions remains unclear. We approach this issue from the view that the river incision histories and their bedload provenance provide complementary evidence for reconstructing the evolution of the ancient river system. Zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from the middle Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River gorge reveal two episodes of accelerated river incision at 18-17 Ma and 8-7 Ma. The onset of the former incision event, coeval with other incision events along the upper-middle Jinsha and Lancang Rivers, implies their hydrological connection and formation of a south-flowing river system. Additionally, detrital geochronology and thermochronology data of late Oligocene–Miocene fluvial-alluvial sediments along the Red River valley provide constraints on their ages and provenance, suggesting emergence of a throughgoing paleo-Red River in the early-middle Miocene. This ancient Red River was disconnected from the upper Jinsha River but connected with Yalong River (upper Yangtze tributary), forming another south-flowing river system. Landscape evolution modelling supports the view that these south-flowing rivers were successively captured by the westward-propagating Yangtze River in the middle-late Miocene, giving birth to the modern drainages of southeastern Tibet. The resultant integration of the upper-middle and lower Jinsha River is manifested by the progressively upstream-propagating acceleration in river incision from 13-9 Ma to 6-5 Ma along the gorges. Our findings from southeastern Tibet suggest that orogen-scale topographic change, river reorganization, and a coeval increase in biodiversity were driven by extrusion tectonics.",

We engineered chimeric immunomodulatory fusion proteins (IFPs) that convert immunosuppressive TGF-β signals into proliferative/survival Interleukin 2 (IL-2) signals in T cells. Chimeric TGF-βR/IL-2R IFPs were constructed by fusing extracellular domains of the TGF-β receptor chains with intracellular domains of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ to enable TGF-β binding to trigger STAT5 phosphorylation and activate the downstream IL-2 pathway. In human primary CD8 + T cells, select IFP designs robustly induced p-STAT5 upon exposure to TGF-β1, and simultaneously reduced canonical SMAD2/3 signaling. IFP-expressing T cells proliferated and displayed enhanced viability in response to TGF-β1, effectively leveraging TGF-β-rich conditions to outcompete nontransduced cells. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that IFP signaling promoted T cell activation and allowed maintenance of stemness during culture with TGF-β. Functionally, coexpressing IFPs with a mesothelin-specific T cell receptor improved tumor killing and promoted T cell expansion in the presence of TGF-β1, highlighting both neutralization of TGF-β–mediated suppression and enhanced proliferation. TGF-βR/IL-2R IFPs appear promising for reprogramming the signals T cells receive in the TME and improving efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in solid tumors.",

Streamflow decline since the 1990s, driven by frequent and prolonged droughts, is 76% more intense than the 16th-century drought—the closest historical analogue.

To identify tumor-intrinsic regulators of immunotherapy resistance and explore therapeutic strategies to restore T cell–mediated tumor control, we employed three functional genomics approaches using in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screening. Cancer USP14 was identified as the critical immune evasion driver. USP14-high HCC patients exhibited poorer anti-PD1 antibody therapy responses and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Inhibition of USP14 suppressed HCC cell growth in coculture with activated CD8+ T cells and restored cocultured CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In vivo USP14 targeting synergized with anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Mechanistically, USP14 deubiquitinated and stabilized GLUT1 through the removal of Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains at Lys-245, which enabled HCC cells to outcompete CD8+ T cells for glucose, generating a glucose-deprived tumor microenvironment that suppressed CD8+ T cell function. Our findings show USP14 in cancer has a proimmunoevasive role in CD8+ T cell–based tumor immunity through GLUT1-mediated glucose competition.

However, investing limited resources in the development of new technologies is risky. The research and development process is unpredictable, with unknown timelines and outcomes. In addition, even after successful development, the effects of deploying a new technology remain uncertain. When confronted with these uncertainties, policymakers must determine how long they should allocate resources to developing new technologies. Informed decisions require anticipating possible successes and failures of both technology development and deployment, which is a challenging optimization task when managing dynamic systems, such as threatened ecological systems. Using an adaptive management approach from AI, we find a time limit new technologies should be developed for, which balances costs, benefits, and uncertainties during development and deployment. We extract clear and transparent general rules for investing in new technologies, building on an analytical approximation. Using Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as a case study, we demonstrate that the development time limit ranges between 0 to 45 y before surrendering. We also show how characteristics of an ecological system influence the optimal investment strategy. Our approach can inform the development of new technologies in multiple domains including biodiversity conservation, public health, energy production, and the technology industry more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Enhancing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in agricultural production can reduce fertilizer input, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and decrease water pollution incidence. However, improving NUE in farming systems without compromising food security remains challenging. Herein, we have successfully developed and applied selenium-based nanotechnology, which capitalizes on above- and belowground synergies to enhance field-scale NUE. Specifically, when N fertilizer application was reduced by 30%, foliar application of selenium nanomaterials significantly enhanced rice photosynthesis by 40.3% compared with reduced N fertilizer treatment (189 kg N/ha). This enhancement promoted carbohydrate synthesis and translocation, providing abundant carbon sources for rhizosphere processes. These abundant carbon sources modulated rhizosphere N transformation processes, stimulating ammonification and nitrification while suppressing denitrification, thereby reducing methane, ammonia, and nitrous oxide emissions by 18.8 to 45.6%. In addition, compared with controls (270 kg N/ha), our approach improved rice root growth and upregulated gene expression associated with N uptake and translocation, increasing rice NUE (48.3%). While maintaining comparable yields to conventional practice, we observed significant improvements in rice quality parameters including crude protein, amino acids, and Se content. Furthermore, the application of this above- and belowground synergistic nano-regulation technology reduced environmental negative impacts by 41.0% and increased economic benefits by 38.2% per ton of rice produced, relative to conventional practices. This work elucidates how nano-enabled agricultural regulation achieves reduced input, enhanced efficiency, and increased income, emphasizing the high potential of nanotechnology in agricultural applications, particularly in improving the utilization efficiency of N fertilizers.",

How this strong inhibitory effect is counterbalanced to maintain pentadactyly in many vertebrate species remains less clear. In this study, we used genetic approaches in mice to reevaluate the mechanism by which Shh signaling modulates AER function and demonstrate that this occurs via Shh-target Bmps that act as a relay signal, rather than by direct Shh action. Furthermore, we show that Shh-induced Bmps also act directly on the ZPA, in a negative feedback loop, to down-regulate Shh expression and ZPA extent. We provide evidence that these dual Bmp-driven negative feedback loops robustly balance total Bmp levels to constrain postaxial digit number.",

          "abstract": "Adzuki bean ( Vigna angularis ) is a key legume widely cultivated in East Asia, prized for both its nutritional value and nitrogen-fixing properties. This paper presents one of the oldest directly dated archaeological finds of adzuki bean, recovered from the Xiaogao site in Shandong, China, and dated to 8985-8645 and 8032-7939 cal. BP—predating previously known Chinese records by at least 4,000 y (approximately 6,000 y considering published directly dated evidence alone). The evidence suggests that adzuki beans formed part of an Early Neolithic multicropping system alongside millet, rice, and soybean in a well-established agricultural tradition in the Lower Yellow River region. Morphometric analysis of adzuki beans from 41 archaeological sites across East Asia reveals a gradual increase in seed size over time when regional data are aggregated, yet highlights distinct regional trajectories. These patterns reflect complex, multiregional domestication processes shaped by both cultural practices and ecological conditions. Notably, the marked differences in bean sizes observed between the Neolithic Yellow River and Jomon-period Japan could be contingent on the distinctions in dietary regimes and associated selective pressures.",

          "abstract": "The total partitioning capacity of indoor surface reservoirs determines the mechanism by which humans receive nondietary exposure to organic contaminants, via inhalation, dermal uptake, and dust ingestion. And yet, this capacity is largely unknown. Surface organic films are ubiquitously present but have very low partitioning volume being only 10’s of nanometer thick, whereas other surface reservoirs such as building materials and furnishings can be permeable or porous with large surface areas at the molecular level. Here, we assess the total partitioning capacity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an indoor environment from the measured kinetics of VOC surface uptake after injection of compounds with variable volatility into a well-characterized, unoccupied test house. We show that the size of the indoor surface reservoirs is very large with an octanol-equivalent average thickness on the order of micrometers, indicating that permeable/porous materials such as painted surfaces and wood are likely the major surface reservoirs in the house rather than organic surface films. Large surface reservoirs result in compounds with octanol-air partition coefficients ( K OA ) larger than 10 5 being predominantly partitioned to indoor surface reservoirs, making them hard to be removed via ventilation. This result significantly impacts our understanding of VOC fate and human exposure in indoor environments. With such a large partitioning capacity, organic contaminants will have much longer indoor residence times than previously predicted.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapy modalities have revolutionized cancer treatment for a number of metastatic and treatment-refractory tumor types. Still, many malignancies that lack T cell infiltration and are termed immunologically “cold” fail to respond to these modalities. One approach to increase tumor immunogenicity has been to induce stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and downstream interferon signaling that is often dysregulated in cold tumors. Despite some early success of STING agonists in preclinical cancer models, these approaches have not been successful in the clinic due to poor tumor penetrance and systemic toxicities. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover therapeutic targets to activate STING expression in human tumors. We identified the lysosomal hydrolase Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase1 (PPT1) as a negative regulator of STING highly expressed in cold ovarian and prostate tumors. Genetic or pharmacological PPT1 suppression increased STING protein stability and its downstream activation of interferon and inflammatory cytokine signaling to enhance T cell migration. Treatment of preclinical prostate and ovarian cancer models expressing low levels of STING with the small molecule PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 enhanced STING expression and activation, leading to infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells that turned these tumors “hot” and reduced tumor growth, fibrosis, and dissemination without toxicity. Further analysis demonstrated that PPT1 is associated with reduced STING expression, CD8 + T cell numbers, overall survival, and immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Thus, PPT1 inhibition may be a promising approach to activate STING and potentiate the effects of immunotherapy in cold tumors.",

          "abstract": "Formation of the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend has been a key geological puzzle that involves both plate tectonics and plume dynamics. Constrained by paleomagnetic data, southward hotspot motion has been considered a major contributor to the formation of the bend, but the role of longitudinal hotspot motion remains largely overlooked. Here, we analyze the Hawaiian hotspot motion using plate kinematics and geographical distances between hotspot tracks. Both analyses indicate a substantial longitudinal Hawaiian hotspot motion. Further application of global mantle convection models reveals a westward (by ~6°) and then an eastward (by ~2°) hotspot drift in addition to the southward motion before and after the bend, with the westward motion primarily controlled by the intraoceanic subduction in Northeast Pacific. We find that both the westward and southward motion are required to fit the seamount chain, with the former contributing a substantial amount of ~20 degrees to the bend angle, no less than the latter, challenging traditional views. Combined with a geodynamically predicted Pacific Plate motion change at 47 Ma, our model provides a nearly perfect fit to the seamount chain. This result suggests that the Hawaiian plume conduit is tilted toward the southwest, providing a strong indication for the source of the Hawaiian plume that has long been debated among seismological studies.",

          "authors": "Maryn O. Carlson, Bryan L. Andrews, Yuval B. Simons",
          "abstract": "The phenotypic effect of a mutation may depend on the genetic background in which it occurs, a phenomenon referred to as epistasis. One source of epistasis in proteins is direct interactions between residues in close physical proximity to one another. However, epistasis may also occur in the absence of specific interactions between amino acids if the genotype-to-phenotype map is nonlinear. Disentangling the contributions of these two phenomena—specific and global epistasis—from noisy, high-throughput mutagenesis experiments is highly nontrivial: The form of the nonlinearity is generally not known and model misspecification may lead to over- or underestimation of specific epistasis. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not attempt to model the fitness measurements directly. Rather, we begin with the observation that global epistasis, under the assumption of monotonicity, imposes strong constraints on the rank statistics of a combinatorial mutagenesis experiment. Namely, the rank-order of mutant phenotypes should be preserved across genetic backgrounds. We exploit this constraint to devise a simple semiparametric method to detect specific epistasis in the presence of global epistasis and measurement noise. We apply this method to three high-throughput mutagenesis experiments, uncovering known protein contacts with similar accuracy to existing, more complicated procedures. Our method immediately generalizes beyond proteins, providing a simple, yet powerful framework for interpreting the epistasis observed in combinatorial datasets.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing question in biology is what makes evolution more or less repeatable. Although evolution seems repeatable when observing convergent phenotypic outcomes, each episode of convergence could have been contingent on an idiosyncratic history that is not expected to repeat. Overlooking events that preceded convergent episodes therefore risks overestimating repeatability. Here, we demonstrate using resurrected ancestral proteins that the evolution of a characteristic diterpene resin acid precursor, isopimaradiene, became especially repeatable in conifers following genetic divergence that simultaneously changed the effects of phenotype-altering substitutions in diterpene synthase enzymes. We found that millions of years of epistatic change prior to three genus-level episodes of convergent isopimaradiene formation led to ancestral diterpene synthases in the family Pinaceae that served as suitable starting points for evolving identical products. However, enzymes predating the Pinaceae formed different diterpenes when the same substitutions were introduced as mutations, indicating that critical alterations in the effects of substitution occurred after the origin of this plant family. Because these alterations occurred prior to the evolution of isopimaradiene, the convergence appears dependent on a history that is less likely to repeat. Our work shows how contingency can lead to repeatable evolution of a trait in related present-day plant lineages.",

Yet, most functional genomic studies on soil bacteria have been performed without predation, thereby selecting for phenotypes impacting growth rather than survival and biasing our view on the ecological factors driving genomic evolution. Here, we study how predation by the ubiquitous amoebal predator Dictyostelium discoideum affects Bacillus subtilis ’ growth and survival using both a genome-scale mutant screen and de novo evolution of resistance. We show that predation-related genes (many not previously identified) promote survival by enabling filament or aggregate formation, thereby outsizing D. discoideum and slowing or preventing ingestion. Importantly, we find that predation resistance is costly, causing a trade-off between growth and survival. B. subtilis navigates this trade-off through switch-like adaptations, where cells switch back-and-forth between a slow-growing resistant state and a fast-growing susceptible state. These behaviors are controlled through both genotypic and phenotypic switches, with a central role for the Spo0A phosphorylation cascade, whose ancestral function may have been to evade or slow predation. Taken together, we uncover how the antagonist selection pressure imposed by predation is an important ecological driver of phenotypic heterogeneity in B. subtilis .",

Here, we propose a boundary method based on the flux transfer formalism typical of radiometry problems, where surface elements transmit and receive “rays” of active particles with infinite persistence length. We demonstrate the power of this boundary method in the case of the swimming microalgae Euglena gracilis trapped in light-defined billiard geometries. Quite surprisingly, we found that Euglena scatters with a nearly Lambertian cosine law, resembling the behavior of blackbody radiation and consequently resulting in nearly uniform distributions inside simple cavity geometries. Nevertheless, leveraging our boundary method, we were able to design a stacked multistage billiard geometry, with a connection scheme between subunits that breaks spatial symmetry and achieves an exponential amplification of cell concentration between its two ends. Our method can be applied to confined active matter in contexts ranging from spatial control and sorting of microorganisms to the design of efficient navigation strategies for microscopic and macroscopic robots.",

In particular, some strategies are vulnerable to the “noisy TV problem,” i.e., an attraction to irrelevant stochastic stimuli. Here, we ask whether humans exhibit a similar attraction to reward-free stochasticity. We design a multistep decision-making paradigm in which participants search for rewarding states in a complex environment containing a highly stochastic but reward-free subregion. We show that i) participants persistently explore the stochastic subregion, and ii) their decisions are best explained by a novelty-driven exploration strategy, compared to alternatives driven by information gain or surprise.

One promising approach involves engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. Mesothelin (MSLN) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting MSLN (TCR MSLN ) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function and improve therapeutic efficacy, but administration of monospecific antibodies targeting individual inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, the combination of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to treatment with antibody alone or TCR MSLN with singlet or doublet antibody combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCR MSLN T cells treated with the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.",

          "abstract": "Prior to ejaculation, mammalian sperm are stored in the epididymis in a “resting” metabolic state. Upon ejaculation, sperm must alter their metabolism to generate the energy needed to support the motility and maturation process known as capacitation to reach and fertilize the oocyte. How sperm regulate the capacitation-induced increase in carbon flux is unknown. Here, we use 13 C stable isotope labeling in mouse sperm isolated from the cauda epididymis to follow glucose metabolism through central carbon metabolic network before and after sperm activation. As sperm transition from resting to highly activated states, they boost energy yield by increasing flux through glycolysis at the expense of the pentose phosphate pathway. Increased glycolytic activity seems to be achieved via capacitation-induced stimulation of flux through aldolase. In the mitochondria-containing midpiece, glycolytically generated pyruvate feeds the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to further maximize energy yield via oxidative phosphorylation. In the mitochondria-free principal piece of the flagellum, pyruvate produced from glycolysis is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, which also serves to regenerate oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) ensuring a sufficient supply to support glycolysis. The resultant lactate is at least partially secreted. Finally, we find evidence that there is an as yet unknown endogenous source of energy in sperm, feeding the upregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. These studies provide the most complete picture of the metabolic shift which occurs in capacitating mouse sperm in glucose.",

          "abstract": "Convergent evolution, or convergence, refers to repeated, independent emergences of the same trait in two or more lineages of species during evolution, often indicating functional adaptation to specific environmental factors. Many computational methods have been proposed to investigate the genetic basis for organismal functional convergence, as an important way to decode the complex sequence–function map of proteins. These methods mostly focus on the convergence of amino acid states at the level of individual sites in functionally related proteins. However, even without site-level sequence similarity, protein function similarity may also stem from convergence of high-order protein features, which cannot be captured by the conventional methods. To fill this gap, we first derived numerical embeddings from protein sequences by pretrained protein language models (PLM). In four previously reported cases, we found that functionally convergent proteins have similar embeddings despite no site-level convergence, indicating that PLM embeddings can reflect convergence of high-order protein features. We then designed a pipeline to detect Adaptive Convergence by Embedding of Protein (ACEP). ACEP tests were significant on known and additional candidate genes with putative adaptive convergence like echolocation and crassulacean acid metabolism. Genome-wide application showed that the ACEP framework can effectively enrich such candidates. Relations between convergences of PLM embeddings and specific protein physicochemical features were further examined. In conclusion, PLM embeddings can indicate adaptive convergence of high-order protein features beyond site identities, demonstrating the power of deep learning tools for investigating the complex mapping between molecular sequences and functions.",

Yet conflicting findings suggest that experts show either reduced (neural efficiency) or increased (vivid simulation) brain activation during MI. We hypothesized that task complexity moderates this effect. Using fNIRS, we compared experts and novices during MI of simple versus complex soccer actions. Experts showed lower activation for simple tasks but higher activation for complex ones, while novices showed the opposite pattern. These findings unify opposing accounts of expertise, revealing that expert brains adaptively scale simulation to task demands.

          "abstract": "Arsenic contamination in rice poses a global challenge to food safety and agricultural productivity, as toxic methylated arsenic species—dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and its highly toxic derivative, methylated monothioarsenate (DMMTA)—accumulate in rice grains. These arsenic species endanger human health and trigger rice straighthead disease, a crop disorder that drastically reduces yields. However, the microbial ecological processes driving arsenic speciation in paddy soils, and their link to striking geographic disparities in rice arsenic speciation profiles and disease prevalence, remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate soil chronosequences spanning 1 to 2,000 y of rice cultivation, a global metagenomic survey of 801 paddy soils, controlled incubations, and field surveys to demonstrate that the balance between arsenic-methylating and arsenic-demethylating microbes is the key determinant of rice grain arsenic speciation and straighthead disease susceptibility. We show that young and moderate-age paddy soils (&lt;700 y), common in regions such as the Americas and Europe, are enriched in arsenic-methylating bacteria, leading to elevated DMA and DMMTA in soils and rice grains. In contrast, ancient paddies in Southeast Asia harbor robust populations of DMA-demethylating methanogenic archaea that effectively mitigate the buildup of these toxic arsenic species. We identify core microbial taxa whose abundances serve as predictive biomarkers and construct a global risk map linking a high methylator-to-demethylator ratio in soils with increased straighthead disease incidence. These findings advance our understanding of arsenic biogeochemistry in agroecosystems and establish a predictive framework for identifying regions at elevated risk of arsenic-induced crop disorders and food contamination.",

          "abstract": "Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 K. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres ( &lt; 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO 2 features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets’ early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push toward higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a “five scale height challenge,” to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO 2 features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST’s excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.",

Assembly and function of the system require at least 27 Dot and Icm proteins, yet its architecture and activation mechanism remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we deploy in situ single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to determine near-atomic structures of the Dot/Icm machine and its intimate association with three distinct outer membrane porins in intact bacteria. Notably, two essential yet enigmatic components, DotA and IcmX, form a pentameric protochannel in an inactive state at the central axis of the Dot/Icm machine. Upon Dot/Icm activation with host lysate, this protochannel undergoes extensive rearrangements to generate an extended transenvelope conduit, as visualized by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging. Furthermore, a combination of cryo-ET and cryo-FIB milling of macrophages infected with L. pneumophila reveals tethering of the Dot/Icm machine to the host membrane, suggesting direct translocation of effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host. Together, our studies identify the DotA–IcmX complex as a gatekeeper for effector translocation and provide a molecular framework for understanding the assembly and activation of the elaborate Dot/Icm T4SS.",

This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.",

We demonstrate that minimal platinum (Pt) loading for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can be achieved through atom abstraction. At low loadings of Pt with copper (Cu), reduction over silica or other oxide supports formed nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt mainly dispersed in the bulk. Addition of tin (Sn) to the alloy led to formation of surface Pt 1 Sn 1 dimers. The larger atomic radius of Sn compared to Cu drove it to the surface, and its stronger interactions with Pt abstracted it from the bulk. Single metallic Pt atoms were stabilized on fully open surfaces, resulting in nearly 100% surface exposure. This configuration reduced Pt usage by one order of magnitude for propane dehydrogenation and improved catalytic stability.",

We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity.

Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II.

Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone.

          "abstract": "Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.",

We reveal appreciable narrowing of the velocity variance to –4.9 ± 0.1 decibels of that of the ground state using free-expansion measurements. Our work shows that a levitated nanoparticle offers an ideal platform for studying nonclassical states of its motion and provides a route to developing applications in quantum sensing and exploring quantum mechanics at a macroscopic scale.",

By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.",

Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.",

Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity.

We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.",

At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate.

          "abstract": "Anopheles funestus s.s. is a major human malaria vector across Africa. To study its evolution, especially under vector control pressure, we sequenced 656 modern specimens (collected 2014 to 2018) and 45 historic specimens (collected 1927 to 1967) from 16 African countries. Despite high genetic diversity, the species shows stable but considerable continental population structure. Although one population showed little differentiation over a century and 4000 kilometers, nearby, we found two genetically distinct ecotypes. Vector control has resulted in strong signals of selection, with some resistance alleles shared across populations through gene flow and others arising independently. Fortunately, we found that a promising gene drive target in Anopheles gambiae is highly conserved in An. funestus . These insights will enable more strategic insecticide usage and gene drive deployment, supporting malaria elimination.",

Given the success of this approach, a transition to continuous protein monitoring (CPM, a real-time, implantable or wearable technology) could similarly advance precision medicine. In this work, we review state-of-the-art CPM platforms and their prospective clinical impact across both chronic disorders—metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative—and acute crises, such as sepsis and transplant dysfunction. We also highlight remaining barriers to widespread adoption, including sensor stability, robust machine learning models for live interpretation, and responsible data handling for patient privacy. With continued engineering and clinical validation, emerging biosensor technologies could transform disease management, facilitating earlier interventions and individualizing treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

We sequenced 1206 genomes from 73 globally distributed locations. After evolving a preference for humans in Sahelian West Africa, the invasive subspecies Ae. aegypti aegypti ( Aaa ) emerged in the Americas after the Atlantic slave trade era and expanded globally. Recent back-to-Africa Aaa migration introduced insecticide resistance and anthropophily into regions with recent dengue outbreaks, raising concern that Aaa movement could increase arbovirus risk in urban Africa. These data underscore developing complexity in the fight against dengue, Zika, and chikungunya and provide a platform to further study this important mosquito vector.",

          "abstract": "Genome function requires regulated genome motion. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.",

          "abstract": "Plasmids are now the primary vectors of antimicrobial resistance, but our understanding of how human industrialisation of antibiotics influenced their evolution is limited by a paucity of data predating the antibiotic era (PAE). By investigating plasmids from clinically relevant bacteria sampled and isolated between 1917 and 1954 and comparing them to modern plasmids, we have captured over 100 years of evolution. We show that while virtually all PAE plasmids were devoid of resistance genes and most never acquired them, a minority evolved to drive the global spread of resistance to first line and last resort antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. Modern plasmids have evolved through complex microevolution and fusion events into a distinct group of highly recombinogenic, multi-replicon, self-transmissible plasmids that now pose the highest risk to resistance dissemination, and therefore to human health.",

Here, we investigated cooperation in mice and artificial intelligence systems, examining how they learn to actively coordinate their actions to obtain shared rewards. We identified key social behavioral strategies and decision-making processes in mice that facilitate successful cooperation. These processes are represented in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ACC activity causally contributes to cooperative behavior. We extended our findings to artificial intelligence systems by training artificial agents in a similar cooperation task. The agents developed behavioral strategies and neural representations reminiscent of those observed in the biological brain, revealing parallels between cooperative behavior in biological and artificial systems.",

          "abstract": "Mental health conditions like depression are associated with an elevated risk of cardiometabolic disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain poorly understood. Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.",

The human menstrual cycle has also a period close to that of the lunar cycle, and recent studies suggest a temporary synchrony between menstrual and lunar cycles. Nevertheless, lunar influence on human reproductive behavior remains controversial. Here, we analyzed long-term menstrual records of individual women from the past 24 years and compared them with records from the past century. We show that women’s menstrual cycles recorded before the introduction of light-emitting diodes in 2010 and the extensive use of smart phones significantly synchronized with the Moon, while those after 2010 coupled to the Moon mostly in January. We hypothesize that the high gravimetric forces between the Moon, Sun, and Earth every January are sufficient for this coupling, while the increasing exposure to artificial light at night impinges on synchrony at other times.",

          "abstract": "Technology plays a central role in all human societies, from foraging to industrial economies. However, technological solutions come with associated costs, and in small-scale societies, technological complexity reflects this trade-off between efficiency and resource constraints. Here, we analyze this trade-off and show a sublinear scaling relationship between toolkit richness and tool part richness in ethnographic societies. This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.",

Leveraging nationwide health surveys and registers from Denmark, we investigated patterns of sleep problems from late adolescence to adulthood and explored early life-course determinants. We generated life-course embeddings using unsupervised machine learning on data from 2.2 million individuals born from 1980 to 2015. We used this landscape to identify neighboring factors of sleep problems. We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns. Specific childhood adversities, such as sibling psychiatric illness, foster care, and parental divorce, were shared factors across multiple sleep disorders such as insomnia and nightmares. These findings underscore the complex interplay between medical and psychosocial factors in sleep.",

While structural distortion from symmetry breaking occurs in femtoseconds, the timescale to lift electronic state degeneracy has remained elusive. We use the vibrationally resolved attosecond chronoscope to capture the electronic symmetry breaking induced by the Renner-Teller effect in bent CO 2 molecules after photoionization by an extreme ultraviolet photon by measuring attosecond ionization delays. Relative photoionization delays between the four cation states are observed, with vibrational state–dependent delays, we analyze the evolution of the degenerate A 2 Π u state to the nondegenerate A ′ and A ″ states due to molecular bending. With the help of theoretical analysis, we show that the relative photoionization delays of up to 72 as between the vibrational levels originate from the symmetry breaking–induced shape resonance.

Here, we show that, in male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance. Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.",

LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.",

          "abstract": "Pulmonary surfactants reduce the work of breathing, enhance compliance, and prevent alveolar collapse. Yet, their role extends beyond that of a simple surfactant; otherwise, exogenous surfactant therapy would fully restore compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by increasing surface concentration alone. Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.",

          "abstract": "Landslides exhibit intermittent downslope movements over days to years before a possible collapse, commonly boosted by external events like precipitation. The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.",

In the heterotaxy syndrome, abnormal left-right patterning leads to a spectrum of severe congenital heart defects, including ventricle malposition. A postulate anchored in the clinical nomenclature assumes that the looping direction of the embryonic heart tube determines ventricle position at birth. However, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we performed a unique longitudinal analysis of heterotaxy with right isomerism, using multimodality imaging of Nodal mouse mutants. Using direct correlations and advanced statistics, we dissected the contribution of heart looping variations to specific structural heart malformations, and uncovered unexpected plasticity of ventricle position after looping in 30% of revertant samples. Genetic tracing and topological associations show that plasticity involves a further step of heart remodeling at E13.5, rather than molecular reprogramming. Human patient scans are consistent with ventricle plasticity and suggest association with poorer prognosis. Our work reveals distinct asymmetric events shaping organs.",

Using exogenous molecular chaperone systems has the potential to stabilize native conformations and inhibit the aberrant aggregation of α-syn, yet inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and insufficient accumulation at PD sites limit their application. Herein, we developed chemotactic chaperone nanomotors (CNMs) that exploit the unique pathological microenvironment of PD lesions, characterized by elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels. The CNMs consist of a chemotactic-targeting module capable of sensing an iNOS concentration gradient, an α-syn–specific recognition module with conformation-sensitive binding domains, and a protein regulatory module with a hydrophobic microdomain that can stabilize α-syn and prevent misfolding. Results demonstrate that CNMs can achieve active chemotactic navigation across BBB and dual modulation of α-syn proteostasis through aggregate dissolution and prevention of misfolding. CNMs not only supplement exogenous chaperone activity but also restore endogenous protein stabilization mechanisms, concurrently reducing neuroinflammatory markers, promoting the application of nanochaperones for PD treatment.",

Here, we tackled this challenge using mouse embryonic axis segmentation as an experimental model. First, we found that energetically subminimal amounts of glucose can support ongoing segmentation clock activity, providing evidence that glycolysis exerts a signaling function. Using a dynamical systems approach based on entrainment, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as the potential signaling metabolite. Functionally, we demonstrated that glycolytic flux/FBP control the segmentation clock period and Wnt signaling in an anticorrelated manner. Critically, we showed that the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by elevated glycolysis is mediated by Wnt signaling rather than cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic state. Combined, our results demonstrate a modular organization of metabolic functions, revealing a signaling module of glycolysis that can be decoupled from its canonical metabolic functions.",

          "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a globally persistent contaminant with substantial health impact. The mass-independent fractionation of even mercury isotopes (even-MIF, denoted as Δ 200 Hg) is widely used to trace atmospheric Hg sources and fluxes. However, the chemical processes inducing even-MIF remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a three-dimensional atmospheric Hg isotope model linking Hg redox processes with even-MIF. The results show that the previous hypothesis of even-MIF occurring exclusively at the tropopause may not fully explain the global Δ 200 Hg patterns. We speculate OH-initiated reactions and photoreduction of Hg II (p) as likely dominant drivers. Simulations show that even-MIF primarily originates in the free troposphere and propagates downward to surface air. Our results reveal distinct spatial Δ 200 Hg variations that were previously unaccounted for in tracing Hg sources. This study provides critical insights into even-MIF drivers and serves as a reference for using Δ 200 Hg to trace atmospheric Hg sources.",

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA. Overall, we show that PTGA is a scalable circular polymer that provides i PP-like properties and that the interfacial ROP method solves the challenges in typical solution-phase polymerization.",

In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery.

We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism.

Population analyses of the VPC network and a recurrent neural network trained on the BDT uncovered notably similar latent dynamics. In both networks, neural trajectories diverged sharply from rest along modality-specific directions during stimulus presentation, while remained at rest during stimulus-absent trials. Subsequently, trajectories rotated toward a mnemonic subspace, where perceptual decisions (acoustic, tactile, and absent) were maintained in three distinctly different stable attractors. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal mechanism for the transition from sensory processing to memory retention explaining both biological and artificial latent neural dynamics in a simple dynamical motif.

In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5–C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain.

However, achieving seamless and efficient coupling between light utilization and high-performance charge storage within a single, integrated platform remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, this study develops laser-architected MXene-graphene composites that unify high-performance energy storage with photoenhancement. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and partially oxidize MXene composite induced by a laser redox process exhibits a hierarchical architecture with outstanding conductivity and surface area. This synergy enables supercapacitors with photoenhanced capacitance, delivering a 228% boost under illumination and record-breaking metrics in capacitance, 2591.75 farads per cubic centimeter (1455.21 farads gram), energy density, 0.518 watt-hours per cubic centimeter (0.345 watt-hours gram), and power density, 320.35 watts per cubic centimeter (180.31 watts gram).

However, the harsh gastrointestinal environment, the low permeability of the intestinal epithelium, and hepatic clearance of foreign particles remain key challenges in this area. Here, we report the site-specific adaptive milk-derived nanovesicles (MiNVs) capable of overcoming intestinal and hepatic barriers for oral insulin delivery. These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin. Notably, MiNVs showed effective glycemic control over long-term treatment in type 1 diabetic rat and minipig models. By integrating transepithelial transport and liver-specific responsiveness, the site-specific adaptability of MiNVs supports their promise in oral insulin administration.",

Here, we introduce HydroSpread—a direct processing technology that enables seamless fabrication and patterning of soft films on liquid surface. It leverages the controlled spreading of liquid ink on liquid surface and combines with precise laser engraving supported by rapid heat transfer at the solid-liquid interface. Geometric shapes, including basic forms of straight lines, sharp turns and circles, and complex patterns, were fabricated with exceptional fidelity to design specifications. We propose two heat-driven hydrodynamic locomotion mechanisms, fin-like bending and leg-like buckling. By harnessing these principles, we engineered two walkable devices—HydroFlexor and HydroBuckler—and demonstrated robust on-water locomotion. This work eliminates fragile postfabrication transfers in soft device manufacturing, bridging the gap between soft films and structure fabrication, and establishes a streamlined pathway for designing and deploying functional soft devices directly in liquid environments.",

Although the mechanisms of DDR activation have been extensively studied, how DDR is kept inactive is far less well understood, especially in plants. Here, we show that the plant-specific transcription factor SOG1, a master regulator of the plant DDR, interacts with PRL1, which functions as a substrate adaptor of the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 PRL1 to polyubiquitinate SOG1, promoting SOG1 degradation through 26 S proteasome. When DNA damage occurs, PRL1 is degraded and SOG1 is phosphorylated, both of which impair the polyubiquitination and degradation of SOG1. This study demonstrated that plants dynamically control DDR by regulating the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of SOG1.",

In contrast to a solid, on PaLS, a droplet can be in 10 different wetting states. This richness arises from the adaptation of the liquid lubricants and can be harnessed to control the apparent contact angle of the droplet over the full range of wettability while removing contact-line pinning effects induced by the solid surface. In the limit of thin liquid films, we derive surface-averaged laws for the apparent contact angle for each wetting state, which capture both experimental and simulation data.

Using spectrally resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FAD •– photoexcitation in the absence of substrate leads to the formation of the oxidized flavin FAD ox (the resting state in the catalytic cycle) within 100 femtoseconds. While this feature is similar to that occurring in flavoprotein oxidases, the ensuing photocycle is more complex. Upon excitation at the lowest-energy transition, the ejected electron is initially captured as a hydrated electron ( e – H ) before transferring to a secondary acceptor in 2.5 picoseconds and returning to the flavin in 37 picoseconds. This implies that e – H can be generated within a protein environment, an unprecedented finding. This assessment is supported by molecular dynamics simulations showing an expansion of the flavin-binding pocket without substrate, allowing water molecules to fill the void.

Although the posttranslational regulation of PILS is important for acclimating growth responses, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. This study demonstrates that components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation of functional PILS proteins under nonstressed conditions. We further reveal that both internal and external signals use the ERAD complex to differentially modulate the turnover rates of PILS proteins. Our findings uncover an additional physiological role of the ERAD complex in regulating PILS protein turnover.

We show that NiV-M–mediated virus-like particle (VLP) production depends on its interaction with host F-actin via its carboxyl-terminal domain. We demonstrate that F-actin retains NiV-M assembly sites at the PM by analyzing NiV-M assembly kinetics. Disrupting actin dynamics or NiV-M–actin interaction alters M nanoscale organization and reduces membrane retention, without affecting initial recruitment. We also show that the Arp2/3 complex, an actin-branching factor, promotes VLP production. Inhibiting Arp2/3 reduces NiV-M retention at the PM and impairs protrusion formation while leaving the assembly rate unchanged.

Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.",

We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL).

While the exact densities are obtained from accurate configuration interaction (CI), the exact XC energies and XC potentials are obtained via inverse DFT calculations on the CI densities. We demonstrate how simple neural network (NN)–based local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), trained on just five atoms and two molecules, provide remarkable improvement in total energies and densities. Particularly, the NN-based GGA functional attains similar accuracy as the higher rung SCAN meta-GGA on various thermochemistry datasets.

It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.",

However, whether metacaspases and purine-rich element (R-motif)–mediated defense messenger RNA translation are involved in plant antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.",

The observations are characterized by subkilometer-scale layering, ±20% variations in color of the individual layers, and high radiance ( I / F  &gt; 1). Strong spatial (latitudinal) variability is also evident, suggesting highly inhomogeneous absorption and atmospheric heating. Models of the radiance, while likely to be degenerate, indicate good agreement with lower-resolution results inferred from other techniques. Mesospheric aerosol layers (strongly blue in CaSSIS color ratios) are also evident. The observed decrease in the CaSSIS RED/BLU color ratio with altitude is indicative of a decrease in particle radius.",

A quantitative correlation between capacitance changes and x-ray dose rate is established, enabling stable, high-resolution imaging.

We address this by engineering defects, specifically nanopores, in monolayer WS 2 through controlled plasma treatments. These nanopores create dangling bonds to improve molecular adsorption for molecule enrichment and dynamically modulate the WS 2 bandgap to optimize band alignment with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. This leads to a shift in photoluminescence peaks from red to blue with increasing defect density. Furthermore, the Raman signal is amplified by localized electromagnetic fields around the nanopores and carefully chosen resonance laser wavelengths. This combination allows blue-shifted WS 2 to achieve single-molecule SERS detection, with a sensitivity limit reaching 1 × 10 −20 M for R6G. Using SERS mapping, we visualize adsorption sites, confirming the nanopores’ role as active sites. Our study introduces a pioneering method for developing ultrasensitive 2D SERS substrates and advances the understanding of SERS mechanisms on 2D materials.",

In vitro, RGD-Alg@MSCs demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic effects compared to conventional MSCs, including improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced release of immunomodulatory factors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these enhanced therapeutic effects. In the mouse model, RGD-Alg@MSCs exhibited prolonged ocular retention and enhanced tear production, promoted corneal healing, and suppressed inflammation by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and T H 17 differentiation.

We also generated three transgenic mouse lines that allow α cell-specific, inducible deletion of the genes for the two prohormone convertase enzymes that process proglucagon . Our studies reveal that both mouse and human islets contain GLP-1(7–36)NH2, but glucagon mediates α cell–to–β cell communication in mice. However, in the absence of normal production of glucagon, α cells up-regulate prohormone convertase 1 (PC1/3) to generate GLP-1 and enhance glucose tolerance.

Through nanofiber architecture and surface engineering, the membrane balances proton conductivity, mechanical strength and electrochemical performance. The sandwich-structure nanofiber membrane (SSNFM) achieves a peak power density of 942 mW cm −2 after 100-hour accelerated stress testing, substantially outperforming conventional commercial membranes (520 mW cm −2 ). Electrochemical characterization confirms enhanced proton conductivity for SSNFM (40.4 mS cm −1 ) compared to commercial membranes (17.5 mS cm −1 ). Multiscale analyses, including x-ray computed tomography and multiphase simulations, reveal improved membrane properties, catalyst layer stability, and triple-phase boundary formation, facilitating efficient charge and mass transport.

The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.",

Building on business historical scholarship and drawing on the archives of business interest associations and key business elites, this article traces the rise and fall of private advocacy forums from the aftermath of the Second World War to the present. Our findings show that while such elite forums proliferated in the late twentieth century, their influence was historically contingent.

Employees were empowered to bargain for working conditions with employers, and the National Labor Relations Board (“the Board”) enforced the necessary rights and processes. Over time, employer resistance eroded the statute’s protections and drove deunionization. In the early 2010s, however, some Board officials recognized community-based workers’ rights organizations as opportunities to inform non-unionized workers of their right to “concerted activity” under the Act. I argue that this effort is analogous to creative and strategic approaches taken in other workplace law agencies, and its uptake among some officials reflected differences in local labor organizing networks among the regional offices, and divergent perceptions of the law. Thus, this study bridges sociological insights on legal consciousness with the growing literature on creative and collaborative workplace law enforcement.",

Dynamic effects demonstrate that firms shift from passive, strategic innovation in the early stages to active, substantive innovation later on. Mechanism tests identify three transmission channels: improved environmental information disclosure, increased ecological awareness among management and reduced agency costs.

While scholars have mostly addressed this question in local/national contexts, we ask about perceptions of environmental, labor, and human rights abuses in global supply chains.

Using a conjoint survey experiment in Germany, we examine the conditions under which individuals want to ban products because of exploitation or environmental degradation in the production process. Consistent with a contested fields approach, strategic claims of both corporations and NGOs influence judgments about bans—in opposite directions—and anti-corporate critiques counteract the effects of corporate promises to some degree. Socio-political attitudes structure judgments about bans, though many corporate and advocacy messages resonate similarly across political divides. Open-ended responses further reveal the collective imagination of problems, products, and claims that animate this kind of moralized market.",

I draw on rich ethnographic work involving a group of small developers who had actively engaged in building extra housing units on rooftops of already existing buildings in a middle-class neighborhood. I argue that marketizing informality was driven by differential embeddedness, referring to a two-pronged process of simultaneous dis-embeddedness and embeddedness of production and exchange. Informally-supplied commodities were dis-embedded from the logic and dynamics of social reproduction. Simultaneously, the market-oriented embeddedness of production and exchange into existing formal and informal systems of norms, identities, practices and relations enabled the institutionalization of the fledgling market space. Much of this process was driven by the informal developers themselves through three mechanisms: adhesive legality, social legitimization and private enforcement.",

This challenges existing theories assuming unipolar financial governance under neoliberal globalization. The article introduces “transnational financial orders” to address this puzzle in the processes of international currency circulation, the financial embeddedness of transnational politically embedded bankers (TPEBs), and the transnational investment order. TPEBs’ stance on unipolar vs. multipolar global governance is crucial. Too broad unipolar sanctions on too many entities in competitive powers such as Russia and China create economies of scale for TPEBs to afford a multipolar order with benefits outweighing the costs imposed by sanctioning powers. This multipolar order benefits competitive powers’ ability to withstand sanctions, signaling a transition from unipolarity to multipolarity in a post-neoliberal parallel globalization.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how digital platforms reorganize markets and impact platform-dependent participants. Using qualitative data collected from the Chinese freight transportation sector, it argues that platform expansion has extensively weakened the pre-existing relational infrastructure of markets and replaced it with centralized digital infrastructures. This disruptive transformation harms truck drivers’ welfare through two mechanisms: (1) Enhanced market connectivity and anonymity intensify competition and reduce drivers’ income; (2) Bureaucratic, biased platform mediation replaces social, collaborative problem-solving, increasing risks for drivers. Both processes have undermined the relational, spatial boundaries of pre-existing social networks, thus breaking social safety nets and increasing economic insecurity for the less powerful actors. By examining a less-studied case in China, this research offers a novel perspective on the transformative power of digital platforms.
