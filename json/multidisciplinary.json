          "abstract": "Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’ 1–6 . This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 7–9 . However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains 10–12 . The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.",

          "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood 1–5 . Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.",

          "abstract": "Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) 1,2 . Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) 3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres 3,5–8 or bulk waveguides 9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth 11,12 . We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide 13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics.",

          "abstract": "Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery 1,2 . A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei . This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene—an important trigger for antigen switching—the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.",

          "abstract": "In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock 1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion 2 and systemic hyperinflammation 3 . The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5 ). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.",

          "abstract": "Nanoribbons, nanometre-wide strips of a two-dimensional material, are a unique system in condensed matter. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times 1,2 , quantum confinement 3 and topologically protected states 4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors 6 . Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.",

          "authors": "Jens Terhaar, Friedrich A. Burger, Linus Vogt, Thomas L. Frölicher, Thomas F. Stocker",
          "abstract": "Global ocean surface temperatures were at record levels for more than a year from April 2023 onwards, exceeding the previous record in 2015–2016 by 0.25 °C on average between April 2023 and March 2024 1 . The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures 2 . Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend.",

          "abstract": "Taxonomic incommensurability denotes the difficulty in comparing scientific theories due to different uses of concepts and operationalizations. To tackle this problem in psychology, here we use language models to obtain semantic embeddings representing psychometric items, scales and construct labels in a vector space. This approach allows us to analyse different datasets (for example, the International Personality Item Pool) spanning thousands of items and hundreds of scales and constructs and show that embeddings can be used to predict empirical relations between measures, automatically detect taxonomic fallacies and suggest more parsimonious taxonomies. These findings suggest that semantic embeddings constitute a powerful tool for tackling taxonomic incommensurability in the psychological sciences.",

While rodent studies suggest the medial temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus, is involved in these functions, its role in human imagination remains uncertain. In human participants, imaginations can be explicitly instructed and reported. Here we investigate hippocampal theta oscillations during real-world and imagined navigation using motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted medial temporal lobe electrodes. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, encoding spatial information and partitioning navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar patterns despite the absence of external cues. A statistical model successfully reconstructed real-world and imagined positions, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding memory in real-world settings.",

          "authors": "David Smerdon, Samuel Pearson, Sabina Albrecht",
          "abstract": "Despite legal protections, discrimination based on sexual orientation remains difficult to detect and measure in labor markets. We present evidence from a field experiment ( N = 1,128) conducted in Australia on a major gig economy platform that allows users to outsource everyday tasks. By manipulating both the sexual orientation of job posters (gay vs. straight male) and physical proximity requirements of tasks (inside vs. outside the home), we identify discrimination against gay profiles and demonstrate a specific mechanism for its emergence: physical proximity. Gay profiles received fewer offers and less engagement, and attracted workers with significantly lower quality ratings, but only for tasks requiring close physical proximity. Additional exploratory analysis further suggests that the results are driven by an anti-gay bias rather than an anti-men or pro-women bias and that discrimination is stronger for tasks with a higher degree of interaction between worker and job poster. Our findings demonstrate how digital labor platforms can perpetuate traditional forms of discrimination, while shedding light on physical proximity as one important mechanism. These results have important implications for users of the gig economy, a sector of increasing importance due to its rapid growth and comparatively lax regulatory frameworks.",

          "abstract": "Large language models can now generate political messages as persuasive as those written by humans, raising concerns about how far this persuasiveness may continue to increase with model size. Here, we generate 720 persuasive messages on 10 US political issues from 24 language models spanning several orders of magnitude in size. We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment ( N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models’ persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.",

          "abstract": "Autocratic governments around the world use clandestine propaganda campaigns to influence the media. We document a decade-long trend in China toward the planting of government-authored articles in party and commercial newspapers. To examine this phenomenon, we develop an approach to identifying scripted propaganda—the coerced reprinting of lightly adapted government-authored articles in newspapers—that leverages the footprints left by the government when making media interventions. We show that in China, scripted propaganda is a daily phenomenon—on 90% of days from 2012 to 2022, the vast majority of party newspapers include at least some scripted propaganda at the direction of a central directive. On particular sensitive days, the amount of scripted propaganda can spike to 30% of the articles appearing in major newspapers. We show that scripted propaganda has strengthened under President Xi Jinping. In the last decade, the front page of party newspapers has evolved from 5% scripted articles to approximately 20% scripted. This government-authored content throughout the paper is increasingly homogeneous—fewer and fewer adaptations are done by individual newspapers. In contrast to popular speculation, we show that scripted content is not only on ideological topics (although it is increasingly ideological) and is also very prevalent in commercial papers. Using a case study of domestic coverage of COVID-19, we demonstrate how the regime uses scripting to shape, constrain, and delay information during crises. Our findings reveal the wide-ranging influence of government-authored propaganda in China’s media ecosystem.",

          "authors": "Ana Arjona, Mario Chacón, Laura García-Montoya",
          "abstract": "Although a growing literature has investigated the effects of various types of civil war violence on political behavior, no study has examined the impact of assassinations targeting politicians. This is a critical omission, as violence against local politicians is prevalent across civil war contexts and may be the most consequential form of violence for political participation by affecting both candidate supply and voter demand. Using an original dataset of nearly 2,000 killings of Colombian local politicians between 1980 and 2023, we estimate the impact of this violence on voter turnout. Taking municipalities where assassination attempts failed as a comparison group, we find that political assassinations significantly decrease voter turnout in both the short and medium terms, with effects persisting in various elections even after the signing of a peace agreement. These findings contrast with many studies suggesting that other forms of civil war violence enhance political participation during the postconflict period or after a truce or peace agreement. Our results suggest that different forms of violence can have distinct effects on political behavior, underscoring the need to theorize how the targeting, nature, and context of violence condition its effects. This echoes calls for more nuanced studies on the behavioral impacts of violence. Our findings also have implications for understanding democracy amid rising violence against political leaders in countries affected by organized crime, such as Mexico and Brazil; polarized contexts, such as the United States; and weakly institutionalized democracies, such as South Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines.",

In the United States, the tendency to center men in concepts of people develops across middle childhood, yet the specific mechanisms that contribute to it remain unknown. Here, we investigate one subtle but potentially powerful social mechanism: the category labels that parents use to describe boys/men and girls/women in conversations with their children. Across two studies ( N = 822 parent–child dyads, predominantly from the United States), parents used gender-neutral labels like “kid” or “person” more often to describe boys/men than girls/women and, conversely, used gender-specific labels (e.g., “girl”) more often to describe girls/women than boys/men. These patterns emerged when parents were shown gender-stereotypical girls/women and boys/men (e.g., a girl painting her nails, a boy digging for worms); when parents viewed counterstereotypical stimuli (e.g., a boy painting his nails, a girl digging for worms), the patterns reversed. Our findings illuminate parents’ category label usage as a critical social mechanism that may undergird the development of a male default in a US cultural context, informing efforts to intervene on this process.",

          "abstract": "Central emotion theories assume that during threatening and dangerous events the human face signals a prototypical, distinct, and universally recognized expression of fear which can be accurately decoded by conspecific perceivers. Due to the importance of fear expressions, an unusually large body of research has been dedicated to exploring their evolutionary origins, neurobiological mechanisms, and clinical significance. However, these studies typically utilize highly recognizable posed actor portrayals presumed to closely resemble the diagnostic physical appearance of real-life fearful faces. Here, we challenge this diagnosticity assumption. Following context-dependent frameworks (Barrett, 2017), we hypothesized that extrafacial context (e.g., situational information, body posture, etc.) plays a far greater role in fear communication than the signal of the isolated face. In 12 preregistered experiments (N = 4,180), we examined the perception of authentic, real-life videos documenting a diverse range of intense fear-inducing situations (e.g., height jumping, physical attacks, exposure to phobia triggers). Participants viewed the face alone, the context with no face, or the full video while various response methods of emotion perception were tested (forced choice, open-ended, multiple emotion scales, valence-arousal ratings). Across experiments, videos of the faces alone failed to communicate fear in a reliable manner. In sharp contrast, context with no faces, and faces with context were clearly and robustly perceived as fearful, with medium to large effect sizes. These findings suggest that despite the undisputed importance of perceiving fear reactions, facial expressions alone bear minimal diagnostic value, while context plays a critical role in real-life fear perception.",

          "abstract": "The long-term success of introduced populations depends on both their initial size and ability to compete against existing residents, but it remains unclear how these factors collectively shape colonization dynamics. Here, we investigate how initial population (propagule) size shapes the outcome of community coalescence by systematically mixing eight pairs of in vitro microbial communities at ratios that vary over six orders of magnitude, and we compare our results to neutral ecological theory. Although the composition of the resulting cocultures deviated substantially from neutral expectations, each coculture contained species whose relative abundance depended on propagule size even after ~40 generations of growth. Using a consumer–resource model, we show that this dose-dependent colonization can arise when resident and introduced species have high niche overlap and consume shared resources at similar rates. Strain isolates displayed longer-lasting dose dependence when introduced into diverse communities than in pairwise cocultures, consistent with our model’s prediction that propagule size should have larger, more persistent effects in diverse communities. Our model also successfully predicted that species with similar resource-utilization profiles, as inferred from growth in spent media and untargeted metabolomics, would show stronger dose dependence in pairwise coculture. This work demonstrates that transient, dose-dependent colonization dynamics can emerge from resource competition and exert long-term effects on the outcomes of community coalescence.",

          "abstract": "Pain independent of disease activity is frequently reported by rheumatoid arthritis patients and remains undertreated. Preclinical evidence suggests that imbalance of neuroimmune proresolving interactions within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) rather than at the site of inflammation plays mechanistic roles in persistent arthritis pain. Here, we inhibited production of proresolving lipid mediators by silencing 12/15-lipoxygenase expression in CX3CR1 + monocyte/macrophages conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In an arthritis model, hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity is exacerbated in male and female cKO mice in association with DRG infiltration of neutrophils, which migrate in response to leukotriene B 4 released by macrophages through 5-lipoxygenase conversion of arachidonic acid provided by neuron-derived vesicles. Neutrophils apoptosis promotes primary macrophage efferocytosis which is defective in cKO macrophages. In wild-type (WT) and cKO mice, intrathecal injection of MerTK activating antibody, attenuates persistent hypersensitivity and polarizes DRG macrophages toward a proresolving phenotype with production of antinociceptive lipoxin A 4 . Thus, we delineate a neuron–macrophage–neutrophil bidirectional circuit that can be exploited to reduce persistent arthritis pain.",

MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome, and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection. A large number of conventionally nonessential genes appeared to contribute as well, including genes encoding proteins that resemble antidesiccants.

          "abstract": "The retina is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that, when transmitted to the brain, create the sensation of vision. The mammalian retina is epigenetically unique since the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into retinal cells is accompanied by a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoters of many genes important for retinal development and function. However, the pathway responsible for DNA demethylation and its role in retinal development and function were unknown. We hypothesized that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases plays a key role in this pathway. To this end, we knocked out the TET family in RPCs and characterized the TET-deficient and control retinas using various approaches including electron microscopy, electroretinogram tests, TUNEL, RNA-seq, WGBS, and 5hmC-Seal. We found that while the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway contributes to the development of many retinal cell types, it is the most significant contributor to rod and cone photoreceptor development and function. We found that genetic ablation of TET enzymes in RPCs prevents demethylation and the activity of genes essential for rod specification and for rod and cone maturation. Reduced activity of genes responsible for rod specification results in the TET-deficient retina being depleted of these neurons. Meanwhile, reduced activity of genes responsible for rod and cone maturation leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the TET-deficient photoreceptors, which results in loss of their function and leads to blindness. These function-deprived, underdeveloped photoreceptors die over time, leading to retinal dystrophy.",

          "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation, pannus formation, and progressive joint destruction. The inflammatory milieu in RA drives endothelial cell activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules, thus facilitating leukocyte infiltration into the synovium. Reelin, a circulating glycoprotein previously implicated in endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in diseases such as atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis, has emerged as a potential upstream regulator of these processes. However, its role in RA pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin levels are markedly elevated in the plasma of both RA patients and mouse models of arthritis, with higher concentrations correlating with greater disease severity. Genetic deletion of the Reelin receptor Apoer2 conferred significant protection against serum transfer arthritis (STA), underscoring the relevance of this pathway in disease progression. Furthermore, therapeutic inhibition of Reelin using the CR-50 antibody yielded robust anti-inflammatory effects in multiple preclinical arthritis models, including STA, K/BxN, and collagen-induced arthritis. Notably, CR-50 treatment not only reduced leukocyte infiltration and synovial inflammation but also mitigated pannus formation. Importantly, these benefits were achieved without the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac. Our findings position Reelin as a proinflammatory endothelial biomarker and therapeutic target in RA. By modulating endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment, anti-Reelin strategies offer an alternative approach to attenuate synovial inflammation and joint damage. These results provide a compelling rationale for further exploration of Reelin-targeted therapies as alternatives to conventional immunosuppressive treatments in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "While vegetation brings positive benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, the impact of ongoing global greening remains controversial due to its uncertain effects on hydrological cycle. Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation dynamics on global water availability by proposing a comprehensive framework to quantify the terrestrial water sink and source scores associated with vegetation dynamics. These scores serve as indicators of whether large alterations in water resources have occurred in the lands due to either the greening or degradation of surface vegetation. We use multisource datasets from climate model projections, remote sensing, and local measurements to examine the impact of vegetation dynamics on water availability over the periods of 1982 to 2019 and 2015 to 2100. During historical observation periods, regions such as India and northern China experienced large depletion of water resources as a result of vegetation greening, leading to water scarcity. In the future, a shift is projected for India and northern China, transforming them into regions capable of meeting water demands arising from vegetation greening. This transition is largely attributed to wetting and warming climates. It indicates that trade-off effects between climate and underlying vegetation dynamics may result in strengthening regional hydrological resilience and ensuring the stable status of local water resources. Furthermore, tropical rainforests (except for the Amazon Rainforest) are experiencing greening with minimal impact on local water resources consistently. These insights are valuable for globally identifying optimal locations to implement ecological restoration, facilitating the balance of sustainable water resources and vegetation greening.",

Using high-dimensional CO-detection by indexing, a technology for spatial imaging, this study examines the cellular microenvironment of MS lesions in secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. We analyzed immune, glial, neuronal, and endothelial cell interactions within MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter across two independent cohorts. Our findings show the enrichment of EBV markers, particularly EBNA1 and LMP1, within MS lesions. EBV-positive cells interact closely with reactive astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Image analysis confirmed the presence of EBV-positive staining within neurons and glial cells, suggesting a direct role for EBV in neuronal and glial involvement in MS. Additionally, we observed altered immune cell interactions, including reduced associations with macrophages and memory T cells, and enhanced interactions with glial cells. Disruptions in blood–brain barrier integrity were also noted in regions of the MS brain. These results highlight EBV’s contribution to immune modulation, glial dysfunction, and neuronal damage in MS, particularly in progressive subtypes. The analysis of MS brain tissue suggests potential therapeutic targets, including antivirals and brain penetrant immune modulators, to address EBV’s impact on MS progression.",

          "abstract": "Positive selection at the 2q21.3 enhancer region for lactase gene ( LCT ) expression in Europeans and Africans has long been attributed to selection for lactase persistence (LP), the capacity of adults to digest lactose in milk, presumably because of the benefits associated with milk consumption. While considered a classic example of gene–culture coevolution, recently doubts have been raised about the link between selection at 2q21.3 and LP. Analysis of additional populations could shed further light; here, we demonstrate that a haplotype spanning ~467 kb at the 2q21.3 locus has risen to high frequency in East Asians (~25%) but is absent from Africans and Europeans. This haplotype likely derived from Neanderthals and has been under positive selection in East Asians. The East Asian–specific haplotype is associated with alterations in LCT expression and promoter methylation in certain cell types, similar to what is observed with LP-associated haplotypes in Europeans. Moreover, its frequency is comparable to that of LP in East Asians, suggesting a potential association with LP in East Asians. However, it is highly unlikely that selection in East Asians was related to milk-drinking habits. We find that this haplotype impacts the expression of UBXN4 , DARS1, and DARS1-AS1 in immune cells and is associated with neutrophil and white blood cell counts. Hence, the selection might be linked to certain aspects of immune function. This implies that selection on 2q21.3 has thus either occurred for different reasons in different populations or the selection observed in other populations is also not due to LP.",

Although populations of big trees are concentrated along the west coast, populations of medium trees are more evenly distributed across the nation. In the western United States, trees &gt;50 cm DBH comprise ~75% of the total carbon stored in live trees, while in the eastern United States they comprise ~20%. Plot remeasurement data indicate that populations of big trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.49% in the west and 2.9% in the east, and populations of medium trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.5% in the west and 2.4% in the east. One exception is the Sierra Nevada region, where big trees are declining. Additionally, we observed declines for several individual species.

          "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCC) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells with variable potency that contribute to nearly every tissue and organ throughout the body. Considered unique to vertebrates, NCC are transiently generated within the dorsolateral region of the neural plate or neural tube during neurulation. Their delamination and migration are crucial for embryo development as NCC differentiation is influenced by their final resting locations. Previous work in avian and aquatic species revealed that NCC delaminate via an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which transforms these progenitor cells from static polarized epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells with fluid front and back polarity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating NCC delamination in mammals are poorly understood. Through time-lapse imaging of NCC delamination in mouse embryos, we identified a subset of cells that exit the neuroepithelium as isolated round cells, which then halt for a short period prior to acquiring the mesenchymal migratory morphology classically associated with delaminating NCC. High-magnification imaging and protein localization analyses of the cytoskeleton, together with measurements of pressure and tension of delaminating NCC and neighboring neuroepithelial cells, revealed that round NCC are extruded from the neuroepithelium prior to completion of EMT. Furthermore, cranial NCC are extruded through activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel, PIEZO1. Our results support a model in which cell density, pressure, and tension in the neuroepithelium result in activation of the live cell extrusion pathway and delamination of a subpopulation of NCC in parallel with EMT, which has implications for cell delamination in development and disease.",

Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) have demonstrated the potential for highly specific molecular detection, but the sensitivity is often constrained by the slow trans-cleavage activity of Cas enzymes, necessitating preamplification of target nucleic acids. In this study, we present a CRISPR-Cascade assay that overcomes these limitations by integrating a positive feedback loop that enables nucleic acid amplification-free detection of pathogenic DNA at atto-molar levels and achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1.3 within just 10 min. The versatility of the assay is demonstrated through the detection of bloodstream infection pathogens, including Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli , and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) spiked in whole blood samples. Additionally, we introduce a multiplexing OR-function logic gate, further enhancing the potential of the CRISPR-Cascade assay for rapid and accurate diagnostics in clinical settings. Our findings highlight the ability of the CRISPR-Cascade assay to provide highly sensitive and specific molecular detection, paving the way for advanced applications in point-of-care diagnostics and beyond.",

Here, we describe a generalizable selection method to enrich for GPCR ligands from a synthetic camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) library. Our strategy yielded multiple nanobody ligands for the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), a prototypical GPCR and important drug target. We found that nanobodies readily act as allosteric modulators, encoding selectivity for both the receptor and chemical features of GPCR ligands. We then used structure-guided design to convert two nanobodies from allosteric ligands to competitive AT1R inhibitors through simple mutations. This work demonstrates that nanobodies can encode multiple pharmacological behaviors and have great potential as evolvable scaffolds for the development of next-generation GPCR therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Microsporidia are divergent fungal pathogens that employ a unique harpoon-like apparatus called the polar tube (PT) to invade host cells. The long PT is fired out of the microsporidian spore over the course of just a few hundred milliseconds. Once fired, the PT is thought to pierce the plasma membrane of a target cell and act as a conduit for the transfer of the parasite into the host cell, which initiates infection. The PT architecture and its association with neighboring organelles within the parasite cell remain poorly understood. Here, we use cryoelectron tomography to investigate the structural cell biology of the PT in dormant spores from the human-infecting microsporidian species, Encephalitozoon intestinalis . Segmentation and subtomogram averaging of the PT reveal at least four layers: two protein-based layers surrounded by a membrane layer and filled with a dense core. Regularly spaced protein filaments form the structural skeleton of the PT. Combining cryoelectron tomography with cellular modeling, we propose a model for the three-dimensional organization of the polaroplast, an organelle that surrounds the PT and is continuous with the outermost, membranous layer of the PT. Our results reveal the ultrastructure of the microsporidian invasion apparatus in situ, laying the foundation for understanding infection mechanisms.",

However, the causation and mechanism of liver fibrosis triggered by chronic HEV infection remain poorly understood. Here, we found that the viral multiple-domain replicase (ORF1) undergoes unique ubiquitin–proteasomal processing leading to formation of the H EV- D erived S MAD A ctivator (HDSA), a viral polypeptide lacking putative helicase and RNA polymerase domains. The HDSA is stable, non-HSP90-bound, localizes to the nucleus, and is abundant in G3 HEV-infected hepatocytes of various origins. Markedly, the HDSA in hepatocytes potentiates the fibrogenic TGF-β/SMAD pathway by forming compact complexes with SMAD3 to facilitate its promoter binding and coactivator recruitment, leading to significant fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils. Virus infection–induced liver fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils could be prevented by mutating the residues P989C, A990C, and A991C (PAA-3C) within ORF1, which are required for proteasomal processing. Thus, we have identified a viral protein derived from host proteasomal processing, defined its notable role in liver fibrosis and highlighted the nature of an unanticipated host–HEV interaction that facilitates hepatitis E pathogenesis.",

The human endometrium is receptive to a blastocyst for a brief period, the window of implantation. Critical knowledge underpinning biological processes leading to RIF, essential for effective treatment, is lacking. We employed spatial transcriptomics to define region- and cell-type-specific differences in endometrial gene expression in luteinizing hormone timed biopsies between women with RIF (n = 8) and fertile controls (FC) (n = 8). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing endometrial regions between FC and RIF (685 luminal epithelium, 293 glandular epithelium, 419 subluminal stroma, 264 functionalis stroma, 1,125 subluminal stromal CD45 + leukocytes, and 1,049 functionalis stromal CD56 + leukocytes). Only 57 DEGs were common to all subregions and cell types, which highlights that multiple DEGs are lost when the endometrium is examined as a single entity. When RIF-specific DEGs were leveraged against knowledge from mouse genetic models, genes associated with aberrant embryo implantation phenotypes were observed, mostly in immune cell populations. Dysregulated pathways in specific endometrial regions included the “WNT signaling pathway,” altered in the functionalis and subluminal stroma. “Response to estradiol” and “ovulation cycle” pathways were dysregulated in the subluminal stroma. In silico drug screening identified potential compounds that can reverse the RIF gene expression profile (e.g., raloxifene, bisoprolol). Our findings, in a well-characterized cohort, highly endorse consideration of each endometrial region and cell type as separate entities. Ignoring individual regions and composite cell populations will overlook important aberrations, forego potential treatment targets, and lead to research waste pursuing clinically irrelevant treatment options.",

These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y −1 ) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y −1 ) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y −1 in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y −1 in seafood production.

Here, we show a mathematical correspondence between a value function for goal-directed spatial navigation and an information measure for word embedding models in natural language processing. Based on this relationship, we integrate spatial and semantic computations into a neural representation model called “disentangled successor information” (DSI). DSI generates biologically plausible neural representations: spatial representations like place cells and grid cells, and concept-specific word representations which resemble concept cells. Furthermore, with DSI representations, we can perform inferences of spatial contexts and words by a common computational framework based on simple arithmetic operations. This computation can be biologically interpreted by partial modulations of cell assemblies of nongrid cells and concept cells. Our model offers a theoretical connection of spatial and semantic computations and suggests possible computational roles of hippocampal and entorhinal neural representations.",

As notorious corallivores, crown-of-thorns sea stars (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) have caused extensive losses of coral habitat during unexplained population outbreaks across the Indo-Pacific. While predation of adult CoTS may help to suppress their outbreaks, it does not sufficiently explain their profound boom-bust dynamics and so remains equivocal. Factors influencing early postsettlement mortality are generally more impactful on population size, thus lower trophic interactions involving juvenile CoTS may better contribute to outbreak prevention. We evaluated the impact of key predatory decapods that interact with juvenile CoTS in their coral rubble nursery before they emerge as destructive corallivores. Decapod density was influenced by habitat complexity and varied regionally, inverse to spatial trends in CoTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. Using eDNA gut content analysis, we confirmed seven species (~12% of individuals) of wild-caught decapod, collected from two reefs separated by &gt;1,000 km, as CoTS predators. Owing to spatial variation in predator abundance and community structure, we estimated potential (previous aquarium experiments) and realized (eDNA results here) rates of CoTS consumption were ~3-fold and ~1.6-fold lower, respectively, in outbreak hotspots. Through combination of field and molecular techniques, we demonstrated the appreciable impact of cryptic predators on early population success of this nuisance species, which expands our knowledge of CoTS outbreaks, pest species management, and reef conservation. Resolving predator–prey interactions at lower levels of the ecosystem can be crucial to understanding broader ecological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The flagellum is the most complex macromolecular structure known in bacteria and is composed of around two dozen distinct proteins. The main building block of the long, external flagellar filament, flagellin, is secreted through the flagellar type-III secretion system at a remarkable rate of several tens of thousands of amino acids per second, significantly surpassing the rates achieved by other pore-based protein secretion systems. The evolutionary implications and potential benefits of this high secretion rate for flagellum assembly and function, however, have remained elusive. In this study, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence that the flagellar secretion rate has been evolutionarily optimized to facilitate rapid and efficient construction of a functional flagellum. By synchronizing flagellar assembly, we found that a minimal filament length of 2.5 μm was required for swimming motility. Biophysical modeling revealed that this minimal filament length threshold resulted from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the whole swimming cell, dependent on the filament length. Furthermore, we developed a stepwise filament labeling method combined with electron microscopy visualization to validate predicted flagellin secretion rates of up to 10,000 amino acids per second. A biophysical model of flagellum growth demonstrates that the observed high flagellin secretion rate efficiently balances filament elongation and energy consumption, thereby enabling motility in the shortest amount of time. Taken together, these insights underscore the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development and optimization of the flagellum and type-III secretion system, illuminating the intricate interplay and cost-benefit tradeoff between functionality and efficiency in assembly of large macromolecular structures.",

Hence, novel approaches are needed to address these challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that mRNA polymeric nanoparticles encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies in situ at the tumor site enhance the therapeutic efficacy of neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine for PDAC. This mRNA-based, in situ anti-PD-1 antibody production strategy also protects tumor-infiltrating T cells from PD-1 inhibition, potentially reducing the toxicities induced by systemic checkpoint inhibition.

We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity—roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics.

          "abstract": "The plant photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) mediates the responses of plants to red (R) light. Trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me3) plays a crucial role in governing gene expression and controlling the response of plants to environmental changes. However, how dynamic H3K27me3 mediates plant response to R light is poorly understood. Here, we report that RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), an H3K27me3 demethylase, promotes hypocotyl elongation under R light in Arabidopsis . Upon exposure to R light, REF6 preferentially interacts with the active Pfr form of phyB. Consequently, phyB enhances REF6 accumulation and its binding ability, which are necessary for inducing cell-elongation-related genes from open chromatin, ensuring normal plant growth under prolonged light exposure. Moreover, REF6 acts together with the phyB-PIF4 module to mediate light regulation of hypocotyl growth. These findings provide insights into the understanding of how phytochromes, epigenetic factors, and transcription factors coordinately control plant growth in response to changing light environment.",

          "abstract": "Low-energy excitations play a key role in all condensed-matter systems, yet there is limited understanding of their nature in glasses, where they correspond to local rearrangements of groups of particles. Here, we introduce an algorithm to systematically uncover these excitations up to the activation energy scale relevant to structural relaxation. We use it in a model system to measure the density of states on a scale never achieved before, confirming that this quantity shifts to higher energy under cooling, precisely as the activation energy does. Second, we show that the excitations’ energetic and spatial features allow one to predict with great accuracy the dynamic propensity, i.e., the location of future relaxation dynamics. Finally, we find that excitations have a primary field whose properties, including the displacement of the most mobile particle, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and are independent of temperature. Additionally, they exhibit an outer deformation field that depends on the material’s stability and, therefore, on temperature. We build a scaling description of these findings. Overall, our analysis supports that excitations play a crucial role in regulating relaxation dynamics near the glass transition, effectively suppressing the transition to dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories while also being strongly influenced by it.",

          "abstract": "Currently, most cell or tissue transplantations using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are anticipated to involve allogeneic iPSCs. However, the immunological properties of iPSCs in an allogeneic setting are not well understood. We previously established a mouse transplantation model of MHC-compatible/minor antigen-mismatched combinations, assuming a hypoimmunogenic iPSC-setting. Here, we found that iPSCs subcutaneously inoculated into MHC-compatible allogeneic host mice resisted rejection and formed teratomas without immunosuppressant administration. Notably, when skin grafts were transplanted onto hosts more than 40 d after the initial iPSCs inoculation, only the skin of the same strain as the initial iPSCs was engrafted. Therefore, donor-specific immune tolerance was induced by a single iPSC inoculation. Diverse analyses, including single-cell RNA-sequencing after transplantation, revealed an increase in regulatory T cell (Treg) population, particularly CD25 + CD103 + effector Tregs within the teratoma and skin grafts. The removal of CD25 + or Foxp3 + cells suppressed the increase in effector Tregs and disrupted graft acceptance, indicating the importance of these cells in the establishment of immune tolerance. Within the teratoma, we observed an increase in TGF-β2 levels, suggesting an association with the increase in effector Tregs. Our results provide important insights for future applications of allogeneic iPSC-based cell or tissue transplantation.",

Contrary to the rapid lethality caused by SOS1 genetic ablation in SOS2 KO mice, SOS1 pharmacological inhibition by its specific inhibitor BI-3406 did not significantly affect animal weight/viability nor cause noteworthy systemic toxicity. Allograft assays using different KRAS mut cell lines showed that treatment with BI-3406 impaired RAS activation and RAS downstream signaling and decreased tumor burden and disease progression as a result of both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic therapeutic effects of the drug. Consistent with prior genetic evidence and the KRAS mut allografts assays in immunocompromised mice, our analyses using an in vivo model of KRAS G12D -driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in immunocompetent mice showed that single, systemic BI-3406 treatment impaired tumor growth and downmodulated protumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment comparably to SOS1 genetic ablation or to treatment with the specific KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133. Furthermore, markedly stronger, synergistic antitumor effects were observed upon concomitant treatment with BI-3406 and MRTX1133 in the same in vivo LUAD mouse model. Our data confirm SOS1 as an actionable therapy target in RAS-dependent cancers and suggest that BI-3406 treatment may yield clinical benefit both as monotherapy or as a potential combination partner for multiple RAS-targeting strategies.",

Like eukaryotic actin, bacterial actins assemble into dynamic polymers upon ATP binding, however variation in interactions between strands gives rise to striking diversity of filament architectures. Here, we report a family of bacterial actins of unknown function, conserved among the Verrucomicrobiota phylum, which assembles into a unique tubular structure in the presence of ATP. A cryo-EM structure of the filaments reveals that it consists of three strands, unlike other described bacterial actin structures. This architecture provides further insights into the organization of actin-like filaments and has implications for understanding the diversity and evolution of the bacterial cytoskeleton.",

          "abstract": "Information processing in the human brain can be modeled as a complex dynamical system operating out of equilibrium with multiple regions interacting nonlinearly. Yet, despite extensive study of the global level of nonequilibrium in the brain, quantifying the irreversibility of interactions among brain regions at multiple levels remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we present the Directed Multiplex Visibility Graph Irreversibility framework, a method for analyzing neural recordings using network analysis of time-series. Our approach constructs directed multilayer graphs from multivariate time-series where information about irreversibility can be decoded from the marginal degree distributions across the layers, which each represents a variable. This framework is able to quantify the irreversibility of every interaction in the complex system. Applying the method to magnetoencephalography recordings during a long-term memory recognition task, we quantify the multivariate irreversibility of interactions between brain regions and identify the combinations of regions which showed higher levels of nonequilibrium in their interactions. For individual regions, we find higher irreversibility in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions while for pairs, strong relationships are uncovered between cognitive and sensorial pairs in the same hemisphere. For triplets and quadruplets, the most nonequilibrium interactions are between cognitive–sensorial pairs alongside medial regions. Combining these results, we show that multilevel irreversibility offers unique insights into the higher-order, hierarchical organization of neural dynamics from the perspective of brain network dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing number of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) structures being resolved, the dynamic process of how GPCRs transit from the inactive toward the active state remains unclear. In this study, comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore how ligand binding modulates the conformational dynamics of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R). We observed a sequential occurrence of structural changes in the inactive-to-active transition of M2R induced by a superagonist iperoxo, which includes the orthosteric binding site contraction, the TM6 opening into an intermediate conformation, and a further structural change toward full activation upon binding to G protein or a G protein mimetic nanobody. Two activation intermediates were identified, which show structural features different from those reported for apo-GPCRs. Moreover, our results suggest that stabilization of a specific W400 6.48 conformation and enhanced F396 6.44 dynamics are crucial for activation, whereas distinct side-chain rotamer equilibriums of Y206 5.58 in the cytoplasmic cavity are correlated with agonist efficacies. Our work provides atomic-level structural insights into the agonist-induced M2R activation pathway and highlights a mechanism by which ligand efficacy can be encoded and transduced in the form of aromatic ring dynamics.",

While eight binding sites on the tubulin dimer have been structurally characterized, this study reveals a ninth. We found that the tubulin inhibitor Tumabulin-1 (TM1, a BML284 derivative) binds simultaneously to the well-known colchicine site and a previously unknown site, designated as Tumabulin site. This site resides at the interface of α1-tubulin, β1-tubulin, and RB3 within the tubulin–RB3–tubulintyrosine ligase complex. Remarkably, two TM1 molecules bind cooperatively to this relatively large pocket, interacting with all three proteins. Crucially, this binding is dependent on RB3; it is absent when RB3 is missing or the key residue H71 is mutated (H71Q). We further designed and synthesized Tumabulin-2 (TM2) that selectively binds the Tumabulin site, excluding binding the colchicine site. TM2 acts as a molecular glue, strengthening the interaction between RB3 and the tubulin dimer and consequently enhancing RB3’s tubulin-depolymerizing activity. In conclusion, our findings confirm the existence of a ninth tubulin-binding site and offer a promising foundation for developing Tubulin–RB3 molecular glues as a next generation of anticancer therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Inflammation is among the known causes of cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL), but its exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that pyroptosis—a recently identified inflammatory type of regulated cell death dependent on gasdermin D (GSDMD)—was activated in the cochleae of cisplatin-treated mice, causing CIHL. Meanwhile, treatment with the GSDMD inhibitor necrosulfonamide alleviated CIHL in these mice. To further examine the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in CIHL, we conducted experiments in Gsdmd- deficient mice . Gsdmd −/− mice demonstrated significantly lower cisplatin-induced cochlear damage than control mice and appeared to be invulnerable to CIHL. Furthermore, GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in the stria vascularis (SV), but not in the hair cells (HCs), played a dominant role in CIHL. In marginal cells (MCs) of SV, cisplatin induced caspase-dependent GSDMD cleavage, and the pore-forming N-terminal of GSDMD rapidly localized to the mitochondria, leading to abnormal mitochondrial aggregation and oxidative stress. The consequent mitochondrial dysfunction in MCs might result in the severe progression of inflammation, SV damage, and HC loss. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of pyroptosis using the FDA-approved drug disulfiram effectively alleviated the symptoms of CIHL. Collectively, these findings offer a broad avenue for inhibiting pyroptosis-induced cisplatin ototoxicity and provide valuable theoretical insights for the clinical management of CIHL.",

Here, we found that the internalization of DR5, an important receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiates apoptosis to inhibit Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication. An evolutionary analysis of the DR5 sequence demonstrated that three amino acids underwent positive selection in primates. Notably, one of these positive selection sites, A62, is essential for the antiviral function of DR5 and is important for the binding of DR5 to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, DR5 exhibits broad antiviral activity against and inhibits various herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and herpes simplex virus type 2. As a countermeasure, the KSHV K5 protein interacts with DR5 and promotes DR5 degradation through the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; lysine 245 of DR5 is essential for K5-induced DR5 degradation. These findings demonstrate that DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses.",

However, its role in shaping behavior remains unclear. Recent evidence shows that resting-state spatial patterns not only align with task-evoked topographies but also encode distinct visual (e.g., lines, contours, faces, places) and motor (e.g., hand postures) features, suggesting mechanisms for long-term storage and predictive coding. While prior research focused on static, time-averaged task activations, we examine whether dynamic, time-varying motor states seen during active hand movements are also present at rest. Three distinct motor activation states, engaging the motor cortex alongside sensory and association areas, were identified. These states appeared both at rest and during task execution but underwent temporal reorganization from rest to task. Thus, resting-state dynamics serve as strong spatiotemporal priors for task-based activation. Critically, resting-state patterns more closely resembled those associated with frequent ecological hand movements than with an unfamiliar movement, indicating a structured repertoire of movement patterns that is replayed at rest and reorganized during action. This suggests that spontaneous neural activity provides priors for future movements and contributes to long-term memory storage, reinforcing the functional interplay between resting and task-driven brain activity.",

Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator—a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning–assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.",

The O 2 -dependent aromatase that converts androgen to estrogen (estrogenesis) has never been identified in any prokaryotes. Here, we report the finding of anaerobic estrogenesis in a Peptococcaceae bacterium ( Phosphitispora sp. strain TUW77) isolated from the gut of the great blue-spotted mudskipper ( Boleophthalmus pectinirostris ). This strain exhibits testosterone fermentation pathways, transforming testosterone into estrogens and androstanediol under anaerobic conditions. Physiological experiments revealed that strain TUW77 grows exclusively on testosterone, utilizing the androgenic C-19 methyl group as both the carbon source and electron donor. The genomic analysis identified three copies of a polycistronic gene cluster, abeABC (anaerobic bacterial estrogenesis), encoding components of a classic cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase system. These genes, highly expressed under testosterone-fed conditions, show up to 57% protein identity to the characterized EmtAB from denitrifying Denitratisoma spp., known for methylating estrogen into androgen (the reverse reaction). Tiered transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that the removed C-19 methyl group is completely oxidized to CO 2 via the oxidative Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), while the reducing equivalents (NADH) fully reduce remaining testosterone to androstanediol. Consistently, the addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, an extracellular electron acceptor, to testosterone-fed TUW77 cultures enabled complete testosterone conversion into estrogen without androstanediol accumulation (anaerobic testosterone oxidation). This finding of aromatase-independent estrogenesis in anaerobic bacteria suggests that the ancient WLP may have contributed to the emergence of estrogens in the early biosphere.",

We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly.

          "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TADs) are sub-Megabase regions in vertebrate genomes with enriched intradomain interactions that restrict enhancer–promoter contacts across their boundaries. However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, here we show that the width of TAD boundaries forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBSs distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the random crosslinker polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis, using three generic boundary categories, identifies differential influence on TAD insulation, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in establishing genome organization. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer–promoter contacts over long distances across TAD boundaries, providing a further mechanism for transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Some viruses counter host-cell efforts to digest invading viral RNA by using special structures resistant to host RNases, known as exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs). xrRNAs typically form an unusual fold with the 5′-end threaded through a ring consisting of a multihelix junction closed by a pseudoknot. By using single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we previously showed that a Zika virus xrRNA is extremely rigid mechanically, withstanding very high forces, and that this mechanical resistance—not simply the knot-like fold topology—is essential for RNase resistance. Here, we have determined which interactions are most important for generating mechanical rigidity in the Zika virus xrRNA, by systematically mutating tertiary contacts. We found that removing any of the tertiary contacts involving the threaded 5′ end was sufficient to abrogate mechanical resistance. In contrast, breaking a single pseudoknot base pair was not sufficient to do so: Two broken pairs were needed. This hierarchy of interaction importance for mechanical rigidity was supported by simulations mapping how mechanical tension was distributed within the xrRNA. For all mutants, RNase resistance varied in lock-step with mechanical resistance, confirming the primary role of mechanical rigidity in xrRNA function. This work reveals which interactions are most important for Zika xrRNA function, with implications for targeting the xrRNA therapeutically.",

More than seven decades have passed since Waddington’s pioneering demonstration of the acquisition of morphological traits through genetic assimilation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by performing combined genomic analyses of Waddington’s genetic assimilation experiments using the ectopic veins (EV) phenocopy in Drosophila as a model. Our study reveals the assimilation of EV in both outbred and inbred fly natural populations, despite their limited genetic diversity. We identified key changes in the expression of developmental genes and pinpointed selected alleles involved in EV assimilation. The assimilation of EV is mainly driven by the selection of regulatory alleles already present in the ancestral populations, including the downregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Cad96Ca by the insertion of a transposable element in its 3′ untranslated region. The genetic variation at this locus in the inbred population is maintained by a large chromosomal inversion. In outbred populations, the evolution of EV results from a polygenic response shaped by the selective environment. Our results support a model in which selection for multiple preexisting alleles in the ancestral population, rather than stress-induced genetic or epigenetic variation, drives the evolution of EV in natural fly populations.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which NBS1 mutations cause clinical phenotypes of NBS, such as craniofacial dysmorphism, is still unclear. Here, we show that NBS1 localizes at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci in nucleoli and interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery including RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and TCOF1. Loss of NBS1 impairs Pol I-dependent transcription of pre-rRNA and induces nucleolar stress. In particular, lacking Nbs1 in mouse neural crest cells not only leads to the reduction of ribosome biogenesis but also craniofacial abnormalities during prenatal development. Moreover, the C-terminus of NBS1 is associated with pre-rRNA and a number of pre-rRNA processing factors, which may also facilitate pre-rRNA maturation.

Here, we report that a p53-induced circular RNA circASCC3 promotes chemotherapeutic resistance by resolving R-loops. Our results reveal that p53 directly activates the transcription of ASCC3 , the host gene of circASCC3. In addition, the RNA-binding protein SFPQ is identified to inhibit the formation of circASCC3 by associating with its flanking regions. Importantly, p53 facilitates the formation of circASCC3 by repressing the expression of SFPQ. CircASCC3 has a marginal effect on the survival and growth of cancer cells under normal growing conditions but surprisingly boosts their survival and growth in response to DNA damage stress. Mechanistic analysis reveals that circASCC3 binds to the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 to inhibit its proteasomal degradation. This results in the prevention of R-loop accumulation due to DNA damage, thereby conferring tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Together, our study uncovers that p53 activates circASCC3 to promote R-loop resolution, which maintains genomic stability and potentially contributes to chemoresistance.",

Unless their therapeutic effects are solely mediated by paracrine, transplanted stem cells need to be highly plastic to adapt to the host tissue environment and differentiate into constituent tissue-specific cells for tissue repair. Stem cells used in current cell-based therapies either have limited differentiation potential or are pluripotent but must be strictly restricted to avoid tumorigenicity risk in vivo. Here, we describe the derivation of human adult high-plasticity stem cells, which we call guide-integrated adult stem cells (giaSCs), from the interaction of blood-derived guide cells and umbilical cord tissue–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). The guide cells are a cell population derived from the peripheral blood of human adults. Unidirectional transfer through nanotube-like structures of granular substances from the guide cells into the recipient UC-MSCs gave rise to giaSCs. Topical application of human giaSCs into full-layer excisional wounds of wild-type mice led to reconstitution of skin tissue. Systemically administered human giaSCs migrated to and reside in mouse small intestinal tissue damaged by lipopolysaccharides and then differentiated into small intestinal epithelial cells for tissue repair. These transplantation experiments demonstrated that giaSCs have in vivo high plasticity. Additional in vivo and in vitro data showed that giaSCs have low immunogenicity and are nontumorigenic. These data indicate that giaSCs offer a highly promising approach to stem cell therapy.",

In the present study, we identified the m 6 A methylation of the viral RNA of different IAV subtypes and confirmed that m 6 A modification promotes the polymerase activity and replication of IAV. By mutating m 6 A motifs on the multiple viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV, we revealed that m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the expression of viral genes and the replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA reduced the pathogenicity of IAV in a mouse model. Mechanistically, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex by impairing the interaction between vRNA and vRNP proteins in an m 6 A methyltransferase-dependent manner, but not the m 6 A reader proteins.

          "abstract": "Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that establishes a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis within root nodules of legumes. In this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes a drastic cellular change leading to a terminally differentiated form, called bacteroid, characterized by genome endoreduplication, increased cell size, and high membrane permeability. Bacterial cell cycle (mis)regulation is at the heart of this differentiation process. In free-living cells, the master regulator CtrA ensures the progression of cell cycle by activating cell division (controlled by FtsZ) and inhibiting DNA replication, while on the other hand the so far poorly unknown downregulation of CtrA and FtsZ is essential for bacteroid differentiation. Here, we combine cell biology, biochemistry, and bacterial genetics to understand the functions of FcrX, a factor that controls both CtrA and FtsZ in free-living growth and in symbiosis. Depletion of the essential gene fcrX led to abnormally high levels of FtsZ and CtrA and minicell formation. Using multiple complementary techniques, we showed that FcrX may interact with FtsZ and CtrA. Moreover, fcrX transcription is directly controlled by CtrA itself and the FcrX protein displays a cell cycle-dependent pattern. We showed further that FcrX also binds the degradosome complex ClpXP and its adaptors CpdR1 and RcdA, and that CtrA degradation efficiency depends on FcrX. We further showed that, despite weak homology with FliJ-like proteins, only FcrX proteins from closely related species are able to complement S. meliloti fcrX function. Finally, deregulation of FcrX showed abnormal symbiotic behaviors in plants suggesting a putative role of this factor during bacteroid differentiation.",

In situ control and manipulation to achieve diversity in emulsion droplets for emerging applications is challenging. In a liquid crystal-based emulsion, the surface anchoring of the molecules at the isotropic fluid-liquid crystal interface introduces elastic distortions that result in anisotropic interparticle interactions, similar to electrostatic interactions between multipoles, which also lends a naming analogy as elastic dipoles, quadrupoles, and higher. However, controlling the anchoring condition at the interface at will is rarely achieved. Here, we present an emulsion system in which silicone oil droplets in a nematic liquid crystal spontaneously induce conic surface anchoring, forming elastic hexadecapoles without any surfactant. The conic degenerate surface anchoring shows continuous reversible anchoring transition to tangential and homeotropic below and above the ambient temperature, respectively. We introduce a physical design principle and in situ control to achieve three-phase compound droplets with diverse morphologies and topologies by fusing elastic hexadecapoles of oil droplets with elastic dipoles of glycerol droplets. The surrounding director field and the resulting defect structure of the compound droplets are analyzed by numerical simulations. Our approach to forming compound droplets will allow the on-demand design of building blocks for engineered emulsions for reconfigurable composite materials.",

These allow seed plants to adapt to diverse environments by optimizing resource allocation and structural integrity. In seed plants, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE ( SMXL ) family members function in phloem development and strigolactone-induced inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Although strigolactone signaling regulates most SMXL family members, the only known regulator of SMXL4 and SMXL5 is the RNA-binding protein JULGI. We demonstrate that in angiosperms, by directly regulating SMXL4/5 expression, JULGI uncouples SMXL4/5 activity from strigolactone signaling. JULGI and ancestral SMXL s from seedless vascular plants or SMXL4/5 from seed plants are coexpressed in the phloem tissues of vascular plants, from lycophytes to angiosperms. Core angiosperm SMXL4/5 mRNAs contain a G-rich element in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that serves as a target sequence for JULGI to negatively regulate SMXL4/5 expression. Heterologous expression of JULGI s from various angiosperms rescued the Arabidopsis jul1 jul2 mutant. Expressing SMXL4/5 s from seed plants and ancestral SMXL s rescued Arabidopsis smxl4 smxl5 . Angiosperm SMXL4/5s lack an RGKT motif for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analog rac -GR24 induced proteasomal degradation of SMXL from ferns and SMXL5a from gymnosperms, but not SMXL4/5 from angiosperms. These findings suggest that in ancestral angiosperms, the 5′ UTR of SMXL4/5 gained G-rich elements, creating a regulatory module with JULGI that allows the phloem development pathway to act independently of strigolactone signaling.",

One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as E ( 3 d n − 1 4 s 1 ) − E ( 3 d n − 2 4 s 2 ) . Theoretical concerns have been raised about this definition due to its evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlation in the 4s 2 configuration. Here, we define a ground-state measure of the sd energy imbalance, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the 3d atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from the local spin density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the regularized and restored Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (r 2 SCAN) meta-GGA for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we find large (∼2 eV) ground-state sd energy imbalances when applying a Perdew–Zunger 1981 self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an “energy penalty” associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a balance of s- and d-errors.",

Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, so understanding the dynamical principles underlying self-reconfiguration may prove of import to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple example of dynamical reconfiguration: a family of networks whose signal pathways can be switched on the fly, only through use of their inputs, with no changes to their synaptic weights. These are single-layer convolutional recurrent network with local unitary synaptic weights and a smooth sigmoidal activation function. We generate traveling waves using the high spatiotemporal frequencies of the input, and we use the low spatiotemporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, channeling said traveling waves through an input-specified spatial pattern. This mechanism uses inherent properties of marginally stable, dynamically critical systems, which are a direct consequence of their unitary convolution kernels: every network in the family can do this. We show these networks solve the classical connectedness detection problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness, and forbidding it elsewhere.",

Two neurodegenerative events occur early in the optic nerve, the structural link between the retina and brain: loss of anterograde transport in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and early alterations in astrocyte structure and function. Here, we used whole-mount tissue clearing of full mouse brains to image RGC anterograde transport function and astrocyte responses across retinorecipient regions early in a unilateral microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. Using light sheet imaging, we found that RGC projections terminating specifically in the accessory optic tract are the first to lose transport function. Although degeneration was induced in one retina, astrocytes in both brain hemispheres responded to transport loss in a retinotopic pattern that mirrored the degenerating RGCs. A subpopulation of these astrocytes in contact with large descending blood vessels were immunopositive for LCN2, a marker associated with astrocyte reactivity. Together, these data suggest that even early stages of unilateral glaucoma have broad impacts on the health of astrocytes across both hemispheres of the brain, implying a glial mechanism behind neurodegenerative comorbidity in glaucoma.",

Using a Bayesian Kalman filtering approach to estimate TSI from both satellite-based observations and proxies gives two complementary explanations: recent satellite-based observations of TSI contain unaccounted-for positive linear drifts, and regression-based reconstructions are affected by commonly used solar magnetic proxies becoming less sensitive to TSI variations at low values. After accounting for satellite instrument drifts and reduced sensitivity, direct and proxy observations come into agreement and together indicate a linear trend in overall TSI of −0.15 W/m 2 per decade with a 95% CI of −0.17 to −0.13 W/m 2 per decade between 1980 and 2023.",

Here, we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a space-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction, and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision-making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.",

          "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel whose dysfunction leads to intracellular accumulation of chloride ions, dehydration of cell surfaces, and subsequent damage to airway and ductal organs. Beyond its function as a chloride channel, interactions between CFTR, epithelium sodium channel, and solute carrier (SLC) transporter family membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins, including calmodulin and Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1), coregulate ion homeostasis. CFTR has also been observed to form mesoscale membrane clusters. However, the contributions of multivalent protein and lipid interactions to cluster formation are not well understood. Using a combination of computational modeling and biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions with CFTR protein binding partners, calcium, and membrane cholesterol can induce mesoscale CFTR cluster formation on model membranes. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CFTR also promotes mesoscale cluster formation in the absence of calcium, indicating that multiple mechanisms can contribute to CFTR cluster formation. Our findings reveal that coupling of multivalent protein and lipid interactions promotes CFTR cluster formation consistent with membrane-associated biological phase separation.",

          "abstract": "Microbial communities vary across space, time, and individual hosts, generating a need for statistical methods capable of quantifying variability across multiple microbiome samples at once. To understand heterogeneity across microbiome samples from different host individuals, sampling times, spatial locations, or experimental replicates, we present FAVA ( F ST -based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances), a framework for characterizing compositional variability across two or more microbiome samples. FAVA quantifies variability across many samples of taxonomic or functional relative abundances in a single index ranging between 0 and 1, equaling 0 when all samples are identical and 1 when each sample is entirely composed of a single taxon (and at least two distinct taxa are present across samples). Its definition relies on the population-genetic statistic F ST , with samples playing the role of “populations” and taxa playing the role of “alleles.” Its mathematical properties allow users to compare datasets with different numbers of samples and taxonomic categories. We introduce extensions that incorporate phylogenetic similarity among taxa and spatial or temporal distances between samples. We demonstrate FAVA in two examples. First, we use FAVA to measure how the taxonomic and functional variability of gastrointestinal microbiomes across individuals from seven ruminant species changes along the gastrointestinal tract. Second, we use FAVA to quantify the increase in temporal variability of gut microbiomes in healthy humans following an antibiotic course and to measure the duration of the antibiotic’s influence on temporal microbiome variability. We have implemented this tool in an R package, FAVA , for use in pipelines for the analysis of microbial relative abundances.",

          "abstract": "Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.",

          "abstract": "Muscle contraction is driven by myosin motors from the thick filaments pulling on the actin-containing thin filaments of the sarcomere, and it is regulated by structural changes in both filaments. Thin filaments are activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca 2+ ] i and by myosin binding to actin. Thick filaments are activated by direct sensing of the filament load. However, these mechanisms cannot explain muscle relaxation when [Ca 2+ ] i decreases at high load and myosin motors are attached to actin. There is, therefore, a fundamental gap in our understanding of muscle relaxation, despite its importance for muscle function in vivo, for example, for rapid eye movements or, on slower timescales, for the efficient control of posture. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) to determine how muscle thin and thick filaments switch OFF in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the mouse in response to decreases in either [Ca 2+ ] i or muscle load and to describe the distribution of muscle sarcomere lengths (SLs) during relaxation. We show that reducing load at high [Ca 2+ ] i is more effective in switching OFF both the thick and thin filaments than reducing [Ca 2+ ] i at high load in normal relaxation. In the latter case, the thick filaments initially remain fully ON, although the number of myosin motors bound to actin decreases and the force per attached motor increases. That initial slow phase of relaxation is abruptly terminated by yielding of one population of sarcomeres, triggering a redistribution of SLs that leads to the rapid completion of mechanical relaxation.",

In a DMD mouse model, mdx 5cv mice, CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) deficiency diminishes Ly6C hi macrophage infiltration by blocking blood Ly6C hi inflammatory monocyte recruitment. This is accompanied by transient improvement of muscle damage, fibrosis, and regeneration. The benefit, however, is lost after the expansion of intramuscular Ly6C lo macrophages. To address the mechanisms underlying the Ly6C lo macrophage expansion, we compared mdx 5cv /Nur77 −/− and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− /Nur7 −/− mice with mdx 5cv and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− mice, respectively, and found no evidence to suggest Ly6C lo monocyte recruitment by dystrophic muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Flt3 cre /Rosa26 LSL-YFP -based lineage tracing of macrophage origins demonstrated the expansion and pathogenic activation of muscle resident macrophages in CCR2-deficient mdx 5cv mice. The expansion was associated with increased cell proliferation, which appeared induced by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) derived from fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Our study establishes a pathogenic role for skeletal muscle resident macrophages and supports a regulatory role of FAPs in stimulating the expansion of resident macrophages in the DMD mouse model when the inflammatory macrophage infiltration is inhibited.",

          "abstract": "The transthyretin (TTR) tetramer, assembled as a dimer of dimers, transports thyroxine and retinol binding protein in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Aggregation of wild type (WT) or pathogenic variant TTR leads to transthyretin amyloidosis, which is associated with neurodegenerative and cardiac disease. The trigger for TTR aggregation under physiological conditions is unknown. The tetramer is extremely stable at neutral pH, but aggregation via tetramer dissociation and monomer misfolding can be induced in vitro by lowering the pH. To elucidate factors that may cause TTR aggregation at neutral pH, we examined the effect of shear forces such as those that arise from fluid flow in the vascular system. Fluid shear forces were generated by rapidly stirring TTR solutions in conical microcentrifuge tubes. Under agitation, TTR formed β-rich aggregates and fibrils at a rate that was dependent upon protein concentration. The lag time before the onset of agitation-induced aggregation increases as the total TTR concentration is increased, consistent with a mechanism in which the tetramer first dissociates to form monomer that either partially unfolds to enter the aggregation pathway or reassociates to form tetramer. NMR spectra recorded at various time points during the lag phase revealed growth of an aggregation-prone intermediate trapped as a dynamically perturbed tetramer. Enhanced conformational fluctuations in the weak dimer–dimer interface suggest loosening of critical intersubunit contacts which likely destabilizes the agitated tetramer and predisposes it toward dissociation. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of aggregation of WT human TTR under near-physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake is critical in cardiac adaptation to chronic stressors. Abnormalities in Ca 2+ handling, including mitochondrial uptake mechanisms, have been implicated in pathological heart hypertrophy. Enhancing mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) expression has been suggested to interfere with maladaptive development of heart failure. Here, we addressed whether MCU modulation affects the cardiac response to pressure overload. MCU content was quantified in human and murine hearts at different phases of myocardial hypertrophy. Cardiac function/structure were analyzed after Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) in mice undergone viral-assisted overexpression or downregulation of MCU. In vitro and ex vivo assays determined the effect of MCU modulation on mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake, cellular phenotype and hypertrophic signaling. In human and murine hearts MCU levels increased in the adaptive phase of myocardial hypertrophy and declined in the failing stage. Consistently, modulation of MCU had a cell-autonomous effect in cardiomyocyte/heart adaptation to chronic overload. Indeed, upon TAC MCU-downregulation accelerated development of contractile dysfunction, interstitial fibrosis and heart failure. Conversely, MCU-overexpression prolonged the adaptive phase of hypertrophic response, as, in advanced stages upon TAC, hearts showed preserved contractility, absence of fibrosis and intact vascularization. In vitro and ex vivo analyses indicated that enhancement in mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes entails “mitochondrion-to-cytoplasm” signals leading to ROS-mediated activation of Akt, which may explain the protective effects towards heart response to TAC. Enhanced mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake affects the compensatory response to pressure overload via retrograde mitochondrial-Ca 2+ /ROS/Akt signaling, thus uncovering a potentially targetable mechanism against maladaptive myocardial hypertrophy.",

Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22.

In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis via G i -cyclic AMP signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity.

          "abstract": "Global change drives biodiversity shifts worldwide, but these shifts are poorly understood in highly diverse tropical regions. In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species’ occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change. Our results highlight the vulnerability of cloud forests under global change and the urgency to increase monitoring of species’ responses.",

We demonstrate an inexpensive mandrel-free method for making polymer muscles that can have a spring index of &gt;50 and a contractile tensile stroke exceeding 97%. This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle’s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets. This mandrel-free method was used to make high-spring-index carbon nanotube yarns for mechanical energy harvesters, self-powered strain sensors, and solvent-driven and electrochemically driven artificial muscles.",

To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions.",

We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins.

The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces β cells. Candida dubliniensis increases β cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence.

To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.",

This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests.

Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation.

Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting.",

          "abstract": "At the end of the Cretaceous, the massive Deccan trap (DT) volcanic eruptions are regarded as the primary driver of global climate deterioration. Accurate age models are key to unravel the sequence of events related to DT volcanism onset and effects on the global climate system. We establish a direct geochemical link between DT volcanism as recorded in marine osmium isotopic data and global climate change documented in benthic foraminifera carbon and oxygen isotope records. Based on our state-of-the-art astronomically calibrated age model, two major shifts in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os at 66.49 and 66.28 million years ago are contemporaneous with major eruption phases of the DT and disruptions of the global carbon cycle. Geochemical records and modeling suggest larger erupted volumes with high volatile emissions for the early phase of DT volcanism and point to differing emissions of SO 2 and CO 2 during the observed marine osmium shifts with diverse effects on the global climate system.",

Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient. Here, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of aging mice, revealing citrulline as a consistently down-regulated metabolite associated with aging. Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes.",

The liver resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, form the hepatic firewall to clear many encapsulated bacteria in the blood circulation but fail to control certain high-virulence capsule types. Here we report that the spleen is the backup immune organ to clear the liver-resistant serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a leading human pathogen. Asplenic mice failed to control the growth of the liver-resistant pneumococci in the blood circulation. Immunologic and genetic analyses identified splenic red pulp (RP) macrophages as the major phagocytes for bacterial clearance. Furthermore, the plasma natural antibodies against the cell wall phosphocholine and the complement system were necessary for RP macrophage–mediated immunity. These findings have provided a conceptual framework for the innate defense against blood bacterial infections, a mechanistic explanation for the hyper-susceptibility of asplenic individuals to S. pneumoniae , and a proof of concept for developing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against encapsulated pathogens.",

However, most experimental systems either ignore gradients or fail to capture gradients in mechanically relevant contexts. Here, we use microfluidic experiments and biophysical simulations to explore how host-relevant shear flow affects antimicrobial gradients across communities of the highly resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials.",

This study uses an in vitro human cerebral organoid model with multiomic analysis, integrating advanced microscopies and single-cell RNA sequencing, to monitor tissue oxygen tension during neural development. Results reveal a key period between weeks 4 and 6 with elevated intra-organoid oxygen tension, altered energy homeostasis, and rapid neurogenesis within the organoids. The timed oxygen tension elevation can be suppressed by hypoxia treatment or silencing of neuroglobin gene. This study provides insights into the role of oxygen in early neurogenesis from functional, genotypic, phenotypic, and proteomic aspects. These findings highlight the significance of the timed tissue oxygen tension elevation in neurogenesis and provide insights into the role of neuroglobin in neural development, with potential implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "Whether restoration actions achieve full ecological recovery is still debated. This is particularly controversial in the marine realm, where the success of restoration is mostly evaluated in terms of the short-term survival of transplanted organisms. In view of this, we combined population and trait-based approaches to explore the long-term effectiveness of active restoration of a key Mediterranean octocoral. For this purpose, an assemblage with restored Corallium rubrum colonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales.",

          "abstract": "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a progressive disease, wherein males more often develop valve calcification relative to females that develop valve fibrosis. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) aberrantly activate to myofibroblasts during AVS, driving the fibrotic valve phenotype in females. Myofibroblasts further differentiate into osteoblast-like cells and produce calcium nanoparticles, driving valve calcification in males. We hypothesized that the lysine demethylase UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked) decreases methylation uniquely in male VICs responding to nanoscale extracellular matrix cues to promote an osteoblast-like cell phenotype. Here, we describe a hydrogel biomaterial cell culture platform to interrogate how nanoscale cues modulate sex-specific methylation states in VICs activating to myofibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells. We found that UTY modulates the osteoblast-like cell phenotype in response to nanoscale cues uniquely in male VICs. Overall, we reveal a previously unidentified role of UTY in the regulation of calcification processes in males during AVS progression.",

          "abstract": "Lipid homeostasis is critical to neuronal survival. ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that the Drosophila ABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus, Eato deficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additional Eato loss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescue Eato loss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases.",

We identified genome subcompartmentalization and chromatin interactions specific to GBM, as well as extensive intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity at these levels. We identified copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) and demonstrated how they disrupted 3D genome structures. SVs could not only induce enhancer hijacking but also cause the loss of enhancers to the same gene, both of which contributed to gene dysregulation.

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of LIPT1 in regulating DNA damage and chromosome stability and may suggest a means to enhance therapeutic outcomes with DNA-damaging agents.",

The neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, best known for its role in controlling energy homeostasis, has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a range of cancer types, but its role in PC has yet to be explored. We show that expression of NPY and NPY1R are up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KP R172H C mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout of Npy1r significantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KP R172H C migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices. Pharmacological NPY1R inhibition in an intrasplenic model of PC metastasis recapitulated the results of our genetic studies, with BIBO3304 significantly decreasing liver metastasis.

Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.",

Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4.

Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature.",

Here, we show that the pathway leading to cell death depends on the nature of the activating signal. Previous models suggest that in steady state, TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die slowly and spontaneously predominantly by uncontrolled tumor necrosis factor–RIPK1–driven death. However, upon infection of cells that express the NLRP3 inflammasome, (e.g., macrophages), with pathogens that activate this pathway (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes ), TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die rapidly, prematurely, and exclusively by enhanced NLRP3-driven pyroptosis. Even infection with the RIPK1-activating pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , results in enhanced RIPK1–caspase-8 activation and enhanced secondary NLRP3 activation. Mechanistically, TBK1/IKKε control endosomal traffic, and their loss disrupts endosomal homeostasis, thereby signaling cell stress. This results in premature NLRP3 activation even upon sensing “signal 2” alone, without the obligatory “signal 1.” Collectively, TBK1/IKKε emerge as a central brake in limiting death-induced inflammation by both RIPK1 and NLRP3 death-inducing pathways.",

Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis by LACC1 / Lacc1 knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore, Lacc1 −/− mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo.

We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

          "abstract": "In vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, the precise output of the final effectors, GLI (glioma-associated oncogene) transcription factors, depends on the primary cilium. Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway–specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.",

Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear. We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.",

This remarkable activity is largely attributable to the deltaproteobacterial family Desulfobacteraceae of complete oxidizers (to CO 2 ), which our biogeography focused meta-analysis verified as cosmopolitan. However, the catabolic/regulatory networks underlying this ecophysiological feat at the thermodynamic limit are essentially unknown. Integrating cultivation-based (80 conditions) proteogenomics of six representative Desulfobacteraceae spp., we identify molecular commonalities explaining the family’s environmental relevance and success. Desulfobacteraceae genomes are specifically enriched in substrate uptake, degradation capacities, and regulatory functions including fine-tuned sulfate uptake. Conserved gene arrangements and shared regulatory patterns translate into strikingly similar (sub-)proteome profiles. From 319 proteins, we constructed a meta-network for catabolizing 35 substrates. Therefrom, we defined a Desulfobacteraceae characteristic gene subset, which we found prevalent in metagenomes of organic-rich, marine sediments. These genes are promising targets to advance our mechanistic understanding of Desulfobacteraceae -driven biogeochemical processes in marine sediments and beyond.",

Palm1 binds to the amino-terminal region of βII-spectrin, and MINFLUX microscopy localizes it in close proximity (&lt;20 nanometers) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Combining overexpression, knockout, and rescue experiments, we observe that the expression level of Palm1 controls the degree of periodicity of the MPS and also affects the electrophysiological properties of neurons. A single amino acid mutation (W54A) in Palm1 abolishes the MPS binding and remodeling activities of Palm1.

Enteroviruses use the cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5′ end of the genome to balance these two processes. Cloverleaf acts as a promoter for RNA synthesis and forms a complex with viral 3CD protein, the precursor to 3C pro protease, and 3D pol polymerase. The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3C pro domain, yet how 3C pro promotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3C pro complex, wherein two 3C pro molecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3C pro dimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3C pro is a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein. We show that 3CD protein also dimerizes on cloverleaf RNA and binds the RNA with higher affinity than 3C pro .

We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem. These findings provide a framework to understand how the brain infers pain from innocuous thermal inputs, with important implications for the etiology of thermosensory symptoms under chronic pain conditions.",

In this study, using biochemical, computational, and cell-based assays, we report that the caspase-11 CARD functions as a bipartite lipid-binding module. Distinct regions within the CARD bind to phosphate groups and long acyl chains of self- and nonself-lipids. Self-lipid binding capability is conserved across numerous caspase-11 homologs and orthologs. The symmetry in self- and nonself-lipid detection mechanisms enabled us to engineer an LPS-binding domain de novo, using an ancestral CARD-like domain present in the fish Amphilophus citrinellus .

Here, we demonstrate an approach to control the generation and injection nature of plasmonic hot holes released from Au nanomesh/p-type GaN (p-GaN) Schottky architecture by modulating polarity of p-GaN. This polarity modulation enhances the flux of hot holes into the plasmonic platform, thereby accelerating Landau damping stemming from increased effective heat capacity of hot electrons in the metallic nanomaterial. We observed that this strategy drives the intensified hot-hole flux even in non–hot spot areas, hinting at the prospect of leveraging the complete potential of the plasmonic device beyond usual hot spots. The polarity modulation in plasmonic Schottky device gives rise to opportunities for manipulating the nature of plasmonic hot carriers for future energy conversion devices.",

To address this, we generated cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients with ALS-FTLD harboring the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic and healthy controls. Here, we show a higher mtDNA single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) burden in astroglia derived from C9ORF72 -mutant organoids, with some de novo mtSNVs likely due to the C9ORF72 repeat and others evading selection to reach higher heteroplasmy levels.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetically encoded biosensors, and in toto live imaging, we observe intrinsic variations in erbb2 expression and its association with trabecular fate. Specifically, erbb2 promotes PI3K activity and recruits the Arp2/3 complex, inducing a polarized accumulation of the actomyosin network to drive cell delamination. Subsequently, the lineage-committed nascent trabeculae trigger Notch activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes to suppress erbb2 expression and reduce cell tension, thereby confining them to the compact layer.

Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years.

          "abstract": "Microneedles directly penetrating into the cornea inevitably cause pain, corneal structure damage, and reduced light transmittance. In this work, a minimally invasive annular microneedle (A-MN) patch was developed avoiding direct puncture into the central cornea for ophthalmic drug delivery. The feasible mechanical strength of A-MNs was achieved by adjusting the ratio of PVP-β-CD and PVA to puncture the cornea barrier. Through effective diffusion to corneal stroma, bioavailability of hydrophilic small-molecule drugs, hydrophobic drugs, and macromolecular protein drugs through an A-MN patch was 24.36, 17.47, and 5.36 times higher than that of free drug administration. A-MNs effectively maintained light transmittance of the cornea with a light transmittance of 96.33 to 100%, which was higher than that of S-MNs. Furthermore, A-MNs effectively avoided corneal tissue and nerve damage along with the pain. The efficiency and safety of A-MNs were also examined through both an in vitro cell experiment and an in vivo animal experimental model, which showed great potential in clinical application.",

          "abstract": "Topical drug delivery on ocular surface always suffers from frequent administration and low bioavailability due to short drug residence. Despite advances of different adhesive ophthalmic drugs in extending release, cornea and eyelid nonselective adhesion inevitably causes ocular discomfort and even damage. Here, we describe in situ formation of an adhesive lubricative Janus nanocoating (ALJN) to enable long-lasting comfort drug delivery. By iron complexation, an asymmetric ALJN is formed on ocular surface via facile sequential instillation. The adhesive polyphenol inner layer binding with ocular surface enables drug loading and sustained release, while the lubricative zwitterionic polymer outer layer prevents eyelid adhesion to ensure comfort. Following instillation, ALJN retains on ocular surface over 24 hours and reduces blinking frequency to normal level. Moreover, ALJN demonstrates remarkable therapeutic potential in mouse and rabbit models of corneal contusion and alkali burn. This work proposes a comfortable long-lasting topical delivery platform for treating various ocular diseases.",

          "abstract": "Learning and memory deficits, including spatial navigation difficulties, are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several ASD mouse models ( Scn2a +/− , Fmr1 −/− , Cdkl5 −/− ) exhibit impaired spatial learning, with these deficits often attributed to hippocampal dysfunction. However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wide Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen in Scn2a +/− mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediated Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits in Scn2a +/− mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments in Fmr1 and Cdkl5 knockout mice. Thus, in several genetic models of ASD, PRC abnormalities may disrupt hippocampal function to impair learning and memory.",

Additionally, RBM films endure 500 stretch cycles (0 to 15% strain) with stable and reversible resistance alterations, making them ideal for stretchable electrodes.

Using Ni-Fe bimetallic phosphides as a model catalyst, operando Q-XAFS experiments reveal that the structural transformation initiates at the preferential oxidation of Fe sites over Ni sites. The in situ–generated O-Fe-P structure serves as the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity of the catalyst, a finding supported by theoretical calculations.

The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.",

Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in &lt;90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic. The proteomic signatures reflect the effects of plastic distal to the site of exposure (i.e., the stomach).

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects.

We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers. Property enhancements attributed to the progression of anisotropic extension are verified by mechanical tests of drawn silk fibers and justified by theory.

This method relies on FAP-catalyzed in situ self-assembly of its substrate probe that leads to the increase of the rotational correlation time (τ R ) of probe, thereby notably amplifies T 1 MRI signal. Thanks to the superior specificity and efficiency of enzymatic reaction, our method has been validated as highly selective and sensitive to FAP in two liver fibrosis mouse models.

By using point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography with sulfonate-based dye molecules, we achieved nanoscale imaging of polymer blend films while specifically labeling non-oxygen domains and excluding oxygen-containing domains. This selectivity is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the dye molecules and the oxygen atoms in the polymer side chains. We demonstrate the applicability of oxygen-excluded nanoimaging to various polymer blend films, enabling domain identification and visualization of nanoscale structures. Our oxygen-excluded nanoimaging technique provides unique insights into the complex phase separation behavior of polymer blends at the nanoscale, opening possibilities for the nanoscale characterization of a wide range of materials beyond polymer blends.",

It elucidates how the family transitioned from industrial management to becoming a significant player in international financial investment. By delving into archival materials and conducting interviews with key executives and family members, this study illustrates the family’s adeptness at maintaining control over its industrial empire by associating external financiers and in fine unlocking resources for other lucrative financial ventures. This transformation was facilitated by a sophisticated three-tiered holding structure, which served dual purposes: overseeing capital control and managing private wealth, often through private equity mechanisms.
