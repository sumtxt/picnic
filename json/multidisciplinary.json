          "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines 1 , it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour 2 . This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems 3,4 . Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models 5 . Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them.",

          "abstract": "Accretion disks in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars) 1–4 and supermassive black holes 5 . Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems in which radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disk ( L ≳ L Edd ). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies 6 . Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ( L ≳ L Edd ). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disk than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disk. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast ( v ~ 0.3 c ) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at a similarly high Eddington ratio 7 .",

          "abstract": "Coral reefs form complex physical structures that can help to mitigate coastal flooding risk 1,2 . This function will be reduced by sea-level rise (SLR) and impaired reef growth caused by climate change and local anthropogenic stressors 3 . Water depths above reef surfaces are projected to increase as a result, but the magnitudes and timescales of this increase are poorly constrained, which limits modelling of coastal vulnerability 4,5 . Here we analyse fossil reef deposits to constrain links between reef ecology and growth potential across more than 400 tropical western Atlantic sites, and assess the magnitudes of resultant above-reef increases in water depth through to 2100 under various shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios. Our analysis predicts that more than 70% of tropical western Atlantic reefs will transition into net erosional states by 2040, but that if warming exceeds 2 °C (SSP2–4.5 and higher), nearly all reefs (at least 99%) will be eroding by 2100. The divergent trajectories of reef growth and SLR will thus magnify the effects of SLR; increases in water depth of around 0.3–0.5 m above the present are projected under all warming scenarios by 2060, but depth increases of 0.7–1.2 m are predicted by 2100 under scenarios in which warming surpasses 2 °C. This would increase the risk of flooding along vulnerable reef-fronted coasts and modify nearshore hydrodynamics and ecosystems. Reef restoration offers one pathway back to higher reef growth 6,7 , but would dampen the effects of SLR in 2100 only by around 0.3–0.4 m, and only when combined with aggressive climate mitigation.",

          "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates growth factor (GF) and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic processes connected to cell growth and inhibit catabolic processes such as autophagy 1,2 . GF signalling through the tuberous sclerosis complex regulates the lysosomally localized small GTPase RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) 3 . Direct binding of RHEB–GTP to the mTOR kinase subunit of mTORC1 allosterically activates the kinase by inducing a large-scale conformational change 4 . Here we reconstituted mTORC1 activation on membranes by RHEB, RAGs and Ragulator. Cryo-electron microscopy showed that RAPTOR and mTOR interact directly with the membrane. Full engagement of the membrane anchors is required for optimal alignment of the catalytic residues in the mTOR kinase active site. Converging signals from GFs and nutrients drive mTORC1 recruitment to and activation on lysosomal membrane in a four-step process, consisting of (1) RAG–Ragulator-driven recruitment to within ~100 Å of the lysosomal membrane; (2) RHEB-driven recruitment to within ~40 Å; (3) RAPTOR–membrane engagement and intermediate enzyme activation; and (4) mTOR–membrane engagement and full enzyme activation. RHEB and membrane engagement combined leads to full catalytic activation and structurally explains GF and nutrient signal integration at the lysosome.",

          "abstract": "General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) 1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting 3 , have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.",

          "abstract": "Neutrophils, the most abundant and biotoxic immune cells, extrude nuclear DNA into the extracellular space to maintain homeostasis. Termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), these protein-modified and decondensed extracellular DNA scaffolds control infection and are involved in coagulation, autoimmunity and cancer 1,2 . Here we show how myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly expressed neutrophil protein, disassembles nucleosomes, thereby facilitating NET formation, yet also binds stably to NETs extracellularly. We describe how the oligomeric status of MPO governs both outcomes. MPO dimers interact with nucleosomal DNA using one protomer and concurrently dock into the nucleosome acidic patch with the other protomer. As a consequence, dimeric MPO displaces DNA from the core complex, culminating in nucleosome disassembly. On the other hand, MPO monomers stably interact with the nucleosome acidic patch without making concomitant DNA contacts, explaining how monomeric MPO binds to and licences NETs to confer hypohalous acid production in the extracellular space 3 . Our data demonstrate that the binding of MPO to chromatin is governed by specific molecular interactions that transform chromatin into a non-replicative, non-encoding state that offers new biological functions in a cell-free manner. We propose that MPO is, to our knowledge, the first member of a class of proteins that convert chromatin into an immune effector.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics 1,2 . However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated by autonomous dynamics, with the flow direction (that is, neural mode) largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that this transition marks the moment of decision commitment, that is, the time when the animal makes up its mind. To test this, we developed a simplified model of the dynamics to estimate a putative neurally inferred time of commitment (nTc) for each trial. This model captures diverse single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping 3,4 . The estimated nTc values were not time locked to stimulus or response timing but instead varied broadly across trials. If nTc marks commitment, evidence before this point should affect the decision, whereas evidence afterwards should not. Behavioural analysis aligned to nTc confirmed this prediction. Our findings show that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode and suggest that nTc offers a useful neural marker for studying rapid changes in internal brain state.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients’ past and current health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course 1–3 . Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records 4,5 . However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT 6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods 7 provide insights into Delphi-2M’s predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) sustained from contact sports are the largest risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) 1–4 . Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after death and the events that trigger initial hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) deposition remain unclear 2 . Furthermore, the symptoms endorsed by young individuals are not fully explained by the extent of p-tau deposition 2 , severely hampering therapeutic interventions. Here we observed a multicellular response prior to the onset of CTE p-tau pathology that correlates with number of years of RHI exposure in young people (less than 51 years of age) with RHI exposure, the majority of whom played American football. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing of tissue from 8 control individuals, 9 RHI-exposed individuals and 11 individuals with low-stage CTE, we identify SPP1-expressing inflammatory microglia, angiogenic and inflamed endothelial cells, astrocytosis and altered synaptic gene expression in those exposed to RHI. We also observe a significant loss of cortical sulcus layer 2/3 neurons independent of p-tau pathology. Finally, we identify TGFβ1 as a potential signal that mediates microglia–endothelial cell cross talk. These results provide robust evidence that multiple years of RHI is sufficient to induce lasting cellular alterations that may underlie p-tau deposition and help explain the early pathogenesis in young former contact sport athletes. Furthermore, these data identify specific cellular responses to RHI that may direct future identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CTE.",

          "authors": "Lara Weed, Jamie M. Zeitzer",
          "abstract": "Seasonal changes in time policy, such as switching between Standard Time (SDT) and Daylight Saving Time (DST), have been adopted by many countries, including the United States. While transitioning between SDT and DST has notable acute negative population health impacts, the chronic impact of these time policies on health has not been well evaluated. To estimate the impact of permanent SDT or DST on health, we modeled the circadian impact of SDT, DST, and Biannual Shifting (BAS) across a year in the contiguous, continental United States. We find that BAS produces a greater burden on the circadian system as compared to either permanent SDT or DST. Chronotype as well as location (latitude and location within time zones) impact this burden. Analyzing these data relative to county-level health data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Places dataset), we find that, under idealized light exposure conditions and after controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, there would be a decrease in the prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.78% ( − 0.06% to − 1.49%)] and stroke [ − 0.09% ( − 0.04% to − 0.14%)] under SDT compared with the current policy. The prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.51% ( − 0.09% to − 0.93%)] and stroke [ − 0.07% ( − 0.04% to − 0.09%)] would also decrease under permanent DST, though to a lesser degree. Our data, reflecting the impact of time policy on circadian burden and subsequent health benefits, support the cessation of BAS.",

          "abstract": "Diversified economies are critical for cities to sustain their growth and development, but they are also costly because diversification often requires expanding a city’s capability base. We analyze how cities manage this trade-off by measuring the coherence of the economic activities they support, defined as the technological distance between randomly sampled productive units in a city. We use this framework to study how the US urban system developed over almost two centuries, from 1850 to today. To do so, we rely on historical census data, covering over 600M individual records to describe the economic activities of cities between 1850 and 1940, as well as 8 million patent records and detailed occupational and industrial profiles of cities for more recent decades. Despite massive shifts in the economic geography of the United States over this 170-y period, average coherence in its urban system remains unchanged. Moreover, across different time periods, datasets, and relatedness measures, coherence falls with city size at the exact same rate, pointing to constraints to diversification that are governed by a city’s size in universal ways.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms have become vital channels for businesses to reach consumers through advertising. But in the United States, the digital advertising market in which these platforms operate is dominated by a few major players, raising concerns for antitrust regulators. In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%. Shifts in demand were three times greater for larger advertisers relative to smaller ones, suggesting that Meta platforms and TikTok are closer substitutes for larger firms and that a TikTok ban would therefore impose greater challenges on smaller businesses.",

          "abstract": "Romantic (typically sexual) relationships are important to personal, physical, mental, social, and economic well-being, and to human evolution. Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy and raise important lines of enquiry in the evolutionary and social sciences.",

          "abstract": "The optimal control of finite-time processes on the microscale is of significant theoretical and practical interest, particularly for the energy-efficient operation of nanomachines. While previous studies have primarily focused on transitions between equilibrium states, many biologically and technologically relevant processes occur far from equilibrium. In such nonequilibrium settings, memory, a ubiquitous feature in realistic systems, plays an intricate role, as any driving necessarily excites internal memory modes. This motivates a deeper exploration of optimal control strategies in nonequilibrium regimes. Here, we combine experiments, theory, and computational methods to investigate the transition of a colloidal particle confined in an optical trap between two nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). We identify optimal control protocols that minimize the thermodynamic work during the finite-time transition between two NESS. We compare optimal protocols in viscous and viscoelastic fluid environments, which are common in realistic technical and biological processes and introduce memory due to a delayed response. Regardless of the presence of memory effects, optimal protocols consistently balance energy extraction with dissipation minimization. In the presence of memory, optimal control is achieved if the protocol matches the time response of the environment. These findings offer key insights for designing optimal control strategies for finite-time, nonequilibrium processes in complex environments.",

Since necroptosis leads to the release of intracellular content, the fate of RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils after necroptotic cell death has not been investigated. Here, we tracked RIPK1 and RIPK3 coassemblies and found that these fibrillar aggregates could be released into the culture medium after the membrane rupture in necroptotic cells. Interestingly, these RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils were capable of infiltrating recipient cells and acting as seeds for the nucleation and formation of the endogenous necrosome. Cryo electron microscopy structural analysis unveiled a distinctive S-shaped conformation common to RHIM fibrils of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which can facilitate the cross-seeding of RIPK3 by RIPK1 or RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils. Our findings suggest the ability of functional RIPK1/RIPK3 amyloid fibrils in intercellular spreading to induce protein conformation change in recipient cells and provide structural insights into the mechanism of RIPK1 and RIPK3 cross-templating to drive necroptosis.",

          "abstract": "To survive in highly competitive environments, bacteria use specialized secretion systems to deliver antibacterial toxins into neighboring cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. In many Gram-positive bacteria, the export of such toxins requires a membrane-bound molecular apparatus known as the type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb). Recently, it was shown that toxin recruitment to the T7SSb requires a physical interaction between a toxin and two or more so-called targeting factors, which harbor key residues required for T7SS-dependent protein export. However, in addition to these targeting factors, some toxins additionally require a protein belonging to the DUF4176 protein family. Here, by examining two toxin–DUF4176 protein pairs, we demonstrate that DUF4176 constitutes a family of toxin-specific molecular chaperones. In addition to being required for toxin stability in producing cells, we find that DUF4176 proteins facilitate toxin export by specifically interacting with a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered region found in many T7SS toxins. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine structures of several DUF4176 chaperones in their unbound state, and of a DUF4176 chaperone in complex with the binding site of its cognate toxin. These structures reveal that this binding site consists of a disordered amphipathic α-helix that requires interaction with its cognate chaperone for proper folding. Overall, we have identified a family of secretion system associated molecular chaperones found throughout T7SSb-containing Gram-positive bacteria.",

Protein-coding circular RNA (circRNA) is an emerging class of RNA cargo that offers increased stability compared to mRNA with potentially reduced immunogenicity, but delivery technologies for intracellular delivery of circRNA remain underexplored. Here, we develop an optimized lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for circRNA delivery to immune cells, observing strong and durable transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. We employ a design-of-experiments (DoE) methodology to identify key formulation parameters for enhanced circRNA delivery and, upon intramuscular administration of our optimized circRNA LNPs to mice, observe substantial accumulation within draining lymph nodes and strong dendritic cell (DC) maturation at short time points. Applying this optimized circRNA LNP platform to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate robust antibody production and enhanced immune responses in mice compared to vaccination with mRNA LNPs, including strong T h 1-biased cellular responses and a 3.8-fold increase in antigen-specific reciprocal endpoint IgG titers. These results provide insights into design criteria for circRNA LNP formulations and support the use of circRNA LNPs for vaccination against infectious diseases.",

          "abstract": "Across all domains of life, cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases have diversified to perform a range of crucial functions, such as methionine synthesis and the demethylation of various reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds. These large modular enzymes typically possess three substrate-binding domains, two binding either the methyl donor or methyl acceptor, as well as a cobalamin-binding domain. Here, by challenging the current paradigm of glycine betaine (GBT) catabolism, we have identified a unique methyltransferase in aerobic environmental bacteria that has a dual function both as a methionine synthase and a GBT methyltransferase. Using the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 as a model, we demonstrate that a core cobalamin-binding domain (MtgC) and a bidirectional methyltransferase (MtgD) are essential for both methionine synthesis and GBT demethylation. MtgC is phylogenetically distinct from the cobalamin-binding domains of either the classical methionine synthase (MetH) or the GBT methyltransferases found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Across the global ocean, mtgC expression is frequently greater than previously known GBT catabolic pathways due to its occurrence in abundant cosmopolitan marine bacteria. Thus, we uncover a unique relationship between GBT catabolism and methionine synthesis in nature and identify a major route for N-osmolyte demethylation in the global ocean.",

Functional phsABC and asrABC operons provided a growth benefit to S. Typhimurium in the cecum of Enterobacterales- free conventional mice only upon inoculation with commensal E. coli. In gnotobiotic mice engrafted with a defined community of 17 human Clostridia isolates, S. Typhimurium infection inhibited cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration in E. coli only in the presence of Desulfovibrio piger , a sulfide-producing representative of the Deltaproteobacteria. A S. Typhimurium strain deficient for hydrogen sulfide production ( phsA asrA mutant) did not inhibit cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration in E. coli , even when D. piger was present. Collectively, these data suggest that the phsABC and asrABC operons of Salmonella serovars provide a benefit during competition with closely related bacteria, such as E. coli , by inhibiting cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration of the commensal.",

          "abstract": "The use of AI, or more generally data-driven algorithms, has become ubiquitous in today’s society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a methodological framework to answer this question empirically with minimal assumptions. We measure a decision maker’s ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded and unconfounded treatment assignment, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is assumed to be randomized across cases, conditional on observed covariates, with final decisions made by humans. Under this study design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems—human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. Importantly, the AI-alone system encompasses any individualized treatment assignment, including those not used in the original study. We also show when AI recommendations should be provided to a human-decision maker, and when one should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to our own randomized controlled trial evaluating a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge’s decision to impose cash bail. Furthermore, replacing a human judge with algorithms—the risk assessment score and a large language model in particular—yields worse classification performance.",

Here, we demonstrate that posttranscriptional regulation by the RNA binding protein HuR is essential for the homeostatic self-replenishment of innate B-1a cells, the expansion of B-1 cell clones targeting self-antigens, and the production of natural autoantibodies. HuR KO B-1 cells fail to express the high levels of surface B-cell receptor (BCR), TACI, and BAFFR required for tonic signaling and cell survival. At the molecular level, HuR promotes the translation of messenger RNAs encoding the IgM heavy chain and modules, in a direct or indirect manner, the expression of TACI and BAFFR.

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies with limited therapeutic options. Among the alternative targets explored for pancreatic cancer, the glycolipid stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA4) has been extensively studied. We have previously demonstrated that the chimeric anti-SSEA4 antibody with alpha-2,6-sialylated complex type biantennary glycan (SCT) or its 3-fluorosialyl derivative (FSCT) attached to the Fc-Asn297 residue exhibited enhanced binding to the Fc-receptors FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIA which are responsible for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as vaccinal effect. Here, we found that high-SSEA4 expression correlates with increasing tumor proliferation and sensitivity to the glyco-optimized antibodies (anti-SSEA4-SCT and anti-SSEA4-FSCT) which preferentially recruit NKG2D-expressing natural killer cells and FcγRIIA-bearing macrophages with enhanced target killing activity. We also uncovered an immune evasion mechanism involving the interaction of sialoglycans on the cancer cell with Siglec-9 on NK cells or Siglec-10 on macrophages to block the antibody-mediated effector functions, and this immune checkpoint inhibition can be suppressed with the removal of sialic acid on cancer cells or blockade of Siglec recognition. In xenograft models, the glyco-optimized antibodies exhibited superior inhibition of tumor growth with high-SSEA4 expression compared to the wild-type antibody and persistent antitumor activity without additional antibody administration. These findings support anti-SSEA4 antibodies with enhanced effector functions and blockade of Siglec-mediated immune checkpoint as a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.",

At the core of the proposal is a hierarchy of layered prosodic messages that co-occur within the same intonation unit (0.5 to 2 s long). Motivated by this hierarchy, a procedure for the differential detection of three such co-occurring nonverbal messages is then described. In way of implementation, we produce a variant model of the WHISPER automatic speech recognition system that flags intonation unit boundaries, intonation unit prototypes, and emphases therein. The procedure required us to alter WHISPER’s token combinations and significantly adjust its prediction process. The variant model was tested on four datasets that contain spontaneous and read speech, and performs on a par with similar human annotation, and often better, using relatively modest training data. Several insights regarding this implementation, such as model size and encoding methods, are described as well. We believe that the proposed framework, coupled with the results of its application herein, can greatly improve the analysis of speech and language, integrating contextual information and speaker intentions into linguistic descriptions for a large array of purposes with modest means.",

          "abstract": "The Turkana Basin is a renowned paleoanthropological region in Kenya and Ethiopia and is famous for discoveries of numerous hominin fossils and their associated cultural technologies. The Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary sequences hosting these important remains are interbedded with volcanic ash (tuff) beds that provide crucial bracketing age constraints. The Nariokotome Tuff Complex, comprising the Upper, Middle, and Lower Nariokotome Tuffs, preserves deposits that cover an important time interval during the late Early Pleistocene that saw milestone events for Homo erectus and associated technological development. Unfortunately, characterization of these tuffs has been hampered by a) overlapping published eruption ages and b) indistinguishable major element compositions. In addition, fluvial reworking of feldspar-bearing pumice clasts (the target rock for age determinations) from older volcanic deposits into younger tuff layers complicates correct age assignments. Here, we use multiple tephrochronological correlation tools, including high-resolution 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and grain-specific major- and trace-element geochemistry, to establish a well-characterized geochemical and geochronological framework for the Nariokotome tuffs. Utilizing a modern-generation mass-spectrometer, we report distinct ages for the Upper Nariokotome Tuff at 1,233.1 ± 1.3 ka (± 1.9 ka, 2σ; including external uncertainties), the Middle Nariokotome Tuff at 1,263.4 ± 1.2 ka (± 1.9 ka) and the Lower Nariokotome Tuff at 1,285.8 ± 1.0 ka (± 2.1 ka). In addition, high-spatial resolution Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry trace element compositions provide distinct characterization of each tuff, aiding intrabasin correlation of these units. This combined methodology demonstrates the potential to resolve the stratigraphic complexities associated with assigning ages to key paleoanthropological sites.",

          "abstract": "Differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is driven by the activation of a set of genes controlled by serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous transcription factor with limited intrinsic transcriptional activity. Myocardin (MYOCD) is a strong transcriptional coactivator that orchestrates smooth muscle differentiation through its association with SRF. MYOCD forms nuclear condensates via its intrinsically disordered transcription activation domain (TAD), whereas SRF is diffusely distributed in the nucleus. MYOCD recruits SRF into these condensates, thereby activating the smooth muscle gene program. We engineered a “superactivator” of smooth muscle genes by replacing SRF’s weak TAD with that of MYOCD, thereby enabling SRF to form nuclear condensates and reprogram fibroblasts into SMCs. Using protein proximity labeling, quantitative proteomics and superresolution confocal microscopy, we show that condensates formed by the MYOCD TAD aggregate chromatin remodelers, RNA polymerases, and mRNA processing factors to drive smooth muscle gene expression. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms whereby nuclear condensates facilitate tissue-specific gene expression and highlight a strategy for engineering cell fate determinants by coupling condensate-forming domains to heterologous DNA-binding proteins.",

          "abstract": "Number 1A, 1948 by Jackson Pollock is a quintessential example of his action painting technique where ropes of color, drips of black, and pools of white coalesce into the layered dynamism that defines his style. While past work has identified the red and yellow pigments that form part of his core palette, the vibrant blue in the painting has remained unassigned. In this study resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to assign the blue in the painting as manganese blue. This assignment offers critical context for the conservation of his works. Importantly, assignment of this pigment enables spectroscopic investigation of the electronic structure origin of the pure hue of manganese blue and the chemical phenomena that produce its color. To probe these phenomena, resonance Raman data are coupled to magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to assign and analyze the two electronic transitions that create the blue color. This study reveals these bands are split by excited-state exchange interactions; the gap between them contains the reflected light that gives manganese blue its appearance. This sheds light on distinct advantages of molecular inorganic pigments: their ability to leverage ligand field effects in charge transfer states to create multiple intense visible absorption features and the ability to fine-tune pigment color through host lattice electrostatics.",

          "abstract": "The self-organization of cortical microtubule (MT) arrays within plant cells is an emergent phenomenon with important consequences for the synthesis of the cell wall, cell shape, and subsequently the structure of plants. Mathematical modeling and experiments have elucidated the underlying processes involved. There has been recent interest in the influence of geometric cues on array orientation, be it direct (cell shape) or indirect (tension in the membrane). However, the mechanical influence of membrane curvature on these elastic filaments has largely been ignored. A previous model was proposed to describe how the anchoring process may control the deflection of individual MTs seeking to minimize bending on a cylindrical cell. We incorporate this process into a model of interacting MTs and find the cell curvature influence to be significant: the array favors orientations parallel to the direction of elongation rather than the expected transverse direction. Even without elasticity, the geometry of large cells hinders robust MT organization. These results suggest the necessity of additional processes to overcome these factors. We propose an orientation-dependent catastrophe rate, hypothetically caused by cellulose microfibrils impeding MT polymerization. We find a combination of anchoring and impedance to be sufficient to generate transverse arrays despite the geometric influences.",

While their mechanical responses have been extensively studied, their fracture behavior remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the effect of the deformation-director coupling on LCE fracture paths is unknown, and fracture criteria for LCEs are not yet established. To address this gap, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate fracture propagation in LCEs. We stretch edge-cracked monodomain LCE samples, recording their stress-stretch responses and crack paths under varying initial directors and stretching rates. Our findings reveal that cracks can change direction during propagation, which are highly dependent on both the initial director and the stretching rate. To further understand LCE fracture behavior, we develop a rate-dependent phase-field fracture model, which is validated through experiments, and demonstrates the ability to predict complex fracture paths. Our study paves the way for designing LCEs with enhanced fracture properties, imperative for their future applications.",

Humanized mice, generated by transplanting human hematopoietic stem, progenitor cells into genetically modified mice, are invaluable to study human immune development and function in vivo. However, a major limitation of current models is suboptimal myelopoiesis, particularly lack of functional human neutrophils, hampering the modeling of human immune responses and chronic diseases. Here, we describe a humanized mouse model, named MaGIC for genes replaced, in the C57Bl/6 N strain, which improves human myelopoiesis and enables development of functional human neutrophils. In MaGIC mice, human cytokines M-CSF/CSF1(M), GM-CSF/CSF2(G) and IL-6(I) are knocked-in replacing mouse genes and murine IL2rg and Rag1 (a) are deleted. Human THPO in these mice supports human hematopoiesis. More importantly, insertion of human CD47 (C) under the control of endogenous mouse CD47 promoter enables xenotransplantation and human neutrophil development. MaGIC mice support all human neutrophil subsets found in human bone marrow and blood, a major improvement. This is achieved by creating a niche postirradiation for human granulocyte–macrophage progenitors via reduced murine CD47 and physiological levels of human CD47. These mice also have mature human monocytes, tissue macrophages, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells, enabled by humanized M-CSF and GM-CSF. Human neutrophils in MaGIC mice are fully functional in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammation. MaGIC mice address critical gaps in current models and enable incisive translational research on human neutrophils, advancing studies in infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.",

Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF , a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron . Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains.

Recent computational advances, maturity of models, availability of data, and interdisciplinary expertise make model coupling an increasingly feasible, effective, and useful tool for climate policy analysis. We examine the unique contributions of each modeling approach, highlight synergies from uniting their strengths, and discuss alternatives to and conditions for coupling. In addressing methodological challenges, we present examples of effective coupling of IAM–ABM–CGE, emphasizing the importance of maintaining model integrity while enhancing policy relevance.

          "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays provide a powerful method to generate large-scale datasets essential for advancing AI-driven predictions in biology. The tripartite β-lactamase assay (TPBLA), in which a protein of interest is inserted between two domains of β-lactamase, has previously been reported as capable of detecting and quantitating the aggregation of proteins and biologics in the oxidizing periplasm of Escherichia coli and used as a platform for identifying small molecule inhibitors of aggregation. Here, we repurpose the TPBLA into a high-throughput DMS platform. We validate this format using a single-site saturation library of the intrinsically disordered peptide Aβ 42 , linked to Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating strong agreement between observed variant fitness scores and variant behavior using our previously reported low-throughput TPBLA. The results of DMS revealed variant fitness scores that correlate with known amyloid-promoting regions. An in silico approach using FoldX-derived per-residue thermodynamic stability confirmed that the TPBLA reports on amyloid fibril stability. In vitro experiments support this finding, showing a strong correlation between variant fitness scores and the critical concentration of amyloid formation. Machine learning using the DMS dataset identified β‐sheet propensity and polarity as primary drivers of variant fitness scores. The derived model is also able to predict thermodynamically stabilizing regions in other amyloid systems, underscoring its generalizability. Collectively, our results demonstrate the TPBLA as a versatile platform for generating robust datasets to advance predictive modeling and to inform the design of aggregation‐resistant proteins.",

When mutated, the P2X2R exacerbates age- and noise-related hearing loss, but selective modulators of the receptor are lacking, and the molecular basis of activation and desensitization remains poorly understood. Here, we determine high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of the full-length wild-type human P2X2R in an apo closed state and two distinct ATP-bound desensitized states. In the apo closed state structure, we observe features unique to the P2X2R and locate disease mutations within or near the transmembrane domain. In addition, our ATP-bound structures show how free anionic ATP forms subtype-specific interactions with the orthosteric binding site. We identify and characterize two different ATP-bound desensitized state structures, one similar to published models for other P2XR subtypes, and a second alternate conformation not previously observed. A loop adjacent to the orthosteric binding site between these two ATP-bound desensitized state structures undergoes significant conformational changes. These movements are supported by multireplicate, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulation studies and suggest a path by which ATP could enter or leave the orthosteric pocket. Together, our results provide structural insights into the P2X2R, facilitating structure-based drug development for this therapeutically important target.",

High-dimensional immunostaining of murine mammary tumor progression revealed that MTMs were localized in the peritumoral stroma and associated with eosinophils, which were previously shown to facilitate antitumor T cell responses. The depletion of MTMs accelerated tumorigenesis in both spontaneous and orthotopically transplanted mammary tumor models. Upon induction of a productive antitumor response via the depletion of regulatory T cells, MTMs assumed an alternatively activated state and expressed eotaxins, thereby attracting eosinophils to peritumoral regions. MTMs expressed the receptor for the alarmin IL-33, which induced both MTM activation and eosinophil recruitment. These results suggest that MTMs can sense IL-33 and recruit eosinophils to facilitate antitumor immunity, a mechanism that may operate during tumor progression and be further enhanced during productive antitumor responses.",

The balance and regulation of 26S and 30S proteasomes are not yet known. Here, we show that among the proteasome base assembly chaperones, only S5b/PSMD5 determines the levels of proteasome holoenzymes, especially the 30S proteasome, in mammals. In a variety of cell lines and mouse tissues, we found that apart from its role in yeast 19S proteasome assembly, loss of S5b/PSMD5 increased assembly toward the 26S and 30S proteasomes. During the process, we identified proteasome complexes that may represent alternative assembly intermediates, including the 19S base complex and 20S complexes harboring 19S subunits, eventually leading to a shift in the overall steady-state level of the 26S and 30S proteasomes. Intriguingly, the addition of the S5b/PSMD5 protein in vitro and its increase in cells efficiently disassembled the 30S proteasome into the 20S and 19S complexes. Increase in the 26S and 30S proteasomes over the 20S proteasome enhances the degradation of the aggregation-prone proteins and ubiquitinated proteins in cells and ameliorates cognitive impairment through the reduction of tau pathology in PS19 mice. These results suggest that 26S and 30S proteasomes are manipulated by S5b/PSMD5 and are beneficial for mitigating proteinopathy in mammals.",

Using two-dimensional numerical models of mantle convection with sharp and broad mineral phase transitions for pyrolite, we show that both scales of upwellings can be generated in a stagnant lid planet with an interior temperature 250 to 400 K warmer than Earth’s. The smaller plumes originate from a ~600 km deep internal layer that exists as a consequence of the different sequence of mineral phase transitions that occur in warmer mantles less processed and differentiated by partial melting and volcanism.

          "abstract": "Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First, we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced λ -jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the λ -jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become “soft” under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked “kineo-elastic” term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree–Fock calculations.",

Notably, mutations that alter BRAF function are prominent drivers of human cancer and certain RASopathy disorders, making BRAF an important target for therapeutic intervention. Despite extensive research, several aspects of BRAF regulation remain unclear. In this study, we developed an in vitro BRAF activation assay using purified autoinhibited BRAF:14-3-3 2 :MEK complexes. Our results show that fully processed, active-state KRAS alone can promote dimer-dependent BRAF activation. Moreover, we found that phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposomes synergized with KRAS to promote BRAF activation, achieving activity levels comparable to those observed with BRAF proteins that constitutively dimerize. In contrast, the SMP phosphatase complex had only a minimal effect on BRAF catalytic activity in this system but mediated the dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory pS365 14-3-3 binding site in a manner that was accelerated by the presence of KRAS alone or KRAS and 30% PS liposomes. Finally, we show that inhibitors blocking the BRAF RBD:KRAS interaction were able to suppress the in vitro activation of BRAF, underscoring the critical role of RAS binding in initiating the disassembly of the BRAF autoinhibited state. Thus, this assay provides valuable insights into the steps required for BRAF activation and can serve as an effective screening tool for identifying compounds that may inhibit this process and have therapeutic potential.",

          "abstract": "The noncoding small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associate with a large set of proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). While the function of snRNAs is well characterized, the regulation of their transcription remains poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that SUMO conjugation regulates snRNA3′ end processing. To further study the connection between SUMOylation and snRNA biogenesis, we generated a CRISPR/dCas9 tool comprising a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the catalytic domain of the SUMO protease SENP1 (dCas9-SENP1). Here, we show that snRNA transcription decreases when dCas9-SENP1 is delivered to their promoter-proximal sequence elements (PSE), indicating that SUMO conjugation to proteins associated with snRNA promoters is necessary for proper transcriptional activity. Focusing on SNAPC1, a subunit of the snRNA-specific transcription complex SNAPc, we identified lysine residues 245 and 333 as SUMO acceptor sites and generated a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of this protein (SNAPC1 2KR). To explore the relevance of SNAPC1 SUMOylation on snRNA transcription, we generated a cell line carrying an inducible degron system for depletion of the endogenous SNAPC1 protein. This system led us to demonstrate that SNAPC1 2KR is unable to sustain basal levels of snRNA transcription. By tagging endogenous SNAPC3 and SNAPC4, two other subunits of SNAPc, we show that while SNAPC1 SUMOylation-deficient mutant is able to interact with SNAPC3, its interaction with SNAPC4 is affected, despite the fact it is still recruited to the PSE. Altogether, these results indicate that SNAPC1 SUMOylation is required for proper snRNA transcription and SNAPc complex assembly.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases present one of the most significant global health challenges. These disorders are defined by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates that impair synaptic function and cause progressive neuronal degeneration. Therefore, stimulating protein clearance mechanisms may be neuro-protective. Variants in FBXO7/PARK15 cause Parkinsonian Pyramidal Syndrome, an early-onset parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorder in humans, and inactivation of this gene in mice recapitulates many phenotypes seen in patients. The proteasome regulator PI31 is a direct binding partner of Fbxo7 and promotes local protein degradation at synapses by mediating fast proteasome transport in neurites. PI31 protein levels are reduced when the function of Fbxo7 is impaired. Here we show that restoring PI31 levels in Fbxo7 mutant fly and mouse strains prevents neuronal degeneration and significantly improves neuronal function, health, and lifespan. Notably, Fbxo7 inactivation in mouse neurons causes hyperphosphorylation of tau, and this was suppressed by transgenic expression of PI31. Our results demonstrate that PI31 is a crucial biological target through which Fbxo7 deficiency drives pathology. Therefore, targeting the PI31-pathway may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

          "authors": "Ryuta Kanai, Naoki Tsunekawa, Flemming Cornelius, Bente Vilsen, Chikashi Toyoshima",
          "abstract": "Palytoxin (PTX), a potent marine toxin, has long been known to transform Na + ,K + -ATPase (NKA), an indispensable ion pump, into a nonselective cation channel. It has been postulated that PTX takes control of the two gates on either side of a channel-like pore. These gates normally open and close alternately, synchronized with chemical events, never opening simultaneously. A critical question is whether palytoxin takes over the control of the two gates or creates a new pathway. Here, we present structures of NKA with bound palytoxin in three different states. PTX binds to NKA in E2P, occupying the physiological Na + exit pathway, similar to istaroxime, a new-generation cardiotonic steroid. Adding Na + and ATP/ADP to the NKA·PTX complex induces an open channel traversing the entire membrane alongside the physiological ion pathway. As AlF x , a stable transition state analog of phosphate replaces phosphate in the NKA·PTX complex preformed in E2P, the complex appears to undergo the normal reaction cycle from E2P to E1· n Na + . PTX occupies the space between the transmembrane helices M4 and M6, thereby preventing the closure of the extracellular half of the ion pathway. These structures demonstrate that the architecture of NKA is fundamentally different from “a pore with two gates.” Each half of the ion pathway comprises three segments, including a movable component that plays a pivotal role in translocating the bound cations by connecting the constant part to an appropriate inlet. The ion pathway of NKA transforms dynamically, ensuring that the two halves never exist simultaneously.",

          "abstract": "Insulin potently decreases blood glucose; thus, tight control is required to prevent excessive insulin release and hypoglycemia. Central to this inhibition is somatostatin released from delta cells that are clustered with beta cells in pancreatic islets. This communication is of interest because the loss of functional beta cells in diabetes leads to uncontrolled delta cell activity that disrupts islet paracrine crosstalk. While it is established that insulin and somatostatin secretion are coordinated, the specific mechanism is unsettled. We have previously demonstrated that beta cells release the hormone Urocortin 3 to stimulate delta cells at high glucose, demonstrating a paracrine negative feedback loop. Others have proposed direct coordination via gap junctions. To resolve this conundrum, we used the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6s to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of beta and delta cells in low (2.8 mM) (LG) and high (16.8 mM) glucose (HG). Surprisingly, while many delta cells exhibit Ca 2+ oscillations in HG that are coordinated with beta cells, the activation of these delta cells precedes beta cells and is more variable than beta cell responses. The selective delta cell knockout of connexin 36 confirmed the involvement of gap junctions. However, blockade of vesicle release with the Rho-GTPase inhibitor ML-141 completely removed coupling between beta and most delta cells in HG. Our data reveal considerable functional heterogeneity among delta cells, where most delta cells are entrained by oscillatory Ca 2+ behaviors of beta cells that are mediated by a combination of paracrine signaling and low-density gap junction coupling.",

Combining these methods with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can extend their reach. However, the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the choice of the active space complicates the consistent evaluation of energies and gradients across structurally diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the weighted active space protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrated the approach on the TiC + -catalyzed C–H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn–Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.",

We now report cryoelectron microscopy structures of TAP in complex with the remaining four: BNLF2a (Epstein–Barr virus), hUS6 (human cytomegalovirus), bUL49.5 (bovine herpesvirus 1), and CPXV012 (cowpox virus), assembling a structural atlas of viral TAP evasion. Despite employing divergent sequences, folds, and conformational targets, these viral inhibitors converge on a common strategy: they stall TAP from the alternating access cycle, precluding peptide entry into the ER and shielding infected cells from cytotoxic T cell surveillance.

TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins—many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the “AtTIRome”) to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRome’s cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure–function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the “BB-loop”, a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins. We further demonstrate that artificial TIRs are functional on an NLR chassis and that BB-loop variation can tune the activity of a natural TIR-NLR protein. These findings shed light on the diversity of TIR outputs and reveal methods to design and engineer TIR-based immune receptors.",

          "abstract": "Tropical cyclones are expected to intensify more rapidly with warming, but relatively little work has examined whether they could expand more rapidly with warming, too. Recent theory predicts that peak expansion rate should increase with sea surface temperature (SST), and physical arguments suggest this dependence should be specifically on the relative SST, i.e. the SST difference from the tropical mean. We test this hypothesis with historical observational data, in which SST variations are primarily variations in relative SST. Both average and peak expansion rates are found to systematically increase with relative SST globally across the Northern Hemisphere (27.2 and 37.5 km/d/K) and within each individual basin. Results are robust across both reanalysis and Best Track observational datasets. Uniform-SST aquaplanet simulations show a much weaker dependence of maximum expansion rate on absolute SST, suggesting that the dominant dependence is on relative SST. Hence, mean global warming is not expected to strongly change storm size dynamics, but patterns of sea surface warming may play an important role in determining how storm size, and hence coastal risk, may change in the future. This work can also help improve forecasting of the wind field and its hazards and impacts at landfall.",

          "abstract": "γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in inhibition in the adult brain. Structural and electrophysiological studies have provided numerous insights into the receptor’s functioning but the complete molecular mechanism of GABA A R action remains elusive. Herein, we used high-resolution single-channel recording to analyze point-mutated α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptors and applied so called Φ value (REFER, rate-equilibrium free energy relationship) analysis which allows to infer the order of domains engagement during activation, offering a complementary “dynamic” insight into the receptor’s function. As anticipated, point mutations at the orthosteric binding sites reduced GABA binding affinity, with the magnitude of this effect diminishing progressively with increasing distance from the binding site. On the contrary, mutations located all over the macromolecule’s structure, e.g., in “peripheral top position,” extracellular/transmembrane interface, and channel pore, affected the receptor with a clear tendency to influence entire gating including opening/closing, preactivation, and desensitization with no clear correlation with the distance to the channel gate. Interestingly, the calculated Φ values for the GABA A R showed a relatively narrow range (0.42 to 0.81), suggesting that the conformational transitions are highly synchronized and coordinated by a global network of interactions. This prediction is also in agreement with observation that, typically, single GABA A R residue mutation alters the kinetics of not just one but many (often all) conformational transitions. We thus propose a dictum reflecting modus operandi of the GABA A R: Binding is local and gating is global. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that GABA A R shows particularly strong functional compactness manifested as global gating mechanisms and high allostery.",

          "abstract": "Bubble-mediated gas exchange associated with wave breaking is a critical pathway for ocean–atmosphere exchange of low solubility gases such as oxygen. Yet, ocean and climate models, as well as observation-based products, usually rely on wind-only air–sea flux formulations derived from carbon constraints that ignore the asymmetric nature of the bubble flux, contributing to discrepancies between estimates of oxygen inventories and their response to climate change. Without bubbles, gas exchange is controlled by a symmetric wind-driven exchange, with the ocean–atmosphere gas partial pressure difference controlling whether outgassing or uptake occurs. Bubbles entrained by wave breaking can enhance this symmetric turbulent exchange, and contribute an additional asymmetric flux, always leading to an uptake, as they get squeezed by hydrostatic pressure (large bubbles) or collapse and fully dissolve (small bubbles). We present an observation-constrained theoretical framework of the air–sea flux accounting for air entrainment due to wave breaking and symmetric and asymmetric bubble exchange. The combined evidence from theory, laboratory, and field measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes, oxygen concentration, and noble gas supersaturation yields a universal formulation of gas exchange which we implement into a global ocean biogeochemical model. We discuss the resulting oxygen fluxes and demonstrate that our wind–wave–bubble formulation better reproduces observed in situ oxygen concentrations in water mass formation regions, where air–sea exchange is high, than a commonly used wind-only formulation. We show that the asymmetric bubble flux is essential for evaluating air–sea oxygen fluxes and estimating the magnitude of the ocean oxygen loss associated with global warming.",

Unfolding results in a dynamic, frayed helix that weakens the association with its partnering β2 subunit to lower the activation threshold of integrin αXβ2-mediated cell adhesion. The extent of unfolding depends on membrane geometry, thereby establishing a mechanism for sensing membrane properties. The combination of adhesive control with sensory capacity in integrin αXβ2 and αMβ2 may achieve membrane localization-dependent receptor activation in leukocyte phagocytosis. The unfolding of the αX TM helix arises from a high number of α-helix-destabilizing residues that TM helices in general approach but do not exceed. Accordingly, backbone dynamics of TM helices may disrupt hydrogen bonds, modulate protein function, and optimize TM helix rigidity.",

However, design guided by similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has been less successful, likely due to the deviations from ideal barrel geometry required to maintain interstrand hydrogen bonding without introducing backbone strain. Instead, beta barrels have been designed using two-dimensional structural blueprints; while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it requires expert knowledge and provides only indirect control over the global shape. Here, we show that the simplicity and control over shape and structure provided by parametric representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by taking advantage of the rich sequence–structure relationships implicit in RoseTTAFold-based design methods. Starting from parametrically generated barrel backbones, both RFjoint inpainting and RFdiffusion readily incorporate backbone irregularities necessary for proper folding with minimal deviation from the idealized barrel geometries. We show that for beta barrels across a broad range of beta sheet parameterizations, these methods achieve high in silico and experimental success rates, with atomic accuracy confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of a rare barrel topology, and de novo designed transmembrane nanopores with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high success rates of deep learning–based protein design methods, our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more precisely specifiable and accessible.",

          "abstract": "The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is critical for maintaining cerebral homeostasis, and its deterioration with age is an important pathogenic factor in the etiology of vascular dementia. Extracellular matrix–integrin interactions play a central role in regulating vascular stability. The αvβ3 integrin is not expressed by brain endothelial cells under stable conditions but is strongly induced by hypoxia. However, it is currently unclear whether αvβ3 integrin exerts a destructive or protective influence on BBB integrity. In young (8 to 10 wk) and aged (20 mo) mice, we examined the impact of a function-blocking β3 integrin antibody as well as the inhibitory peptide cilengitide on BBB disruption during exposure to CMH (8% O 2 ). Hypoxic induction of brain endothelial β3 integrin was much stronger in aged mice. In both young and aged mice, β3 integrin inhibition greatly amplified hypoxia-induced BBB disruption, correlating with loss of tight junction proteins and induction of the leaky BBB marker mouse endothelial cell antigen (MECA)-32. Consistent with this, β3 integrin null mice showed increased levels of hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and MECA-32 expression. Cilengitide also reduced the integrity of a brain endothelial monolayer in vitro, prevented β3 integrin localization to focal adhesions, and reduced expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and tight junction proteins. These observations suggest that hypoxic induction of endothelial αvβ3 integrin enhances BBB integrity by stabilizing endothelial adhesion. This raises the interesting possibility that pharmacological upregulation of endothelial αvβ3 integrin in the aged brain might hold therapeutic promise for vascular dementia.",

We show that the pseudouridine synthases (PUS), PUS1, and PUS7 are essential for efficient KSHV lytic replication, supported by their redistribution to viral replication and transcription complexes. We present a comprehensive analysis of KSHV RNA pseudouridylation, revealing hundreds of modified RNAs at single-nucleotide resolution. Notably, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation of the KSHV-encoded polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN) plays a significant role in the expression of PAN RNA. These findings reveal an essential role of pseudouridine modification in the KSHV replication cycle.",

In order to explain these dynamics, past researchers have suggested that the primary catalyst for the flourishing Casas Grandes population in the thirteenth century A.D. was caused by migrants from Mesoamerica or from larger populations to the north. We analyzed mitochondrial genetic data from individuals interred at sites that date to earlier (A.D. 700–1200) and later (A.D. 1200–1450) time periods, which allowed us to examine changes in gene pools over time and to test these migration hypotheses. Comparing the full mitogenomes from 114 individuals, we show that low levels of migration occurred diachronically, although they still may have contributed to hybridized cultural practices. These data counter the long-standing assumption that widescale population replacement was the cause for the rise of Paquimé, the center of the Casas Grandes world in the thirteenth-century A.D.",

These proposals were based on studies of the principal σ factor of Escherichia coli , σ 70 , which generally, albeit not obligatorily, is released from RNAP upon the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Here, we show that, in contrast to E. coli σ 70 , the Bacillus subtilis principal σ factor, σ A , is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We further show that a mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ region 1.1 (σ R1.1) is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We also observe that B. subtilis σ A and the mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ R1.1 interact much more stably with RNAP than full-length E. coli σ 70 .

However, their distinction remains unclear. Our study addresses this issue by focusing on their timescales at both the behavioral level (using fast and slow finger tapping) and the neural level (using EEG) using two independent datasets (N = 84 and 35). Behavioral results revealed a double dissociation: Task-relatedness was linked to fast tapping only, whereas thought orientation was associated with slow tapping only. At the neural level, we assessed topographic similarity in EEG to quantify the temporal influence of past neural activity on current ones. Task-relatedness modulated topographic similarity only during fast tapping, while thought orientation did so only during slow tapping. Critically, topographic similarity was phase-based, as shown by its correlation with phase-locking value and the loss of associations with thought after phase-shuffling. This indicates that the neural signatures of both thought dimensions are strongly phase-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that nonlinearity plays a distinct role mediating the impact of different timescales (slow and fast finger tapping) on spontaneous thoughts at both behavioral (precision error) and neural levels (topographic similarity). Overall, these results demonstrate that task-relatedness is associated with short timescales, whereas thought orientation is associated with long timescales. This highlights how distinct temporal dynamics shape different spontaneous thought dimensions on both their behavioral and neural features.",

Acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3), a key enzyme of medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) metabolism, has been implicated in metabolic syndrome, but its function in fibrotic kidney remains unexplored. Here, we found that tubular epithelial ACSM3 expression was downregulated in kidney fibrotic mice and patients and inversely correlated with disease severity. Systemic and tubular-specific knockout of ACSM3 both exacerbated renal fibrosis, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated ACSM3 overexpression alleviated fibrotic kidneys in mice. Mechanistically, ACSM3 deficiency disrupted MCFA metabolism and resulted in abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis. Notably, we identified that dodecanoic acid (C12:0) could improve kidney fibrosis, which was primarily utilized via ACSM3 in kidneys. Furthermore, C12:0 oxidation impairment caused by tubular ACSM3 deficiency aggravated fibrotic kidney. Together, ACSM3-regulated MCFA metabolism played a pivotal role in kidney fibrosis, highlighting a potent drug target of ACSM3 and a potential supplementary therapy of MCFA against chronic kidney disease.",

          "abstract": "Inferring accurate and precise material models necessary for high-fidelity predictions has been a central challenge in constitutive modeling. Both traditional regression methods and modern machine-learning approaches require specialized data labels, which often cannot be sufficiently obtained from experiments. This data demand makes many sophisticated models impractical for real-world problems. Improvements in digital image correlation techniques have enabled accurate measurements of displacement data, providing an alternative kinematics-based approach for model identification. However, for materials undergoing plastic deformation, fracture, and damage, the corresponding inverse problem could be inherently challenging due to the dependence on loading history. We overcome this by formulating an inverse problem to discover interpretable plasticity models parameterized by neural networks (NN) from kinematic observations, leveraging a differentiable simulator with a smooth constitutive update that enables backpropagation for the NN training. The ability to use kinematic observations to infer complex material models may pave the way for a massive generation of material models that can be game-changing for emerging applications such as the design of metamaterials, response surface analyses, and the design of experiments.",

This study uses multiple techniques, including X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate 54 pre-Neolithic burials from 11 archaeological sites located across Southeastern Asia. The findings confirm that many of these pre-Neolithic flexed and squatting burials were treated by an extended period of smoke-drying over fire, a process of mummification similar to that recorded ethnographically in some Australian and Highland New Guinea societies.

Functional characterization using Slc39a8 A391T knock-in mice and kidney-specific Slc39a8 knockout mice reveals that loss of SLC39A8 function reduces renal zinc accumulation, thereby mitigating susceptibility to kidney injury and disease progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that perturbed zinc homeostasis drives renal damage, and limiting zinc levels—whether via impaired SLC39A8 activity or direct chelation—activates the zinc–AKT–FOXO1–G6PC axis to confer protection. Critically, zinc chelation with EDTA recapitulates this benefit, significantly preventing and ameliorating experimental acute and chronic kidney disease. These findings establish renal zinc homeostasis as a key therapeutic node, with SLC39A8 and zinc-modulating strategies representing promising avenues for treating a broad range of kidney diseases.",

Structural and functional analyses, including X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis, revealed key residues in UGT76G4 that dictate its regioselectivity, with residue 200 playing a pivotal role.

Here, we identified Wnt7b, which is markedly upregulated in GBM patients, as a determinant of resistance to immune checkpoint blockers (αPD1; anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) in a clinically relevant, αPD1-resistant GBM murine model with abundant stem cells. We observed that increased levels of Wnt7b and β-catenin correlated with the resistance to αPD1. Treatment combining a porcupine inhibitor WNT974 with αPD1 reprogrammed the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to bolster antitumor immune responses and extended the survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM, with 25% long-term survivors. Our causal studies revealed that WNT974 potentiated αPD1 therapy by the expansion of antigen presenting DC3-like dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, WNT974 combination with αPD1 was associated with a reduction in immune suppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), an increase in the Ki67+CD8/Ki67+regulatory T cells (Treg) ratio, tilting the CD8:Treg balance in the TME toward antitumor immune response, and more pronounced GrzB+CD8+ effector T cells. Conversely, an increase in monocytic MDSCs and phosphorylation of pro-oncogenic proteins was associated with resistance to the combination therapy. Collectively, our preclinical findings provide a strong rationale to test Wnt7b/β-catenin inhibition with αPD1 therapy in GBM patients with elevated Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling.",

Whether these two states are connected or entirely decoupled remains controversial. We here resolve this controversy by providing experimental evidence of a continuous transition between ET and EIT in Taylor-Couette flow. Through experimentally quantifying the roles of elasticity and inertia in flow stability, we find that elasticity is the primary driving mechanism for both elastic and elastoinertial instabilities, and inertia plays a secondary role in the latter. Remarkably, the critical condition for these instabilities can be described by a unified function derived from stability analysis, revealing that the transition between elastic instability to elastoinertial instability is continuous. Moreover, we show that the flow structures and the energy spectrum evolve seamlessly from ET to elasticity-dominated EIT, transitional EIT, and inertia-modulated EIT, with inertia playing an increasingly important role in the last three regimes. Our results offer insights into the fundamental nature of turbulence in viscoelastic flows and would have implications for applications involving drag reduction and polymer processing.",

Herein, we establish a multimodal coherent X-ray diffraction imaging framework for spatiotemporal mapping of mesoscale structural dynamics in precipitation-strengthened alloys. As a demonstrative application, we visualized the structural evolution in Mg 97 Zn 1 Gd 2 during isothermal annealing at 700 K, revealing real-time dynamics of nucleation, growth, and coarsening. Ptychographic reconstruction enabled imaging of microstructural transformations across a wide field of view (~100 μm 2 ) with temporal resolution spanning several hours. We observed decomposition of (Mg, Zn) 3 Gd and concurrent precipitation and coarsening of long-period stacking ordered phases. To resolve local dynamics at finer spatiotemporal scales, we combined dynamic coherent diffraction imaging with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, targeting selected regions (~10 μm 2 ) with time resolution down to tens of seconds. This approach revealed the rapid formation of nanoscale precipitates within 10 s after heating, followed by coarsening over several hundred seconds. Additionally, we applied optical flow analysis—a computational method to track motion patterns—to visualize and quantify the nucleation, growth, and coarsening kinetics. The abovementioned findings demonstrate the capability of in situ coherent X-ray techniques to acquire the real-time evolutions of mesoscale structures in complex materials.

Our earlier report demonstrated that platelet GPIbα is required for hepatocellular TPO generation, which is the major resource of TPO in the blood circulation. However, how hepatocytes physically contact circulating sinusoidal platelets across the liver endothelium for this process is unknown. Kupffer cells reside in contact with both sinusoidal blood and underlying hepatocytes, and mediate senescent platelet clearance, but their role in TPO regulation has never been explored. Here, we found Kupffer cell depletion via either clodronate liposomes or specific transgenic models abrogated circulating TPO. Kupffer cell depletion also prevented TPO level increase in GPIbα-deficient mice following wild-type (GPIbα + ) platelet transfusion, signifying an interdependent mechanism for TPO regulation. Mice treated with arsenite had significantly decreased liver endothelial fenestrations and hepatocyte sinusoidal protrusions as well as TPO levels. This effect was exacerbated by Kupffer cell depletion, and Kupffer cells were identified to enhance liver endothelial fenestrations. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis of the liver revealed platelets arrested on Kupffer cell surface were in contact with hepatocyte protrusions. Thus, we elucidated that Kupffer cells promote endothelial fenestrae and hepatocyte protrusions, accumulate circulating platelets, and facilitate cellular interactions between hepatocytes and platelets, which drive TPO generation. This connection between platelet clearance and thrombopoiesis should have broad implications for hematology and pathologies such as Bernard–Soulier syndrome, thrombocytopenias, as well as liver diseases.",

These proteins often need to bind to a substrate, such as the cell membrane, onto which they interact and form two-dimensional (2D) patterns. It is unclear how the membrane’s continuity and dimensionality impact pattern formation. Here, we address this gap using the MinDE system, a prototypical example of pattern-forming membrane proteins. We show that when the lipid substrate is fragmented into submicrometer-sized diffusive liposomes, adenosine triphosphate-driven protein–protein interactions generate three-dimensional (3D) spatially extended patterns, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. Remarkably, these 3D patterns emerge at scales four orders of magnitude larger than the individual liposomes. By systematically varying protein concentration, liposome size, and density, we observed and characterized a variety of 3D dynamical patterns not seen on continuous 2D membranes, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals, and a coexistence phase. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model revealed that the physical properties of the dispersed membrane effectively rescale both the protein–membrane binding rates and diffusion, two key parameters governing pattern formation and wavelength selection. These findings highlight the robustness of Min’s pattern-forming ability, suggesting that protein–membrane suspensions could serve as an adaptable template for studying out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo contexts.",

Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments, the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed to help scientists customize and scale the device according to their research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.",

          "authors": "Danielle R. Johnson, Adam Bocanski, Emily M. Diorio, James Chen, Hui Meng",
          "abstract": "Recent discovery of “extreme clustering” of inertial particles in isotropic turbulent flow suggests a hidden mechanism of particle–particle interaction at sub-Kolmogorov separations unexplained by hydrodynamic interaction. The near-contact radial distribution function (RDF) reaches O ( 10 4 ) , resulting in a collision kernel four orders larger than direct numerical simulation predictions. Statistical stationarity is lost in the particle-laden turbulence, suggesting the particles experience a nonequilibrium process. We hypothesize dielectric particles in isotropic turbulence experience contact electrification through interparticle collisions, creating inhomogeneous mosaic surface charge. These mosaic charges lead to attractive forces and thereby extreme clustering and collision amplification, forming a positive feedback loop. To explore this potential mechanism, we investigated hollow glass spheres dispersed in a high-Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic air turbulence chamber using high-resolution 3D particle tracking velocimetry and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). We measured RDF, particle-pair mean-inward radial relative velocity, and mean radial relative acceleration (RA) with time up to 10 min. We sampled particles from the flow chamber through time and evaluated their nanoscopic charge distribution using KPFM. We found that both RDF and mosaic surface charge increase with time; RA at close separations is attractive, intensifies as particles approach, and grows in time; and the turbulence-exposed RA curves collapse when nondimensionalized by the dipole–dipole acceleration calculated from mosaic charge distributions. These results support the proposed mechanism—Inhomogeneous Mosaic Potential Amplified Collisions in Turbulence (IMPACT). Better understanding and modeling of these effects could improve predictions for air pollution, weather patterns, and drug manufacturing—where particle interactions have big impacts.",

          "abstract": "Winds generate waves over the oceans with a wide range of properties. The largest wave heights and periods are important parameters in the design of marine structures. Extreme waves also play an outsize role in air–sea fluxes and coastal dynamics, and leave imprints on seismic and sediment records. Rare events have so far escaped measurements, with few wave heights from satellite altimeters exceeding 16 m, and no associated measurement of wave periods. Here, we use swells radiated from storms to reveal long wave periods within the storms, and their generation mechanism. Swells are resolved in the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite sea level measurements. Patterns of increasing swell wavelength and decreasing swell height away from storms are consistent with a nonlinear transfer of energy from short to long period waves. We propose an updated parametric shape for wave spectra in storms that aligns with SWOT swell measurements. It reduces energy levels by a factor of 20 at 1.2 to 1.4 times the peak period compared to commonly used spectral shapes and allows estimation of storm wave periods from swell heights. Consistent with less extreme conditions, the peak period generally increases with wave height. This was particularly verified for the largest storm peak period of 20.2 ± 0.6 s, obtained for the event with the largest significant wave height 19.7 ± 0.3 m measured by altimeters. These observations of long period swells should have a wide range of applications from coastal dynamics to seismology.",

The blowout persisted for 112 days, releasing ~109,000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. Elevated air toxics and fine particle pollutant levels were also measured in nearby communities. We used California’s birth records and a quasiexperimental design to assess whether pregnant women living in affected communities during the disaster experienced more adverse birth outcomes than expected. Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility. Furthermore, we observed a dose-response effect, where the odds of low birthweight were highest among women living closest to the well and attenuated out.",

Unlike other oxidases, alcohol oxidase exclusively uses O 2 as an electron acceptor, preventing interference with the electron transfer chain involving the sensing oxidase. We demonstrated the compatibility of this O 2 scavenger for calibration-free sensing of glucose, lactate, and creatinine in the concentration range relevant to human health. Without the O 2 scavenger, sensor readings were less than 50% of those under inert gas conditions. With the O 2 scavenger, the accuracy improved to 99%, even at low substrate concentrations.

The encapsulated superoxide dismutase–catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization.

Integrated analyses across species identified diverse subtypes of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are highly conserved across primates. Compositional analyses revealed that subdivisions of the primate basolateral complex contain distinct classes of glutamatergic neurons and divergent gene expression profiles for parvalbumin and somatostatin GABAergic neurons. Referencing primate neuron types to transcriptomic atlases of the murine amygdala highlighted primate-specific specializations for glutamatergic neurons and identified which neuron types are conserved across mammals and amygdalar subdivisions.

          "abstract": "Current treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) fall short of meeting clinical needs, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of PDAC progression, which involves not only biochemical signals but also essential biomechanical cues. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression. This research reveals a promising approach for treating PDAC by focusing on biomechanical cues.",

          "abstract": "Endosomes and lysosomes (collectively termed “endolysosomes”) traverse the cytoplasm in a stop-and-go manner, but the mechanisms underlying this motion remain poorly understood. Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm.",

Further accretion proceeds through the inner structures, including a Keplerian disk and an inner disk (~100 au), which are thought to be driving a collimated bipolar outflow.

We establish PADI4 as a negative regulator of proliferation, acting on LEF1-positive hair shaft committed progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PADI4 citrullinates proteins associated with mRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis, and lack of PADI4 promotes protein synthesis and ribosomal RNA transcription in vivo. Characterizing key translational effectors, we demonstrate that PADI4 citrullinates the translational repressor 4E-BP1 and reveal a cross-talk between PADI4 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.

          "abstract": "A critical yet challenging step in protein complex assembly is the formation of a dimeric intermediate that serves as a seed for incorporating additional subunits. We hypothesized that this step could be facilitated by “bi-handed” chaperones that recognize two different subunits through distinct domains (hands). However, whether such chaperones exist remained unknown. Here, we identify AAGAB as a bona fide bi-handed chaperone. AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD. This hemicomplex is subsequently transferred to the GD via a GD:σ2 binding interface, accompanied by conformational maturation. These findings establish AAGAB as the founding member of a bi-handed chaperone family and reveal an intramolecular handover mechanism that underlies their mode of action.",

The rational design of enzyme-metal hybrid catalysts (EMHCs) is an attractive strategy for operating chemoenzymatic cascade reactions efficiently under mild conditions. In this study, we develop a method for the instantaneous and continuous synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets. Compared to traditional wet impregnation methods, the reaction time of the microdroplet-assisted method is shortened from days to seconds, achieving a space-time yield increase by two to five orders of magnitude. The as-prepared Pd/lipase cross-linked enzyme aggregates with ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and well-preserved structure of enzymes exhibit excellent activity in the dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral amines. The mechanism for the process enhancement in the synthesis of EMHCs in evaporating microdroplets is studied by theoretical calculations, indicating that the fast solvent evaporation and high-heat transfer are the major factors for the instantaneous synthesis of EMHCs.",

GM1 and other complex gangliosides enhance EV secretion, while disruption of ganglioside synthesis impairs it. GM1 supplementation restores EV secretion in Huntington’s disease (HD) fibroblasts and cell models with ganglioside deficiency, including models of neurodegenerative diseases caused by a genetic block of ganglioside synthesis. Notably, GM1 enhances EV-mediated secretion of pathogenic misfolded proteins, including mutant huntingtin (mHTT), α-synuclein, and tau, reducing intracellular burden and providing mechanistic insight into the mHTT-lowering effects of GM1 in HD models.

We show that global warming significantly alters BSISO propagation by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 projections. Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 scenario, the eastward mode’s expansion propagation speed shows a twofold increase from 5.1 ± 1.9 to 10.3 ± 2.0 meters per second by the late 21st century, with a remarkable eastward extension by ~30° longitude compared to the present climate. The accelerated eastward mode frequency is expected to rise by 15%, intensifying subseasonal precipitation whiplash worldwide and shortening disaster preparedness time. This acceleration results from an asymmetric pattern of boundary layer moisture convergence anomalies, driven by weakened Rossby wave westerlies and enhanced Kelvin wave response linked to warming-induced atmospheric stabilization and El Niño–like ocean surface warming pattern. Conversely, a projected weakening of easterly vertical shear over the northern Indian Ocean attenuates the Rossby wave response and favors more eastward expansion events.",

This study establishes a Drosophila model for vomiting triggered by berberine ingestion. Our findings reveal that this response is mediated by the chemoreceptor TrpA1, which is indirectly activated by berberine via the mAChRs-PLC pathway. Berberine induces acetylcholine release from foregut epithelial cells, which triggers tachykinin secretion from intestinal tracheal cells. Tachykinins contract the visceral muscles, particularly the P4 pump of the foregut, and suppress myosuppressin release from pars intercerebralis neurons, thereby promoting crop motility. We further demonstrate the conservation of key genes involved in mammalian vomiting regulation. Overall, this study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding vomiting and introduces Drosophila as a genetic model for mechanistic studies.",

Nanoparticles form conductive percolation under a precisely patterned magnetic field. Within a phase transitional matrix, junctions between nanoparticles are tightened, enhancing electrical performance during transitions. We demonstrated in situ electrical switching and high-resolution alternating current electroluminescence display using the RAMP system.

Here, we synthesized the response of growing season carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions to experimentally manipulated warming of ~2°C for permafrost in alpine and Arctic regions. Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO 2 sink weakened but the CH 4 sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO 2 sink and CH 4 source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N 2 O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost. Although keeping additional warming below 2°C in permafrost regions can avoid the positive permafrost-climate feedback, measures are needed to maintain fragile carbon sink of alpine permafrost ecosystems.",

Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time. This work establishes the effectiveness of combining frequency tagging with machine learning to capture cognitive and behavioral effects with stimulus precision, applicable to other studies involving simultaneous stimuli.",

We observe clear signatures of multi-timescale mode locking, including a quadratic distribution of pump noise across both azimuthal mode families, consistent with theory. These findings are supported by near-transform–limited repetition beats and the emergence of periodic temporal patterns on the slow timescale.

Under +2°C of warming, 73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions. Regions with the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt timing under average climate conditions also have the largest shift earlier in postfire snowmelt under +2°C warming.

Herein, a multifunctional additive 3,4,5-trifluorobenzamide (TFBZ) was introduced to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects of the methylammonium (MA)–free WBG perovskite films. The TFBZ demonstrates superior passivation capability compared to benzamide, effectively mitigating both iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb 2+ defects via fluorine-enhanced interactions. In addition, the fluorine substituents in TFBZ could form N–H···F hydrogen bonds with formamidinium iodide to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite. This proposed method is effective in defect passivation and crystal growth modulation for both 1.67– and 1.79–electron volt MA-free WBG perovskites, enabling the fabrication of MA-free all-perovskite TSCs with an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 29.01% (certified at 28.52%).",

It can perform snapshot 3D imaging through a thin optical mask with a scalable field of view (FOV). Integrated microscopy uses computational algorithms for object reconstruction, but efficient reconstruction algorithms for large-scale data have been lacking. Here, we developed DeepInMiniscope, a miniaturized integrated microscope featuring a custom-designed optical mask and an efficient physics-informed deep learning model that markedly reduces computational demand. Parts of the 3D object can be individually reconstructed and combined. Our deep learning algorithm can reconstruct object volumes over 4 millimeters by 6 millimeters by 0.6 millimeters. We demonstrated substantial improvement in both reconstruction quality and speed compared to traditional methods for large-scale data. Notably, we imaged neuronal activity with near-cellular resolution in awake mouse cortex, representing a substantial leap over existing integrated microscopes. DeepInMiniscope holds great promise for scalable, large-FOV, high-speed, 3D imaging applications with compact device footprint.",

Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Ripe fruit pulp from 20 angiosperm species in Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda contained an average value of 0.31 (± 0.21 SD) and 0.32% (± 0.20) ethanol (weight/weight), respectively, as scaled by annual chimpanzee feeding time per species at each site. Chimpanzees typically eat ~4.5 kilograms of fruit per day, corresponding to an estimated ethanol ingestion of 14 grams (±9), or the equivalent of 1.4 (±0.9) standard drinks by international standards. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol is widespread within tropical fruits and that modern predisposition to alcohol consumption derives from ancestral exposure to this psychoactive substance among frugivorous primates.",

By stoichiometry-controlled polycondensation, the chain packing and microporosity of synthesized polyimides are finely regulated, verified by molecular simulations. The corresponding asymmetrical membranes with defect-free thin layers of 100 to 250 nanometers are prepared via solution casting and thermal annealing steps. Such programmed membranes enable tunable permselectivity for hydrocarbons with less than 40 carbon atoms. The fractionation of kerosene-paraffin mixture in toluene is demonstrated through a two-stage process containing the optimized membranes. The cascade process remarkably enriches the C 10 -C 13 hydrocarbons from 50% up to 97%.

Herein, we report a strain-optimized dual copper complex immobilized in mesoporous carbon, which exhibits remarkable ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 49.9% along with a multicarbon (C 2+ ) product’s FE up to 65.2% at −1.19 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Concurrently, the catalyst displays considerable stability for 15 hours at a full cell potential of −3.1 volts.

          "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the leading cause of inherited blindness, lacks therapies because of undefined photoreceptor degeneration mechanisms. While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration. This study establishes three advances: (i) TREM2 exhibits stage-dependent neuroprotective/neurotoxic roles, (ii) photoreceptor metabolites dictate microglia/myeloid cell fate via STAT2, and (iii) microglial apoptosis spreads through membrane signaling complexes. Our findings redefine neuroimmune dynamics in retinal degeneration, propose chronotherapeutic TREM2 targeting, and extend to Alzheimer’s and other microglia-associated CNS disorders via metabolic-immune interplay.",

However, the design method and localized perception of phase transitions remain challenging. Inspired by the passive coupling mechanisms in ostrich locomotion, this work proposes nonreciprocal metamaterials that can perceive real-time phase transition. These architectures enable the topological solitons to propagate unidirectionally and overcome dispersive and dissipative effects through bistable-to-monostable state switching between adjacent units. The integration of electromagnetic resonators within the metamaterial units enables real-time detection of dynamic phase transitions, as soliton propagation or external loads induce resonance frequency shifts between distinct stable states. By arraying these mechanoreceptive units and the combination of the machine learning, it can encode information and compute programmatically. Furthermore, the mechanoreceptors hold promising applications in robotics. This work provides an approach for integrating phase transition perception and nonlinear wave manipulation and offers insights into dynamic material intelligence and energy management systems.",

Applying a periodically modulated laser light to optomechanical oscillators allows for stable and precise control of oscillator couplings. This enables us to not only explore the physics of quantized integer and fractional phase slips but also synthesize multioctave synchronizations of mechanical oscillators that exhibit tailorable multistability. Furthermore, the dynamically manipulated synchronizations lead to an exotic phase-space trajectory, which has a nontrivial winding number and giant nonreciprocity.

Using single-cell metabarcoding on 243 diatom-bearing foraminifera specimens from Indonesia, we found one highly dominant diatom strain in each foraminiferal host species bearing at least 90% of the reads in a majority of host species, whereas the bacterial community was very flexible, with only 25% of the variation explained by water depth, substrate type, location, and host species.

          "abstract": "Holography is a revolutionary imaging technology capable of storing and recovering full-wave information of the light fields scattered by objects. However, current hologram configurations are based on space-only modulation and can merely record the amplitude and phase information of object lights. Here, we advance the holography concept by transitioning it from a space-only, homodyne, and single-tone approach to a spatiotemporal, heterodyne, and multifrequency methodology. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a space-time holographic metasurface antenna (HMA) capable of encoding and reconstructing the full amplitude, phase, and frequency contents of object waves. We demonstrate the HMA for frequency conversion and holographic beamforming in the far field, as well as multifrequency two-dimensional (2D) and 3D holographic imaging in the near field. The proposed integrative and multifunctional space-time HMA goes beyond the existing holography technology, with the potential to enable a plethora of applications such as augmented/virtual reality, data storage, metrology, and wireless communications.",

          "abstract": "The spectral absorption of biomolecules holds immense potential for revealing molecular identity, biological functions, and clinical diagnostics. Here, we present color-resolved third harmonic generation microscopy (cTHGM), a noninvasive method for molecular imaging based on absorption-enhanced THG response. Leveraging one single broadband femtosecond laser beam, cTHGM captures subtle absorption variations, including ~2-nanometer shifts in the Soret band, enabling precise distinction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from hemoglobin with negligible phototoxicity. We demonstrate that cTHGM measures HbA1c fractions in single red blood cells (RBCs) in vivo and ex vivo, providing noninvasive HbA1c measurement and insights into HbA1c distribution at the cellular level. In addition, cTHGM reconstructs historical glycemic trajectories by decoding single-RBC HbA1c distributions, offering a retrospective view of glycemic variability over months. This innovative method combines label-free imaging, high spatial and spectral resolution, and noninvasive manners, making it a promising tool for diabetes management, glycemic variability monitoring, and broader applications in precision medicine.",

The computation in traditional analog systems relies on use of intrinsic physical quantities (e.g., resistance), which are prone to fluctuations due to environmental changes or repeated programming, leading to compromised precision. Here, we shift the reliance on intrinsic physical quantity of memory devices to geometric ratio of transistors, enabling ultrahigh-precision analog computation. We demonstrate an analog in-memory computing chip based on a standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process, achieving the highest precision reported to date. Enhanced by the proposed weight remapping technique, the chip realizes ultrahigh computing accuracy with a root mean square error of only 0.101% across multiple parallel vector-by-matrix multiplication operations. Moreover, our analog in-memory computing chip maintains high precision, with an error of 0.155 and 0.130% under environmental temperatures of −78.5° and 180°C, respectively. This work pushes the boundaries of analog computing precision by leveraging stable geometry feature of devices.",

          "abstract": "Adipocyte hypertrophy during obesity triggers chronic inflammation, leading to metabolic disorders. However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes ( Hoip A-KO ) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD in Hoip A-KO obese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Marine diatoms are an abundant and ecologically important phytoplankton group susceptible to changing environmental conditions. Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated. This study presents a methodological and conceptual framework as a foundation for future studies to collate data capable of predicting species-specific responses and shifts in ecological niches driven by changes in marine carbonate chemistry.",

Limited availability of animal models and cell lines hinders understanding of transformation mechanisms. Addressing this gap, we established the first in silico dynamic model of the disease. Our methodology integrates mathematical logic modeling with experimental data to identify disease drivers, mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets. We validated the model by comparing the model’s readout with experimental data from different biological levels, such as single-cell RNA sequencing analyses and a CLL/RS patient formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue cohort. Our analyses identified BMI1 proto-oncogene and TP53 loss as key RS progression regulators. In addition, we performed an in silico target screening to identify promising target combinations in a personalized fashion.

The OECTC leverages the electronic wettability switch characteristic of conjugated polymers to convert sensed signals into a valve mechanism for controlling the release of chemical substances (e.g., drugs and neurotransmitters). This provides an all-in-one solution for synchronized signal recording and substance release for physiological modulation. The applications of the OECTC in intelligent wearable devices for managing type II diabetes and as a neural amplifier or inverter for neurotransmitter modulation are demonstrated.",

Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet heightened demands for energy and biosynthesis, reshaping regulatory networks across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers. Metabolite-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) serve as pivotal mechanisms integrating metabolic intermediates with immune signaling pathways. Beyond classical acetylation, diverse nonacetyl PTMs—including lactylation, succinylation, malonylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation—modify histone and nonhistone proteins, regulating gene expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions. Advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics now enable precise characterization of these PTMs, uncovering their broad roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes current progress in immunometabolism and explores future directions such as mechanistic studies, combination strategies, and clinical applications. Metabolite-driven PTMs critically connect metabolism to immune regulation, suggesting promising therapeutic approaches for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Gadolinium-based contrast agents revolutionized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by accelerating spin relaxation. In contrast, agents that decelerate relaxation were hitherto unknown. Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as 15 N-pyridine, 1,4- 13 C 2 -succinate, and 1- 15 N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner. Here, we report on a previously unrecognized effect in which the tracers’ longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates in aqueous solution are substantially reduced by adding nicotinamide, urea, glycerol, or dendrons. The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s p K a where T 1 can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the 15 N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1- 15 N-nicotinamide. This chemically induced deceleration of nuclear spin relaxation (CIDER) was confirmed using magnetic field–cycling experiments and offers broad potential for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and beyond.",

Under a 50-fold salinity gradient, the NP-MXene membrane achieved a record power density of 85.1 watts per square meter and an osmotic potential of 181.5 millivolts, the highest reported for a single device. Harnessing ion-specific signals from multi-ion transport, we further demonstrated an iontronic transistor capable of modulating ion flow by salinity gradients, eliminating the need for external gate voltage.

Harnessing corona biochemical reconstitutions and cell biology, we reveal that the paralogous spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 promote nonredundant branches of corona assembly. MPS1 kinase–dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD. Discovery of a direct interaction with the RZZ explains how the SAC protein MAD1 fits this corona assembly scheme.

Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions. To quantify asperity interactions, we introduce the contact fabric tensor, whose anisotropy provides a unified measure of roughness matching and a predictor for frictional strength and sliding onset.
