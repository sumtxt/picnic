          "authors": "Frank M. Schneider, Anne Bartsch, Larissa Leonhard, Anea Meinert",
          "abstract": "Can fictional entertainment foster political information processing and engagement, and if so, how? A German national telephone survey ( N Study1 = 905) and two online surveys ( N Study2 = 877; N Study3 = 1,018) were conducted to extend prior experimental research by examining unforced exposure to full-length media stimuli in real-world settings, using representative surveys, and including self-reports of actual behavior after exposure. Survey participants were interviewed about television theme nights (i.e., a combination of subsequent entertainment and information programs on the same topic) to examine direct and indirect relationships between eudaimonic entertainment experiences (i.e., moving and thought-provoking experiences) and politically relevant outcomes. As expected, feeling moved by a movie positively correlated with reflective thoughts, which, in turn, were associated with issue interest, subjective knowledge, and willingness to participate politically across all three studies. Additional relationships of feeling moved and reflective thoughts with information seeking, objective knowledge, and interpersonal discussion emerged for some but not all studies.",

          "abstract": "Empirical research connects the News Finds Me perception (NFM) with undesirable democratic outcomes. Consequently, high-NFM individuals may be more vulnerable to political misinformation than low-NFM individuals. In this two-wave, preregistered news judgment study (N = 867 US adults), we explore the possibility that high-NFM individuals overestimate their ability to detect misinformation‚Äîa phenomenon grounded in the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect, whereby individuals with limited competence fail to recognize their shortcomings. As hypothesized, high-NFM (vs. low-NFM) participants reported greater overconfidence in their false news discernment ability‚Äîan effect driven by their objectively lower discernment ability. We also find that the more overconfident high-NFM people were, the greater their intentions to engage with false and true news, although their overconfidence was especially likely to predict intentions to engage with false news. These findings suggest the NFM plays a dually negative role in promoting susceptibility to misinformation, highlighting the need for targeted intervention efforts.",

These effects were moderated by behavior repetitiveness and communication modality. However, gain vs. loss framing showed no significant differences in anger (k = 6, r = ‚Äì.03), negative cognitions (k = 6, r = ‚Äì.01), or psychological reactance (k = 12, r = ‚Äì.02).

          "authors": "Philipp K Masur, Giulia Ranzini",
          "abstract": "Since the advent of social network sites, researchers have investigated how and why users share personal information online. Yet, the replicability of individual findings remains unclear. We addressed this gap by closely replicating three seminal studies: Krasnova et al.‚Äôs (2010) study on the privacy calculus, Vitak‚Äôs (2012) analysis of the impact of context collapse, and Dienlin and Trepte‚Äôs (2015) investigation of the privacy paradox. While only 32.5% of the original effects replicated exactly across the three studies, 67.5% were significant and in line with the original direction. Despite this overall replication success, the prominent negative privacy concerns and self-disclosure link did not replicate and became positive instead. Additional specification curve analyses revealed that the strength of this relationship is contingent on a variety of analytical decisions. The findings offer insights into the replicability of survey-based privacy research, highlighting the role of replication in a dynamic research landscape.",

          "abstract": "Across three studies, we examined how balance theory can be used to predict interdependent character evaluations. Leveraging the propositions of balance theory as suggested by Grizzard, Francemone et al. (2020), our findings demonstrate that moral information about a single character biases perceptions and judgments of other characters within the same narrative. Beyond replicating binary comparative judgments between characters, similar to past work on character interdependence, we show that the relational information conveyed by a character network can reveal how interdependent effects between several characters will manifest. Specifically, our results demonstrate that characters are either contrasted or assimilated to one another based on the relationship valences communicated by the narrative‚Äôs character network. Extrapolating from these findings, we discuss several aspects of character networks that should be considered to further develop the concept of character interdependence.",

          "authors": "Jayson Harsin",
          "abstract": "One of the rare uncontested contemporary public facts is that especially Western academic and popular discourse became preoccupied with problematizing public untruth, misbelief, and distrust in the wake of Brexit, Trump, and the Covid-19 pandemic, a conjuncture more controversially referred to as ‚Äúpost-truth politics.‚Äù Three diverse books under review here can be gingerly approached under that post-truth banner, so long as it means a public anxiety about the possibility of securing publicly accepted facts (as opposed to, say, Oxford dictionaries‚Äô definition). Considering them together affords us a broader global and deeper historical, social, and psychological perspective on the conjuncture. Dannagal Goldthwaite Young‚Äôs Wrong encourages us to see what appears as a perplexing polarization of politics and entrenched (mis)beliefs as, instead, a distilled product of media-economic logics and the political exploitation of basic psychological needs for agency, control, comprehension, and/or community. Sarah Banet-Weiser and Kathryn Claire Higgins‚Äô Believability‚Äîengaging with the post-#MeToo and post-truth political entanglements‚Äîexplores how disbelief in factual accounts has always been reserved for women and other structurally demoted truth-tellers in historically specific ‚Äúeconomies of believability‚Äù. In Spin Dictators, meanwhile, Sergei Guriev and Daniel Triesman draw attention to shifting styles of dictatorship, from bloodily repressive autocratic and totalitarian historical examples‚Äîthe test cases of Arendt‚Äôs proto-post-truth politics around the ‚Äúfragility‚Äù of public facts‚Äîto something more liberal-democratic in terms of style and strategy.",

          "abstract": "Given that communicative phenomena are inherently processual, the scarcity of a longitudinal narrative perspective is an evident lacuna in communication research. This article argues that to explore communicative processes as a longitudinal experience, shaped by the constant tension between structure and agency, researchers can elicit and analyze stories that information producers and consumers construct in their own words across time. Consequently, the article explores the implementation of Longitudinal Qualitative Interviewing (LQI), the repeated interviewing of the same individuals at two (or more) time points, in the study of media. It considers the methodological and conceptual insights that could be drawn from such an application, and the ways in which the unique affordances of LQI enhance the validity of qualitative communication research. Our discussion of the implementation of LQI is anchored in an exploration of occupational life histories of 39 Israeli journalists over the span of a decade.",

          "authors": "Bridget Backhaus, Heather Anderson",
          "abstract": "Around the world, community radio is supported by volunteers who freely give their labour to keep stations on air. This work is crucial to ensuring that community radio can fulfil its ideological and, in some cases, legislative obligations to maximise community participation in media production and increase the diversity of voices on the airwaves. Further, the characteristics that differentiate community media from its commercial and state-run counterparts ‚Äì not-for-profit, community ownership, maximalist participation, among others ‚Äì are embedded within and the direct outcomes of these labour practices. This article suggests that a key connection between these complex traits and impacts is the affective labour of community radio practitioners. Though the affective labour of volunteers is central to the functioning of community radio, there is relatively little work exploring this dimension of community radio. Drawing on 51 in-depth interviews with community radio practitioners from across Australia, this article explores how affect is circulated both by and through the work of community radio practitioners, and the implications of this for community radio work. The findings suggest that affective labour is central to the community-building work of community radio and its role in weaving people and communities together.",

          "authors": "Ayesha Omer",
          "abstract": "In June 2015, amidst soaring temperatures, severe electricity, and water shortages, hundreds collapsed on the streets in Karachi. Emergency wards, morgues, and graveyards became full. Drawing on environmental media studies, infrastructure studies, and urban studies, the 2015 Karachi heatwave created, what I call, ‚Äúa thermal ecology‚Äù that encapsulates shifting material, geophysical, cultural phenomena that comprise life inside a heatwave. I demonstrate that the thermal ecology reconsitutes mediation, as relationships between media forms, systems, and cultures reorganize in response to ubiquitous heat. I examine three instances of such thermal mediation: first, a media assemblage of citizen-led media activism disseminated through public and corporate media platforms; second, a data computation-driven urban governance plan to tackle future heatwaves; and, third, a community-based visual media art project, Of Struggle , which documents and intervenes against the violent loss of human, nonhuman life from urban development. While recent scholarship attends to the tremendous heat expended by digital media, this paper examines the thermal ecology as it conditions forms of mediation, and the social and ecological lifeworlds within which these are embedded. It argues that the thermal ecology ‚Äì its media actions, governance, imaginaries ‚Äì need urgent examination as excessive, violent heat is an ongoing condition and marked future for all.",

          "authors": "Samantha James",
          "abstract": "As K-pop fans around the world participate in their fan communities in hybrid online-offline contexts, their sense of connection with artists and one another is shaped by their unique position in-between co-creators and resistors within the platform ecosystem. This article draws upon 10 months of fieldwork from 2022 to 2023 to offer a framework for how fans navigate platformization and offers a theoretical contribution to platform studies by advancing the theory of affective participation from the in-between. As a process, platformization involves the shifting of everyday experiences from offline interaction to technologically mediated interaction. For K-pop fans, platform infrastructures change participation in the realm of quantification and identification. This project delves into the relationship between K-pop fans and power structures within this contemporary capitalist system. I argue that, although fans work to creatively subvert systems of power within platformization, through navigation practices such as gatekeeping insider knowledge, community policing, and self-cooptation, they reinvent community structuring systems that serve to benefit K-pop industry leaders and platform owners. However, their creative platform use illuminates a potential for affective participation in the in-between ‚Äîsimultaneously subverting and supporting industry expectations. Fans‚Äô unique relationship with industry leaders and one another demonstrate the contradictory textured affective sensations which allow them to participate in fandom in unique ways. By offering this textured approach to affective participation, this article provides meaningful footing for future research on contemporary participation in global platformized contexts.",

          "authors": "Ruoning Chen, Michael Skey, Sabina Mihelj",
          "abstract": "Digital media have played a significant role in the rise of nationalism in recent years. Existing research, however, tends to focus on more explicit or passionate expressions of nationalist feelings online. In contrast, there has been very little work on the relationship between everyday digital practices and the (re)production of national frameworks among ‚Äúordinary‚Äù citizens. To address this lacuna, this study develops a novel theoretical framework that employs insights from studies of everyday habits, temporal rhythms and ‚Äúcommon-sense‚Äù knowledge. This framework is used to examine the everyday digital practices of ordinary people in China drawing on data from media diaries and semi-structured interviews with 45 participants. The Chinese digital infrastructure is particularly conducive to the formation of distinct national digital habits, due to its reliance on domestic platforms and the presence of the ‚ÄúGreat Firewall‚Äù that limits access to foreign platforms. Yet, as our analysis shows, the nationalizing effects of this digital infrastructure requires ‚Äúbuy-in‚Äù from citizens. We first investigate how and why people‚Äôs digital activities tend to be confined to the national ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù of Chinese platforms. Second, we highlight the role of WeChat as the primary node in China‚Äôs digital ecosystem and demonstrate how ordinary citizens use it, in a largely taken-for-granted manner, to sustain a plethora of nationally bounded relationships and activities. Finally, we examine the tiny number of participants that move beyond this ecosystem and their motivations for both venturing out and returning ‚Äúhome.‚Äù",

          "authors": "Rachel Wood",
          "abstract": "How do Instagram sustainability influencers communicate criticisms of consumer culture, and try to promote more sustainable alternatives, in the context of a platform and industry that seeks to promote consumption by design? Drawing on an ethnography of Instagram influencers who advocate ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù lifestyle politics, this paper argues that a ‚Äúsustainability paradox‚Äù emerges from the impossibility of aligning environmental values with the commercial norms of the influencer industry. This paradox necessitates continuous negotiation and management for influencers, and routinely excludes them from pathways to paid work. As extensive research on influencer labor has shown, sustainability influencers are far from alone in being systematically marginalized from paid work because they are not ‚Äúadvertiser friendly‚Äù or ‚Äúbrand safe‚Äù according to the capitalist norms of social media platforms and the influencer industry. The paper makes two key arguments regarding the causes of, and solutions to, this problem. First, the ‚Äúparadox‚Äù faced by sustainability influencers points to the irreparable unsustainability of the influencer industry and the environmentally destructive systems of production, promotion and consumption which it exists to promote. And second, solutions to the systemic problems of exploitative influencer labor cannot be found from tweaks to labor conditions in this unsustainable industry. Instead, the paper makes a case for the value of a ‚Äúpost-work‚Äù approach to influencer labor, which broadens critical and political imaginaries for what ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù might mean outside of exclusionary and environmentally catastrophic hegemonies of promotional labor and consumption.",

The findings highlight how the performative nature of their parenting allows these bloggers to actively shape their own identities and those of their mixed-blood children, navigating structural constraints and cultural differences while engaging with gendered, racialized, and (trans)national discourses that shape family lives and power relations in transnational households. While doing so, their participation in the attention economy also reveals contradictions‚Äîwhere empowerment and commodification coexist.",

          "authors": "Chelsea Butkowski, Frances Corry",
          "abstract": "As long-standing social media platforms reinvent themselves and new platforms emerge, recent discourses about social media describe the platform landscape as marked by rising uncertainty and volatility. This article deconstructs popular media narratives of emerging, centralized social media platforms, including TikTok, BeReal, and Threads. Through a qualitative textual analysis of mainstream press discourses, we address the current existential juncture in the social media landscape by examining normative ideals of social media usage and the visions animated by these framings. Our study finds that social media‚Äôs imagined futures are refracted through the past, surfacing the fundamental importance of nostalgia in narratives of each platform‚Äôs emergence. We describe a persistent entanglement between the ongoing production of speculative discourses about future technologies and a yearning for affective experiences of bygone platforms through the concept of nostalgic anticipation. Nostalgic anticipation provides a framework for understanding how today‚Äôs narratives of technological change create idealized visions of a digital past while eliding critiques of the social media industry.",

          "authors": "Siri Frisli",
          "abstract": "This study investigates COVID-19-related misinformation on Norwegian Twitter (X), using a mixed-method approach to analyze a large corpus of 426,000 Norwegian-language tweets posted over the course of 3 years, focusing on the interplay between discursive strategies, ideological dynamics, and power relations. The quantitative analysis uses Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify and map the prevalence of key discourses. The STM revealed how the COVID-19 misinformation on the platforms was mainly concentrated around two discourses: politics and health. A qualitative critical discourse analysis was used to explore how vaccine-related misinformation reinforced or challenged broader power dynamics and hegemonic ideologies around health, science, and freedom. Informed by the quantitative analysis, the discourse analysis focused on two prevalent misinformation topics, revealing how vaccine-critical discourses contest the authority of health institutions and the government by framing vaccines as dangerous, experimental, and illegal. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how misinformation circulates and evolves in specific sociopolitical contexts. By analyzing the intersections of ideology, power, and discourse, the study highlights social media‚Äôs role in mediating public debates during health crises. The results emphasize that misinformation is not merely false or misleading information but a strategic challenge to hegemony, ideology, and power. Implications include the need for more nuanced approaches to combating misinformation, addressing its ideological and discursive appeal.",

          "title": "The Rise of Influencer Practices Among Psychologists: From Therapy Rooms to Instagram Reels",
          "authors": "Bur√ßin Sarƒ±",
          "abstract": "Professions are neither isolated nor static entities; they operate within a dynamic system that is shaped by the internal and external forces. Today, a novel yet formidable external force is gradually permeating professional domains: influencer creep , driven by neoliberal self-branding rhetoric. This study investigates the diffusion of influencer creep into psychology, a field with strong legal, workplace, and public jurisdiction. Using a multi-method approach, we observed 100 Turkish psychologists‚Äô Instagram practices over 6 months and conducted 20 semi-structured interviews. Findings reveal that Instagram has become an unexpected intermediary in the labor market for psychologists, intensifying to fulfill the three pillars of influencer creep: self-branding, optimization, and authenticity. Psychologists now strategically use the platform as a ‚Äúvisual curriculum vitae,‚Äù leveraging its affordances to craft micro-selling points for their self-brand. These efforts also involve negotiating with algorithms, constant optimization efforts, and projecting themselves authentically by trying not to compromise their professional demeanor. Based on these findings, we contend that influencer creep not only alters individual professional practices but also reconfigures the profession itself through four interrelated changes: (a) the expansion of audiences, shifting from small-scale, localized clients to large, mass followings; (b) the redefinition of traditional markers of expertise, where institutional credentials are increasingly replaced by platform-driven metrics; (c) the alteration of traditional gatekeeping structures, as algorithmic systems take on a more prominent role in determining professional recognition and influence; and (d) requiring a new set of skills such as content creation and algorithmic proficiency, often overshadowing conventional professional competencies.",
