          "authors": "Paul Schrodt",
          "abstract": "This meta-analysis reviews the findings from 49 studies (N = 23,336) examining the association between interparental conflict and children feeling caught between parents (also referred to as parent–child triangulation). The cumulative evidence indicates a moderate, meaningful relationship between interparental conflict and children feeling caught (r = .402, 95% confidence interval: .366, .437). On average, the positive association was stronger when researchers used: (a) samples that included both intact and post-divorce family members as opposed to only intact or post-divorce families; (b) samples that included young adult children as opposed to adolescent children; (c) cross-sectional as opposed to longitudinal research designs; (d) children’s reports of interparental conflict as opposed to parents’ reports or observational ratings; and (e) individuals as the unit of analysis as opposed to triads. Implications for developing a communication theory of feeling caught are discussed.",

          "authors": "Jason C Coronel, Matthew Sweitzer, James Alex Bonus, Rebecca Dore, Blue Lerner",
          "abstract": "A new era of message processing research will emerge from the convergence of powerful machine learning algorithms with dynamic data from everyday devices equipped with biological sensors. Our study takes critical steps into this era by integrating theory-guided artificial neural networks with eye movements to understand how people learn science concepts from dynamic multimedia. Essential to our theory-guided machine learning approach is a cognitive conceptualization of time as the dynamic interdependence between past and new information that guides how multimedia is attended to and understood. We tracked the eye movements of 197 children as they watched an educational video. We trained two neural network architectures differing in theory guidance to predict learning outcomes using eye movements. The theory-guided architecture, which considered the temporal interdependence of information, yielded more accurate out-of-sample predictions. Our work advances the use of theory-guided machine learning and the development of systems that monitor real-time learning.",
