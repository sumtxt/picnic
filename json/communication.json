          "authors": "Jana H Dreston, Andreas Nanz",
          "abstract": "As political campaigns increasingly use social media to reach voters, scholars debate whether users actually acquire election-related knowledge or merely perceive themselves as more knowledgeable. It remains unclear whether social media enhances voting that aligns with users’ political attitudes (“correct voting”). Previous studies suggest social media effects vary substantially based on whether exposure is intentional or incidental. In a between-subject online experiment (N = 1,460), participants scrolled through a social media feed exposing them to policy statements either intentionally, incidentally, or not at all before voting in a mock election. We found that both intentional and incidental exposure increased objective knowledge, whereas only intentional exposure enhanced subjective knowledge. Yet, participants did not translate the acquired knowledge into aligned voting. However, those who intentionally sought election information felt more confident in their voting decision. Our findings suggest social media may mobilize voters more effectively than it enables them to make “good” decisions.",

Drawing from the two-step flow of communication theory and behavioral models of collective action, we conducted two experimental studies and an innovative quasi-experimental field study (total N = 2,960). Across these studies, influencer messages increased collective response efficacy beliefs and political action intentions, particularly among followers with strong parasocial ties. Moreover, repeated exposure to an influencer’s message reinforced these effects. Our research underscores the potential of influencers in mobilizing collective political action within digital media environments.",

          "authors": "Hiu-Fung Chung",
          "abstract": "How does critical AI studies itself travel, and what happens when it arrives elsewhere? This commentary reflects on the global circulation of critique from the standpoint of East Asia, where layered histories of modernization, technological aspiration, and cultural traditions generate alternative ways of knowing, imagining, and critiquing AI beyond South–North frameworks. Writing from my position as a graduate student from East Asia, now trained in a North American institution, I introduce three analytical vectors— tangle, transplant , and transmute —all of which emerge dialogically through my research on AI innovation in East Asia and through engagement with Asian media scholarship addressing similar concerns. Through vignettes from this research journey, I suggest that these themes illuminate how dominant critical vocabularies encounter local imaginaries, on-the-ground frictions, socio-cultural histories, and divergent ethical orientations. Rather than proposing a unified Asian critical theory of AI, I offer “traveling AI” as a reflexive praxis that centers relational co-constitution, situated reworking, and philosophical reorientation, while remaining attuned to epistemic tensions and power differentials. In dialogue with broader de-westernizing projects, this paper suggests that East Asia can contribute to reimagining critique not as theory from the center or the periphery, but as an ongoing praxis of troubling with in-betweenness .",

          "authors": "Macau K. F. Mak, Michael W. Wagner",
          "abstract": "Many individuals regularly use multiple social media platforms, and their information exposure is shaped by the various networks they maintain across these platforms. Given the rising trend of multi-platform social media use, this article introduces a two-step approach to investigate how networks across platforms conjointly and distinctly relate to incidental exposure to news and political information. Our analysis of survey data from the United States showed that greater immersion in multiple politically heterogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal incidental exposure, while greater immersion in multiple politically homogeneous networks across platforms predicted higher pro-attitudinal incidental exposure. Among the popular platforms, immersion in networks on Facebook, X (Twitter), and YouTube played a particularly influential role in these relationships. Surprisingly, we also found that greater immersion in homogeneous networks across multiple platforms predicted higher counter-attitudinal exposure, even though immersion in any single platform’s homogeneous network was not a significant predictor.",

          "abstract": "Guided by boundary work, this study aims to investigate how lifestyle journalism’s boundaries are changing in response to the rise of creator culture. Specifically, this study seeks to understand how lifestyle journalists define and perceive new creators in their profession and what kind of boundary-making strategies they enact in reaction to such new actors. Through 31 interviews with Singaporean lifestyle journalists, the findings show that there is currently a dynamic and evolving ecosystem of distinct digital lifestyle players comprising lifestyle journalists, digital natives, bloggers, key opinion leaders and influencers, and that the journalists perceive a complex ‘frenemy’ relationship with these actors. Lifestyle journalists engage in a combination of expansion, expulsion and protection of autonomy boundary strategies to guard their profession’s boundaries against the incursions of these new lifestyle actors, but there is a clear shift towards expansion-led strategies. Lifestyle journalists seem to be increasingly welcoming of both newer social media actors and practices into their profession, signalling that lifestyle journalism now exists in a digital reputation economy where online visibility, above all else, serves as the foremost marker of professional success.",

          "title": "Aging in the Digital Tsunami: Older Micro-Influencers, Digital Inclusion, and Dynamic Access on Douyin",
          "authors": "Yingwen Wang, Yanghui Cao",
          "abstract": "As China undergoes rapid demographic aging, older Wanghong (influencers over 60) on platforms like Douyin challenge traditional digital inclusion frameworks that conceptualize access as linear progression through motivational, material, skills, and usage dimensions. This study examines how older micro-Wanghong navigate challenges during content creation, revealing critical gaps in existing digital inclusion theory. Drawing on an exploratory qualitative study of 11 micro-Wanghong, we develop the dynamic access concept that reconceptualizes digital inclusion as continuous adaptation across three dimensions: motivational resilience (maintaining creator identity despite platform constraints), adaptive skill development (ongoing competency evolution responding to platform changes), and algorithmic navigation (strategic responses to systematic platform exclusions). Our analysis reveals systematic algorithmic exclusion through temporal marginalization (algorithms favoring high-frequency posting patterns that disadvantage older micro-Wanghong’s rhythms), knowledge domain restrictions (automated content moderation limiting topics relevant to older adults), and culture misalignment (platform architectures optimized for entertainment conflicting with older micro-Wanghong’s knowledge transformation preferences) that create structural barriers independent of individual competencies. Despite these constraints, participants demonstrate sophisticated adaptive strategies enabling sustained creative participation through ongoing platform negotiation rather than static skill application. These findings extend Van Dijk’s digital inclusion theory by demonstrating how platform-mediated content creation collapses traditional access boundaries into ongoing negotiation processes. The dynamic access addresses temporal dimensions which often assumed in digital appropriation or inclusion theories, positioning meaningful participation as requiring continuous adaptive capacity rather than one-time achievement. We argue that digital inclusion policy must evolve beyond basic access provision toward supporting ongoing adaptation to platform evolution.",

          "abstract": "Social media provide unprecedented opportunities for public deliberation. However, a growing number of users perceive negativity in political debate taking place in those venues and are increasingly frustrated when discussing politics with those they disagree with. In this article, we test the proposition that perceiving online discussions as healthier (i.e. more polite and civil) than offline discussions invigorates online political participation. We rely on an online survey fielded in 17 European countries on more than 28,000 individuals. Our findings indicate that being embedded in healthier discussions on social media is more of an important predictor of online participation for those respondents reporting higher political discussion fatigue and less so for those perceiving online discussions as fun. Overall, our study offers cross-national evidence of why and for whom exposure to healthy political discussions online might be mobilizing.",

          "abstract": "The “News Finds Me” (NFM) perception captures the common belief that one can stay informed without actively seeking news. This study aims to extend previous research by comparing the widely used general NFM measure with topic-specific perceptions of entertainment, sports, politics, COVID-19, and climate change news. We assess the strength, predictors, and outcomes of NFM perceptions across those different thematic domains. Our findings show that NFM perceptions are stronger for soft news (entertainment and sports) compared to hard news (politics, COVID-19, climate change). In addition, interest in a news topic is associated with lower NFM perceptions for hard news and higher perceptions for soft news. While the traditional NFM measure reflects “News Finds Me” perceptions in politics and COVID-19 well, it is not as effective in capturing perceptions of climate change and soft news. Our results emphasize the need to explore different news genres to better understand news consumption beliefs and behaviors.",

          "authors": "Tucker Wang-Hai, Bibo Lin",
          "abstract": "This study examines how a special subset of Chinese journalists (those who focus mostly on an overseas audience) navigate and utilize U.S.-owned social media platforms, which are banned in China, in their daily newsroom practices. While previous research has primarily focused on digital news production and platformization in Western contexts, this study offers a transnational and sociotechnical perspective on how Chinese journalists negotiate platform logics (such as audience metrics and recommendation algorithms) while balancing state-driven narratives with global audience demands. Drawing on 26 in-depth interviews, the study zooms in on Chinese journalists’ constrained freedom associated with social media use: they benefit from access to large audiences but lack control over platform design and governance. These Chinese journalists often feel alienated from the platforms they rely on: journalistic labor is regulated by the Chinese state, while platform infrastructures are governed by U.S. tech firms. This study highlights how platformization in transnational journalism is shaped by the entanglement of technology, politics, and professional norms, extending our understanding of how platform power operates across geopolitical boundaries and offering a distinctive lens on the global unevenness of digital media systems.",

          "title": "Mediated Peer Interactions Among Rural Children in China: A Field Study From the Perspective of the New Sociology of Childhood",
          "authors": "Hongli Zhou, Xudong Zhou, Jing Wang",
          "abstract": "Amid the profound transformations of rural society, traditional authorities and value systems are undergoing significant disruption. Mediated peer interactions among children are no longer merely a form of entertainment, but have become crucial arenas where they exercise agency and participate in shaping these changes. Grounded in the theoretical framework of the new sociology of childhood, this study presents an ethnographic investigation of HL Village. The findings reveal that the official evaluative system, represented by the school, has lost its effectiveness within the peer world. As active social agents, children reconstruct interactional spaces, reinvent social rules, and generate internal hierarchies through intensive mediated peer communication. In doing so, they establish an alternative value system centered on “media capital.” This dynamic creates a fundamental tension between the disciplinary logic of the adult world and the reconstructive logic of children’s peer culture. Based on these findings, the study argues that the agency children exhibit in mediated peer interactions is deeply ambivalent: while it challenges traditional authority, it simultaneously reproduces new forms of inequality and digital exclusion. Moreover, this mediated peer interactions offers a micro-level lens through which to observe rural social transformation, as its unique culture of interaction both reflects and contributes to broader structural shifts.",
