          "authors": "Graham D Bodie, Miriam Brinberg, Susanne Jones, Denise H Solomon, Nilam Ram",
          "abstract": "This study proposes and tests five temporally explicit models of message evaluation derived from work on supportive communication. Although most empirical work in this area is based on a limited number of time-scales (temporal isolation of messages or temporal aggregation of conversations), theories that direct that work have the potential to make much more sophisticated predictions of how supportive messages, and the conversations within which they occur, are evaluated. Using data produced by pairs of friends who engaged in 5-min supportive conversations, we articulated a series of theoretically informed models that examined how type, accumulation, and timing of conversational moves impacted how disclosers evaluated the supportiveness of the statements made throughout the conversation (evaluated by the discloser using video-assisted recall) and how they felt after the conversation. Results confirmed that (a) evaluations made throughout a conversation are related to post-conversation reports of supportiveness and emotional improvement, (b) different types of speaking acts are generally not differentially supportive, and (c) timing of some speaking acts matters—altogether suggesting we pay more attention to how we conceptualize and measure time in studies of enacted support.",

          "authors": "Neve Gordon",
          "abstract": "This article maps the word antisemitism on the pages of The Jewish Chronicle (TJC), the world’s oldest Jewish newspaper, examining first the frequency of the term over a period of 100 years before zooming in to interrogate the ways in which ‘antisemitism’ was invoked during the 9 months before and 9 months after October 7, 2023. The data reveals that TJC has been exaggerating and instrumentalising a Zionist notion of antisemitism to foment moral panic, mobilising the language of trauma and injury to continuously reassert a notion of Jewish victimhood. Building on the work of media scholars who investigate victimhood, I argue that the newspaper puts into motions a justificatory framework that operates by claiming injury and then using the alleged injury to set in motion a series of oppressive actions against individuals, groups and institutions. By way of conclusion, I show how TJC has been using ‘antisemitism’ as a ‘consoling idea’ to consolidate and sustain Jewish group identity while simultaneously invoking the term to shield and legitimise violent forms of racial governance and as a weapon against Palestinian and pro-Palestinian activists.",

          "authors": "Qiuxin Chen, Yuanyuan Shi, Yeheng Pan",
          "abstract": "Focusing on the use of the loudspeaker during the COVID-19 emergency in Shanghai in 2022, this study explores the evolving roles and sociotechnical imaginaries associated with this traditional medium in contemporary emergency management. Drawing on participant observation and interviews, the study reveals the complex emotional landscape surrounding the loudspeaker due to its symbolic associations with authority and power. For some residents, it was perceived as a symbol of coercion and intrusion; for others, especially in moments of uncertainty, it evoked feelings of nostalgia and a sense of security. In response to public sentiment, grassroots administrators began to adapt their communication strategies—modifying language, adding emotional resonance, and embedding elements of cultural identity—to reduce dissatisfaction and foster cooperation. These adaptive practices illustrate a transformation in the socio-technical imaginary of the loudspeaker, from a unidirectional instrument of regulation to a more dynamic medium of interaction. During the public health emergency, it came to serve not only regulatory functions but also acted as a conduit for emotional expression and cultural connection. This study thus extends the theoretical boundaries of socio-technical imagination, offering insights into how older technologies acquire new meanings and relational capacities within the hybrid communicative landscapes of crisis governance.",

          "authors": "Riccardo Ferrigato, Gabriele Balbi",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces and discusses a theoretical approach for media scholars: the media maintenance approach (MEMA). Maintenance is not a new subject of study in social sciences and humanities, but it has been rarely addressed by media studies so far. After reviewing literature about maintenance in history of technology, philosophy of technology, and STS, and defining the concept of “maintenance”, the paper turns to media studies and examines how current (sub)fields, such as media archaeology, ecomedia, media sustainability, media history, media evolution, audience and users’ studies, labor studies, and PEC have already addressed issues related to maintenance and to maintaining forms or practices of communication. MEMA can gather, connect and enrich these existing perspectives and can advance a unified and integrated approach able to combine continuity and change, but also conservation and innovation in media studies. In the conclusion, the paper addresses three “benefits” that MEMA can bring to media studies, all dealing with different degrees of temporalities.",

          "authors": "Angeline Marie Letourneau",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms are crucial for political and social engagement, where identity profoundly shapes public opinion. While existing research explores social media and identity, the rise of sophisticated bots complicates this relationship; bots programmed to mimic human identity groups may influence discourse and sway opinion on critical issues like elections and climate change. Addressing a gap in theoretical work, this article proposes the concept of instrumental bot identities, explaining how bots can be strategically designed to leverage and co-opt social identity processes for enhanced impact. By developing a theoretical framework, I outline the characteristics (e.g. relevance, familiarity, anonymity) and interaction patterns (e.g. influencing ingroup/outgroup dynamics) that could make specific identities instrumental for bot campaigns. Using the case of fossil fuel workers, a politically salient group in energy transition discussions, the article illustrates how bots could simulate classed and gendered characteristics to reinforce stereotypes, shape group norms, and ultimately influence public attitudes toward decarbonization policies. This framework highlights that bot effectiveness may stem from exploiting identity-motivated reasoning, offering crucial insights for understanding and mitigating online manipulation in polarized contexts.",

          "title": "After Twitter: Fragmentation, Platform Polities and Protective Sociality",
          "authors": "Nathaniel Tkacz, Robert W. Gehl",
          "abstract": "This article argues that a profound change has occurred in the spaces of social media, centring on the region formerly occupied by Twitter. More than Twitter rebranding as X, After Twitter refers to a historical punctuation point in the timeline of social media and an emerging social media reality. After Twitter registers the slow death of a set of ideals and related practices specific to platforms like Twitter, but also to the waning of ideals in relation to the communicative potentials of the open web more generally. We make three broad claims which characterise social media After Twitter: First, by way of an overview of alternatives and competitors including Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Truth Social and more, we observe a social media fragmentation. Such fragmentation is not solely driven by economic forces or technological development and instead is understood along explicitly political lines. Second, we observe the rise of polarised platform polities. These polities reflect divergent political positions, create distinct political realities and foster different modes of interaction and belonging. Third, we observe a general shift from connective to protective forms of sociality, where users approach social media as if they are constantly in the presence of adversaries, and the ‘weak ties’ that once defined a web of opportunities are replaced by an assumed toxicity of ties. We conclude by reflecting on the nostalgia for the Twitter-that-was, suggesting the need to foster a critical and reflective relationship with the Twitter of old.",

          "abstract": "This study examines digital vigilantism videos on TikTok and their role in highlighting systemic barriers to traditional justice. Through textual analysis of 50 TikTok “vigilante videos” and the 244,600 comments supporting them, this research explores how women employ weaponized exposure to pursue informal justice across a spectrum of experienced harms. While prevailing scholarship highlights the risks of digital vigilantism, this project provides a critical feminist perspective, emphasizing the tension between carceral and anticarceral approaches to justice. Findings reveal “vigilante videos” serve three key functions: (1) facilitating retributive action against perpetrators, (2) transforming victims’ shame into collective empowerment, and (3) creating protective networks safeguarding potential future victims. By engaging with these videos, TikTok users foster a sense of crowd-sourced justice, amplifying the voices of women who have been failed by traditional legal avenues. These digital practices reflect a broader critique of the carceral state and demonstrate how women navigate justice outside of formal systems. This research contributes to scholarship on TikTok, cultural criminology activism, and anitcarceral feminism.",

          "title": "Fashioning Ethnic Pride: Women of Color and the Outfit Transition Trend on TikTok",
          "authors": "Melissa Carolee Brown, Reyna Rajkumar, Kaitlin Webster",
          "abstract": "This study examines how women of color on TikTok engage with the viral “outfit transition” trend to assert ethnic pride, resist cultural assimilation, and build digital communities. Our research builds on literature exploring TikTok’s affordances and digital fashion culture, focusing on how women of color use the application to challenge aesthetic assimilation and celebrate ethnocultural identity. Using critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) and digital ethnography, we analyzed 63 TikTok videos to explore how audiovisual features (e.g., audio, hashtags, and comments) enable marginalized creators to challenge western aesthetic dominance. The findings reveal that women of color strategically use TikTok to construct a subaltern digital commons, celebrating ethnic pride while fostering solidarity across diaspora communities. These creators promote cross-cultural engagement by inviting non-ethnic viewers to learn about and respectfully engage with their cultures on their terms. This study expands on studies of digital fashion culture to show how TikTok’s outfit transition trend functions as an online space to resist Eurocentric beauty standards while centering non-white femininities and cultural aesthetics. In addition, our analysis sheds light on how these creators navigate algorithmic biases that often limit visibility for marginalized groups. Women of color creatively rework viral trends to enhance their visibility, asserting control over how they and their communities are represented online. Ultimately, the study underscores TikTok’s potential as a site for community building and intercultural exchange, where women of color challenge colonial legacies in fashion while sustaining digital spaces for ethnocultural uplift.",
