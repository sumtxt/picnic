          "title": "Reimagining digital inclusion through platform economies in Brazil",
          "authors": "Victoria Adams, Edward King",
          "abstract": "This article considers how community-led organisations in Brazil are reformulating debates surrounding digital inclusion in the face of the consolidation of platform capitalism. It does this through exploration of how two NGOs cultivate spaces for exchange and dialogue in rural and urban areas of the country’s Southwest. The first, SILO, works with communities in rural, peripheral and protected areas to respond to local challenges using art, science and technology, while the second, AfroGames, offers esports training to disadvantaged young people across the city of Rio de Janeiro. Building on discussions with those behind each NGO in March 2024, the article examines how both organisations reproduce and break from large-scale state and civil society efforts to promote social, cultural and digital inclusion in Brazil in the early 2000s. A key contention of the article is that contemporary efforts to promote digital inclusion in Brazil cannot be divorced from territorially rooted mobilisations for social justice. At the same time, it attends to key differences between the work of the NGOs analysed and the digital inclusion efforts of the early 2000s, for example, as regards their approach to free and open culture and the potential of the video games industry. The article argues that the work of both NGOs shows how, in the hands of communities and activists, even expressions of digital culture widely associated with platform economies, capital accumulation and individualism, such as retail platforms and esports, can be turned to provocative and emancipatory ends. It concludes by considering how the work of both NGOs contributes to recent research exploring the complexities of how platforms land in Latin America through their focus on how sociocultural practices and platforms intersect, reworking the strategies of Brazil’s digital inclusion movement and probing of the limits of autonomy in an era of pervasive platform capitalism.",

          "authors": "Meri Frig, Visa Penttilä",
          "abstract": "Many of the causes and impacts of environmental and social issues may seem invisible, while others are apparent yet overlooked. Journalists act as focal agents shaping how society addresses these issues, including climate change and social inequality. In this article, we investigate how journalists act as visibility agents – that is, agents who make visible such issues in the media, culture, and society more generally. Drawing on interviews with Nordic journalists, this exploratory qualitative study shows how journalists address the (in)visibility of environmental and social issues in four primary ways: uncovering wrongdoing, moderating false and inadequate information, explaining complex social/environmental topics, and popularizing issues. The study advances literature on mediated visibility and the relationships between journalists and political and economic leaders by explaining how the former approach the task of visibilizing environmental and social problems.",

          "authors": "Rebecca Monteleone, Beena Raghav, Amy Silverman, Darius Cunningham, Phillis Schmidbauer, Marissa Kuehn",
          "abstract": "There has been limited attention to the role of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) as contributors and consumers of news media. In a series of focus groups conducted with people with I/DD about news media, we found respondents had a diverse set of topical interests but generally negative perceptions of the news. They also faced a number of infrastructural, attitudinal, and cognitive barriers to accessing media. Additionally, participants expressed a desire for more positive representation of I/DD in news media, as well as more education and training for journalists. We conclude by considering news media engagement as an aspect of civic participation and make several recommendations for applications and future directions.",

          "authors": "Do Kyun David Kim, Isaac Kim",
          "abstract": "In the era of digital communication, social media have often been considered a bastion of freedom of speech, both at national and global levels. However, in Myanmar, the military government has imposed strict control over social media since its coup in 2021, while using them to disseminate authoritarian propaganda. Civilians who have voiced opposition against the regime have been arrested, and foreign media networks have withdrawn their operations from the country due to governmental oppression. Recognizing the oppressive political climate and its impact on freedom of speech and public discourse on social media, this study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) constructing a theoretical model of connective democracy for Myanmar by integrating the concepts of freedom of speech and contractarianism, and (2) suggesting effective strategic social media communication strategies to liberate Myanmar. These theoretical and practical approaches will contribute to constructing connective democracy not only in Myanmar but also other countries under political oppression and communication censorship.",

          "authors": "Kevin Munger, Valerie Li",
          "abstract": "TikTok and the associated technologies for recording and editing short-form video constitute a large and growing portion of online communication. Previous modalities of social media, including static images and especially text, engendered significant attention to the facticity of the communication: was a statement true or false? Did an event actually take place? For a certain genre of stylized, highly edited short-form video, this is beside the point—which is to produce a compelling video that portrays a prominent figure in a particular light. We conduct an experiment to evaluate whether “edits” of prominent politicians can change voter perceptions. We find that “thirst trap” edits cause an increase in perceptions of politician attractiveness and that “badass” edits improve overall evaluations of Donald Trump (but not Joe Biden). Descriptively, we present a distribution of the evaluations of the attractiveness of Trump, Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr (“RFK”), demonstrating significant variation.",

          "authors": "John R. Gallagher, Antonia Pecoraro Hernandez",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how aspirational content creators (ACCs) on the r/NewTubers subreddit forum understand and discuss YouTube’s algorithm. This study employs thematic analysis of 144 r/NewTubers posts that explicitly mentioned algorithms. The analysis reveals four main themes: mythologizing and anthropomorphism, demystification of the algorithm, platform gossip, and community backlash. NewTubers often personify the algorithm, attributing human-like qualities and agency to it. This anthropomorphism, however, is frequently challenged by other NewTubers who emphasize the algorithm’s technical nature and the importance of content quality. These narratives highlight the formation of public, non-institutional algorithmic literacies among ACCs as they negotiate the opaque world of platform algorithms.",

          "authors": "Mikkeline Thomsen, Sarah Steinitz, Morten Fischer Sivertsen, Sine N. Just",
          "abstract": "Facebook groups hold civic potential as fora for connective democracy. Exploring this claim, we offer a contribution to ongoing debates concerning the democratic value of digital communication. Through a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative mapping of approximately 9,000 Danish Facebook groups, netnographic field studies of select groups, and interviews with group moderators, we investigate the groups as “friendlier spaces” of contemporary civic behaviors. We find that the groups enact two key principles of connective democracy: recognizing common identity invites mundane citizenship and negotiating common norms establishes a training ground for political participation. To conceptualize the civic behaviors that arise in the Facebook groups, we introduce the concept of digital community centers, drawing parallels to the cultural history of Danish community centers, which became ubiquitous in the early 1900s and served as hubs for socializing and political exchange throughout the 20th century. We conclude that citizen-led Facebook groups replicate the political potential of traditional community centers, thus serving as their digital equivalents. The groups not only support connective democracy on the ground but also prepare members for formal political participation, thereby holding potential to revitalize democracy in the digital era.",
