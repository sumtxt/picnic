          "title": "The (dis)advantages of (in)visibility: an analysis of the role of sexual orientation and gender identity in recent flows of forced migrants to Brazil",
          "authors": "Vítor Lopes Andrade",
          "abstract": "Since 2002, Brazil has been granting refugee status on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). This topic has become more visible in the last few years due to the large flow of Venezuelans crossing the border, many of whom are not heterosexual and/or cisgender. However, there is an older, although less visible, flow of African people, mainly from Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon, who travel to Brazil in order to claim asylum because of their SOGI. Despite the fact that more research has been conducted recently on the intersection between migration and sexuality, most of this scholarship focuses on South-North movements, not South-South migrations with destinations such as Brazil. The aim of this article is to analyse the central role played by political and social (in)visibility of SOGI forced migrants in Brazil and the (dis)advantages provided by their (in)visibility. In order to do so, I draw on twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork in the city of São Paulo, which included participant observation and semi-structured interviews with SOGI forced migrants from African countries. I also draw on secondary data from ethnographies carried out with SOGI forced migrants from Venezuela in the cities of Boa Vista and Rio de Janeiro, as well as on official data published by the Brazilian government. My argument is that SOGI forced migrants play with their own (in)visibility, making strategic decisions before migrating to Brazil, during their journeys, and after their arrival in the country.",

          "title": "Does geographic mobility contribute to educational outcomes: is migration timing the missing link in internal migration",
          "authors": "Lijie Song",
          "abstract": "The rapid economic growth and urbanization have significantly increased geographic mobility among individuals and families. While international migration has long been a topic of debate, internal migrations are gaining increasing attention. Using data from China Migration Dynamic Survey, this paper pays special attention to the role of internal migration in educational attainment of the next generation. Specifically, by examining the migration-induced (non-)disruption in schooling, this study aims to control certain confounding factors and explore the role of migration timing as a potential missing link. The findings reveal that non-disruptive migration (before children aged 5) results in increased children’s schooling years for both left-behind children (LBC) and migrant children (MC). Conversely, disruptive migration tends to have no significant effects on children’s education in most cases. To bolster the robustness of these findings, an alternative sample of younger children aged 6–20 is constructed to assess potential dropout rates. Additionally, to address concerns regarding endogenous issues, we instrument the (non)disruption with the average (non-)disruption rate and the employment rate of the migration year in the hometown and destination respectively for MC and LBC. Meanwhile, propensity score matching (PSM) technique is employed to gauge the average treatment effect by comparing the disrupted and non-disrupted. The results consistently reaffirm the main findings, highlighting the importance of interventions to mitigate disadvantages associated with migration timing. In particular, policies should focus on children who experience migration during their schooling years and ensure supportive educational environments to minimize potential disruptions.",

          "abstract": "International migration systems are, usually, addressed from the perspective of networks between migration flows that have countries of origin and destination as units of analysis. This paper proposes a complementary approach in which the units restricting migration networks are national sub‐regions at origin and countries at destination. What gives specificity to such migration systems based on a kind of conditional selectivity of emigration? How can the validity of such systems be tested? The methodology we propose to answer such questions is applied to the case of emigration from Romania. Regions of origin and six countries of destination of recent migration are linked through flows that structure the analysed migration system. The analysis highlights changes between emigration flows to Italy, Spain, Germany, Great Britain, France and Austria, during the 2011–2021 intercensary period. Recent emigration flows are specified by reference to NUTS 3 regions, differentiated by urban and rural residential areas. Emigration contexts are highlighted by multiple regression analyses and factor analysis.",

          "authors": "Anoji Ekanayake",
          "abstract": "Since the Gulf region's economic boom in the mid‐1970s, the region has attracted Sri Lankan migrant workers of all skill levels. These workers accumulate savings that, if productively invested upon return, could support their reintegration and generate broader economic benefits. However, most studies on remittance use of Sri Lankan migrants have focused on returnee domestic workers and other workers at the lower end of the skill spectrum, overlooking higher skilled migrants who have greater investment potential. This study fills the gap by examining the use of remittances among high‐skilled, skilled and semi‐skilled returnees. Drawing on primary data from seven key informant interviews, 21 in‐depth interviews and a survey of 205 returnee migrants, the research reveals that across the skill spectrum, the majority of remittances are spent on consumption and non‐productive purposes. The study identifies three key barriers to investment in sustainable income‐generating activities: consumption‐driven expenditure patterns, insufficient support for business ventures from the Sri Lankan government and structural barriers to investment in the country.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Gonzalez O'Brien, Loren Collingwood, Michael Ahn Paarlberg, Jordin Tafoya",
          "abstract": "Researchers broadly define sanctuary cities as localities with policies that limit local cooperation or participation in federal immigration enforcement, but this is often a binary definition. Existing scholarship has examined the roles that sanctuary cities play in limiting cooperation in federal immigration enforcement but has tended to rely on an inconsistent definition of what constitutes a ‘sanctuary city’. Much of the existing research also analytically treats sanctuary cities the same, regardless of the individual components of a given policy. To address these shortcomings, we draw on a content analysis of 379 municipal policies passed from 1971 to 2021, coding each policy along a seven‐point scale originally developed by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC). We draw on individual city case studies to illustrate each component of the scale and then score each locality from one to seven based on a content analysis of the policy's text. We demonstrate that policies vary in the limits they place on cooperation in federal immigration enforcement and that these limits vary geographically and temporally. We find that sanctuary policies have added new components over time, as federal immigration policies and agencies have changed, with the most comprehensive policies passed after Trump won the presidency in 2016.",

          "title": "The Strategic Politics of Cross-Border Mobility: A Typology of Migration Interdependence",
          "authors": "Gerasimos Tsourapas",
          "abstract": "How do states navigate cooperation and coercion in the governance of labor migration? This article introduces a novel framework for understanding strategic behavior in migration diplomacy, grounded in the concept of migration interdependence. It argues that state strategy is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution of exposure to the consequences of disrupted migration flows. When stronger states are more exposed, cooperation becomes rational; when stronger states are less exposed, or when weaker states possess credible alternatives, coercion becomes viable. The article develops a two-axis typology to explain these dynamics and applies it to four bilateral labor migration corridors: New Zealand–Pacific Islands, Russia–Central Asia, Gulf States–Nepal, and Malaysia–Indonesia. These cases span Global South and South–North relationships, allowing for controlled comparison across varied structural configurations. Methodologically, the article employs a focused comparative approach combining process tracing and a structured typological framework, drawing on primary and secondary sources to triangulate evidence and elucidate variation across migration corridors. It identifies four factors that condition states’ strategic options: remittance dependency, labor market reliance, migration portfolio diversification, and institutionalization. The article advances migration studies by reconceptualizing labor mobility as a site of deliberate, strategic state engagement rather than a passive byproduct of domestic pressures. Simultaneously, it enriches international relations theory by offering a nuanced understanding of how power and migration interdependence intertwine to shape state behavior within asymmetric contexts. By identifying conditions that enable coercion, the article offers a critical policy tool for anticipating and mitigating exploitative practices in migration diplomacy.",

          "abstract": "Partisanship and feelings about racial groups are increasingly linked among whites in the United States. Does this pattern extend to other Americans? To answer this question, we begin by examining trends in what has been termed “affective differentiation”—a measure of racial affect that is, in our case, the difference in ratings between one’s own group and white Americans—and partisanship to demonstrate first that affective differentiation has increased. Further, this measure of racial affect has a growing relationship with partisanship among Black and Latine Americans such that Democratic identification is associated with higher levels of affective differentiation. Next, using panel data from the two most recent presidential elections we find that the direction of influence flows from partisanship to affective differentiation. Higher levels of attachment to the Democratic Party are associated with greater affective differentiation in which respondents rate their own group more favorably than whites. In recent elections, there has been a stark polarization among political parties regarding the utilization of explicit racial rhetoric. Members of the electorate have taken notice, leading partisans to update their racial attitudes.",

However, India has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, nor formulated domestic asylum laws. While the country has made significant progress in the legal protection of LGBTIQ+ people, the benefit thereof does not extend to those with these intersectional vulnerabilities, such as queer refugees. The deteriorating political environment for refugees in the region and the denial of legal status to remain mean that those who fled their countries to avoid persecution for their identity are unable to articulate their SOGIESC even as exiles. Our article draws upon our experiences of providing legal representation to LGBTIQ+ refugees in India through the UNHCR process, and analyses the protection gaps LGBTIQ+ refugees experience in India.",

Through semi-structured interviews and surveys, this research examines how refugees perceive and respond to hazards as they navigate the process of displacement and resettlement. This pilot study incorporates participatory research, involving the delivery of hazard education sessions for newly displaced populations and engagement with community partners as integral components of its research design. We reflect on the lessons learned in cultivating relationships with community partners and integrating education in emergencies within the research framework. We emphasize the importance of cultural humility, continuous reflection on power dynamics within the research settings, and the recognition of the refugees’ agency. The field reflection advocates for participatory and community-based research that empowers displaced communities and promotes self-efficacy.",

          "authors": "Alina Esteves, Jennifer McGarrigle",
          "abstract": "There is a growing concern among different stakeholders about the relevance of respecting distinct dietary regimes and supplying food that is not only nutritious but also culturally adequate. This is particularly felt in the most diversified cities where minority groups may not have their needs catered for. This paper aims to explore the translocal halal economies that converge in the city of Lisbon and the tactics used by ordinary Muslim households to access it. Engaging with literature on cultural food adequacy, migrant infrastructures and translocalism, we argue that in this urban context—and beyond—, migrant infrastructures are a way to mobilize shared resources and overcome urban socio‐spatial inequalities. Migrant infrastructures mediate religious observance and the everyday reproduction of migrant life in the city, blurring the lines between formal and informal, religious and economic, mobile and immobile. The empirical research shows, however, that access to these infrastructures is unequal creating cleavages among Muslims along the lines of purchase power, residential patterns and urban accessibility. This differentiated access to resources is also reflected in practices that create bridges linking locales across the Muslim diasporic space at different geographical scales, ranging from the local, to the regional and to the international. Thus, through translocal and transnational practices, Portugal is also being repositioned in the halal product market chain at a global scale drawing on colonial continuities and penetration into new markets.",

          "title": "Understanding Residential Mobility in Urban China: A Comparative Analysis of Hukou Residents and Temporary Migrants in Shanghai",
          "authors": "Zhen Li, Lei Lei",
          "abstract": "As an avenue toward achieving better housing conditions and meeting individual and family needs, residential mobility is critical for migrants’ integration into the host society. Previous studies have examined the levels and determinants of residential mobility of (im)migrants and local/native residents separately, but few have directly compared the levels and determinants of mobility across these two groups or distinguished residential mobility for different reasons. Using recent data from the Shanghai Urban Neighborhood Survey, this study compares the levels and main determinants of residential mobility for work, family and housing reasons between local hukou residents and temporary migrants. Results show that migrants are much more likely to move than hukou residents, especially for employment reasons. Life‐course factors have weaker impacts on family‐related moves of migrants than those of hukou residents. There are educational gradients in housing‐related moves among hukou residents but not among migrants. Household income affects migrants’ moves to meet family needs, rather than moves to improve housing quality. Furthermore, home ownership, residential crowding, and residential duration also have different influences on residential mobility between migrants and hukou r esidents. Our results contribute to on‐going policy discussions to promote residential stability of temporary migrants in China.",

          "authors": "Rosa Mas Giralt, Ruth Evans",
          "abstract": "Heavily restricted humanitarian protection schemes, protracted waiting periods, and immobility regimes are increasingly disrupting familyhood and intra‐/intergenerational caregiving practices for many forced migrants and their extended families. This paper draws from the experiences of 16 displaced families of diverse ethnicities living in the UK with higher care needs related to disability, chronic illness and/or mental health, which have hitherto been overlooked. Integrating feminist ethics of care with the notion of ‘enforced transnationalism’, the analysis shows how displaced families are subjected to a continuum of migration, welfare, and social care policies over time which result in processes of family ‘nuclearization’ and immobility. Barriers to family visits and reunification compound limitations on welfare and social care support when families seek to fulfil transnational caring obligations. This increases the pressures on the middle and younger generations providing informal care and negatively affects families' relational wellbeing. Despite this, transnational families deploy resistance tactics through maintaining and re‐building intra‐ and intergenerational caring relationships and values of family solidarity to live ‘care‐filled lives’ in the places where they have sought sanctuary. The paper significantly deepens the theoretical and empirical scope of the concept of ‘enforced transnationalism’, bringing relational selves and care front and centre in studies of forced migration and transnational familyhood.",

          "authors": "Julia Cook, Tamara Young, Kate Senior, Jonathan Curtis",
          "abstract": "Recent scholarship has turned to the concept of ‘intergenerational belonging’ and to questions about how belonging is navigated and experienced in contexts marked by environmental challenges. This article contributes to each of these bodies of literature by considering how members of different age cohorts experience, perform and represent belonging and place attachment in a regional Australian suburb undergoing significant environmental change. It presents findings from a walking ethnography, and from two community mapping workshops conducted with members of different age cohorts. We find that, in our field site, belonging is shaped by whether one is ‘born and bred’ in the suburb or is otherwise considered a ‘blow‐in’, and that those who are deemed ‘locals’ are able to speak with authority on topics such as where the suburb ends, with this authority legitimated by their knowledge of place. However, we find that caring for and about the local environment allowed those who were not considered ‘locals’ to engage in a performance of belonging that provided them with a specific status and social role in the suburb. Ultimately, we highlight how care for and about the environment can provide a means for individuals to perform belonging, and, stemming from this environmental focus, we demonstrate how intergenerational belonging can extend beyond connections through families to also encompass broader intergenerational concerns.",

          "authors": "Sheenagh McShane, Karen Block, Rebecca Bentley",
          "abstract": "The relationship between refugee housing and well‐being extends beyond basic shelter, encompassing social, cultural and spatial dimensions. This study explores how housing is experienced and understood by former‐refugees not merely as a physical structure but as a site of meaning, identity and belonging. Drawing on Massey's relational theory of space and a multidimensional understanding of belonging, this research examines the housing aspirations of refugees through the photovoice component of a larger qualitative study on refugee housing and health in Victoria. Twenty‐one participants used photography to capture aspects of their lived experiences of housing and neighbourhoods that may have been difficult to articulate through conventional methods. A thematic analysis of workshop discussions revealed that housing aspirations extend beyond affordability and homeownership to include safety, connection, cultural fit and access to green space and local amenities. Where these aspirations were unmet, participants reported feelings of insecurity and frustration, negatively affecting their well‐being and sense of belonging. Participants' photographs and narratives revealed not only barriers to integration but also the everyday practices through which they created connections and reshaped their housing environments as relational spaces of care, connection and community.",

          "authors": "Chi Jin, Bo Li, Sylvia J. T. Jansen, Harry J. F. M. Boumeester, Peter J. Boelhouwer",
          "abstract": "Global metropolises, including first‐tier Chinese cities, are confronting unprecedented challenges of talent exodus amid escalating housing costs, competitive job markets and deteriorating urban living conditions. Traditional migration theories fall short in explaining young talents' mobility decisions, as their high human capital drives them to prioritize multidimensional considerations beyond mere economic returns. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework integrating multiple aspects of prospect theory—reference dependence, loss aversion, endowment effects and risk attitudes—to investigate young talents' settlement intentions through logistic regression analysis of survey data from 1065 professionals across Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. The research reveals that migration decisions are fundamentally shaped by asymmetric psychological evaluations: young talents demonstrate heightened sensitivity to potential losses in job prospects and housing affordability. Institutional and psychological endowments significantly enhance settlement intentions: homeownership, local hukou status and public sector employment increase staying probability, along with longer duration of residence and stronger place attachment. Notably, our findings reveal nuanced suppression effects of migration‐specific risk attitude on one's general risk attitude: while first‐tier cities attract individuals with higher general risk tolerance who are willing to embrace urban challenges, these individuals also tend to have higher migration‐specific risk tolerance, which in turn reduces their long‐term settlement intention. These insights not only advance behavioural economic understanding of talent mobility in urban areas, but also provide practical guidance for metropolitan governance. Our findings suggest that effective urban talent retention requires cities to strengthen institutional ties and guarantee stable career development rather than relying primarily on economic incentives. This approach ensures cities maintain the human capital essential for innovation and competitiveness in an era of increasing inter‐urban competition.",
