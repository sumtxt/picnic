          "title": "A systematic review of migrants’ non-employment precarity–conceptualizations by scholars and migrants’ narratives",
          "authors": "Suet Lin Hung, Chi Yuen Lai, Kwok Kin Fung",
          "abstract": "Precarity is a term capturing the migrants’ situation under globalization and migration-driven uncertainties. Many have attempted to explain the precarity in terms of employment changes, but fewer in terms of non-employment ones. A systematic review is conducted to summarize the conceptualization of migrant precarity manifested in non-employment aspects. Studies ( n = 46) from 2014 to 2024 were selected by searching through social science databases of using the keyterms of “precarity” or “precarization” or “precariat” or “precariousness” AND “migrants” or “migration”. Precarity conceptualizations were compared by migrants’ narratives to identify precarity items omitted in literature. Findings showed that migrants’ precarities suffer from typical economic, social and legal precarities. Yet, precarities of household, information and housing are understudied. Moreover, analyzation of migrants’ narratives shown mismatches to scholar’s conceptualization, which reflects a need for scholars to research with the voices of migrants to rectify the conceptualization. The review also shows a socially reproduction relationship between precarities, while multidimensional conceptualizations will help scholars’ analysis to stick consistently to migrants’ experiences. It is also recommended to research more on information, housing, and psychological precarity, apart from a need to adopt longitudinal lens into migrant precarity studies.

          "title": "The hidden power of provincial and territorial immigration programs in shaping Canada’s immigration landscape",
          "authors": "Catherine Xhardez, Danoé Tanguay",
          "abstract": "The Canadian immigration system is unique in that subnational governments play a significant role in selecting immigrants through Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs), which empower nine provinces and two territories to actively select (“nominate”) economic immigrants. Collectively, PNPs have become the country’s largest economic immigration program, but they are also the least studied, leading to a lack of understanding, transparency, and accountability. Using a subnational comparative method, this study examines 78 active subnational immigration programs ( policy outputs ), investigating policy design, requirements, and distribution of nominations in 2021–2022. We assess whether PNPs contribute to broader changes in the Canadian immigration regime. First, our analysis reveals the prevalence of employment-based streams and prearranged work as a selection criterion. Second, we show nuanced policy outputs in the progression toward a two-step system, with provincial variation in requirements for prior Canadian experience. Third, while PNPs are open to low-skilled workers, programs tailored exclusively to this group remain relatively limited. This comparative analysis reveals significant inter-provincial variation, and highlights the importance of a “disaggregated” evaluation of the migration state at the subnational level.",

          "authors": "Cecilia Schenetti, Valentina Mazzucato, Sally Wyatt, Djamila Schans",
          "abstract": "European states employ migration information campaigns (MICs) to discourage irregular migration to Europe by people from the Global South. Campaigns are justified by their initiators in various ways. On the one hand, campaigns are said to protect ‘potential migrants’ by helping them to make informed decisions (‘care’). On the other hand, campaigns respond to Europe's security objective of restricting migration flows (‘control’). Researchers have looked at various intermediaries involved in these campaigns. Yet, little attention has been given to individual European policy actors who decide on the funding and design of campaigns and how they navigate between campaigns' contradictory intentions to care for ‘potential migrants’ and to control borders. How do European campaign initiators justify the need for MICs? And what does this tell us about the migration imaginaries of those who develop migration governance measures? Based on interviews with European policymakers and campaign designers in the Netherlands and Senegal, this article examines their discursive acts of legitimation. It shows that in justifying their everyday work, they imagine themselves as humanitarian actors, and ‘potential migrants’ as depoliticized subjects in need of care. While initiators do sometimes examine campaigns critically, they build a worldview in which care is instrumental to border enforcement and in which compassion becomes a form of repressive ‘soft’ bordering.",

          "authors": "Katharine Donato, Jacobs Elizabeth, Singh Lisa, Arab Ali, Wycoff Nathan",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a special issue of International Migration Review and overviews the promise and limitations of organic data for migration research. We explain different approaches to collecting and analyzing timely open-source organic data, and how it can be integrated with traditional administrative and survey data. After identifying the promise and limitations of specific organic data sources, we offer two empirical examples that illustrate how organic data may be used in research on migration and displacement. One example uses Ukrainian-language tweets to capture changing day-to-day dynamics during the initial stages of an emerging conflict. The second examines how a significant policy change in Colombia is associated with xenophobic conversation about Venezuelan migrants using Spanish-language tweets. Together, they illustrate how organic data may be used to examine the shifting dynamics of migration and forced migration.",

          "authors": "Jochen Lingelbach",
          "abstract": "Refugee-receiving states do not live up to the universalist ideals of international refugee legislation but are selective and discriminatory. The case of Poland’s acceptance of Ukrainians while simultaneously building a border wall to keep out non-Ukrainians is an obvious case. Based on historical research on the British Empire’s policies towards European refugees, this article looks into a comparable moment when governments made an exception to their established anti-refugee policy and accepted certain groups of refugees. The British colonial administration in East Africa rejected Jewish refugees but accepted a specific group of Poles during the Second World War. This exception under war conditions was legitimized with an emphasis on the group’s gender, race, and connection to the co-belligerent Polish army. They were the white women and children of the Polish male soldiers fighting with the British against the Axis. The recent welcome for Ukrainian refugees in Poland followed similar lines of argumentation.",

          "authors": "Ditte Shapiro, Katrine Syppli Kohl, Rikke Egaa Jørgensen, Marie Sandberg",
          "abstract": "Over the past decade, a series of legal changes have intensified Denmark’s temporal governance of refugees. This development reflects a more widespread turn towards temporary protection and return across the Global North. Drawing on eleven months of fieldwork and interviews with thirty refugees in Denmark, the article applies a temporal lens to analyse how this development is experienced and navigated by refugee families subjected to conditions of prolonged uncertainty, with a focus on how it affects their intergenerational relationships. We find that temporal governance spurs three ‘temporal modalities’ that we call acceleration, entrapment, and rupture, the consequences of which refugees engage with through different tactics related to generational status and social situation. Furthering a conceptualization of displacement as ‘temporal dispossession’, the analysis shows how the temporal governance of refugee families in Denmark permeates the intimate domestic space, bringing family members out of sync, and raising well-founded fears of family separation.",

          "authors": "Tatiana Glushkova, Laura Kemppainen, Anne Kouvonen, Sirpa Wrede, Ilkka Pietilä, Teemu Kemppainen",
          "abstract": "Belonging is a fundamental human experience that plays a critical role in shaping individuals' connections to their communities. Establishing a sense of belonging to a destination society can be particularly challenging for older migrants. Neighbourhood factors and the broader regional context may influence one's sense of belonging to various communities. However, research exploring how neighbourhood‐level factors relate to different types of belonging remains limited. Using data from a population‐based study on older Russian‐speaking migrants in Finland ( n = 1082, 57% men and 43% women; mean age 63.2 years, 36% response rate) and a postal code area database (3036 postal codes on mainland Finland, with an average of 1802 residents and an average area of 112 km 2 ), we examined various types of belonging among Russian‐speaking migrants aged 50 years or older and how both individual and neighbourhood‐level factors were associated with the types of belonging. Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA) was employed to study types of belonging, and multilevel regression analysis was used to examine associations between the types and neighbourhood and individual factors that were identified. Three types of belonging were identified: belonging to the majority population, that is, ‘Finns’; belonging to Ingrian Finns; and belonging to Russian speakers. In neighbourhoods with a higher proportion of Russian speakers, belonging to Finns was weaker. Moreover, significant differences in belonging to Russian speakers were observed across regions of Finland. Thus, in regions located near the Finnish–Russian border, belonging to Russian speakers was stronger. Although neighbourhood characteristics were not associated with belonging to Ingrian Finns, individual‐level factors, such as being older, receiving income support, and having lower education levels were associated with this type of belonging. Additionally, good command of the local language contributed to belonging to Finns and weakened belonging to Russian speakers.",

          "authors": "Olena Hołubowska, Ate Poorthuis",
          "abstract": "Urban experiences are shaped by daily activities that often extend beyond residential areas, leading to opportunities for encounters with people different from us in various contexts. Such encounters can subsequently influence attitudes towards those groups, which is critical in the diverse environments of modern cities. This study explores how neighbourhoods with varying types of amenities facilitate intergroup mixing among individuals of different income levels and migration backgrounds. Using data from OpenStreetMap to characterise neighbourhoods by their amenities and mobility patterns derived from mobile phone app data of 204,567 residents of Auckland, New Zealand, we quantify the relationship between intergroup mixing and the types of amenities, or more particularly ‘spaces of encounter’, that a neighbourhood offers. Our findings reveal distinct characteristics between spaces that promote income mixing versus those that foster migration background mixing. Spaces promoting income mixing tend to have more consumption‐oriented amenities (such as bars and restaurants) and fewer shops, whereas spaces promoting mixing between migrants and locals feature more places of worship and fewer institutional settings. These insights underscore the important role that specific spaces of encounter might play within our neighbourhoods and thus carry implications for urban planning and policy aimed at enhancing social cohesion.",

          "authors": "Ilona Matysiak",
          "abstract": "This article aims to explore (im)mobility patterns of older adults living in small rural Iowa towns. The research questions addressed were focused on the older adults’ paths to their current place of residence, their plans regarding possible relocation in the future, as well as how these are intertwined, given the life course perspective. The data are drawn from in‐depth interviews conducted with 25 residents aged 65 years and over in four rural Iowa communities. Insights are also gained from 29 interviews with local stakeholders from these towns. The analysis shows that the great majority of older adults plan on staying put due to a mixture of mostly social, functional and biographical aspects of place attachment. However, these are more or less significant depending on older interviewees’ past mobility experiences. Only a few do not exclude relocation in the future. These outcomes provide a new perspective regarding classical models of older adults’ mobility over the life course.",

          "authors": "Pingyang Liu, Aixi Han, Yunzhi Yuan",
          "abstract": "The importance of organizational leadership has been widely acknowledged, while the nuances, roles and the mechanisms of community leadership, as a unique bottom‐up type, have been inefficiently explored, especially in rural spaces under the context of population hollowing out. Based on the practices of pilot villages in Shanghai, China, this study delves into the intricate roles of rural community leadership, elucidating its contributions to the implementation of rural revitalization initiatives. Identified into three dimensions of leading and demonstrating, mobilization and organization, and reputation and credibility, and analyzed via Probit models, rural community leadership are found to be critical for the revitalization of villages with hollowing out population. All three dimensions significantly influence rural revitalization outcomes, with varying moderating effects on other key factors, such as stakeholder involvement and policy implementation. Notably, the capability of mobilization and organization emerges as paramount for short‐term outcomes, reputation and credibility becomes increasingly crucial for long‐term success, while the leading and demonstrating capability tends to be the bottom‐line requirement for community leaders. This study highlights the increasing importance of cultivating rural community leadership within the left‐behind population for rural development, and the need for sustained efforts to enable community leaders to maximize their talents.",
