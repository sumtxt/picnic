          "authors": "Lucrezia Canzutti",
          "abstract": "The digitisation of borders has permeated academic and political debates, the image of ‘digital fortress Europe’ becoming normalised and taken for granted. This ‘taken for grantedness’, however, clashes with the reality on the ground and has important implications for migrants' rights and credibility. This paper seeks to supplement accounts that foreground the assumed omnipresence of digital technologies with an analysis of their concomitant absence. Drawing on fieldwork in Italy, it demonstrates how the discourse around digital borders sustains states' ‘epistemic borderwork’ and erases migrants' knowledge and rights claims. Overall, the paper reflects on which technologies are made absent and present at the EU borders, and how both absence and presence are imbricated in power relations that enable new forms of violence and reactivate legacies of subordination and domination.",

          "authors": "Didier Bigo",
          "abstract": "This article argues that there is no single form of security that reduces insecurity but rather forms of (in)security that are contradictory and mutually destructive. This is the case between traditional liberal security, based on evidence, the individual and the penal order, and contemporary predictive preventive security, based on ‘reasonable’ suspicion. The digitisation of data has accelerated this trend towards preventive security, which is created through the creation of specific data‐organising categories according to algorithms, the sorting out of profiles of ‘persons of concern’ ranked according to their level of danger, and the so‐called ability of artificial intelligence to predict the future behaviour of individuals in order to place some of them under surveillance. This applies not only to terrorists or criminals, but also to many international travellers, making their use banal. The databases of the European agency EU‐LISA will help to show the functioning of this new ‘dispositif’ of suspicion, which endangers democratic politics.",

          "abstract": "Enlisting states of origin or transit to prevent exit from their own territory has become a tool of extraterritorial migration control for industrialised liberal democratic states. This article first explores the practical erosion of the right to leave any country since the demise of communism, focusing on arrangements between EU member states and select African states of origin or transit. I then document the legitimating function performed by the anti‐smuggling and search and rescue regimes in effacing the human right to leave. I conclude by situating exit restrictions in a wider European project of promoting, building and supporting border infrastructure in the name of development and capacity building in select African countries. This permits reflection on what the contemporary use of exit restrictions signifies for the equation of border control and sovereignty.",

          "authors": "Eslam ElBahlawan, Mawa Mohamed",
          "abstract": "This article examines the everyday experiences of the Egyptian minority in Milan, Italy, focusing on challenges arising from the lack of formal recognition for their religious affiliations—Islam and Coptic Orthodoxy—which are central to their ethnic identity. Drawing on Talal Asad’s notion of recognition, Edward Said’s critique of Orientalism, and Nelson Maldonado-Torres’ coloniality framework, it critiques how European policies conflate secularization with security, marginalizing non-European communities. Italy’s legal system highlights this tension: while de jure constitutional protections guarantee religious freedom, de facto bureaucratic and political barriers exclude minority faiths from equal standing. Egyptian migrants must navigate this imbalance, where theoretical rights rarely translate into practical access, forcing them to continually adapt their religious and ethnic identities in a marginalizing society. The article shows how religious invisibility sustains marginalization, contrasting Europe’s multicultural ideals with exclusionary practices. It reveals how colonial legacies shape migrant experiences and restrict rights.",

          "authors": "Christopher D. Berk",
          "abstract": "This article examines the dynamics of youth identity formation at a boarding school for “at-risk” children. The school prepares its young boarders for adulthood through systematic intervention in their everyday cultural practices. By inducing a state of social liminality, or felt in-betweenness, the school seeks to guide its students—mainly youth of color—towards particular social roles, norms, and beliefs. However, children respond and adapt to this ambivalence, which leads to lasting effects as they transition into young adulthood. Utilizing extensive fieldwork and longitudinal data, the analysis employs an interpretive approach to provide context-specific insights into these dynamics. The study details the cultural interventions observed in 2013-14 and revisits the children, now young adults, a decade later, to understand the policy and ethical implications of those interventions. In so doing, this study contributes to understanding the complex interaction between authority, conformity, and identity management within institutions devoted to transforming the lives of children at the social margins.",

          "authors": "Nigel Walford",
          "abstract": "Postal geography is increasingly used to define spatial units for data collection and statistical reporting in British population censuses. There has been a shift from defining a single set of spatial units for each census to creating areas with greater consistency across censuses using artificial polygons around collections of postcoded addresses. However, the question remains whether creating new zones for the purpose of reporting aggregate statistics can feasibly be carried out by starting from individual addresses rather than postcode units, while at the same time preserving the confidentiality of households and individuals. Although the issues could be approached by using modelled data derived from modern censuses, the approach adopted here has been to use genuine household and individual level data from the 1911 Census for addresses that have been georeferenced in a selection of local authorities. Testing the difference between address‐ and postcode‐based new zones was carried out by aggregating from two sets of Thiessen polygon building blocks, one for individual 1911 census addresses and the other for these addresses grouped within modern unit postcode boundaries. The sets of new zones were assessed by measures of target population attainment, homogeneity and shape compactness and in respect of how they allocated different percentages of the addresses to the same spatial unit. People and households were distributed at lower densities across new zones that occurred in relatively unpopulated areas, although even in more densely inhabited parts of the study areas some people and households were colocated in the same new zones produced from the two starting sets of different Thiessen polygons.",
