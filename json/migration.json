          "title": "Migration aspirations and their realisation: a configurational driver analysis of 26 African and Asian research areas",
          "authors": "Mathias Czaika, Zina Weisner",
          "abstract": "‘Tackling the root causes’ of migration has emerged as a central strategy for the European Union to manage the movements of people from middle- or low-income countries. While the effectiveness of this approach remains a subject of debate, the field of migration studies has highlighted the interplay of multiple migration drivers, or driver complexes, rather than singled out'root causes'. However, empirical research has yet to assess the specific configurations and interactions of these driver complexes across diverse emigration contexts, and also, whether policy interventions have any impact in reducing migration aspirations and actual emigration. This paper employs Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to assess the complexities surrounding migration aspirations and realizations in 26 research areas spanning ten African and Asian countries. Following the two-step model of migration, the study identifies necessary and sufficient conditions explaining regional disparities in emigration aspirations and intensity. The analysis explores how structural hardships such as poverty, poor livelihoods, insecurity, conflict, weak governance, and environmental stress interact with socio-cultural factors such as transnational ties and cultures of migration. We find that such hardships alone are not necessary or sufficient for driving migration aspirations or actual out-migration. Migration aspirations are influenced by a complex interplay of socio-cultural and political-economic factors. Within this dynamic, both migration networks and international ties as well as the relative absence of migration-discouraging policies play central roles. At the same time, even a deeply rooted culture of migration and strong migration aspirations are per se not sufficient in generating high levels of out-migration.",

          "authors": "Gerasimos Tsourapas",
          "abstract": "Migration diplomacy has become a critical element of contemporary geopolitics, yet its complex dimensions remain underexplored. This article introduces a novel three‐level game framework to examine how foreign policy strategies leverage cross‐border mobility across domestic, bilateral and supranational dimensions. The 2020 Greek–Turkish border crisis serves as a case study to investigate how domestic political imperatives, bilateral disputes and engagement with European institutions shaped the two government' strategies. The study integrates process tracing with diverse multi‐source data – including policy documents, media analysis and stakeholder interviews – to demonstrate how migration crises function as instruments of geopolitical contestation. This framework is also applied to cases, such as Morocco–Spain, Tunisia–EU and Belarus–EU, advancing theoretical and empirical understandings of migration diplomacy. The article provides fresh insights into the interplay between domestic politics, bilateral relations and supranational governance, illustrating how migration diplomacy is both a reflection and a driver of contemporary power dynamics in global geopolitics.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I engage with the return migration and ageing nexus from an intergenerational vantage point. I build on the analytical power of emotions to argue for paying careful attention to the salient emotional dimensions of migration and what I term the emotional politics of return migration. I discuss the relationality, multiple temporalities and elusiveness of return by drawing on in‐depth interviews and ethnographic observations with transnational families: specifically, the adult offspring who have emigrated to the United States – where they experience legal uncertainty – and their ageing parents in Brazil. The article contributes to scholarship on return migration and ageing in two ways. First, by emphasizing a temporal dimension where the emotional politics of return migration take shape through uneven rhythms, frequencies and intensities of contact, and second, by underscoring an intersubjective, familial component, where the return is mediated through bodily interaction, digital technologies and discourses of emotivity.",

          "abstract": "SOGI asylum has received increasing political and academic attention. Focusing on refugee status determination, academics have emphasized how normative representations of sexual and gender minorities in Northern asylum institutions lead to the exclusion of many SOGI asylum applicants. To broaden the understanding of queer people’s experiences of forced migration and asylum, this paper shifts attention to what happens just before the asylum examination, namely the fact of applying for SOGI asylum itself. Based on 3 years’ ethnographic fieldwork, this research investigates how queer exiles come to apply for SOGI asylum in France. By emphasizing the variety of factors, besides their experiences of persecution, leading them to apply for SOGI asylum, this paper decompartmentalizes asylum from below, denaturalizing the category of LGBT+ refugees by reinserting the asylum application into more general and diversified individual experiences of migration. Doing so, it also counters liberationist and humanitarian narratives associated with SOGI asylum seekers.",

          "authors": "Tom Wilson, Jeromey Temple, Elin Charles‐Edwards",
          "abstract": "In common with many other advanced economies, Australia is experiencing a crisis of worsening housing affordability. While some of the causes are longstanding, the crisis comes at a time of very high population growth driven by record high net immigration. This paper considers what the underlying demographic demand for housing, as expressed by the number of households, is likely to be over the next few years and then further ahead out to 2041. Particular attention is paid to the 2024–29 period because the Australian Government has announced a policy to build an additional 1.2 million new dwellings during this time. Using an updated version of the sequential propensity household projection model, household projections for 15 major regions of Australia were prepared for the period 2021–2041. Projected growth in the number of households was decomposed to reveal the contributions of various demographic and living arrangement drivers of growth. Alternative futures were considered using scenarios which take into account possible variations in both population and household variables. The projection results demonstrate the dominance of population growth in increasing household numbers, with additional growth contributed by population age structure change, while likely living arrangement trends will operate to dampen growth. Even considering alternative high growth futures, household growth over the 2024–29 period at the national scale is likely to be lower than 1.2 million. However, growth will vary considerably across the 15 regions, underscoring the need for housing supply to match geographical variations in household growth.",

          "authors": "Karol Korczyński, Katarzyna Kajdanek",
          "abstract": "The COVID‐19 pandemic had a profound spatial impact on economic, cultural and social life, notably altering mobility, including internal migration. Many studies to date looked into various aspects of internal migration patterns after the pandemic outbreak. However, little research has been focused on the area of Central and Eastern Europe. The aim of the paper is to empirically examine the quantitative perspective of registered inter‐municipal migrations in Poland between 2017 and 2023. Specifically, the study sought to determine how the scale and directions of internal migrations in Poland changed across three distinct periods: (1) pre‐pandemic (2017–2019); (2) during the initial COVID‐19 response (2020); (3) post‐restrictions period (2021–2023). We ask to what extent the dominant internal migration trends (depopulation of rural areas and growth in metropolitan areas fuelled by strong suburbanisation trends) were affected during COVID‐19 compared to preceding years. We examine this through analysis of migration intensity, net‐migration rates and the predominance of urban and rural origins and destinations, using population register data on annual flows between municipalities. We discover that the COVID‐19 pandemic resulted in a decrease of migration intensity in 2020 as well as in the following years compared to 2017–2019, with lower net‐migration rates in suburban areas and greater in non‐metropolitan peripheries.",

          "abstract": "The article deals with the topic of the forced migration of Ukrainian academics who left their homeland after the onset of Russia's full‐scale aggression on 24th February 2022. It is based on the results of a qualitative study of scholars who settled in different foreign destinations and examines their migration trajectories from both a spatial and temporal perspective as well as from the point of view of individual decision making. Combining forced migration research with existing scholarship on academic mobility, it tracks scholars’ long journeys to their places of asylum, distinguishing two principal academic trajectories undertaken by Ukrainian academics: continuing to work remotely for Ukrainian institutions and seeking academic positions abroad. The article demonstrates that the most common life strategy of displaced Ukrainian researchers involves the maintenance of dense transnational networks—principally professional links with Ukrainian universities—while simultaneously looking for opportunities abroad. This dual strategy has led to distinct outcomes compared to previously studied cases of forced migration of academics.",
