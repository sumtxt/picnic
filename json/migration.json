          "authors": "Jiaqi M. Liu, Clare Xiaoqian Wan",
          "abstract": "By examining China’s refugee policies from 1949 to 1982, this article demonstrates how the Chinese state redefined “return” and “refugee” to serve shifting political objectives. While China is often perceived as a source, rather than a host, of asylum seekers, it hosted over 320,000 displaced migrants—primarily ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asia—during the Cold War. Through a systematic discourse analysis of 382 People’s Daily articles, we identify four state narratives—diaspora, diplomatic tool, ideological sanctuary, and legal duty—that structured how China labeled displaced migrants, interpreted their sentiments, and determined their settlement. These models evolved dynamically: from the 1950s to the late 1970s, China framed displaced migrants as both diasporic returnees and victims of foreign persecution to bolster its legitimacy. During the Cultural Revolution, they were recast as Maoist returnees seeking ideological redemption. By 1978, the state invoked international legal norms by portraying them as “refugees” to secure global assistance amid the Indochinese refugee crisis. We argue that China’s refugee discourse functioned as a flexible political instrument that unsettled rigid distinctions between voluntary and forced migration. Our findings advance a constructivist understanding of migration categories and offer a historically grounded critique of refugee politics beyond Western-centric Cold War narratives.",

          "authors": "Minakshi Keeni, Nina Takashino",
          "abstract": "This study examines the influence of encampment policies on host community perceptions towards Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and Nepal, with an emphasis on how these perceptions shape the future of the refugees. Bangladesh, which has implemented an encampment policy, contrasts with Nepal, where no such policy exists. The research employs ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to evaluate host community attitudes towards government policies, citizenship for newborns, and access to essential services like healthcare, jobs, education, and social security. The findings reveal that in Bangladesh, wealthier community members perceive less economic competition from refugees, particularly in job markets, due to the restrictions imposed by the encampment policy. However, social media in Bangladesh exacerbates negative perceptions, particularly concerning citizenship for Rohingya newborns, potentially hindering social cohesion. In Nepal, the absence of an encampment policy correlates with more negative perceptions among younger and economically vulnerable groups, who view refugees as competitors for limited resources. The study concludes that while encampment policies may mitigate immediate economic tensions, they risk deepening social divisions. Conversely, the lack of such policies in Nepal may lead to heightened resource competition and social tension. The research highlights the need for adaptive policy strategies that balance economic integration with social cohesion, ensuring sustainable refugee-host relations in both countries.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Grossman",
          "abstract": "Militarism is a discourse that glorifies soldiers and treats military service as a key component of full citizenship. This article contends that states can project militaristic discourse onto citizens living outside their territory, thus creating an extraterritorial variant of militarism. When home-state elites construct overseas citizens as soldiers, they evaluate them based on their military record or their potential as prospective soldiers. The paradigmatic case of Israel reveals three forms of extraterritorial militarism: constructing citizens abroad as non-soldiers, past soldiers, or future soldiers. A discourse analysis of parliamentary debates illustrates how Israeli elites framed those emigrants and children of emigrants who served or were willing to serve in the Israel Defense Forces as better extraterritorial citizens than those who did not or would not serve. Additionally, the article examines who is excluded from the discourse of extraterritorial militarism in Israel, and how and why this discourse has changed over time.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to examine the experiences and challenges faced by preschool teachers in Turkey while working with refugee children. Adopting a phenomenological design as part of qualitative methodology, the study draws on inductive analysis to interpret data from focus group interviews with three teachers who work with refugee children. The findings reveal that teachers experience a sense of inadequacy due to language barriers and cultural differences, which complicate classroom management. Furthermore, the disconnect between the educational programme and practical realities, difficulties in implementation, lack of administrative support, unsuitable physical environments, insufficient materials and hygiene issues negatively impact the teaching and learning process. In conclusion, it is recommended that educational programmes be revised to address language and cultural adaptation, that improvements be made to physical environmental conditions, that administrative support be strengthened and that teacher training processes be adapted to meet the needs of refugee children.",

          "abstract": "The existing model for health provision in refugee camps is not fit for purpose, especially for protracted displacement. As individuals are increasingly displaced beyond the temporary period for which camps are designed, it is critical that we reimagine care provision in such settings and give increased attention to individuals' dynamic and complex needs throughout their displacement. This Commentary reflects ongoing discussions from an interdisciplinary group that began at a 2024 workshop in Cairo, Egypt. As numerous challenges, including defunding and division between refugee and host communities, continue to worsen in the current political climate, it is imperative that we critically examine how our current systems for health provision in displacement settings can be made more ethical, sustainable and integrated.",

          "abstract": "Do negative perceptions of droughts increase individual's preparedness to migrate across national borders and if so, does institutional trust mediate such relationship? Only a small number of studies suggest that drought perceptions increase international migration. Yet, these insights remain to be empirically tested in Africa using a large‐ N study. We examine this claim and explore if trust in institutions can mediate this relationship. To explore this, we distinguish between trust in partial institutions that enact laws and policies, trust in impartial institutions that enforce policies and generalised in all institutions designed to create and enforce laws on the intent to emigrate. We aim to fill both gaps within the literature by using survey data across Africa between 2016 and 2018. Our results suggest that perceived intensification of drought severity over time is a motivating factor for emigration; albeit we also find robust evidence that trust in partial institutions can mediate this relationship.",

          "title": "How Transit Countries Become Refugee Destinations: Insights From Central and Eastern Europe",
          "authors": "Ciprian Panzaru, Liliana Harding",
          "abstract": "This study examines how refugees' destination preferences evolve during transit, focusing on three Central and Eastern European countries—Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary—traditionally regarded as ‘transit only’ prior to the Ukraine refugee crisis. Using a mixed‐methods approach, we first analyse 2252 observations from the International Organisation for Migration's Flow Monitoring Surveys to identify the main factors influencing changes in destination choices. We then complement these findings with qualitative data from focus groups with 16 asylum seekers in Romania to explore these dynamics in depth. Our results show that prioritising safety significantly increases the likelihood of asylum seekers reconsidering a transit country as a potential destination. Other influential factors include asylum conditions, migration costs, and educational background, with more educated individuals more likely to revise initial plans. Although our primary focus is on asylum seekers, we find that high migration costs also affect decisions, suggesting a need to ‘recover’ investments through settlement in more stable or economically attractive countries. The qualitative findings support the quantitative results, highlighting the role of legal stability, social networks, and perceived opportunity in shifting preferences. Overall, the study suggests that under certain conditions, transit countries can become viable destinations and supports the application of bounded rationality and human capital theory in understanding refugee decision‐making.",

          "authors": "Lamis Abdelaaty, Scott Blinder, Rebecca Hamlin",
          "abstract": "Which arguments for refugee admissions are most persuasive to publics in receiving states? Some refugee scholars and advocates insist that the way to maximize support for refugee admissions is to emphasize their instrumental economic benefit to receiving states. Others prefer arguments based in legal or moral obligations, arguing that economic arguments risk undermining support for the most vulnerable or needy refugees. In this article, we assess whether and how economic, legal, and moral arguments affect Americans’ support for refugee admissions, and which types of refugees they prefer to admit. We report results from a nationally representative survey in the United States ( N = 1,297), with an embedded survey experiment and conjoint decision task. We find that the moral argument led to more support for refugee admissions, while the legal argument increased support only among non-Republicans, and the economic argument had no discernible impact. In the conjoint task, the economic argument increased preferences for economically productive potential refugees, but in a way that focused on lower-status occupations. Our findings suggest that while the economic argument may not reduce support, other approaches are more likely to increase Americans’ support for refugees.",

          "authors": "Gianluca Iazzolino, Eleonora Celoria, Amarilli Varesio",
          "abstract": "Our article uses a socio-legal lens to examine the construction of precarity among migrant food delivery workers in Turin, Italy. We argue that the Italian migration system, and the way it is implemented, narrows the range of sources of income, and pushes migrants into a condition of liminal legality, formatting the malleable workforce upon which food delivery platforms deploy their biopower. We thus suggest that the commodification of migrant labor in the platform food delivery sector in Turin, while driven by platform logics, is rooted in, and compounded by, the contradictions and opacity of the Italian immigration regime. We thus advance the novel concept of algorithmic–bureaucratic precarization which allows an understanding of how the interaction of the legal and the digital causes migrant workers to be held on the outermost margins of employment. By drawing on ethnographic data collected during the Covid-19 pandemic, we chart the growing centrality of food delivery platforms in the political economy of migration. In so doing, we show how the interaction between shifting migration policies, information asymmetries of digital platforms and legal loopholes exacerbates the socio-economic vulnerability of migrant workers. We unpack algorithmic–bureaucratic precarization by describing the entanglement of legal and procedural failures that illegalize migrants and asylum seekers and put them at risk of exploitation. Through the specific case of migrant food delivery workers in Turin, we contribute to the legal geography literature on precarization by highlighting how the platform economy is reshaping the nexus of neoliberal flexibilization and restrictive migration policies.",

Participants were 112 adolescents in seventh to ninth grades from labor migrants’ or asylum seekers’ families attending school in Tel Aviv, Israel. They completed measures of mental health, acculturation, social support, and self-efficacy. No differences emerged between groups in mental health or acculturation. Compared to Israeli norms, participants showed high rates of abnormal mental health scores. Separated acculturation predicted lower hyperactivity, integrated acculturation predicted better prosocial behavior, higher social support predicted lower peer problems and better prosocial behavior, and higher self-efficacy predicted fewer peer problems. To conclude, migrant youth in Israel face significant mental health challenges, and acculturation patterns and resilience factors may influence their mental health. The study questions the use of acculturation in predicting mental health and suggests that schools should implement programs to foster empowerment and resilience in this population.",

          "abstract": "This article contributes to the limited literature on immigrant caregivers in rural Spain. Building upon interview data, it examines the question of social inclusion with a focus on employment from the perspectives of Latin American women working in private, home‐based elderly care. The interviews were conducted in small towns and villages across Teruel; a landlocked, sparsely populated, predominantly rural province in eastern Spain. For these caregivers, employment generally offered a means to improve their financial situation and, in some cases, to obtain legal residency. However, their day‐to‐day experiences varied considerably. This wide spectrum included cases of isolation and exploitation, of marginal participation in their communities, and of genuine satisfaction with their lifestyles and social relationships. With particular attention to the rural context, the article examines how inclusion and exclusion were shaped by factors such as employment conditions and personal networks. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of supportive employers in bridging the gap between caregivers and their rural communities—employers who can potentially foster inclusion to a degree not commonly experienced by other immigrant workers in the southern European countryside.",

The geographical proximity between kin reveals patterns of potential support networks and is associated with subnational heterogeneities in both family solidarity norms and existing support needs. Using data on generations born between 1951 and 1966 ( N = 20,744 anchor‐kin dyads) from an Italian nationally representative survey (Istat “Families, social subject and life cycle” survey 2016), we provide new evidence on how geographical proximity is associated with kinship type (parents, children, or siblings) and the geographical location of the anchor generation at the province level. Our results, from three‐level random slope logistic regression models on the probability of living within a 15 km radius, show that middle‐aged Italians are more likely to live near their parents and children than to their siblings, suggesting stronger family obligations in vertical ties compared to horizontal ties. There are substantial variations across Italian provinces, with Southern areas generally characterized by closer proximity to kin, particularly to siblings and parents, compared to Northern areas. The geographical spread of kin across Southern and Northern areas is partially explained by traditional family norms and high unemployment rates.",

          "authors": "Haiyang Lu, Xinyue Li, Weiliang Hu",
          "abstract": "This study examined the impact of residential segregation on the health of rural‐to‐urban migrants in China. Residential segregation in China is primarily shaped by the country's unique household registration ( hukou ) system, known as the hukou . Drawing on data from China's migrant population, our findings revealed that residential segregation significantly worsened rural‐to‐urban migrants' health and exacerbated existing health disparities. Further analysis indicated that segregation limited rural‐to‐urban migrants' access to public health services and hindered social integration, both of which likely contribute to their poorer health outcomes. Given the growing residential segregation in developing countries, our findings have significant implications for policy interventions targeted at improving migrants' health through more equitable housing policies and enhanced public services in segregated neighbourhoods.",

          "title": "The Journey Beyond Reception: Asylum Seekers’ Internal Migration Trajectories in Belgium",
          "authors": "Natacha Zimmer, Bruno Schoumaker",
          "abstract": "Research on internal migrations of asylum seekers has focused on contexts of stringent dispersal policies and has highlighted that such policies are often not in line with the subsequent settlement of refugees. However, few studies adopt a quantitative and longitudinal approach to the matter in contexts of less stringent dispersal policies. We examine the internal migrations of asylum seekers and the role of the Belgian reception system. Drawing on National Register data, we use sequence analysis to describe the internal migration trajectories of asylum‐seeking migrants who arrived between 2012 and 2016. To assess the extent to which the place of reception allocated determines their subsequent moves, we compare them with migrants having similar sociodemographic profiles but who did not apply for asylum. Results show that asylum seekers are initially more dispersed across Belgium's territory compared to non‐asylum seekers and are overrepresented in rural areas and Wallonia. Their residential patterns later converge to those of non‐asylum seekers, with a concentration in urban Flanders and Brussels. Nonetheless, we find evidence that being assigned to a rural reception place at arrival slightly increases the chances of staying in rural municipalities. Additionally, being allocated to a reception place in one region significantly reduces the chances of moving to the opposite region. Although the Belgian reception system differs from countries often studied, the mismatch between reception policy and subsequent settlement is still observed, “delaying settlement in urban areas”.",

          "title": "Evolving Patterns of Ethnic Segregation in English Schools: A Decomposition Analysis",
          "authors": "Yiyang Gao",
          "abstract": "The proportion of ethnic minority pupils in English schools has seen a marked increase since the 2000s, now comprising about a third of the state school population. This demographic shift, influenced by factors like birth rates, immigration, and age structures, has significantly diversified the ethnic and linguistic landscape in schools. This paper seeks to understand the effect of this change on ethnic segregation in schools, particularly considering the complex interplay of demographics, residential patterns, and education policies. Despite common perceptions of increasing segregation, research suggests a more nuanced reality. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of ethnic segregation trends in English schools over the past two decades, focusing on multi‐group and multi‐scale perspectives. Employing the decomposable entropy‐based measures, the research examines how evolving demographics affect segregation patterns. Findings reveal a general decline in between‐school segregation, with notable geographical variations. London shows decreased statistical segregation at the school level. In contrast, areas like Yorkshire maintain persistently high levels of ethnic segregation. The study also scrutinises the effect of education reforms like academisation, indicating minimal changes in ethnic composition during conversion to academies, yet highlighting some academies' less representative ethnic makeup compared to other schools. This paper contributes to the understanding of ethnic segregation in education, highlighting the complexities and regional disparities, and challenges prevailing notions by showcasing the multifaceted nature of ethnic diversity and segregation in English schools.",

          "authors": "Gregor Schäfer, Claire Maxwell",
          "abstract": "As the number of high‐skilled migrants (HSM) increases worldwide, the number migrating to medium‐sized capitals is also growing. While HSM neighbourhood choices have been sparsely researched, this study focuses in on how the atmospheres of these neighbourhoods lead HSM to feeling included or excluded. Using a relational spatial perspective, with an emphasis on atmospheres, sensing and spacing and drawing on 54 in‐depth interviews and map tasks, the study identifies three types of neighbourhood atmospheres: (1) new international neighbourhoods characterized by ongoing development and international diversity, fostering feelings of inclusion; (2) established Danish neighbourhoods marked by exclusivity and socio‐symbolic boundary maintenance, often leading to a feeling of exclusion; and (3) established multicultural neighbourhoods that resemble more global cities in their diversity, providing familiarity and conditional inclusion. The findings highlight the importance of understanding neighbourhoods as relational spaces in which HSM not only reside, but also actively shape the space. The findings highlight the importance of understanding neighbourhoods as relational spaces in which HSM not only reside, but also actively shape the space.",

          "title": "How Economic Inequalities Shape International Migration Aspirations: A Multilevel Analysis of Perceptions and Context",
          "authors": "Nicolás Caso, Jørgen Carling, Mathias Czaika, Jessica Hagen‐Zanker",
          "abstract": "Economic inequality between countries has long been recognized as a key driver of international migration. However, inequality within communities of origin has received far less attention in the literature. This article addresses this gap by focusing on the determinants of international migration aspirations, challenging existing findings, and contributing to the expanding body of research on the inequality‐migration nexus. Leveraging a novel data set from 25 communities in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, this study makes four key contributions. First, we distinguish between perceived and objective measures of wealth and inequality, exploring how each is associated with international migration aspirations. Second, we identify the specific wealth groups most sensitive to inequality and examine how their migration aspirations vary according to both individual wealth levels and the broader context of community‐level inequality. Third, our multi‐level modelling approach enables a nuanced comparison of subjective and objective measures of wealth and inequality at both individual and community levels. Finally, our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in both perceived and observed wealth inequality within countries, underscoring the need for localized analyses that move beyond cross‐country comparisons to better understand how inequality shapes migration dynamics.",
