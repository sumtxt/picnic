          "title": "From shared experiences of gendered racism to converging interpretations? Exploring the formation of a decolonial standpoint by women of Moroccan descent in postcolonial France",
          "authors": "Nina Sahraoui",
          "abstract": "This article invites a dialogue between decolonial perspectives on diasporas and feminist standpoint theories by exploring processes of standpoint formation by women of Moroccan descent who grew up in postcolonial France. The article draws on 18 interviews with women aged in their 20s to their 40s, as well as a long-term engagement with these questions through ‘patchwork ethnography’. While emphasising that these women were neither exposed to identical experiences nor have the same worldviews, the article shows that they have navigated a set of shared experiences that pertain to their social position and that they are thus aware of the manifestations in their everyday lives and of the workings of gendered and racialised social hierarchies that affect them. The article explores participants’ experiences of racism and of its gendered inflections; the formation of ‘shared angles of visions’ (Hill Collins, 1997) around specific issues as a result; and finally, participants’ assessments of the different terms used to describe them in public and in everyday discourses. The article seeks to contribute to thinking through empirically the formation of an epistemological standpoint at the crossroads of feminist and decolonial approaches.",

          "title": "“Do good and talk about it”: informal representation and migrant-led civil society organizations’ mediation between low-wage labor migrants and state institutions in the GCC countries",
          "authors": "Mira Burmeister-Rudolph",
          "abstract": "Low-wage labor migrants experience major human and working rights abuses in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries despite national labor laws and signatures to various human rights conventions. On paper, India has established an institutional framework of transnational social protection for its officially estimated 5.5 million low-wage workers migrating to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, e.g., financial emergency support, repatriation services, and walk-in centers. However, migrants in low-wage employment often cannot access substantive social rights in practice. Indian upper/middle-class migrant civil society groups mediate their access to Indian embassies’ services and the destination countries’ state institutions. The realization of social rights via informal, third-party representation stems from a representational disjuncture between low-wage labor migrants and the Indian state, which is rooted in their historical socioeconomic marginalization, limitations of the formal political system, and the constitutive role of informality in shaping and structuring citizen-state interactions in India. Through the lens of Piper and von Lieres’ (2015) concept of mediated citizenship and based on data from semi-structured interviews and participant observation of migrant support networks in the Gulf countries, this article examines why mediation takes place and how volunteers speak and take action for marginalized migrants in low-wage employment and consequences of mediation. It argues that migrant volunteer organizations and individuals are powerful stakeholders in the migration governance in the GCC region, as they possess leverage over who has (better) access to state institutions and the provision of social and human rights. Their status as intermediaries underlines the disaggregation of Indian citizenship along class and caste lines, which can be (mis)-used by mediators to pursue their interests, resulting in ambiguous effects. The article contributes to perspectives on migration governance in the GCC region, transnational social policies, and migrant volunteering.",

          "abstract": "This article draws upon qualitative and quantitative data from Uganda to explore the ways in which mobility supports the livelihoods of refugees in rural settlements. It shows how, under conditions of extreme precarity and against the background of gradual reductions in humanitarian aid, refugees resort to short distance ‘survivalist mobilities’ underpinned by economic desperation. While trips to urban areas are rare and infrequent, refugees regularly move out of the settlements to access firewood, vegetation, and farmland and to engage in casual labour and petty trade. Such activities enable day-to-day survival, but there are structural constraints that prevent them from becoming sustainable livelihoods that allow for stability or growth. The article challenges the common description of mobility in policy and scholarly discourse as empowering, natural, and essential for the socio-economic progress of refugees, as well as some of the assumptions underpinning current refugee ‘self-reliance’ policies in Uganda.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the experiences of thirty-two refugee mothers who fled Ukraine with their children to Germany—to Berlin and Frankfurt/Oder—this article traces the co-constitutive relationship of displacement and motherhood through the angle of temporality. First, it uncovers how displacement in motherhood is defined by mothers’ urge and urgency to protect their children. Second, it shows how refugee mothers utilize different forms of ‘active waiting’ to rebuild their lives in search of stability for themselves and their children and affectively deal with the trauma of multiple losses. Last but not least, motherhood in displacement generates new forms of maternal subjectivity as the interlocutors ‘spend their time’ to patch the ruptures in their lives for the sake of their children, not only alone but also together with other refugee mothers through digital means. Negotiating motherhood thus provides room to productively navigate a temporal disorientation caused by the displacement.",

          "abstract": "The article draws on the concept of legal infrastructures and infrastructuring processes in the context of the ongoing discussion on the (legal) framing of environmental migration. It lays out why the entanglement of empirical and normative indeterminacy in environmental migration forces opens the door to a transdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective. It explores how framing environmental migration in terms of legal mobility infrastructures or, rather, of the legal infrastructuring of (global) mobility can help transcend the legal impasse that currently still surrounds it. It draws on previous work on entangled mobility regimes in Latin America, most notably in the context of the Venezuelan refugee crisis as of 2015 and on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the border regime in Brazil. Some of the phenomena observed in these contexts provide valuable insights into the logic of the legal infrastructuring of mobility and into how the environment/displacement nexus might be infrastructured in a region that is one of the hotspots of the climate crisis.",

          "authors": "Haruka Kato",
          "abstract": "During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, many urban planners focused on urban exodus. However, a research gap exists as to whether the spread of the infection affected changes in the migration destination determinants of family households. This study aims to clarify the shifting determinants of the migration destinations of family households with children who migrated from the urban centre of the Japanese metropolitan areas because of the spread of the infection during the pandemic. This study adopted a life‐course perspective of the shift in migration destination determinants from the pre‐pandemic to the pandemic periods. The participants were recruited through a web‐based questionnaire survey. As a result, this study concluded that family households with children who mentioned the spread of COVID‐19 infection as a migration motive exhibited significant shifts in their migration destination determinants, emphasising the importance of social interaction‐related factors. The social interaction factors are the favorability of communities, community ties, returning to their hometown, and proximity to relatives. Conversely, the influence of work, living environment, and housing factors on family migration did not change much from the pre‐pandemic to the pandemic periods. This means that the pandemic did not affect migration motives related to work, the living environment, and housing. Therefore, the unique contribution of this study lies in its revelation of the temporal precedence of shifts in the prioritisation of social interaction determinants from pre‐pandemic to pandemic periods. Our findings suggest that they might migrated from urban centres to other cities that offer opportunities for social interaction.",

          "authors": "Domenico Parisi, Daniel T. Lichter, Shrinidhi Ambinakudige, Christian Kelly Scott",
          "abstract": "America's municipalities, as political actors, have become the cultural arena for changes in Black social integration and inclusion. Growing racial diversity presumably offers new opportunities for residential inclusion, resulting in less segregation, in an increasingly pluralistic and multiethnic society. This study examines patterns of Black segregation from Whites and non‐Blacks across America's increasingly multiracial municipalities over the last four decades. Our results reveal high, yet steep decline in Black segregation from Whites since 1990, as measured by the index of dissimilarity (D), decreasing from 77 to 64. However, Black–White segregation remains exceptionally high compared to other racial groups. Black segregation from Hispanics has also declined since 1990, but segregation from Asians has changed very little. In metro municipalities, fringe suburbs pose serious challenges for Black integration, suggesting new bastions of segregation. Nonmetro municipalities, particularly county seats, still show higher levels of segregation, reflecting enduring social structures that impede racial mixing. Fixed‐effects models that control for unobserved municipal‐period effects indicate that observed changes in the predictors cannot fully ‘explain’ the differentials in Black segregation or the large downward trend since 1990. Racial inequalities—in income, housing and labour market opportunities—nevertheless continue to reinforce persistent Black municipal segregation from Whites and other non‐Black populations. It remains to be seen whether Black segregation will continue to decline indefinitely in a multiethnic society or evolve in new and unexpected ways as racial diversity penetrates the American landscape.",
