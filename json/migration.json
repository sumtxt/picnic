          "title": "The political economy of immigrant homeownership: housing assets and conservative shifts in South Korea",
          "authors": "Seungwoo Han",
          "abstract": "This study examines how housing wealth influences the political incorporation of immigrants in South Korea, identifying asset accumulation as a key factor shaping redistributive preferences. Using nationally representative panel data, the analysis demonstrates that immigrants who acquire housing assets—whether through ownership or appreciation in property value—become less supportive of public provision directed at other foreign residents. While immigrants initially exhibit stronger support for state intervention, greater exposure to the housing market is associated with a growing perception that existing government support is adequate and a reduced inclination to endorse expanded immigrant-targeted spending. These shifts reflect not a uniform turn toward conservatism, but a reconfiguration of political attitudes shaped by economic security, social positioning, financial constraints, and the redrawing of intra-group boundaries. In South Korea’s asset-based welfare regime, housing functions not only as a source of private stability but also as a mechanism that mediates immigrants’ evolving relationship to the state and to other immigrant groups. By situating these dynamics within a non-Western context, this study contributes to broader debates on immigration, housing, and the stratifying effects of economic incorporation.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the causal effects of the massive Syrian refugee inflow on natives’ health outcomes using data from the Turkish Income and Living Conditions Survey. We address endogeneity issues raised by refugees’ location preferences by implementing a two-stage least squares estimation method using a distance-based instrument. We find that the refugee inflow improved the health of high-skilled and employed males, whereas the effects on low-skilled native males are insignificant. We find no evidence of a significant health effect for females. We also investigate the potential channels through which refugees can affect natives’ health outcomes, and show evidence that the improvements in high-skilled males’ working conditions and reduced probability of finding a job for low-skilled males drive our results.",

          "authors": "Abigail Weitzman, Matthew Blanton, Gilbert Brenes Camacho",
          "abstract": "Much remains unknown about how threat evasion—migration undertaken to escape threats to survival—occurs at the family level. With the phenomenon of threat evasion as our principal focus, we collected and analyzed 65 in-depth interviews and four focus groups ( N = 44) among a highly diverse sample of Latin American asylum-seekers and other migrants in need of international protection (MNP) in Costa Rica. Across MNP from diverse backgrounds, family separation emerged as one of the most prominent themes. Family separations were closely related to families’ evolving degrees of agency, which shaped variation in separations’ anticipation and duration. Conceptualizing anticipation and duration as two intersecting continuums, in this article, we describe different types of MNP family separation, link these types to differences and changes in families’ perceived control over the migration process, and illustrate their distinct emotional and practical implications. Our findings deepen understandings of MNP family separation, and at the same time, broaden theories of migration volition to demonstrate their applicability and implications at the family level.",

          "abstract": "Despite hosting large refugee populations, causal evidence on how refugee exposure shapes local attitudes in developing countries remains scarce. This study examines the impact of refugee exposure on local attitudes and migration policy preferences in the world's largest refugee-hosting country. Using an instrumental variables approach, the findings reveal that exposure significantly affects perceptions of economic burden, insecurity, social distance, and migration governance. Negative attitudes are primarily driven by relative deprivation, cultural alienation, and competition in labor markets and public services. While religiosity minimally affects attitudes, it fosters a more welcoming outlook. Consistent with the integration paradox hypothesis, increased interaction with refugees exacerbates cultural conflicts, framing refugees as a perceived threat to the host community’s culture.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces the age‐weighted migration effectiveness index (AWMEI), a new metric that integrates age‐specific variation into a single measure of migration effectiveness. Traditional indices, such as the migration effectiveness index (MEI) and age‐specific MEI (ASMEI), effectively address the first aspect of migration effectiveness—population redistribution—but overlook the second aspect—transformation of the composition of regional populations. The AWMEI bridges this gap by weighting net migration flows according to their age structure, offering comprehensive insights into migration's dual impacts. Applied to South Korea's internal migration data (2001–2022), the AWMEI uncovers patterns previously obscured by conventional measures. Nationally, an increasing divergence between AWMEI and MEI reveals growing age disparities in migration patterns. At regional and local scales, the AWMEI highlights substantial age‐specific population shifts even where traditional indices indicate minimal migration effectiveness. Amid broader spatial demographic transitions, the AWMEI provides a robust analytical framework for capturing migration's demographic implications. Its inherent adaptability further allows broad application across diverse dimensions of population composition and various research contexts.",

          "abstract": "Migration and its implications are key research topics in population studies. Although scholars argue for a paradigm shift to examine migration from a life‐course perspective, the central body of empirical studies treated migration as a one‐off event. Joining the recent growing studies that focus on migration trajectories, this study proposes a new approach to identify distinct migration trajectories and examine their consequences by considering the directions and frequencies of migrations. This study uses prospective data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2010–2020 to demonstrate the method and integrates with the fixed‐effect model to estimate the impacts of the migration trajectories of the internal rural–urban child migrants on their educational attainment. Four migration trajectories were identified during the 10 years of observations, including migrant stayers, return migrants and circular migrants of different directions. Results illustrate their heterogeneities and educational consequences. The impact of one's migration trajectory on education is determined by the direction (to rural or to urban) of the transition and the accumulated effects of every transition.",

          "authors": "Alfonso Giordano, Laura Sparascio",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how sending governments engage their diasporas for lobbying purposes and the potential outcomes of such efforts. Using Turkey's diaspora in Germany as a case study, we apply an integrated framework combining insights from the diaspora engagement policies and ethnic lobbying literatures to address the question: To what extent is a sending country capable of mobilising its diaspora to lobby for its interests in the host country? We show that governments' policies can strengthen the diaspora lobbying capacity by enhancing the internal factors of ethnic lobbying success, such as political activity, unity, and collective identity. However, these efforts may provoke backlash from the host country, limiting the diaspora's access to political power and chances of successful lobbying. Moreover, when the group's interests diverge from the homeland's objectives, the diaspora may prioritise its own concerns, complicating states' efforts of mobilising a consistently loyal group. This study contributes to our understanding of state‐diaspora relations by highlighting how states attempt to promote diaspora's lobbying and the complexity of such actions.",
