          "authors": "Maurizio Ambrosini",
          "abstract": "Opposition against refugees and migrants is a central topic of the populist far-right’s political agenda. In Italy, the populist far-right has come to lead the national government with the Meloni government. In this scenario, this article identifies what can be defined as the “populist far right paradox”: how to maintain the electoral commitment of rigid closure towards immigrants and refugees, in the presence of interests and pressures that instead require openness. This general question generates three sub-questions. First of all, in which ways, once in government, does the populist far-right try to keep its promises to block immigration? Secondly, how do they manage to navigate between different needs and pressures, which for different reasons require an openness to new entries of people from abroad? Third, how the Meloni government relates with the EU policies?",

          "title": "Health-related lifestyle behaviours and healthcare utilisation among adolescent immigrants in Europe",
          "authors": "Krzysztof Czaderny",
          "abstract": "The healthy immigrant paradox suggests that immigrants tend to have better health than native residents, despite facing socio-economic disadvantages. At the same time, immigrants are considered to utilise healthcare less. This study compares health-related lifestyle behaviours and healthcare utilisation between foreign-born and native-born adolescents living in Europe. It uses the partial least squares method and data from the 2019 European Health Interview Survey, covering 15,320 individuals aged 15–19 years. On average, being foreign-born was positively associated with following a healthy diet, engaging in physical activity, avoiding smoking, and avoiding alcohol. However, these relationships largely varied depending on whether the adolescents originated from within or outside the European Union. Conversely, being foreign-born was generally linked to lower healthcare utilisation. The utilisation of healthcare was by far the lowest among adolescents born outside the European Union who were not citizens of a European Union member state, which contrasts with health-related lifestyle behaviours. Furthermore, the association between being in this group and healthcare utilisation was moderated by equivalised household income. This aligns with previous research suggesting that immigrants tend to underutilise healthcare, primarily due to administrative and economic barriers. Unlike foreign-born adolescents, second-generation immigrants did not differ significantly from their native counterparts in most health-related behaviours analysed. In conclusion, promoting selective acculturation among adolescent immigrants and enhancing their access to healthcare is recommended.",

          "abstract": "This study applies a social network approach to the study of migration. Analysis of a social network of 136 North Koreans refugees in Greater London indicates that individual refugees’ position in the network predicts their probability of developing connections beyond the immediate refugee community. The results show that refugees who are more central in the ethnic trust network, connecting different parts of the network, are more likely to interact with the receiving society by forming a greater number of and more diverse outgroup contacts. Further analysis reveals that the presence of family in the destination significantly predicts whether a refugee holds a central role in the trust network. The study suggests the primacy of family and coethnic ties by highlighting that coethnic networks grounded in trust may support the expansion of the network beyond the refugee community.",

          "abstract": "Declines in immigrant fertility from one generation to the next provide an indirect measure of immigrant assimilation. Post-2000 declines in US fertility nevertheless may mask substantial—and growing—heterogeneity, especially across racial and ethnic minorities and new immigrant groups. We apply data from the June Current Population Survey to document generation-to-generation differentials in cohort completed fertility (CCF) since 2000 among America's racial and ethnic minority populations. Our regression decomposition models highlight composition and rate effects on changing levels of CCF nationally and across immigrant and native-born racial groups. CCF remained remarkably stable overall and for each racial group over the 2000-to-2020 period. The analyses nevertheless revealed small but unexpected increases in CCFs from 1.92 to 1.97 over 2000–2020. Growing diversity has, on balance, placed upward pressure on fertility. This has occurred even as fertility rates have declined overall among US racial minorities and immigrant groups since 2000. Trends in US cohort completed fertility reflect off-setting rate and composition effects across our set of explanatory variables. Any upward pressures on fertility from immigration or America's growing racial diversity has been countered by other downward pressures, especially from over-time increases in female education and declines in marriage. This paper documents recent fertility trends and differentials among different generations of racial and ethnic minority women over time. It highlights the importance of changing population composition, including the racial and generational mix of immigrants, for understanding post-2000 fertility trends. It provides an empirical baseline of fertility research in high-income countries.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines diaspora policy diffusion in Africa by analyzing measures adopted by 54 African countries, the African Union, and the United Nations. It investigates vertical diffusion by comparing national and international measures, and horizontal diffusion by identifying cross-country and regional trends. The findings reveal a bidirectional interplay among national, regional, and global influences that shape diaspora policies. In the early stages, nationally led approaches had limited international alignment, but they gradually evolved toward greater convergence with international frameworks and stronger regional diffusion within clusters. Vertical and horizontal diffusion increasingly reinforce each other. The paper proposes an analytical framework to investigate vertical and horizontal policy diffusion across three scenarios. Challenging the prevailing view of unidirectional diffusion, it highlights the agency of African states in shaping diaspora engagement approaches.",

          "abstract": "Lack of data transparency and administrative data quality issues have hindered our understanding of the treatment of unaccompanied minors in the United States to date. This Dispatch from the Field provides new statistics on nearly a half million unaccompanied minors navigating removal proceedings in US immigration courts nationwide between 2009 and 2023 (through March), including population demographics, geographic location of cases, representation rates, and case outcomes. We extrapolated these statistics, even the most basic of which have not been available to the public since 2017, by using a novel approach that we developed to identify unaccompanied minors in administrative data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. During the study period, only 51% of unaccompanied children were represented by an immigration attorney at any time during their removal proceedings. There are significant geographic and demographic disparities in representation rates. Representation for unaccompanied minors declined almost every year during the first Trump presidency. Over half (56%) of children's cases on which a decision was reached during the study period ended in a deportation order. More children were ordered deported under the first Trump administration (70% of completed cases) than under either the Obama (51%) or Biden (45%) administrations. Children who were not represented by an attorney were far more likely to be ordered deported.",

          "authors": "Lara Marie Greaves, Rebecca Hini, Hannah R. Overbye, Kaylee Grace Brink",
          "abstract": "Different participatory mechanisms for the representation of Indigenous peoples have been proposed across states. Since their creation in 1867, the Māori electorates in the national Parliament have led to dedicated representation for Māori (Indigenous peoples of New Zealand). However, only half of Māori choose to vote on the Māori roll, the remainder choosing to vote on the General roll, illustrating that roll choice is not based simply on group representation. This survey aimed to ask Māori ( N = 1,958) in their own words why they made their roll choice. Through a deductive codebook thematic analysis, a range of codes were constructed around the reasoning behind roll choice. Māori on the Māori roll made their choice because they valued Māori representation; as an expression of their identity; to support the electorates; as a strategic choice; or they had been influenced by others or through education. Those on the General roll felt their roll was the default or a more familiar option; the Māori roll had less of an impact; it was a strategic choice, or they appreciated greater candidate variety; or they valued the smaller geographic electorate size. Some felt Māori no longer needed separate representation or felt less connected to their identity as Māori. The results have implications for both Māori and Indigenous representation through dedicated representational mechanisms.",

However, little is known about how they explain voting behavior among minorities, who have an inherent motivation to protect their minority rights. In this article, I examine how belonging to a minority, political self-efficacy, the civic duty to vote, and a shared party identification are connected to intentions to vote. Analyzing nationally representative panel data in a structural equation model, I compare Swedish-speaking minority adolescents and Finnish-speaking majority adolescents—groups that mainly share similar background characteristics in all but language and their minority or majority status. According to the results, the significantly higher voting intentions found among the minority can partly be derived from their higher level of political self-efficacy. The unilingually Swedish-speaking adolescents also seem to benefit from their more pronounced and homogenous political atmosphere.",

          "abstract": "Why is solidarity between people of color (PoC) so difficult to achieve? New evidence suggests solidarity can be activated through a sense of shared discrimination between PoC. Yet other research highlights many real-world obstacles to this solidarity, including recurring inter-minority conflicts. We consider system justification as one possible mechanism that undercuts PoC solidarity. System justification is a human motive to bolster the status quo. System justifiers who are PoC condone racial inequalities as stable, predictable, and just—which alleviates mental stressors associated with their own racially stigmatized status. We investigate system justification ’s impacts on Asian Americans: a key party to many coalitions and conflicts with Black and Latino people. Using national survey data, we find that system justification is significantly associated with Asian opposition to solidarity with Black Lives Matter, net of racial resentment, and other key covariates. We then refine this result experimentally by exposing Asian adults to the model minority myth—a system-legitimizing ideology. Exposure to this myth triggers system justification , which then increases Asian opposition to pro-Black and pro-Latino policies, among other solidarity-based outcomes. Both results are primarily driven by conservative Asian Americans, highlighting a need to better appreciate Asian Americans’ ideological diversity in U.S. racial politics.",

          "authors": "Kevin Sparrow",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how Black voters choose candidates in majority-Black congressional districts. Partisanship often drives Black vote choice, but the lack of competition in general elections reduces its relevance and highlights the importance of primary elections. Racial cues are also referenced in literature, but the electoral setting reduces the relevance of race. Majority-Black congressional districts are racially homogeneous, and all emerging candidates are Black. Race cannot be used to distinguish between candidates. Congressional primary elections are also considered low-information environments, and voters have limited knowledge about the emerging candidates. In these settings, Black voters turn to cues to choose candidates. Since partisan and racial cues are not viable options, I argue that Black voters seek cues that signal group consensus. I highlight the role of endorsements and public opinion data. I utilize a mixed methodological approach incorporating a randomized survey experiment and focus group discussions with Black primary voters. Results from both methods suggest consensus cues are essential. Experimental results found no significant difference between racial and partisan endorsements, but they found a positive and significant effect for high polling. Focus group respondents had sincere preferences but were willing to abandon them if they differed from the group consensus. They also pointed to the importance of the media. I conducted an exploratory analysis of my experimental results, and I found that those with higher levels of media attention are more likely to rely on consensus cues. These results provide important insight into Black vote choice in majority-Black congressional districts.",

          "abstract": "This article examines Tibetan hunger strikes unto death as a key part of a larger repertoire of protest practices that invoke and mobilize a transnational Tibetan public, fostering national cohesion in exile. While these protests aim to pressure international institutions and foreign governments to condemn repression in Tibet, they also achieve another crucial goal: forging solidarities within the Tibetan exile community. Through archival research, interviews, and ethnographic insights, the article traces the historical emergence of these embodied protests, situating them within broader debates on theories of publics, exploring the affective dimension of sacrifice in mobilizing a transnational public, and highlighting the significance of refugee activism in challenging the global order of nation-states. Ultimately, this study argues that Tibetan hunger strikes do not merely seek external intervention, but actively produce a Tibetan public, reaffirming national identity and a commitment to their freedom struggle in the face of displacement and fragmentation.",

          "authors": "Heba Alnajada",
          "abstract": "Palestinian refugees in Amman persistently call what is now a densely built urban environment, a camp (mukhayyam). Officially, however, the camp went from being recognized by Jordanian host authorities to becoming a “squatter settlement” in World Bank projects, all the while remaining non-recognized by the UN body responsible for Palestine refugees. This article uncovers how sustained humanitarian non-recognition ushered in a language of “informality” that justified demolition and displacement as vehicle for development. In locating this lexical shift in the 1980s and 1990s, this article exposes a new form of epistemic and spatial dispossession brought upon the Palestinians. In calling into question acts of classification, this article historicizes how and why the refugee camp component of the question of Palestine became submerged under “informality.” At the same time, attuned to a Palestinian spatial vocabulary and grammar, this article reveals how the mukhayyam remained resistant to the forces that did not recognize its legitimacy and those that sought to informalize it. It is in this sense that the camp, as a broader encompassing Palestinian vocabulary, has a radical currency.",

Understanding how local context shapes the employment integration of newcomers in their first few years of arrival is critical in informing policy to improve employment outcomes. Using a case study approach, this study explores the employment experiences of recent immigrants in a mid‐sized city in Ontario, Canada to identify challenges and opportunities they face integrating into the local labour market. Findings were framed into an emerging model of immigrant employment‐seeking strategies that identified how individual and contextual factors affect immigrant labour market integration. At the individual level, despite employing several strategies, most immigrants found themselves in low‐skilled positions. At the city level, challenges were associated with a concentration of specific industries with a lower demand for diverse skill sets. Providing support at critical points of the integration process including prearrival and during the initial years postmigration can accelerate the uptake of immigrants into commensurate employment. This study contributes to further understanding of the important role of cities in ensuring the efficient and effective employment integration of immigrants into the Canadian labour market.",

          "authors": "Junqiao Ma, Anbang Wang, Sixuan Luo, Zongyuan Weng, Ke He",
          "abstract": "Using data from the 2011–2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey, which includes over 1.1 million observations, along with the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index, this paper investigates the impact of digital finance on cross‐regional labor mobility and Interindustry movement. The results indicate that regional digital finance disrupts the traditional “proximity mobility preference” of rural labor, thereby broadening the geographic scope of migration. Specifically, it reduces mobility across counties while increasing mobility across cities and provinces. The study finds that rural low‐skilled and middle‐skilled workers are more likely to transition into the tertiary sector after migrating across provinces. This movement is driven by income incentives and reduced costs. For low‐skilled rural labor, regional digital finance encourages provincial mobility and entry into the tertiary sector by raising wage levels and reducing information costs. For middle‐skilled rural labor, the same effect occurs through higher relative income and lower job‐search costs. This study offers new insights into optimizing labor mobility and industrial patterns in the context of digital finance development.",

          "authors": "Ka Wang Kelvin Lam, Eric Fong",
          "abstract": "This article aims to expand the scope of migration research by examining politically driven migration. Drawing from the immigration literature, we distinguish between two forms of politically driven migration, which can be a risk‐averse response to an unknown political future or an expression of dissatisfaction with governments or policies. We substantiate our arguments with evidence from the emigration tendencies of Hong Kong residents after the 1997 handover and the 2019 social movement. We argue that the intention to emigrate after 1997 was driven by a desire to reduce the perceived risks associated with the unknown political future brought about by the transfer of sovereignty. The intention to emigrate after 2019 reflects residents' dissatisfaction with the current political and social arrangements in Hong Kong, particularly as individuals have paid a price to voice for change during the social movement, only to see limited success and a shrinking space for expressing dissenting opinions.",
