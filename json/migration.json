          "authors": "Aija Lulle",
          "abstract": "By building on the concept of preparedness, I demonstrate that return migration in older age requires a home, meaningful social relationships and pension income. More so, a framework for pension portability and taxation should be interpreted as morally just by returnees. The moral dimension encompasses meanings of fair taxation, the value of an older returnee and intergenerational solidarity within migrant communities and returnees' homes. Morality also interweaves multiple scales from transnational agreements to national return migration ideologies and everyday relationships at the micro scale. Accordingly, based on ethnography (2021–2023) with older returnees in Latvia, this research extends return migration theory and ageing studies through the scalar and moral lenses.",

          "authors": "S. Garnett Russell, Diana Rodríguez-Gómez, Paula Mantilla-Blanco",
          "abstract": "With the highest number of displaced persons in history, migrants must navigate complicated systems to access rights and social services. In this article, we provide the perspective of organizational actors providing educational services to refugee and migrant populations in Ecuador. We draw on an analysis of 20 interviews with key informants to examine how global and national refugee and migratory policies shape the work of organizations. We find that organizations play an important role in navigating global and national policies around migration and education and in rendering the policies legible and the migrant populations visible. In addition, these organizations adapt an intersectoral approach, which points to the potential of education as an enabling right and also as an important link to other social services. We propose a migratory ecosystem framework for understanding the coexistence and overlap of multiple legal and policy categories and the implications for accessing social services.",

          "abstract": "Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the consequences of temporary protection regimes in contemporary refugee policy became more acute. This article examines the origins and development of temporary protection in the USA and the European Union from a historical and comparative perspective. By analyzing US congressional documents and EU parliamentary papers, we explore the original political debates in both regions in the 1980s and 1990s. We argue refugee advocates in the USA championed the creation of this new status, while those in the EU expressed skepticism that this would erode the 1951 Refugee Convention. The political calculus in the USA made temporary protection a seemingly limited and winnable accomplishment amid an anti-refugee climate, whereas advocates in the EU feared creating a new prolonged limbo category for refugees. With more people than ever before living under ‘temporary protection’, it is worth re-assessing its origins and the advantages and the limitations of temporary protection.",

          "abstract": "This study compares the social relationships of refugees resettled through the UK’s Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) and Community Sponsorship (CS) programme, focusing on relationship quality, the support offered, and effects on integration. Results show that CS refugees tend to have more relationships providing emotional support, while VPRS refugees often lack such support. By introducing the concepts of ‘helpful’ and ‘caring’ relationships, this study distinguishes between practical help and emotional support, highlighting factors like intimacy and frequent contact. Findings suggest that emotional support in CS networks enhances refugees’ confidence and comfort, facilitates engagement with the broader community, and boosts their ability to reciprocate. This study provides a nuanced understanding of how social relationships, individual factors, and refugee-integration-opportunity structures intersect to shape integration, emphasizing the crucial role of emotional support in facilitating integration.",
