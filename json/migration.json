          "abstract": "Previous scholarship on migration policy assumed that economics and culture are categorically separate criteria of migrant selection, often pushing policy in opposite directions, typically expansive on economics yet restrictive on culture. I argue that in a neoliberal order the economics versus culture distinction loses traction. “Neoliberal nationalism” entails a transactional understanding of political community and society, in which economic considerations become predominant across selection criteria. This strongly relativizes and weakens individual rights on the part of migrants, which had been the mark of liberal migration policy. Neoliberal migration policy simultaneously economizes and culturalizes migrant selection. This is obvious and nearly trite with respect to high-skilled labor migration, the type favored in a neoliberal society. But it is also observable, and more problematic, with respect to family and asylum migrations, which previously had been considered as-of-right and now are subjected to (broadly construed) utility considerations.",

          "abstract": "In the US and the UK, rapidly growing populations of mixed origins have constituted a key research site for decades. In most European countries, by contrast, the mixed-origin group has remained largely invisible within research on immigration-related inequality and especially so in its quantitative branch. Breaking this pattern, we zoom in on Norwegian-born individuals with one parent born outside of Western Europe and North America, a group constituting about a third of the country's overall mixed-origin population. Drawing on administrative register data and survey data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study in Norway, we assess their socioeconomic backgrounds, educational aspirations, and subjective experiences, and compare them to individuals with two Norwegian-born parents and two immigrant parents. Our analyses document a contradictory pattern that begs for future research: Mixed-origin individuals largely resemble their majority peers in terms of parental socioeconomic resources, but they lack the educational drive typical of the second generation, in terms of both subjective aspirations and actual educational attainments. In their social orientations and national identification, they are located somewhere in between the minority and the majority, but they experience similar levels of discrimination and non-recognition as those with two immigrant parents. We use these contradictory findings to discuss possible ways forward for a broader research agenda for mixed-origin populations beyond the US and the UK.",

          "authors": "Mary Rose Geraldine Sarausad, Sureeporn Punpuing",
          "abstract": "Urban refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand are confronted with the complexities of autonomy and precarity beyond formal camp arrangements. Although cities offer some flexibility, refugees face systemic impediments that include the absence of legal recognition, restrictive immigration policies, and marginalization exacerbated by prolonged waiting, demonstrating the realities of being a refugee . This qualitative study examines the influence of Thailand's migration governance system on the realities of protracted displacement among urban refugees, utilizing in-depth interviews with 35 participants (14 key experts and 21 refugees) in Bangkok and peripheral areas. Findings indicate that Thailand's non-ratification of the 1951 Refugee Convention labels refugees as “illegal migrants” under domestic law, subjecting them to arrest and deportation in spite of UNHCR recognition. While most depend on insecure informal work, they are generally excluded from healthcare, education, and social protection, threatening their well-being and perpetuating a cycle of marginalization that hampers the likelihood for inclusion and self-reliance. The COVID-19 pandemic aggravated their precarious conditions, disrupted their livelihoods, and community support networks. The study also highlights how extended periods of legal uncertainty and administrative delays in refugee status determination magnify mental and emotional health issues and social exclusion. Therefore, it advocates for policy reforms that include strengthening Thailand's National Screening Mechanism through nondiscriminatory legal process, creating stable employment prospects by providing work permits, and ensuring equitable access to social infrastructures such as healthcare and education regardless of status. The findings also amplify extensive discussions on the management of urban displacement in non-signatory countries, illustrating how urban refugee populations are consigned to an indefinite state of legal uncertainty and heightened precarity.",

          "authors": "David Scott FitzGerald, John H. Evans",
          "abstract": "Advocates for refugees often publicize increased numbers of refugees, seemingly to generate greater support for pro-refugee policies. In this research note we test whether reading about a greater number of refugees results in more, less, or unchanged feelings of support for pro-refugee policies via a survey experiment from a national sample of more than 3000 U.S. adults. Accounting for uncertainty over whether the public will perceive differential magnitudes on a logarithmic or linear scale, we find that for U.S. adults as a whole, the magnitude of the number of refugees does not lead to support or opposition to policies to (a) admit more refugees or (b) fund refugee relief abroad. Republicans are much less likely to support such policies compared to Democrats, independent of the number of refugees. Surprisingly, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to respond to larger numbers with greater support for both policies. Refugee advocates should not assume that reporting increased numbers of refugees will result in more public support for funding refugees abroad or refugee admissions in the United States.",

          "authors": "Jason E. Kehrberg, Samantha L. Bennett, Scott A. Pray",
          "abstract": "A key component of the authoritarian worldview is social conformity, which manifests in a need to minimize threats to social order. This desire for stability often leads authoritarians to hold systematic and approving attitudes toward law enforcement. Previous scholarship suggests that authoritarianism is linked to attitudes shaped by the social dominance of one’s group identity. We extend this framework to Hispanic populations, whose identities historically fall outside the dominant social order, to examine whether authoritarianism predicts support for law enforcement. Using data from the 2020 American National Election Study (ANES), we employ regression models to examine the relationship between authoritarianism, ethnicity, and attitudes toward law enforcement. Results indicate that authoritarians express more favorable views of law enforcement across non-Hispanic white and Hispanic respondents, with a stronger effect among Hispanics. Positive feelings toward whites are also associated with higher levels of authoritarianism and greater support for police, underscoring the importance of white identity salience in shaping political attitudes. These findings demonstrate that authoritarianism functions as a psychological orientation emphasizing order and conformity rather than a defensive response to marginalization. Our results contribute to understanding how racial identity salience and acculturation processes shape the relationship between worldview and support for state authority.",

          "abstract": "Turnout appeals are amplified in highly polarized, hotly contested elections like 2020. The political environment included social justice unrest, overt appeals to white male voters, and new voting procedures which resonated differently across intersectional identities. Gender and race politics intertwined to create a charged environment for mobilization and for social pressure to vote. We expect the nature and effectiveness of turnout appeals to have varied by race and gender intersections. In addition, given past behavior and the climate of protest, we expect individuals under 30 were less responsive to social pressures to vote. Using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS 2020), we examine whether individuals with different intersectional identities varied in their perception of social pressure to vote as well as in the effectiveness of that pressure. We find that voters are sensitive to social pressure appeals, but both perception and responsiveness vary with intersectional identity.",

          "abstract": "Questions about race and representation often hinge on the public’s beliefs about which policies affect different communities, yet there is limited evidence on how these associations are actually perceived. Using a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine how the issue priorities of political candidates shape perceptions of who they represent. Most policy areas are perceived to benefit White Americans; only a few, especially criminal justice and poverty, are strongly associated with African Americans. We also show that perceptions of candidate ideology and race correlate with perceptions of Black representation, but mediation analysis reveals that criminal justice is associated with Black representation above and beyond ideological inferences. Finally, analyzing nearly 200,000 congressional newsletters and find that while race is rarely explicitly mentioned, Black Americans are most frequently referenced in the context of criminal justice and poverty. Together, these results underscore how race-policy associations operate through both public perception and elite messaging, shaping broader understandings of political representation.",

          "abstract": "Local prosecutors in the United States have significant discretion in the criminal legal system and have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration. Since 2016, however, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of mass incarceration. While scholars tie progressive prosecutors’ elections to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about countermovement efforts—including recalls, impeachments, and suspensions, examples of extra-electoral challenges —opposing these prosecutors. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country’s 300 most populous jurisdictions. Findings reveal that extra-electoral challenges disproportionately target women of color, disproportionately occur in Republican-controlled states, and have nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that extra-electoral challenges constitute a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to challenge racial justice efforts following BLM.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how immigrant origin and neighbourhood environment intersect to shape the timing and pathways of leaving the parental home in Finland, a comparatively new migration destination. Using large‐scale longitudinal Finnish register data for the 1990–1995 birth cohorts ( N = 369,629), we analyse the dynamics of leaving home among majority and immigrant‐origin young adults. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that the socio‐spatial environment shapes leaving‐home behaviour among different immigrant‐origin groups in Finland, providing a more nuanced understanding of this emplaced process. We employ discrete‐time competing‐risks event history models to analyse three transitions out of the parental home: independence, cohabitation and marriage. The results reveal that as the proportion of majority Finns in their neighbourhood increases, young adults with an immigrant background increasingly resemble their majority peers in their leaving‐home behaviour, except for those from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the Balkans and former Yugoslavia. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a differential effect of the neighbourhood environment on men's and women's leaving‐home pathways.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the temporal dynamics and policy influences on pathways out of irregular(ized) status among rejected asylum seekers in Germany through the lens of temporal liminality, a concept highlighting the indefinite waiting and uncertainty faced by migrants in transitional legal states. Using longitudinal administrative data spanning 2013 to 2022, the study employs event history analysis within a competing risks framework to analyse three primary pathways: voluntary departure, deportation, and regularization. The findings reveal that voluntary departures are most common within the first 2 years of an irregular(ized) stay, while regularization becomes increasingly likely over longer durations, reflecting the role of time in shaping opportunities for status stabilization. Deportations remain uncommon, underscoring the legal, logistical, and humanitarian challenges in enforcing removal orders. The research also evaluates the effects of safe‐country classifications and variations in temporary suspensions of deportation ( Duldung ). The safe‐country policy is shown to have limited direct impact on pathways out of irregularity. In contrast, the type of Duldung significantly affects outcomes: employment‐ and training‐based Duldung types foster regularization, while the more restrictive Duldung issued to individuals with unclear identity prolongs irregular(ized) stays. By incorporating the concept of temporal liminality, this study contributes a nuanced understanding of how time interacts with policy frameworks and individual circumstances to shape migration trajectories. The findings call for migration policies that balance enforcement with support, emphasizing the importance of timely and structured pathways to regularization to address the socio‐economic and legal challenges of prolonged liminality.",
