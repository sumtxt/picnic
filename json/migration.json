          "authors": "Md Farid Miah, Sheikh Md Rasel, Russell King",
          "abstract": "The Bangladeshi‐origin community is one of the largest, longest‐established and fastest‐growing migrant groups in the UK. For the first‐generation immigrants, retirement brings a threefold dilemma: stay put for the rest of their lives, surrounded by children and grandchildren; return to Bangladesh to enjoy a peaceful later‐life there; or adopt a to‐and‐fro transnational lifestyle. Interviews were conducted with 32 British Bangladeshis aged 60+, both in London and Sylhet (their main region of origin), with the aim of ascertaining how gender contributes to return migration theory and practice. We find, first, that most British‐Bangladeshi elders do not return. Second, return mobilities, for shorter or longer stays, are highly gendered: it is overwhelmingly men who contemplate and actualise return. Return migration is about reclaiming masculinity and meaning in old age in the home area. Some older men return seasonally, to escape the British winter. A major preoccupation of returnees is access to health services, deemed poor and expensive in Bangladesh.",

          "title": "Refugee return, reintegration, and citizenship practices in post‐conflict Syria",
          "authors": "Osman Bahadır Dinçer, Zeynep Şahin‐Mencütek",
          "abstract": "The return of Syrian refugees and internally displaced persons is occurring despite the absence of economic, political, social, and security infrastructures necessary for a voluntary, safe, and dignified return. Drawing from desk research and interviews conducted with 87 returnees in 2024, this paper explores the interactions between return processes and the Syrian government's citizenship policies. The evidence suggests that the Syrian regime has strategically promoted the right to return and selective readmission of Syrian refugees to gain international legitimacy and facilitate post‐war reconstruction. Empirical findings indicate that returnees have not yet attained all citizenship rights, particularly in ensuring safety, accessing government services, participating in cultural and political life, and fostering a sense of belonging. Furthermore, the lack of conducive conditions for the reintegration of returnees, coupled with the persistent characteristics of the pre‐war and conflict‐era concentric citizenship regime and a lack of political trust, impedes enjoying the rights and protections that should be afforded to them as citizens. This paper contributes to discussions on the politics of repatriation in origin countries and the diverse, path‐dependent factors shaping the reintegration of displaced persons in complex post‐conflict situations.",

          "authors": "Sabrina Dinmohamed",
          "abstract": "This study moves beyond traditional questions regarding immigrants' integration into various domains of their receiving societies to explore the meanings of places and the associated feelings of home. By examining how specific geographical locations relate to these feelings, the study illuminates post‐migration experiences and realities that are often overlooked in studies of immigrants. Specifically, it explores the significance of both the country of origin and the receiving society in shaping immigrants' feeling of home. Two key findings emerge from this ethnographic research. First, the study underscores the diversity within immigrant communities regarding the perceived location of home, with a particular emphasis on the influence of stepwise migration trajectories on these perceptions. Second, the findings demonstrate that the feeling of home is rooted in a variety of factors. By examining this feeling, this study offers a valuable lens via which to understand immigrants' attachments to both their countries of origin and receiving societies, enriching our understanding of their settlement experiences.",

          "authors": "Maya Willecke",
          "abstract": "In late modern societies characterized by increasing mobility and individualization, temporary living and working arrangements are no longer a rare phenomenon. In many life biographies, temporary and multi‐local periods, with more than one place of residence, have become common. This paper adopts a life course perspective to explore how temporary experiences influence individuals’ perceptions of their current multi‐local arrangements and future aspirations. Moreover it investigates how multi‐local residents perceive and realize home in their life course. Based on biographical interviews with multi‐local residents in two German cities, Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig, this study aims to deepen our understanding of multi‐local living arrangement from a life course perspective and to examine its implications on the processuality of home .",

          "title": "Barriers to Homeownership Among Young People in Australia: Unpacking Competing Hypotheses",
          "authors": "Rachel Ong ViforJ, Jack Hewton, Christopher Phelps",
          "abstract": "The homeownership prospects of young people are declining globally. There have been widespread public concerns regarding barriers posed by unaffordable housing markets and tighter borrowing constraints, but equally a recognition that parental assistance can overcome these constraints. At the same time, public commentary often suggests that young people exhibit behaviours that are not conducive to saving for home purchase. This paper tests the relative importance of competing hypotheses regarding the barriers to homeownership among young people using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. We find strong evidence that affordability constraints in the form of unaffordable housing markets and binding borrowing constraints are key barriers to homeownership. These constraints can be mitigated in the presence of intergenerational support as receipt of parental transfers in excess of AU$5000 quadruples the odds of achieving ownership. Poor saving habits, short‐term financial planning and labour market precarities have negative impacts on homeownership prospects, but they are relatively less important drivers of homeownership attainment than affordability constraints and parental transfers.",
