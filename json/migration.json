          "abstract": "The share of internationally mobile students has risen exponentially for the last two decades until the disruptive COVID-19 period, leading to a more diverse and multipolar network structure. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused restrictions across the globe. This systematic review aims to explore how COVID-19 has affected the magnitude, flows, and direction of internationally mobile students. A total of 57 studies, retrieved from several databases after extensive search, were analyzed regarding the dimensions of size, flow, direction, and pattern in international student mobility during the pandemic. The review suggests that following the pandemic, international student mobility was still dominated by the top-tier countries due to their swift actions and incremental policies, while some other countries gained visibility for international students and attracted more international students owing to students’ safety concerns and revised international student policies of the countries. Further, students’ study abroad decisions from source countries seemed to be shaped by the policies and regulations implemented during the pandemic, the political environment of the destination country, and personal concerns about safety and getting the most out of the study abroad experience. These factors reshaped the directional flow of international student mobility and study modality, particularly concerning regionalization and digital transformation for higher education institutions.",

          "abstract": "This article analyses the digitalisation of migration governance on the Brazil–Venezuela border. This digitalisation process ensued after the 2018 border militarisation through Operação Acolhida [Operation Welcome] and the adoption of international models spurred by a border security narrative. Based on a qualitative methodology, which included observation, interviews and documentary research, we examined the implications of digitalising migration governance in two areas of Venezuelan migrants' experiences on the Brazil–Venezuela border: (1) control and surveillance of Venezuelans as they arrive and settle in Brazil and (2) access to services and training projects on Brazilian territory.",

          "authors": "Eric Fong, Xi Ni, Pui Kwan Man",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between participation in social movement and the intention to emigrate. Drawing from data collected between January and March 2021, after the 2019 social movement in Hong Kong had subsided, we identified two important findings related to participation in the social movement and the intention to emigrate. First, we identified five key domains of governance in which the level of dissatisfaction is related to emigration intention: economic opportunities, human rights protection, the living and natural environment, cultural continuity, and stability of institutions. Second, we found that the level of participation in the social movement is not always significantly related to the level of dissatisfaction with the five identified policy domains. At the same time, the level of participation in the social movement is related significantly and directly to emigration intention. Implications of the findings are discussed.",

The contributions delve into key themes such as socioeconomic integration, the pervasive issue of loneliness, family support dynamics, and challenges faced during the end-of-life phase. By highlighting the resilience of older refugees and their potential to contribute meaningfully to their families, communities, and host societies despite systemic barriers, this collection aims to expand the current understanding of this population's needs and perspectives. Through empirical findings drawn from diverse global contexts, this Special Issue provides a nuanced perspective on older refugees' strengths and vulnerabilities, offering insights to inform targeted policies and inclusive support strategies tailored to enhance their social participation and quality of life.",

          "abstract": "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Kothi, and Hijra (LGBTQKH*) refugees in South Asia have long reimagined the meaning of refugeehood and belonging. This paper explores the case of Hijra Bengali refugees following the 1971 Bangladeshi independence war, focusing on their crafting of belonging from below. Despite international pressures for repatriation and organized abandonment, some Hijra refugees chose to remain in Kolkata’s red-light areas, seeking safety, livelihoods, and community through precolonial ties. This study examines Hijra refusal to return to Bangladesh and their subsequent involvement in the Kolkata sex worker movement, highlighting their everyday decision-making, cultural practices, and gendered community. By centering the experiences of Hijra Bengali refugees, this paper both disrupts victimizing narratives from the Global North and reframes top-down belonging, demonstrating how Hijras have been producing and maintaining their own belonging outside of the ambit of the refugee regime and the state.",

          "authors": "Mélanie Bourguignon, Joan Damiens, Yoann Doignon, Thierry Eggerickx, Audrey Plavsic, Jean‐Paul Sanderson, Aurélie Bertrand",
          "abstract": "The Covid‐19 pandemic marked the year 2020. In Belgium, it led to a doubling in deaths, mainly grouped into two periods. This article aims to compare the relative importance of predictors and individual and spatial determinants of mortality during these two waves to an equivalent non‐pandemic period and to identify whether and to what extent the pandemic has altered the sociodemographic patterns of conventional mortality. The analyses relate to all‐cause mortality during the two waves of Covid‐19 and their equivalent in 2019. They are based on matching individual and exhaustive data from the Belgian National Register with tax and population census data. A multi‐level approach combining individual and spatial determinants was adopted. Mortality patterns during and outside the pandemic are very similar. As in 2019, age, sex, and household composition significantly determine the individual risk of dying, with a higher risk of death among the oldest people, men, and residents of collective households. However, their risk of death increases during the Covid period, especially in the 65–79 age group. Spatial information is no more significant in 2020 than in 2019. However, a higher risk of death is observed when the local excess mortality index or the communal proportions of single‐person households or disadvantaged people increase. While the Covid pandemic did not fundamentally alter conventional mortality patterns, it did amplify some of the pre‐existing differences in mortality.",
