          "title": "Regular vs. irregular migration from Indian Punjab: evaluating socio-economic contexts, economic gains and developmental effects",
          "authors": "Naresh Singla, Kulwinder Singh, Nirvair Singh, Bali Bahadur",
          "abstract": "The emergence of irregular migration and its coexistence with regular migration calls for a comparative analysis of their socio-economic contexts, economic gains, and developmental effects in Punjab state of India. Drawing on a primary survey of 350 emigrant households—comprising 250 regular and 100 irregular migrants—the study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating descriptive statistics, non-parametric testing (Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U), regression models, and ethnographic case studies to offer a comparative analysis of the two migration types. The findings confirm significant differences in the socioeconomic factors, economic dynamics, and development impacts across regular and irregular migration. The pattern of migration destinations also significantly varies across regular and irregular migration. Compared to regular migration, irregular migration costs are substantially higher, and its economic gains were considerably lower. Logit and Probit models confirm the significant role of dependency burden, education, and social networks in determining irregular migration. Remittance utilisation also diverges: irregular migrants primarily repay debts and sustain household consumption, whereas regular migrants invest in housing, social ceremonies, and enterprises. Despite differing outcomes, both migration types contribute to household and rural development, though through distinct ways. Case narratives further underscore transitions between legal and irregular statuses, illuminating the fluidity and precarity embedded in contemporary migration regimes. The study concludes that regular and irregular migrations are not dichotomous but interrelated phenomena shaped by structural push factors and constrained policy environments. It calls for inclusive migration governance rooted in development and rights-based frameworks, rather than restrictive enforcement. Both source and destination countries must collaborate to expand legal pathways, protect migrants’ rights, and harness migration’s developmental potential more equitably.",

          "authors": "Ludmila Bogdan",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the profiles, motivations, and methods of human traffickers incarcerated in Romania, based on 20 semi-structured interviews conducted in 2018 at Jilava Prison. The study addresses the research question: \"How do traffickers rationalize their involvement in human trafficking?\" By developing typologies of traffickers and analyzing mechanisms of justification and motivation, the research highlights both the external socio-economic contexts and individual personal characteristics in which traffickers operate. It places these findings in the broader context of labor market imbalances and irregular migration routes that create favorable conditions for trafficking. This paper challenges simplistic portrayals of traffickers as a homogeneous group. These insights are useful not only in academic debates but also have important policy implications. This paper calls for further research and a stronger connection between migration, labor exploitation, and human trafficking.",

          "authors": "Victoria Ankrah, Yusuf Ikbal Oldac",
          "abstract": "This study explores the critical implications of the absence of Cross-Border Pension Portability (CBPP) schemes for Ghanaian migrants residing in the Bronx, New York, illuminating the complexity of their return migration intentions in the absence of CBPP. Drawing on neoclassical economic labour migration theory and the social protection theory, we built a foundation on how past integrational challenges increase the chances of return migration and the significance of CBPP as asafety net for migrant's accumulated social security. We conducted in-depth interviews with 28 Ghanaian migrants to examine how these past integrational challenges, which have already increased their chances of return, are compounded by the absence of a CBPP agreement, which causes a fear of losing their pension benefit on return. The study examines their experiences as they make such complex decisions towards their retirement. Our findings reveal that many migrants prolong their stay in the U.S. to obtain citizenship, which is essential for accessing pension benefits abroad without restrictions. This extended stay disrupts their retirement plans and compels them to extend their work life further to supplement their meagre pension benefit, which is a repercussion of their past low-paying jobs. Migrants face several challenges when deciding to leave the U.S. without acquiring citizenship. Those who choose to return to their home countries must visit the U.S. every six months to maintain their eligibility for benefits. This requirement can lead to significant costs, as they need to cover travel expenses and accommodations. As a result, a large portion of their benefits may be redirected to settle these conditions for their pension eligibility. This research contributes to the literature by highlighting how implementing CBPP could alleviate these burdens, enhance migrant well-being, and facilitate smoother transitions back to migrants’ home countries. Ultimately, we argue that CBPP is essential for addressing humanitarian concerns and the economic implications for migrants and the host country.",

          "authors": "John Cantwell, Pallavi Shukla",
          "abstract": "Digitalization has dramatically expanded the scale and scope of cross-border trade for international businesses, whether large multinational enterprises (MNEs), medium- to small-sized MNEs, or importing/exporting firms. In this paper, we examine how and to what extent migrants facilitate cross-border digital trade between their country of origin and country of residence. We argue that the rise in digital trade between countries is observed, in part, due to the rise of international knowledge connections facilitated by cross-border migrant relationships. Empirical analysis of migration and services trade panel data for the high- and upper-middle-income trading partners of the United States from 2000 to 2020 shows that recent migrants (or non-immigrants) to the United States increased exports to their country of origin. More importantly, we find that permanent migrants (or immigrants) embedded in their country of residence significantly increased exports to their country of origin. Implications for an interdisciplinary dialogue between economic theories of knowledge and institutional change on the one hand and economic sociology and migrant transnationalism on the other are discussed.",

          "authors": "Ayana Best",
          "abstract": "Much of the existing behavioral political science literature ignores Black motherhood as a salient factor of political identity and mobilization. However, Black mothers are often at the forefront of numerous political movements, including ones to end police violence against Black Americans. Due to the disproportionality of police contact in Black communities, Black mothers have a personal stake in ending police abuse that is twofold. First, Black mothers are often victims of sexist and racist policing practices, facing verbal, sexual, psychological, and economic abuse at the hands of law enforcement. Second, while dealing with their own oppressive relationship with the police, they must simultaneously take action to protect their loved ones from potential violence and harm at the hands of the state. The goal of this research is to examine how community-based politics serve as an opportunity for Black maternal status to be manifested as a form of resistance. I focus on what I refer to as community-based political activity because it is deeply rooted in the fabric of Black women’s political activism and produces more immediate benefits than other forms of political engagement. To examine the effects of direct and indirect police encounters on Black mothers, I pose several questions: How does negative police contact affect Black mothers’ community-based political activity? Does this difference apply to Black women who are not mothers? Using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Elections Survey, my analysis demonstrates that maternal status has a significant impact on Black mothers’ community-oriented political engagement, particularly for those affected by indirect police contact.",

          "abstract": "The United States’ refugee resettlement program is one of the oldest and largest government-sponsored resettlement programs globally, and children below the age of 18 comprise a large proportion of those resettled. Despite that, data on long-term integration of refugee children has been missing, which has led to a lack of longitudinal research on this population. In this paper, we use the labeling framework to explore the labeling of students with refugee/asylee statuses in Texas educational data. This initial exploration of data demonstrates the lack of thorough labeling policies and gaps in the implementation of existing policies. Our findings suggest that inconsistencies have emerged in who is identified, when, under which dataset, and how many times because labeling is tied to accountability. Findings also suggest an erasure of refugee/asylee students’ identities. The implications of our findings, including the need for policy reforms at the state and federal levels, are discussed in detail.",

          "abstract": "How is refugee governance constructed for geopolitical gain? This article introduces the concept of credible fictions to theorize how states strategically curate aspects of refugee governance to appear as responsible partners. These fictions are not outright lies, but plausible distortions that produce legible signs of humanitarian strain and institutional responsibility. The article identifies three modalities: illusions of scale, in which population figures are exaggerated to amplify geopolitical relevance; performative enforcement, where control is symbolically enacted to signal responsibility; and staged compliance, in which policy metrics are curated to suggest implementation without structural reform. These practices allow states to preserve sovereign discretion while securing international recognition and material support, often with the tacit endorsement of international organizations. Rather than assessing veracity, the analysis centres on how credibility is constructed, by whom, and to what end. It reframes refugee rent-seeking as a practice grounded in visibility rather than outcomes, and highlights symbolic performance as a core strategy in migration diplomacy.",

          "abstract": "Asylum seekers and refugees often experience diverse sources of discrimination, yet these experiences are seldom understood systematically. Furthermore, less is discussed on how they utilize platforms led by themselves to address these challenges. This study incorporates Burns’ structural discrimination theory and Toomey’s empowerment framework to systematically analyze how members of the asylum-seeking community in Hong Kong perceive the experience of discrimination and how they utilize the platform of the refugee-led organizations (RLOs) as a means of empowerment to combat discrimination. This study draws on thirty in-depth interviews with asylum seekers recruited by a Hong Kong RLO. The qualitative results show that the asylum seekers experienced both institutional and cultural discrimination, but the perceived level of discrimination was mild owing to robust social support. RLOs fulfill traditional roles as a ‘provider’ and ‘liberator’, as well as alternative roles as a ‘catalyst’, ‘facilitator’, ‘ally’, and ‘advocate’. The study emphasizes the importance of the role of ‘ally’ in supporting marginalized asylum seekers and provides policy implications for fostering an inclusive environment for asylum seekers in the context of Hong Kong.",

          "abstract": "Research on social isolation and loneliness has largely overlooked refugees, who are among the loneliest in society. This study employs the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment to examine how stable and situational social isolation contribute to loneliness. Drawing on two-wave panel data from 647 Syrian refugees in the Netherlands, fielded before and during the pandemic, we explore the stability of social ties across geographical and ethnic dimensions and how fluctuations lead to varying degrees of loneliness. While transnational ties served as a social safety net against loneliness during situational social isolation, our findings underscore their limited effectiveness compared to the more transient but protective local ties. Refugees who lacked local ties or experienced a disruption in local inter-ethnic ties were particularly vulnerable to heightened loneliness, emphasizing the importance of maintaining geographically close ties.",

          "abstract": "Italy has stronger intergenerational support networks and more frequent exchanges than other European countries, with little variation over time. Although regional and urban‐rural differences in relations between older parents and their children have been studied, the impact of municipal remoteness in terms of distance from essential services and accessibility remains largely unknown. Using official ISTAT classification of municipality remoteness and data from four waves of the Italian survey “Famiglie e Soggetti Sociali” (1998, 2003, 2009, 2016), we investigated the association between proximity and face‐to‐face contact with the remoteness of the municipalities in which older parents reside. Our results shed new light on the geographical impact on intergenerational ties and support networks, showing that co‐residence is less common in remote areas. Furthermore, older parents residing in remote areas appear to have less frequent contact with their children. This persistent geographical divide, coupled with population ageing, risks exacerbating the vulnerability of older parents in remote areas, given their limited access to formal care infrastructures. These results underscore the need for policymakers to design new strategies that adequately address the future challenges of population ageing.",

This paper adopts transnationalism to investigate late‐life Chinese immigrants' (65 years and over) everyday challenges and information practices in New Zealand. The findings result from a reflexive thematic analysis of in‐depth interviews of 47 older Chinese immigrants. We found that interviewees' challenges and information needs involved New Zealand‐ and China‐oriented issues, reflecting their transnational characteristics. Their information needs primarily targeted their daily challenges. Meanwhile, interviewees' challenges and information needs varied according to their settlement stages (newcomers vs. long‐established immigrants). In contrast, the settlement stage‐based divergencies of their information sources were not obvious. Interviewees' information‐seeking behaviours were both random and purposeful. The findings offer helpful suggestions for policymakers to improve social service and information delivery systems. They also expand our understanding of late‐life immigrants' local integration into host countries.",

          "authors": "Zhenhua Zheng, Yabin Guo, Yuetong Wang",
          "abstract": "Amid the backdrop of rural revitalization and a rapidly aging population, the health status of rural older adults in China has become a matter of growing social concern. While there is a significant correlation between the rural environment and the health status of rural older adults, less attention has been given to the underlying mechanisms by which the rural environment influences their health. Drawing on data from the 2020 China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS), this study explores the complex relationships between the rural environment, social adaptation, physical activity, social participation, and the health status of rural older adults, and analyzes the differences across various age groups. The results indicate that the rural environment exerts a significant positive effect on both social adaptation and the health status of rural older adults. At the same time, social adaptation is a mediating variable of the rural environment's influence on the health status of rural older adults, namely that the rural environment partially enhances the health status of rural older adults by improving social adaptation capacity, while physical activity and social participation did not show a significant mediating effect. Additionally, the influence of the rural environment on both social adaptation and the health status of rural older adults increases with age, and the mediating role of social adaptation similarly becomes more pronounced with aging. This study highlights the differential impacts of the rural environment on social adaptation and the health status of rural older adults across age groups, offering a scientific basis for developing more targeted health intervention strategies for older adults.",

          "abstract": "Whereas longevity differences between movers and stayers are well‐known, the impact of migration on regional disparities in longevity remains understudied. We estimated the contribution of internal migration to regional life expectancy levels and disparities across the Netherlands, thereby assessing the importance of different age groups. We used mortality and demographic data by internal migrant status, COROP (NUTS‐3) region, age and sex from the Dutch population register, including the native population aged 10+ in 2015–2019. We compared regional disparities in life expectancy at age 10 (e10) for the observed population and hypothetical ‘no‐migration’ population using each individual's place of residence 10 years earlier. We also applied age‐decomposition methods. The range in e10 across the 40 COROP regions was 2.22 years for males and 2.54 years for females. Artificially putting movers back into their region of origin yielded differences in regional e10 of between −0.2 to 0.3 years for males and −0.5 to 0.3 years for females, and – on average – 1.65% (males) and 4.17% (females) reduced regional disparities in population‐weighted standard deviation of e10. The age groups that contributed most to the difference in regional disparities in e10 between the observed and the hypothetical situation were 65+ and 10–29 for males, and 30–64 and 65+ for females. The small impact of internal migration on regional disparities in e10 is likely due to the low proportion of movers. Causal effects (socioeconomic composition, health behaviour prevalence) appear more important in determining regional life expectancy disparities in the Netherlands than selection effects.",

          "abstract": "Housing is a fundamental determinant of individual and household well‐being. In fertility research, its role has traditionally been examined through homeownership, yet the impact of housing expenditure—including mortgage payments, rent, bills, and maintenance expenses—remains underexplored. This study extends the literature by analyzing the relationship between housing expenditure and childbearing in Italy. Using data from the Bank of Italy's Survey on Household Income and Wealth (1998–2016), we uncover two key findings. First, higher housing expenditure is positively associated with childbearing, but only among homeowners, not tenants. This suggests that property ownership and improved housing conditions are perceived as essential prerequisites for parenthood in Italy. Second, this relationship holds exclusively for wealthier households—those who can sustain both higher housing costs and the financial demands of raising children. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the increasing prerequisites for parenthood, underscoring the relevance of housing prerequisites. Homeownership—even if it leads to a financial burden—represents a crucial milestone in the childbearing process, at least in Italy.",

          "authors": "Hila Zaban, Orit Unger",
          "abstract": "This paper examines lifestyle migration to Thailand as part of an emerging culture of migration shaped by socio‐political instability and economic uncertainty. Focusing on migrants from a politically and economically volatile context, it highlights the timing of this migration trend and explores how personal and collective crises influence mobility decisions. Situating these dynamics within global migration patterns and parallel cases, the paper employs the concept of social imaginaries to investigate how Thailand is perceived as an ideal destination due to its affordability and relaxed lifestyle. These perceptions, alongside practical factors such as visa flexibility and community support, shape migration choices. Notably, many migrants reject the term ‘migration′, opting for less permanent and more positive framings. By analysing lifestyle migration in times of crisis, this paper expands the scope of lifestyle and privileged migration research, examining the role of privilege in mobility.",

          "authors": "Anna Prashizky",
          "abstract": "This study examines the remittance practices of Ukrainian female Prewar labour migrants in Israel and their evolving roles as economic providers and transnational actors amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Based on 26 in‐depth interviews and participant observations conducted at a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) in Jaffa, the study employs an interpretative analysis to explore the intersections of gender, migration, and conflict. The central argument is that wartime remittances reflect a complex and ambivalent phenomenon: while migrant women express deep national solidarity by channelling their earnings across multiple levels of obligation—including close family members, local communities, and the broader national cause—they simultaneously voice strong mistrust towards the Ukrainian state, rooted in long‐standing public perceptions of systemic corruption. In this context, remittances function both as expressions of moral commitment and as critiques of institutional failure. The study sheds light on the gendered dimensions of transnational support in conflict settings and the emotional tensions embedded in the act of giving.",
