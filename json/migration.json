          "authors": "Samer Bakkour, Rama Sahtout",
          "abstract": "International actors have only relatively recently recognized that internal displacement is a strategy, as well as a consequence, of violent conflict, and the subject accordingly continues to give rise to a host of misinterpretations and misunderstandings, including the tendency to view it as a protection challenge, which persists despite the fact that state actors, as the supposed protectors, are also invariably the main perpetrators of displacement. This article seeks to explore and establish the ‘place’ of internal displacement in the Syrian Regime’s political and military strategy in Assad’s ongoing war on the Syrian people. It draws on an emerging literature on displacement, along with a range of reports on the Regime’s internal displacement activities in the Civil War, to propose that it needs to be engaged and understood as a rational strategy that is being applied to alter existing demographic realities. After zooming in to focus on strategic displacement in particular, it seeks to demonstrate that displacement should not just be understood in terms of its military significance, but also as a mechanism that the Regime uses to reconfigure and rearrange existing political and social realities.",

          "authors": "Claudia Peroni",
          "abstract": "Italy hosts significant numbers of forced migrants throughout its territory. The implementation of asylum policy thus occurs in diverse and sometimes fraught contexts, presenting different resources and obstacles. This paper examines how local context shapes the experiences and practices of street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) implementing policy in the Italian statutory asylum system. Semi-structured interviews with workers in two projects, one in a conservative rural area and one in a progressive urban area, show that the urban/rural divide alone is not an appropriate predictor of similarities and differences in policy implementation and outcomes, which are largely shaped by context-specific sociocultural and relational elements. Workers’ off-duty mediation in interpersonal contact between migrants and community members fosters positive encounters that could partially offset traditionally conservative political cultures and hostile attitudes; however, the same cultures and attitudes cause workers to feel isolated and alienated from their community. Furthermore, SLBs’ decision-making practices in both projects are always collegial and constrained by exhaustive rules, largely eliminating the need for individual discretion typical of SLBs and creating instead “group discretionary” bureaucrats. In light of these findings, I argue for increased attention to locality beyond the simple urban versus rural lens, and increased focus on asylum SLBs as a distinct category of “doubly embedded” SLBs participating in both policy implementation and local context.",

          "title": "Beyond Gateways: Unraveling Residential Mobility and Integration In and Out of Chinatowns",
          "authors": "Hao Liang",
          "abstract": "This article examines immigrant residential mobility patterns in and out of ethnic neighborhoods, focusing on the effects of both socioeconomic attainment and coethnic preferences. Using a recently conducted survey sample of Chinese immigrants in Japan, the study reveals four distinct mobility patterns that lead to residence in and out of ethnic neighborhoods. The four types are a combination of mobility between ethnic and majority neighborhoods, including remaining in ethnic neighborhoods, moving from ethnic neighborhoods to majority neighborhoods, remaining in majority neighborhoods, and moving from majority neighborhoods to ethnic neighborhoods. Varying levels of socioeconomic resources and coethnic residential preferences influence these patterns. They show that ethnic neighborhoods, while serving as essential gateways that offer an initial foothold for newcomers, also act as hubs for cultural affiliation for those with high coethnic preferences, leading some immigrants to move from majority to ethnic neighborhoods. The results also highlight the role of ethnic housing agents in securing housing for socioeconomically disadvantaged immigrants and underscore the importance of language proficiency in achieving spatial assimilation. These results emphasize the significance of mobility pathways in residential integration and suggest potential differences in the integration processes between traditional and global new destinations.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Maple, Lucy Hovil",
          "abstract": "The three durable solutions (resettlement, local integration, and repatriation) are out of reach to most refugees. Even when they are offered, they are often watered down or repackaged, so that their durability has been undermined. This paper examines their contemporary role and framing and proposes an urgent recalibration of our understanding of the solutions based around three interlinked elements. First, to recover the core function of all three durable solutions, namely the (re)gaining of citizenship; in order, second, to shift the conversation away from assumptions about the sedentary nature of durable solutions; which, third, draws out a greater understanding of the potential collaboration and connections between these traditional solutions and ground-level solutions that refugees create for themselves. We argue that not only are each of these elements important in and of themselves, but they also need to be viewed as indivisible.",

          "abstract": "Despite a growing literature on refugee health challenges, the effects of inflows of refugees on the utilization of health services in host communities remain largely ignored. Linking data on the location of displaced populations and geo-referenced survey data on the use of maternal health services in 30 sub-Saharan African countries, we explore whether geographical proximity to refugee- and internally displaced person (IDP) camps and settlements affects the utilization of maternal health care among women in host communities. More specifically, we apply a mother fixed-effects analysis isolating the effect of hosting refugees and IDPs on the probability of delivering at a health facility. We find that living within 25 km of displaced population significantly increases the likelihood of institutional births. This effect is stronger for the poorest mothers. Our study disproves the common misconception that refugees and IDPs have a negative impact on their host communities. Rather, we find a positive effect of hosting displaced populations.",

          "authors": "Haitong Mo, Yuting Liu",
          "abstract": "Young adults in large cities are experiencing serious livelihood challenges, notably precarious employment, housing difficulties, and diminished fertility intention. Existing research on the interplay between fertility and housing has yet to fully capture the intergenerational dynamics. This study utilised questionnaires and in‐depth interviews conducted in a typical China's large city, Guangzhou, to examine the associations between the housing condition and the fertility intention of young adults, across different types of parental support, that is, ‘without parental support’, ‘stay at parents' home’, ‘support renting’, ‘support for partial down payment and/or mortgage’ and ‘support for full payment of homeownership’. Findings indicate that the housing condition significantly and positively associates with the fertility intention, but only for those without parental support or receiving support for partial down payment and/or mortgage. A comparative analysis across the five parental support categories reveals that, the association between the housing condition and the fertility intention is significantly stronger for the group ‘support for partial down payment and/or housing mortgage’ compared to those ‘without parental support’, ‘staying at parents' home’ and receiving ‘support for full payment of homeownership’. This study highlights the cost–utility dynamics of housing, the intergenerational wealth flows, and the gender strategic interactions as crucial underlying mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Shuai Wang",
          "abstract": "As China's urbanisation approaches saturation, the dynamics of migration have shifted from rural out‐migration to urban out‐migration. This shift has rendered children of migrants remaining in urban China understudied. By comparing children of migrants and children of non‐migrants in an urban border setting—Hunchun City, Northeast China, this study examines the association between parental migration and children's life satisfaction through various potential mediating indicators within two dimensions: parents' (a) material support and (b) emotional support. This study employs a mixed‐methods approach, conducting an original data set with children ( N = 639) and in‐depth interviews with children, parents, grandparents and schoolteachers ( N = 41). The findings reveal that across different types of parental migration (father‐only, mother‐only, both‐parent migration), children with both parents migrating have significantly lower life satisfaction than children of non‐migrants, while parents' emotional support mediates significantly more than the material support. It further suggests that children with both parents migrating develop a defensive stance toward their needs as a response to their parents' absence. Specifically, they exhibit resistance to seeking parental assistance when needed, raising critical questions regarding children's resilience and highlighting the complex interplay between family dynamics and children's subjective well‐being in the context of parental migration.",
