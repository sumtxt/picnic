          "authors": "Patrick McGovern, Eiko Thielemann, Omar Hammoud-Gallego",
          "abstract": "What is the role of the market economy and of the European Union in shaping policies that limit migrants’ access to the labour market? While much of the existing research has examined the development of border policies in Europe, less attention has been given to post-entry measures regulating the employment of Third Country Nationals. We examine the role of different market economies and the European Union in devising lesser-known measures that target migrant labour market competition. Focusing on the period from 1990 to 2020, we analyse four case studies: Austria, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. We hypothesize that these migrant labour market competition measures (MCM) have emerged in ways that challenge both the marketization of migration thesis and predictions from theories of EU immigration policymaking and varieties of capitalism (VoC). While the European Union’s influence partially explains the adoption of some selective policies, the emergence of MCM transcends the VoC framework. Furthermore, contrary to marketization claims, states have sought to address labour market concerns about competition from migrants by adopting selective, rather than indiscriminate, regulatory approaches. We argue that the interplay between selectivity and measures restricting migrant labour market competition has become central to understanding how states regulate migration in the European Union.",

          "authors": "Justyna Salamońska",
          "abstract": "In this article, I build on existing research on destination outcomes and migration patterns to better understand West to West mobility within the European Union. I use a unique dataset, the European Internal Movers Social Survey, which was conducted in five countries, with movers who lived in Britain, France, Germany, Italy or Spain and came from one of the other four countries in the sample. The results of the analysis point to a complex relationship between selected destination outcomes (economic, social ties, attachments) and migration patterns(one-off, repeat or multiple). Multiple migrants tend to have better outcomes than one-off movers in relation to the labour market (in terms of being in employment) and destination country networks, but they attach less to the destination country. It seems that multiple migrants invest their resources selectively, and lower attachment to the destination country could be related to the possibility of further mobility. Repeat migrants are more likely to be employed than one-off migrants, but otherwise they do not differ in how they fare in destination in terms of social ties and attachments.",

          "authors": "Andrzej Stawicki, Małgorzata Dziekanowska",
          "abstract": "The subject of the study was the reaction and self‐organization of Polish society to the sudden influx of war refugees from Ukraine after 24 February 2022. The mass response of the Polish society and the provision of aid to approximately 5 million Ukrainian refugees was a phenomenon extensively discussed in various forums. The situation required developing new crisis management mechanisms almost from scratch, as the existing system could not handle the sudden large influx of people. This provided an opportunity to study the mechanisms that prevented a serious humanitarian crisis in border regions. A quantitative and qualitative analysis identified the key factors responsible for the efficiency and resilience of the response. The study used a proprietary index to measure social resilience and supplemented it with in‐depth qualitative research on key crisis response actions. We describe the mechanisms responsible for the system's quick reaction and stabilization. The research revealed diverse forms of self‐organization in Polish society, ranging from informal groups to formal state institutions. This variety enabled flexible adaptation to rapidly changing situations. These initiatives operated independently with different coordination mechanisms, which could not be unified. While the lack of a single coordination mechanism might be seen as a weakness, it allowed for a resilient and comprehensive response on the regional system scale.",

          "authors": "Daniel Herda",
          "abstract": "The first Donald Trump Presidency created a hostile government context of reception for immigrants with its restrictionist approach to migration policy. Segmented assimilation theory argues that such regimes contribute to reactive ethnicity, which can involve increased identification with the origin culture and adversarial stances towards the receiving society. The current study examines this and other possible responses to Trump's ascent among Latinx immigrants. Using pooled cross‐sectional regression, this analysis tracks feelings towards in‐groups and out‐groups at three time periods—(1) the 2016 campaign, (2) between the election and inauguration and (3) during the early presidency. Results identify spikes in negative attitudes towards White Americans and positive feelings towards immigrants at the onset of his administration, following reactive ethnicity. The findings also identify important nuance in how immigrants react to hostility, including reactive solidarity with non‐native out‐groups and a pronounced pattern of in‐group identification among the most acculturated respondents. This study concludes by interpreting these patterns and offering recommendations for future research, particularly as we begin the second Trump Presidency.",

In this article, we draw on theoretical insights from Deleuze and Guattari (2005), Browne (2010) and Amaro (2022) to construct a constellation of historical fragments of computing the face. We move away from a mere focus on bias in facial recognition algorithms and shift our attention towards the structural conditions that organise machine learning around the assumption of race. We unravel four fragments: departing from current proposals for the implementation of facial recognition in EU border management, we historicise computing the face through zooming into practices of physical anthropology and anthropometry in both the Belgian colonial context and by Bertillon and Galton where identification and classification intersected, and the technology of vision of early facial recognition systems. With our article, we show how computing the face has historically been intertwined with racialising instruments and effects and how current proposals on using facial recognition in EU border control are underpinned with a colonial epistemic gaze.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the extent to which time spent abroad contributes to human capital, using higher income as an indicator. Utilising Finnish register data, the study focused on returning migrants with higher education ( N = 3497), matched with a reference population ( N = 30,882). Time abroad was associated with a higher income level upon return amongst men (returnees €63,199, reference €55,982), but not amongst women (returnees €39,316, reference €41,779). In sectors, such as industry, construction, sales and finance, returnees showed particularly significant income differences compared to the reference group. However, even in these sectors, the association between international experience and subsequent income levels appeared to be notably stronger amongst men than women. In these sectors, men's income grew more, with increases of €8678 to €19,363 annually, while women's gains were €1685 to €9582. Overall, while time abroad enhances human capital, the benefits vary substantially by gender and sector. Men experienced clearer income growth compared to their counterparts in the reference group, whereas for women, no similar accumulation of human capital was identified.",

          "abstract": "The internationalisation of higher education has revealed the importance of understanding the formation and dynamics of academic diasporas. Most studies focus on cohesive academic diasporas, overlooking fragmentation in diasporas as a central concern. In this paper, we define and theorise fragmented academic diaspora. The emergence of a highly fragmented diaspora of scholars from Turkey in the British higher education sector presents an ideal opportunity to examine the notion of a fragmented academic diaspora. Based on an online study of 20 scholars from Turkey in British academia, this paper investigates the formation of an academic diaspora fragmented across social fault lines. We examine the factors driving the formation of a fragmented academic diaspora, the boundaries defining this community and the challenges it faces. Additionally, we discuss these scholars' professional and personal experiences and investigate their integration into the academic landscape of Britain. Based on the expectations and aspirations of the participants, we propose strategies to leverage fragmentation within this academic diaspora as a pathway to fostering synergies amidst fragmentation and divisiveness.",

          "abstract": "Some of the reasons for which political parties develop organizations abroad are to represent the emigrants, to mobilize them electorally and to provide support. So far, we know very little about how migrants think about and interpret these actions. To address this gap in the literature, our article aims to explain what drives migrants' perceptions that party organizations abroad represent their interests in their country of origin. We use individual‐level data from an online survey conducted during the summer of 2022 among 1058 Romanian migrants. We find that the perceptions about parties as avenues of representation are a function of both the supply and the demand side. Political parties that are active and instill trust, people's interest in politics and perceived discrimination have strong effects.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we investigate how vulnerability functions as a governance tool in the reception of asylum seekers and other migrants, focusing on how vulnerability frames access to social and material assistance (e.g., information and counseling, accommodation). We contribute to and advance debates on the increased reliance on the concept of vulnerability in migration and asylum governance by mobilizing a policy mobility perspective. Drawing on case studies in Cádiz (Spain) and Marseille (France), we examine how vulnerability as a mobile policy concept becomes embedded in these sites as it encounters specific constellations of actors, institutions, and regulatory frameworks. Our analysis shows that the vulnerability concept easily adapts to the logics of (neo-)liberal marketization, and to both the “nativist” and “globalist” discourses that currently circulate in migration policy and public debate. We argue that the persistence of the vulnerability framework in migration governance is due to its flexibility and ability to serve diverse political agendas. In conclusion, we argue that a policy mobility perspective tempers the idea that a more coherent or inclusive definition would “fix” the problem of vulnerability governance and strengthen rights and protection for people on the move.",

          "authors": "Guilherme Kenji Chihaya, Charlotta Hedberg",
          "abstract": "Migrants benefit differently from their educational credentials depending on their origin. We use the case of Sweden to study the strategies that migrants adopt to overcome barriers keeping them from fully using their education in the host society's labor market. We used administrative register data on employment, self-employment, unemployment, parental leave, and education to classify nine-year-long labor-market sequences of a cohort of migrants. Optimal matching and cluster analysis yielded five sequence types from which incorporation strategies can be inferred. We studied how institutional barriers to the transferability of human capital moderate the association between education and sequence type. We found that the association between education and the probability of each labor market sequence type depended on the institutional dissimilarity between origin and host country, even when linguistic dissimilarity and cultural dissimilarity were accounted for. Favored by supranational institutional arrangements that standardize educational credentials, migrants whose origin country was a member of what later became the European Higher Education Area avoided inactivity by converting their human capital into early employment. In contrast, highly educated migrants from other parts of the world tended to first obtain Swedish educational credentials before entering the labor market. Strategies based on self-employment were not related to education regardless of migrant origin and resulted in much lower earnings. Our findings show that differences in the transferability of human capital can produce diverse incorporation outcomes by shaping which strategies migrants adopt to navigate the context of reception.",

          "abstract": "The concept of “legitimacy” can foster new insights and be of wide relevance to migration research: states seek to exercise “legitimate” power to regulate movement, organizations strive for “legitimacy” in their fields, and individuals want to occupy “legitimate” positions. The concept's usage, however, is largely isolated to specific contexts and cases. Those looking to engage it in their work face at least two challenges: (1) existing studies understand and apply legitimacy in different ways; and (2) there are no well-defined theoretical perspectives in the field to draw on. To facilitate such engagement, I first propose some shared understandings of legitimacy—namely a definition and conceptualization—that are widely applicable, amenable to diverse perspectives and approaches, and analytically useful. I then outline a theoretical perspective—one relating legitimacy to the actions of key players in migration (individuals, groups, organizations, states, etc.)—that can help researchers integrate legitimacy into their work, seek new avenues for future study, and bring the concept into wider conversations in the field. Finally, I illustrate how these arguments can enable new insights by expanding first on the theory of functional imperatives, followed by three substantive areas of migration research: the implementation and effectiveness of migration policies; the migration state and federalism; and status, deservingness, and social movements.",

          "abstract": "This article looks at the public provision of social assistance to migrant families residing irregularly in London. It traces and explains the reconstitution of social workers’ professional identities and institutionalized practices that made them part of the ‘hostile environment’ the British government has been creating for irregular migrants. Drawing mostly on in-depth interviews with local welfare bureaucrats, social workers, and NGO practitioners, we identify three governmental moves that played a crucial role in turning social workers into border guards: the shifting of financial burden to local authorities; the linking of migrants’ destitution with their irregularity; and the framing of their expulsion as ‘voluntary return’. We employ a theoretical approach that builds on Foucault's differentiation between three principal modalities of power—law/sovereignty, discipline, and security—and highlights the productive interplay between them. Our analysis shows how the logics of law, discipline, and security complement and reinforce each other within policy, discourse, and everyday practice, and how this contributes to resolving inherent contradictions that otherwise hamper social workers’ participation in immigration control. The findings help to explain the often surprisingly smooth internalization of immigration control into public welfare institutions and to better understand the organizational modalities of everyday bordering within liberal-democratic states.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative study examines the precarious journeys that Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh embark upon in order to reach other countries, with the aim of elucidating the contextual phenomenon of irregular migration. It highlights the intricate interplay between structural constraints and individual agency by drawing upon Giddens’ structuration theory. The study essentially builds on this theory in order to identify which factors influence the structural constraints and individual agency. The structural constraints include extended, forced sojourns in refugee camp, limited livelihood opportunities, educational issues, security concerns, healthcare challenges, and a lack of legal status. Conversely, individual agency delineates desires for durable solutions, peer pressure, and responses to exploitation. This study investigates first-hand narratives in order to identify the interplay between these forces, shedding light on their roles in shaping the irregular migration patterns. Despite the associated risks and uncertainties, the Rohingya undertake these journeys driven by a desire for safety and economic stability. Taking advantage of their situation, human traffickers target the Rohingya, exploit their vulnerability, and entice them to embark on risky journeys. This study, therefore, emphasizes the urgent need to find comprehensive solutions to address the plight of the Rohingya people.",

          "authors": "Cristina Mazzero",
          "abstract": "Bridging forced migration and higher education (HE) studies, this study explores how HE affects the process of displacement (processual dimension) and the related reconstruction of individual identity (identitarian dimension). Detaching from the romanticized notion of education as an empowering tool, it problematizes how HE shapes the structure of opportunities and coercion throughout all phases of displacement. Drawing from in-depth interviews with displaced Belarusian students who were forced to leave the country for political reasons, the article reveals the double-edged role of universities as coercers before displacement and stabilizers after displacement. Counterintuitively, the latter case does not necessarily improve individual agency but rather is still the expression of a constrained set of choices that inevitably affects identity formation. This results in a continuous negotiation between the ‘student’ and the ‘displaced’ dimension, where intrinsic and instrumental values attributed to HE are differently arranged, supporting the analytical fruitfulness of adopting ‘displaced students’ as an analytical category.",

          "authors": "Zafer Buyukkececi",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, the transition to adulthood in Europe has received significant research interest. This study uses data from two rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) to explore longitudinal work and family life courses through a multichannel sequence analysis. This method examines individual work and family events within a holistic context, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how these events interrelate and quantifies similarities and differences in life courses across various indicators of adulthood. To further understand these transitions, the study employs dyadic regressions to identify both temporal and cross‐country similarities and differences. It also introduces a novel approach that evaluates life courses based on substantive patterns and quantitative differences. The findings reveal that individuals from the same country and cohort generally exhibit more similar life courses. Postwar cohorts show the highest level of similarity in their life courses, while younger generations exhibit greater dissimilarity with other cohorts. Yet, within these younger cohorts, there is a trend towards increased homogeneity, indicating a re‐standardization of life courses. The study also highlights regional variations: Southern European countries and those with liberal welfare systems show the most pronounced differences in the transition to adulthood, while Central and Eastern European countries experience the least de‐standardization. Additionally, new patterns of transitioning to adulthood appear to be spreading from Northern Europe to other regions.",

          "authors": "Yangyang Li, Zhongzhi He, Xin (Cathy) Jin, Zhenbin Zhao, Xiaoyong Li, Jian Zhang, Yang Gao",
          "abstract": "This study responds to recent calls in migration research for a thorough investigation of infrastructural injustice in non‐Western contexts. Using the southern Shaanxi migration project as a case study, the largest state‐led population relocation project since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, we highlight three main findings. First, while the project has successfully contributed to ecological restoration and poverty alleviation, it has inadvertently created a passive form of migration infrastructural injustice, resulting in structural fragmentation of migrant families, dysfunctional family dynamics, and unequal intergenerational relationships. Second, although middle‐aged and older‐adult migrants and female migrants are the most vulnerable to infrastructural injustice, they demonstrate infrastructural agency by negotiating and responding to injustices through relational and collectivist approaches. Third, Confucian ethics function as a unique mediator, simultaneously complicit in infrastructural injustice yet capable of mitigating its effects by regulating and reshaping the nature of infrastructure. Finally, we call for situating infrastructural injustice within different cultural paradigms to demonstrate subjective responses that may contradict objective perceptions.",

          "title": "Contributions of Residential and Income Mobility in Different Life Stages to Increasing Low‐Income Rates in Suburban Neighbourhoods",
          "authors": "Timo M. Kauppinen, Aleksi Karhula",
          "abstract": "Socioeconomic residential segregation has been increasing in many cities in Europe and globally. Selective migration is usually considered the main mechanism shaping the socioeconomic trajectories of neighbourhoods, although some studies have suggested it to have only minor contributions. However, it is worth looking, how persons in different life course situations affect these trajectories by their moves or income mobility. Living in a low‐income neighbourhood may be related to a ‘transit stage’ in the life course, for example in the beginning of the work, housing, and family careers, and if the declining income level in the neighbourhood is related to such situations, it may be less indicative of problems in the area. This study explores how selective migration and income mobility have contributed to the income trajectories of suburban neighbourhoods experiencing downward trend in their income level in Finnish cities between 1997 and 2019, and how these contributions are related to different life course situations. We use individual‐level register‐based panel data covering the complete population of Finland and decomposition methods. Our findings emphasise the central role of selective migration in the increasing low‐income rates. Particularly the residential mobility of young childless adults, commonly students, has increased the low‐income populations. However, the main difference to other types of neighbourhoods is the net loss of employed middle‐aged Finnish‐born non‐low‐income residents. This calls for policies improving the attractiveness of these neighbourhoods for the non‐low‐income population.",

          "authors": "Chen Li, Shuangshuang Tang, Xin Li",
          "abstract": "COVID‐19 has significantly affected vulnerable populations worldwide, particularly rural migrants in urban China, who have suffered immensely during the pandemic. This article explores how COVID‐19 has influenced rural migrants' sense of belonging across various geographical scales. It posits that the pandemic has acted as an external force that reshaped governance, institutional arrangements and government policies, resulting in a new socio‐spatial order that has reconstructed rural migrants' experiences of belonging. In Nanjing, the article finds that rural migrants diminished sense of belonging to the city is linked to strict COVID‐19 measures, inadequate government support and ongoing institutional discrimination. Conversely, their sense of belonging to neighbourhood communities has improved due to increased opportunities for participation in community governance and activities. Additionally, their sense of belonging within their dwellings is influenced by personal experiences and interactions. Ultimately, this article enhances our understanding of the geographies and politics of belonging, offering insights into how urban China's unique governance structure during COVID‐19 has impacted rural migrants' sense of belonging and civil rights.",

          "title": "The Dual Employment Destinations for Rural Cambodians: Skills, Distance and Non‐Monetary Returns on Migration",
          "authors": "Caitlin Finlayson, Nicholas Harrigan, Ariane Utomo, Van Touch, Andrew McGregor, Katharine McKinnon, Brian R. Cook",
          "abstract": "This paper applies the dual labour market migration concept to Cambodia and Thailand. We examine the migration patterns of 9066 individuals from 2507 households in rural Northwest Cambodia, distinguishing between internal migration within Cambodia and international migration to Thailand. We find that individuals from households with fewer resources, such as education, income, and land ownership, tend to migrate to Thailand, while those with more resources prefer internal migration within Cambodia. To deepen our contextual analysis of large‐scale census data, we utilise 122 photos and stories related to the census data collection. Our findings indicate that members of low‐resource households prioritise work in Thailand because it is geographically closer than the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh; it offers relatively higher monetary returns (around USD$12/day vs. $7.5/day in Cambodia); and migration is enabled by leaving children in Cambodia to be raised by grandparents. In contrast, members of high‐resource households prioritise internal migration because Thai language requirements exclude them from primary labour sector jobs in Thailand, they can access family and manage care of children more easily, and they are able to maintain their social status and social networks. This research shows how physical and social distance interact with non‐monetary factors and skill‐based dual labour markets to generate complex patterns of migration both across and within national borders in Southeast Asia.",

          "authors": "Tony Capstick, Katarina Mozetič, James Simpson",
          "abstract": "The paper advances our understanding of care in transnational families by exploring how proximate family members engage in care within two institutional contexts, a school and a hospital. It considers how care processes and outcomes are shaped by the transnational character of families and by the related power dynamics inherent within families and institutions. It does so by studying language and literacy practices that people engage in when they act as language brokers and literacy mediators for family members who are accessing care. Working with two families in the United Kingdom and Sweden, our analysis draws on fieldnotes, interviews with caregivers, and interactional data. We describe the language and literacy practices and interactional events associated with our participants' institutional encounters, relating them to individuals' intersecting positionalities. Analysis demonstrates the ways in which these practices enable them to challenge inequalities inherent in health and educational systems.",

          "title": "Spatial Opportunity Structures and Final Home Leaving Among Young Adults in Norway",
          "authors": "Anna Maria Santiago, Lena Magnusson Turner, Hans Christian Sandlie",
          "abstract": "Previous studies in Norway found that leaving the parental home in young adulthood was facilitated by a generous welfare state coupled with cultural and normative values emphasising early independence and residential stability. Nonetheless, little is known about how spatial opportunity structures in Norway have contributed to recent patterns of home leaving. Using longitudinal register data for the period between 1991 and 2018, we assess the influence of spatial opportunity structures on final home leaving for four cohorts of Norwegian young adults ( N = 216,778). For most Norwegian young adults, median age at final home leaving was 23 years but varied by gender, country background, and centrality level. Accelerated Failure Time models found predicted median age at final home leaving to be 12−18 months younger for women across all country background groups and reduced for young adults whose independent households were established in either more rural or urban municipalities in Norway. Our methodological approach clearly reveals the importance of interregional differences in spatial opportunity structures on patterns of home leaving. Future research should ascertain what the spatial drivers are that facilitate or delay independent household formation, which should be of interest to policymakers trying to promote a national ethos of equality of opportunity.",
