          "title": "Acquiring intangible remittances for Ukraine by female war migrants: is there a ‘cumulative advantage effect’?",
          "authors": "Izabela Grabowska",
          "abstract": "This article—part of the Special Issue on “(In)tangible Remittances and Inequalities”—investigates the acquisition of social remittances by Ukrainian female war migrants in Poland. It focuses on how these women leverage various resources—human, psychological, social, and economic—to potentially contribute to Ukraine’s development during the ongoing conflict with Russia since February 2022 and in the eventual post-conflict period. This wave of Ukrainian war migration is notably rich in resources, particularly in terms of higher education, providing a basis for the formulation of this study. The research is framed within the concept of intangible remittances and incorporates the cumulative advantage effect , which suggests that individuals with more initial intangible resources are more likely to gain additional advantages, thereby enhancing their ability to generate intangible remittances. The study combines quantitative data from a novel survey with an anonymous feedback for participants measuring the level of their resources, conducted via the My Migration Dashboard ( https://mymigration.academy/ ) of 344 Ukrainian female war migrants, with qualitative follow-up insights from 20 in-depth interviews with female participants with higher education. Key quantitative findings reveal that although education and other intangible assets such as soft and cognitive skills, resilience and social networks contribute to cumulative advantage, two unique predictors stand out: civic engagement, which opens up further opportunities for education and training, and autonomous reflexivity which facilitates independent decisions. Key qualitative findings reveal that Ukrainian female war migrants intend to apply the following in Ukraine: educational practices, professional development, life-long learning approach, work ethics, mental health support and social inclusivity. They do not intent to remit to Ukraine a ‘colonial mindset’.",

          "title": "Cradles of resilience: fertility and the fear of erasure among Syrian refugees in Lebanon",
          "authors": "Jasmin Lilian Diab",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon of ‘high’ birth rates among Syrian refugees in Lebanon, framed as, in their own words, “a human instinctive response to a profound fear of extinction.” Drawing from the concept of existential anxiety, theories of trauma and cultural identity theory, as well as on qualitative data from interviews with 278 Syrian refugees, the study delves into the psychological and sociocultural factors that underpin this demographic trend. It highlights how, against the backdrop of protracted displacement and uncertainty, many Syrian refugees perceive high fertility as a strategy for cultural and familial survival. The paper examines the intersection of trauma, displacement, and reproductive behaviour, revealing a complex narrative where fears of loss, erasure, and the desire to preserve identity manifest through increased birth rates. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of refugee experiences, shedding light on how existential fears shape reproductive decisions and challenging conventional perspectives on population growth within refugee communities.",

          "authors": "Steffen Pötzschke, Bernd Weiß",
          "abstract": "Sampling remains a major challenge when researching minority populations, especially in cross-national settings. While various sampling methods are established in the field, most of them cannot easily be implemented globally. However, worldwide operating Social Networking Sites provide an opportunity for the recruitment of certain hard-to-reach populations in almost all countries. Targeting German emigrants through paid advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, we aim to ascertain whether such ads could be used to recruit a nonprobability emigrant sample on a global scale. Specifically, we look at two aspects: relative cost efficiency and coverage. Using this approach, we achieved 3,816 completed surveys from emigrants in 148 countries and territories. The method also yielded good results in world regions where other surveys faced severe coverage issues. Furthermore, a considerable share of the sample could not have been reached using German population registers as a sampling frame, which otherwise constitutes the most promising alternative approach.",

          "authors": "Anton Neronov, Tuba Bircan",
          "abstract": "Academic research and policy discussions commonly define ‘skill’ in migration through the lens of formal qualifications, focusing almost exclusively on economic migrants with tertiary educations. Our systematic review of scholarly literature on skilled migration to, from, and within the EU+ confirms this empirical pattern, revealing a persistent narrowing of the concept. This narrow framing has been widely critiqued within migration studies, particularly for its exclusion of refugees, family migrants, and those whose skills lie outside conventional educational metrics. In response to both these findings and the critical debate, we propose a novel reconceptualisation of ‘skill’ that incorporates the notion of contextual adaptability, a migrant's ability to translate and apply their competencies within specific socio‐cultural and economic environments. This multidimensional framework more accurately reflects the diversity of migrant experiences and offers a more inclusive basis for EU migration policy.",

          "authors": "Margaret Walton‐Roberts, Vivien Runnels, Irudaya Rajan Sebastian, Atul Sood, Sreelekha Nair, Philomina Thomas, Corinne Packer, Ronald Labonté, Ivy Lynn Bourgeault",
          "abstract": "India has become one of the key sources for the global nursing labour force. While there is significant research on the experiences of Indian‐trained nurses in destination countries and their motivations to migrate, relatively less work explores the role of the sending state in this policy field, and rarely are subregional differences considered. In this paper, we focus on the policies and processes that are designed to or otherwise affect nurse migration from India. We draw upon three sources of data: (1) a scoping review of published literature on health worker migration in India, (2) a survey of 1736 health workers in India and (3) interviews with 60 key political and organisational representatives across two regions of India—Kerala and Punjab—as well as from the Delhi Capital Region. Our assessment of the role of the Indian sending state in the international migration of nurses reveals the existence of contradictory policies that are regionally differentiated and distinct. These important subnational jurisdictional policies differ in terms of context, competencies and coherence in managing health worker migration and its resulting impacts on health systems. This research highlights the need to understand jurisdictional differences in any analysis of sending state perspectives on international health worker migration to more fully assess its implication for domestic health systems and changing dynamics in international migration.",

Drawing on qualitative data from 23 semi‐structured interviews with female returnees in Senegal in 2023, the research reveals how female migrants negotiate their reintegration with hegemonic norms of femininity and masculinity and how they position themselves in their families and communities after return. It elucidates how hegemonic norms, families and communities heavily shape the experiences of the women after returning. The findings emphasise the significance of gender‐sensitive frameworks in academia and policymaking, advocating for a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced by women within African return and reintegration contexts.",

          "title": "The Rippling Effects of European Migration Governance in Africa: A Critical Research Agenda and Analytical Approach",
          "authors": "Cathrine Talleraas, Ida Marie Savio Vammen",
          "abstract": "This article advances the concept of “rippling effects” as an analytical approach in research on European migration governance in Africa. By adopting a targeted reflexive lens, it adds a conceptual dimension to critical externalization research—a growing yet fragmented field of inquiry that foregrounds Afrocentric, historized, and grounded perspectives. The article examines the far-reaching implications of European externalization interventions in Africa through a review of recent literature and shows how European migration governance extends across new territories and policy domains, engaging stakeholders across scales and fields. These interventions generate effects that reach well beyond their immediate and intended policy outcomes, particularly as they intersect with African actors and realities that simultaneously shape and resist them. By conceptualizing such implications as rippling effects , the article captures the multiscalar, often less visible, and potentially cumulative implications of migration governance, and moves externalization policy assessment beyond the binary of success or failure. Instead, the article offers an analytical approach that captures how interventions trigger local as well as broader political and societal transformations. As an introduction to the Special Issue, The Rippling Effects of European Migration Governance in Africa, we present the articles included in the collection and situate the research discourse on externalization within the increasing securitization of European migration governance, and its intersections with emerging shifts in current African geopolitics.",

          "abstract": "As population aging accelerates, understanding the living arrangements of older adults – particularly their coresidence with children – is crucial to addressing their diverse needs. While intergenerational coresidence has been widely studied across countries and over time, regional differences within countries remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining regional variations in intergenerational coresidence among older adults in China, a country historically marked by high coresidence levels but facing rapid aging, profound socioeconomic changes, and widening regional disparities in past decades. Using data from the 2000 Chinese Census and multilevel modelling, we analyze coresidence patterns among 871,123 older adults across 340 prefectures. Our findings reveal significant regional variation, with coresidence rates ranging from 20% to 86%. Individual factors explain only 8% of this variation, while regional factors, particularly the proportion of elderly and agricultural employment, are the strongest determinants. Residual analysis shows that older adults in the most developed urban centres exhibit a higher‐than‐average likelihood of coresidence after accounting for sociodemographic factors, suggesting the sustaining of intergenerational coresidence as families adapt to rapid modernisation. This study underscores the need for regional research to inform targeted policies, particularly in less‐developed areas facing accelerated aging, youth outmigration, and inadequate eldercare systems.",

          "abstract": "Differences in access to higher education are a well‐known contributor to socioeconomic inequalities. Yet, despite considerable interest from policymakers, we know little about the processes linking geographic proximity to academic opportunity. Here we investigate how distance to higher education institutions (HEI) shapes students' academic aspirations. Proximity to HEIs has the potential to reduce the social, financial, and emotional costs of attending university while increasing students' academic exposure. Using Swedish register data, we analyze how 9th‐grade students' choice between academic and vocational upper‐secondary tracks varies with their distance to the nearest HEI. We find that proximity to HEIs is associated with higher likelihood to choose an academic track, mostly within the 25 km around an HEI, and that students from low‐educated backgrounds are slightly more affected by distance compared to students from high‐educated backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the influx of new immigrants into megacities has been progressively increasing, making the exploration of their settlement intentions crucial for addressing both their material and spiritual needs. While previous research has examined migrants' settlement intentions from the perspectives of living and employment, most studies focus on a single life dimension. In contrast, this study investigates the effects of the social dimension by incorporating two key domains: the housing and work domain (including housing affordability and commuting distance) and the social support and urban resource interaction domain (encompassing family and social network support, social belonging, urban identity, and urban resource assessment – such as public service accessibility). Using survey data from Shanghai, this study examines the determinants influencing new immigrants' settlement intentions in megacities. It reveals that housing and work conditions, such as affordable housing and shorter commuting distances, significantly enhance settlement intentions. Additionally, within the social support and urban resource interaction domain, family support, urban identity, social belonging, and positive urban resource assessments all demonstrate strong associations with settlement inclination. By elucidating these multidimensional factors, the study assists policymakers in understanding immigrants' cross‐domain needs to improve social integration strategies.",

          "abstract": "Migration policy in the United Kingdom continues to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable forms of migration, using increasingly punitive policy provisions designed to make life unliveable for those outside narrowing frames of acceptability. Part of this policy involves broadening and deepening precarious forms of status while denying routes to permanence to those considered less desirable. This includes many families with children. Although existing quantitative studies have established links between precarious immigration status, post‐migration stressors and poor mental health outcomes for children and for parents, these studies lack insight into everyday life within a hostile immigration environment, including how people actively encounter and navigate life in precarity. This paper presents new qualitative research exploring the impacts of precarious and uncertain immigration status on the wellbeing of children in the United Kingdom. It uses a novel theoretical framework combining the concept of ontological security with Bourdieu's theory of practice to determine how policies of precaritisation result in the denial of access to resources that contribute to crucial elements of wellbeing. It also provides insight into how people actively navigate these challenges to resist the pressures of exclusionary policy.",

This study explores how migration patterns shifted at the municipal level in Spain right after the pandemic shock, while also examining how the factors traditionally seen as population attractors have evolved over time. We analyse a range of demographic groups, distinguishing between internal migration within provinces and movement across provincial borders. Our findings indicate a clear change in migration trends: municipal size has become less relevant, and labour market conditions have also diminished in importance in interprovincial migration, while municipalities with a higher concentration of secondary residences have become much more attractive.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between the immigrant population and entrepreneurial activities in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of the United States. Using a two‐way fixed effects model on MSA‐level aggregate data, aggregated from individual‐level microdata for five periods from the U.S. Census spanning from 2000 to 2022, we find that higher proportions of the immigrant population at the MSA‐level are significantly associated with increased overall self‐employment rates. This relationship is particularly pronounced for unincorporated self‐employment compared to incorporated self‐employment. Our analysis contributes systematic evidence to the policy discourse surrounding the impact of immigration on economic opportunities for native‐born populations. We observe that immigrants are more inclined to become entrepreneurs and are associated with an overall increase in entrepreneurial activities, suggesting they may generate additional employment opportunities for native‐born individuals rather than displacing them. We also find that policies to incentivize and encourage relocating immigrants from high‐immigrant MSAs to low‐immigrant MSAs may benefit the country by increasing overall entrepreneurial activities. Our findings indicate that a 1% point increase in the foreign‐born population share corresponds to an approximate increase of 0.1% points in self‐employment rates.",

Such inaccuracies have far‐reaching implications for various sectors, including public health, urban planning, and resource allocation. The study leverages the rich data environment provided by the detailed 2018 Colombian census data and its coverage indicator, which create a high‐quality controlled environment to assess the performance of census‐independent population estimation approaches. Drawing from a diverse range of environmental landscapes in Colombia, we evaluate the effectiveness of satellite imagery‐derived settlement maps in conjunction with various modeling techniques. We explore two estimation approaches based on settlement maps: a data‐driven machine learning approach exemplified by a random forest model and a process‐driven probabilistic approach exemplified by a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our findings underscore the efficacy of Bayesian modeling in addressing data scarcity and bias, providing robust estimates and quantifying model uncertainty. However, the random forest model performs better when data inputs are detailed and unbiased. We further emphasize the importance of considering settlement map characteristics in the modeling process, while recognizing the overall limitations of relying solely on satellite imagery for population counts. Through a rigorous evaluation of different stages of the population modeling pipeline—data input, model selection, and outcome assessment—this study provides key insights into the challenges and requirements of using satellite imagery‐derived settlement maps for population estimation in data‐scarce contexts.",

          "authors": "Derick Blaauw, Anmar Pretorius, Catherina Schenck, Danie Meyer",
          "abstract": "The fallout of the Covid‐19 pandemic exacerbated the already challenging conditions prevailing among the day labourers in South Africa. We investigated the labour market outcomes (especially income) of day labourers after the Covid‐19 pandemic by focusing on day labourers, both local and foreign, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The methodology for our investigation was based on protocols used in other international and South African studies on various aspects pertaining to day labouring in the Global North and Global South. The fieldwork was carried out in the second half of 2021—completing 241 structured interviews. Regression results indicate that, in general, day labourers' experience and ability to negotiate their wages before accepting a job are the main determinants of their income. Site size matters more for migrants compared to locals, while performing a highly skilled job matters more for local South Africans. Since the bargaining position of workers in the informal economy continues to be eroded in the aftermath of the Covid‐19 pandemic, day labourers may be especially affected, and their structural vulnerability may worsen—and even more so for the migrants.",

          "authors": "Max Nagel",
          "abstract": "This article examines epistemic imbalances in the EU migration literature and their connection to socioeconomic inequalities. While scholarship has largely focused on immigration to EU core countries, emigration—particularly from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)— remains underexplored. Through a meta‐review of 1563 CEE‐focused migration studies (2007–2022) and 9801 studies on EU core countries, the article identifies knowledge silos and academic regionalism as two key challenges. It argues that these structural imbalances hinder comprehensive analyses of migration's socioeconomic effects and policy responses to them. To address this, the article advances a Comparative Political Economy lens to show how the varying structure of interdependent national economies shape these effects and how governments introduce policies to respond to them. It is applied to a case study of Poland's PiS government (2015–2023) to illustrate how peripheral countries can navigate the unequal effects of liberal migration regimes. The findings underscore the need for integrated, cross‐regional and transdisciplinary approaches to account for the interdependence between core and peripheral countries in explaining socioeconomic effects of international migration.",

          "title": "Community Governance During the Shanghai COVID Lockdown III: The Changing Perception of the City",
          "authors": "Xuanyi Nie, Zili Huang, Longfeng Wu",
          "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between community governance during the 2022 Shanghai COVID‐19 lockdown and residents' perception of the city. The perception is constructed by residents' attitudes toward the city and their attachment to the city, which are respectively interpreted by the literature of residential satisfaction and place attachment. Findings indicate that enforced confinement negatively impacts both measurements. Meanwhile, effective community governance, particularly reflected in satisfaction with sustenance distribution, satisfaction with PCR testing arrangements, and perception of community governance staff's roles, positively influences residents' attitudes. However, compared to residents' attitudes, socioeconomic factors, including their hukou, income disruption and job stability, have stronger influences on their city attachment. This study thereby contributes to the literature by advancing the understanding of community governance's role during crises, its differential influences on different population groups, and the emphasis on city‐scale analysis for people–place relationships. This study provides insights for policymakers to enhance urban resilience during crisis management.",

          "title": "The Up and Down Migration at Various Life‐Course Stages: Russia Case Study",
          "authors": "Liliya Karachurina, Nikita Mkrtchyan",
          "abstract": "The paper explores the age‐specific vertical migration in Russia. Vertical migration is understood to be the population resettlement up and down the urban hierarchy–from small villages at the bottom, to large urban agglomerations (megapolises) at the top. The objective is to replicate the approach of Plane and others using the life‐course perspective within the context of Russia. The analysis relies on long‐term internal migration statistics at the level of individual settlements (2011–2020 years). We identify 9 levels of the urban hierarchy–ranging from the largest cities to the smallest villages. Cities, together with their suburbs, are considered as units. Accordingly, if a city is attractive to migrants, its suburbs become attractive too. The results of our analysis show that upward vertical migration is predominant in Russia. The population continues to concentrate at the upper levels of the urban hierarchy, while the lower levels (rural settlements) are rapidly losing population. This observation is true for all age groups. We believe that such centripetal migration, observed across all age groups, is specifically a Russian phenomenon. Also, most migration patterns have high demographic effectiveness, and that ‘jumping’ migrations, skipping over several levels, are more typical than movements between adjacent urban hierarchy levels.",
