          "title": "International migration and the advent of a new demographic era",
          "authors": "Philippe Fargues",
          "abstract": "The paper explores whether international migration is linked to currently decreasing levels of fertility in high birth rates countries, thereby to the advent of a stage of population degrowth at the world's level. Methodology is in two steps. First, a global dataset is assembled comprising 13 variables for each country. For the country itself: emigrant stock, total fertility rate, girls' enrolment rate, women's labour force participation, global gender gap, and income per capita; for a fictitious average region of destination of migrants originating from this specific country, the last six variables. In the second step, links between origin and destination countries in terms of fertility levels and determinants are analysed using bivariate correlations. A remarkable fact emerges, namely national levels of fertility and their determinants vary quasi perfectly parallel at both ends of international migration corridors. Fertility at origin is not correlated to any phenomenon as much as to fertility, girls' school enrolment and gender equity at destination. Three complementary hypotheses explaining this apparently puzzling fact are discussed: transmission of norms by migrants; cultural similarities at both ends of migrant corridors; and congruency between the global diffusion of norms and the global migration of people. The conclusion highlights the original contribution of the paper, both to the demographic discipline (migration should also be dealt with as a remote determinant of fertility) and political debates on migration (erecting barriers to migration works against the preservation of earth).",

          "authors": "Weejun Park",
          "abstract": "This paper examines ‘state brokerage’ in migration infrastructure through South Korea's Employment Permit System (EPS). It introduces the concept of state-led multilevel governance (sMLG)—a synthesis of multilevel governance (MLG) and state transformation (ST)—as a framework for understanding state brokerage, thereby contributing to the greater diversity in migration infrastructure scholarship. By analyzing state archival documents, the paper examines how South Korean state has developed a governance framework that spans multiple political-territorial boundaries through state transformation. The transformation encompasses forging diplomatic relationships with foreign governments and orchestrating cross-border policy collaborations as well as (re)arranging domestic governance by establishing new institutions, enacting and revising laws, and reconfiguring the relationships among these entities. These processes have allowed the EPS to facilitate the migration of less-skilled labor without the involvement of private actors.",

          "title": "Emotional Earmarking: Insights into Remittances and Emotions from a Mixed Methods Study of Migrant Households in Rural Philippines",
          "authors": "Jeremaiah M. Opiniano, Yan Tan",
          "abstract": "Overseas remittances improve the economic conditions and influence the financial behaviors of international migrants’ families that remain in the country of origin. Remittances affect family relationships in the hometown and across transnational borders, but migration research has not yet analyzed these family dynamics through the lens of household finance. Recent studies address the remittance–emotion nexus partially and statically rather than holistically and dynamically, delivering an insufficient understanding of complex and evolving links mediated by the sending, using, and investing of remittances. Built on an existing family financial socialization model, and using mixed methods for case studies in two rural municipalities of the Philippines, this study sets out to determine how emotions come into play as families strive to use remittances productively. A central finding is that migrant households employ what we call emotional earmarking to bring about economic benefits along with concurrent emotional benefits to family relationships. This emotional earmarking can help families (as well as migration and development stakeholders) in the productive use of remittances and the maintenance of family connections despite the physical absence of migrant members.",

          "authors": "Sonja Fransen, Alexander Hunns, Tarek Jaber, Teresa Janz",
          "abstract": "Forcibly displaced people are at the forefront of climate emergencies worldwide. This article reviews the growing literature on climate risks for displaced populations to synthesize knowledge, highlight gaps, and develop a theory-driven research agenda. Our synthesis shows that displaced populations are disproportionately at risk of being negatively impacted by climate hazards, due to their high sensitivity, limited adaptive capacities, and, in some cases, heightened exposure. Most studies focus on Southern Asia with a paucity of studies on climate-vulnerable refugee-hosting states in Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Moreover, the literature heavily relies on case studies, which impedes the generalizability and comparability of findings. We argue for an inclusive and comprehensive climate risk research agenda that systematically maps the exposure of displaced populations to climate hazards, provides theory-driven research on how climate sensitivities and adaptive capacities shape their vulnerabilities, and applies comparative research, including host community populations.",

          "authors": "Eugene Michail",
          "abstract": "European receiving societies’ reactions to the increased refugee arrivals of 2015–6 were represented through a for-or-against binary, which focused on whether locals were hospitable or hostile to refugees. This article offers a critical examination of the making and effects of this binary, examining its discursive unfolding in the Greek island of Chios. Its findings show that the repeated use of the for-or-against framing by different actors resulted in the acceleration of the polarization that this representational scheme was purporting merely to describe, benefiting anti-refugee actors on the ground, obscuring a more complex understanding of the root causes of the developing ‘crisis’, and closing down the possibility of host societies imagining a future with refugees. This research contributes to a clearer understanding of the way host societies have been represented in recent years and of how radical political actors took advantage of these discursive practices to claim a central political role.",

          "authors": "Markus Jokela, Eetu Soini, Michael Laakasuo, Suvi Parikka, Anna Rotkirch, Hans Hämäläinen",
          "abstract": "Multiple factors can influence the rates of residential mobility flows between different regions of a country. Studies have often focused on demographic and economic factors, but social conditions may be relevant as well. We examined whether different indicators of social capital (i.e., social support, loneliness, social trust, community participation, cultural activities, and meeting other people) were associated with population migration rates across 299 municipalities of Finland. Data for the social characteristics were derived from the Regional Health and Wellbeing study ( n = 100,750 respondents) aggregated to the level of municipalities using multilevel regression with post‐stratification (median number of participants was 115 individuals per municipality, range from 5 to 10,616). Residential mobility rates were derived from census data. Municipalities with higher levels of social support, higher social trust, more cultural activities, and more frequent social contacts had higher net migration rates, that is, more people moving in than out of the municipality. Social support, cultural activities, and community participation were associated with higher in‐migration. Social trust and frequency of meeting people were associated with lower out‐migration. The findings provide empirical support for the hypothesis that regions with stronger social capital are more attractive destinations for within‐country residential mobility.",

          "authors": "Senanu Kwasi Kutor, Godwin Arku",
          "abstract": "Husbands' labour migration has ramifications for significant family members, particularly wives left behind. However, limited studies have been conducted to examine the impacts of husbands' migration on women left behind married to international and internal migrants. Drawing on a purposive sampling survey of 298 Ghanaian women (international = 129 and internal = 169) in the Volta Region, we assessed their subjective wellbeing using three dimensions: self‐reported health, self‐reported satisfaction with life, and self‐reported happiness. The results from t‐tests show that on average, international women left behind have higher perceived health (3.72), perceived happiness (3.82) and satisfaction with life (3.19). Results from the multivariable binary logistic regression analyses reveal that while no variables predict self‐reported health for international women left behind, high frequency of communication is statistically associated with internal women left behind self‐assessed health. International women left behind who lived in nuclear households and internal women left behind who reported high wealth quintiles were both statistically associated with satisfaction with life, respectively. While demographic factors (age and duration of marriage) were significant predictors of happiness for international women left behind, neighbourhood type and frequency of communication predicted happiness for internal women left behind. The differences in variables predicting each of the subjective wellbeing dimensions demonstrate the concept's multidimensionality. It also highlights factors influencing subjective wellbeing outcomes of women left behind are not solely due to their husbands' migration. The policy implications of this study are highlighted.",
