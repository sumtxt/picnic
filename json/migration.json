          "authors": "Derya Gogebakan Yildiz, Gokhan Kayir, Haci-Halil Uslucan",
          "abstract": "Currently, German schools are attended by third- and even fourth-generation descendants of Turkish-origin workers who arrived as guests in the 1960s. The experiences of Turkish-origin families can provide valuable insights into Germany’s success in integrating families with migration biographies into the education system and supporting them across generations. This study compares the effectiveness of the German education system in involving and empowering first and second-generation Turkish-origin parents in educational matters, aiming to guide future research and improvements. The study involved 11 parents and six teachers. The interview results showed that first-generation parents were less involved in education processes due to language barriers, felt isolated because of cultural differences, and perceived that teachers and the education system were not sufficiently inclusive in the past. In contrast, the second generation was able to foster closer relationships with the school and participate more actively in education through teacher and parent organisations. Although immigrant parents today have overcome language barriers, they still require support in pedagogical matters. It is recommended that school administrations, teachers, and civil society organisations carry out empowering activities for parents.",

          "authors": "Xiaochen Liang",
          "abstract": "Legal status is increasingly recognized as a hierarchical axis of stratification shaping migrants’ access to employment and rights. The study reported herein examined how three facets of legal status—current categorization, transitions, and initial “starting points”—are associated with the employment conditions of student-migrant-workers (individuals who are on student visas and under post-graduation work permits). Using pooled National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) data from 2015 to 2021, the analysis employed ordinary least squares and logistic regression models, supplemented by propensity score matching, to assess associations between these legal-status facets and annual earnings and four benefits: health insurance, pension plans, profit-sharing, and paid vacation. Findings show that current student-migrant-workers earned significantly less and had poorer benefit access than their comparable counterparts with temporary work visas, dependent visa, permanent residency, or naturalized citizenship. Transitions from student to other statuses (whether temporary, dependent, or permanent) are associated with improved employment conditions, though the extent varies by destination status. Even after becoming permanent, those who initially entered with student visas continued to earn less than those who initially entered with temporary work visas; this disparity narrows over time, but persists for decades. The study contributes evidence that legal-status categorization, transitions, and starting points operate as stratifying mechanisms of employment even among highly educated migrants.",

          "authors": "Pelin Kılınçarslan, Birce Altıok",
          "abstract": "This paper explores how the local turn in migration governance is facilitated through city diplomacy and international networks within highly centralized political systems. Drawing on interviews with municipal representatives, NGOs, and experts in Istanbul, Turkey, it focuses on the drivers behind the city's increasing international engagement in urban migration governance. This article shows that municipalities and local NGOs are increasingly turning to external networks in response to administrative, financial, and political challenges at the domestic level. It introduces the concept of “maneuvering practicality” as a dual-purpose city diplomacy approach that explains how international networking enables city-level actors to balance immediate pragmatic needs with strategic autonomy-building within centralized governance structures. While the recognition of “cities as international actors” has been growing, its implications for urban migration governance, especially in highly centralized contexts, have received relatively less attention both theoretically and empirically. By framing international city diplomacy as both a counterbalancing tool and a resilience mechanism in migration governance, this paper contributes to the emerging scholarship on migration city diplomacy within international relations, urban studies, and migration studies.",

          "authors": "Yixiao Li, Sichuang Chen, Tao Liu",
          "abstract": "China's international migration, accompanying and driving the globalization, has become increasingly important owing to its growing numbers and expanding impact. Given the diversity of international migrants and the complexity of their motivations, this article employs the meta-theoretical framework with estimated data on 5-year bilateral migration flows from 1990 to 2020. This article presents the evolving pattern of China's international migration, compares its immigration and emigration, and identifies their influential factors. China's international migration is growing comparably fast in the world with respect to number and proportion, with deceleration on net emigrant rate. China's international migration is spatially heterogeneous, experiencing declining long-lasting favorable bidirectional connection with Asian countries and increasing preferences for more developed Western countries. Small countries with historical Chinese diaspora communities maintain intensive migration links with China. The numbers of immigrants and emigrants are highly positively correlated owing to their similar influence of economic, development, cultural, religious, or political factors. Apart from the profound similarities, immigration is more influenced by cultural and religious factors and less by economic and development conditions than emigration. The impact of these factors evolves as China continues to develop. Economic and development factors become influential in both directions of migration, but the importance of cultural and religious similarity with China declines.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to contribute to the literature by examining the association between war-induced migration and fertility behaviors through an analysis of women fleeing into Türkiye from Syria, including residents in the destination country, using theoretical frameworks of disruption and adaptation hypotheses. The 2018 Turkey Demographic and Health Survey—Türkiye and Syrian sample data are used within the framework of a life course approach. Discrete-time logistic regression models are used, wherein Syrian refugee women are covered first before the Türkiye sample is added to the modeling. The findings indicate no disruptive effects of migration on fertility outcomes of women among forced migrants compared to non-migrants in a specific year, indicated by a statistically insignificant association between migration and fertility among Syrian refugee women. Finally, no adaptation of fertility of Syrian refugee women to the native population in Türkiye is observed.",

          "authors": "Haobin Fan, Ting Zhang",
          "abstract": "As China's population ages, a rising number of older migrants continue to seek urban employment. This study examines how city‐level development and industry specialization shape their employment prospects. Using individual‐ and city‐level data from 2015 to 2017, we find that older migrant workers are more likely to secure jobs in lower‐tier cities than in top‐tier metropolises like Beijing or Shanghai. This pattern is driven by industry specialization, especially in construction, which creates dense local labour markets and offers wage premiums. These conditions align with older migrants' characteristics: lower education, limited pension coverage, and a stronger preference for wages over housing quality. Our findings provide new insights into aging, labour migration, and urban labour market structure in China.",

          "title": "From Masculinisation to Feminisation of Metropolitan Areas: The Changing Impact of Internal Migration on Regional Sex Ratios in Japan",
          "authors": "Masaki Kotsubo, Tomoki Nakaya",
          "abstract": "In Western countries, more women live in urban or high‐population‐density areas than men, reflecting selective rural‐to‐urban migration by sex. In contrast, the sex ratio of the Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes the capital in Japan, is relatively high compared to other areas within the country, suggesting male‐dominant migration towards that area. However, there were contradictory patterns of recent migration, such as selective migration of women to metropolitan areas and a larger net in‐migration of women to metropolitan areas than men. This can be interpreted to mean that the role of internal migration changed from increasing the sex ratio of metropolitan areas through ‘masculinisation’ to decreasing it through ‘feminisation.’ This study investigates the changes in migration patterns and their impact on the regional sex ratio in Japan using macro‐level data. It first shows the distinctive feature of high sex ratios of inter‐prefectural migrants and migration rates from 1958 to the present. The sex ratio increased until approximately 1990 and decreased thereafter. Subsequently, gender differences in education and employment were summarised as factors related to migration patterns by sex. These differences have gradually become smaller. Finally, this study quantifies the impact of inter‐prefectural migration on prefectural sex ratios using four decennial censuses from 1990 to 2020. The results indicated that the impact of migration changed from ‘masculinisation’ to ‘feminisation’ of the Tokyo metropolitan area and vice versa in the case of nonmetropolitan areas in about 2010. This suggests that the migration patterns in Japan have gradually resembled those of Western countries over the past three decades.",

          "title": "Educational Spaces and Student Mobility: Transiting the Peripheries of the Barcelona Metropolitan Area",
          "authors": "Andreu Termes, Joan Checa",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative case study of student mobility in post‐compulsory secondary education—including both academic and vocational tracks—within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA) between 2019 and 2022. The study investigates the relationship between the territorial distribution of school places, student home‐to‐school mobility, and the configuration of educational spaces. The theoretical framework combines two main approaches: critical geography and structuralism, drawing respectively on the works of Doreen Massey and Pierre Bourdieu. Using quantitative techniques and a comprehensive census database of over 200,000 students, our findings suggest that educational spaces in the BMA are articulated around three key variables: school provision (public, private), educational tracks (academic, vocational), and educational spaces (central Barcelona, elite suburbs, working‐class enclaves). Our analysis—employing, among other techniques, Cramér's V to assess the strength of associations between variables—underscores the socially embedded nature of mobility, which is deeply intertwined with forms of economic and cultural capital. This is reflected in the stark contrast between the mobility patterns of middle‐ and upper‐class students—who display high levels of mobility, particularly through centralisation towards Barcelona and suburban trajectories—and those of working‐class students, whose mobility is more limited and primarily confined to inter‐peripheral movements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and political implications of these findings, particularly in relation to territorial justice and educational equity—considering, for example, the effects of school choice policies and neighbourhood‐based inequalities. We argue that these insights may be applicable to other Southern European metropolitan contexts with comparable educational systems.",

          "authors": "Zhihua Wang, Zengzeng Fan",
          "abstract": "The phenomenon of low fertility rate in China is closely related to the work‐family conflict faced by women. In recent years, flexible work has gradually been regarded as an important measure to balance women's work‐family relationships and solve the current situation of low fertility rates. Employing China Labor‐force Dynamic Survey (CLDS) data from 2014 to 2018, this study utilizes the instrumental variable to test the relationship between flexible work and fertility intention empirically. We find that the higher the flexible work hours, the stronger the fertility intention of women of childbearing age. After excluding the influence of fertility policies, addressing endogeneity issues, and conducting robustness tests in different ways, this conclusion is still supported. Mechanism analysis indicates that flexible work is beneficial in alleviating women's work‐family conflicts, improving individual job satisfaction and life happiness, and thereby promoting an increase in fertility willingness. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of flexible work on fertility intention mainly affects groups engaged in the tertiary industry, state‐owned enterprises, full‐time employment, middle‐ and high‐income earners, married, and those with fertility experience. Further analysis reveals that the family's flexible work hours are beneficial in increasing women's willingness to have children, and flexible work also has a positive impact on actual fertility behavior.",

          "title": "Co‐Ethnic Networks in Ethnic Minority's Migration Destination Choices",
          "authors": "Xinhong Fu, Wanru Xiong",
          "abstract": "Co‐ethnic networks influence people's migration destination choices, particularly for vulnerable populations and ethnic minorities. While the influence of co‐ethnic networks has been well‐documented in the context of international migration, its impact on internal migrants in multi‐ethnic countries remains underexplored. Moreover, previous research has failed to disentangle the impacts of co‐ethnic networks and native‐place networks on migrants' destination choices in the context of internal labour migration due to data limitations. This study takes advantage of a full sample of 53,733 ethnic‐minority labour migrants from X County in China to examine how co‐ethnic networks impact ethnic minority's migration destination choice, and how these impacts vary with migrants' labour mobility. Our findings reveal two key insights: First, migrants are more likely to choose destinations with a large co‐ethnic network compared to migrants from the same region but with different ethnic backgrounds. Second, migrants with disadvantaged attributes, who typically exhibit lower labour mobility, tend to show a stronger preference for destinations with large co‐ethnic communities. This study quantifies the influence of co‐ethnic networks on internal labour migration destination choices and explores their interactions with migrants' labour mobility.",

          "abstract": "Residential mobility is a possible strategy to cope with health challenges in later life. However, little research has examined whether and how health decline triggers residential mobility and whether this relationship differs between parents and childless individuals. Using data on parents and non‐parents aged 50+ from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we perform multinomial logistic regression to examine how recent and previous health events (defined as a decline in acute health, functional limitation, frailty and self‐rated health) influence the 2‐year probability of transitions between care arrangements. We find that recent and previous health declines are not triggering moves towards intergenerational co‐residence, but acute health events, functional limitation and worsened frailty are associated with transitions to home‐based care for parents and non‐parents alike. Additionally, previous health declines have a stronger influence on most residential transitions compared to recent health declines across parental status, suggesting that it takes time for health decline to induce residential mobility. Our findings demonstrate the importance of viewing late‐life residential mobility from a relational framework and highlight home‐based care as a key strategy for responding to health challenges in later life.",

          "title": "Does Later Longer Fewer Campaign Promote Intergenerational Mobility in China?",
          "authors": "Chong Zhuo, Guixin Wang",
          "abstract": "In the 1970s China implemented Later Longer Fewer Campaign (LLFC), it's earliest and most widespread family planning policy. This paper systematically examines LLFC's impact on intergenerational mobility using cohort difference‐in‐differences (DID) and event study. The analysis draws on data from 342 local gazetteers, the 2011–2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), and the 2015 National 1% Population Sample Survey. Following the LLFC's implementation, the average number of years of education among the next generation in affected areas increased by 5.08%, and the likelihood of children from primary‐educated families completing tertiary education increased by 4.28%. In addition to improved education outcomes, the LLFC led to higher annual incomes and a significantly greater probability of individuals becoming technicians and managers. Two main mechanisms explain the LLFC's effect on intergenerational mobility: upbringing awareness transition and increased returns on human capital, with the former playing a more prominent role. The success of incentive‐based family planning policies demonstrates that such approaches can generate substantial upward intergenerational mobility spillover effects.",
