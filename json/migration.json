          "title": "From differences to relations: Towards diaspora‐forming processes",
          "authors": "Patrycja Trzeszczyńska, Grzegorz Demel",
          "abstract": "Already before the full‐scale Russian aggression on Ukraine, Poland has been a country inhabited by autochthonous Ukrainians and has remained a popular destination for their co‐ethnic migrants from Ukraine. Many research on diasporic collectivities and their mutual relations identify various ‘diaspora segments’ or connections of ‘groups’ and ‘communities’ within the given diaspora. The focal point on intra‐diasporic differences is a kind of deconstruction of the seemingly coherent communities. However, it is based on taking their existence for granted. An attempt to overcome this perspective is focusing on diaspora‐forming processes as a non‐essentialist and processual approach that localizes the diaspora in the sphere of social imaginings and cultural practices. The diaspora‐forming processes concept, which this paper offers drawing on the ethnographic fieldwork among Ukrainians in Poland, helps to trace intra‐diasporic relations (instead of differences), and multiple identifications that create diasporic groups in peoples' minds.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the relationships between a comprehensive set of variables and subjective well‐being among a representative sample of 2554 male blue‐collar migrant workers in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The results of multilevel modelling show that mental health, sense of safety and security, job satisfaction, housing and living environment, and institutional trust are among the key predictors of the subjective well‐being of blue‐collar migrant workers. Contradictory to the adverse effects of income inequality on well‐being and the shift of frames of reference, evidence indicates that blue‐collar migrant workers in Abu Dhabi engage in limited social comparison and that the structures of work and daily life matter strongly for this group of workers of low socioeconomic status.",

          "title": "The role of sender credibility in migration information campaigns",
          "authors": "Sandra Morgenstern",
          "abstract": "The actors who carry out migration information campaigns—and thus serve as ‘information senders’—vary greatly. Existing studies on the effectiveness of such campaigns typically focus on one case of an information campaign. It is difficult to compare these case studies because, in addition to the different implementing actors, they differ substantially in terms of the content conveyed and the ways they are carried out. As a result, evidence of the causal effect of the information senders is missing. I argue that who implements the campaign is not trivial, as each type of information sender may be associated with a different level of credibility, and psychological models of information processing suggest that a senders' credibility is key to the impact of information. To corroborate and complement existing research, I present findings from a longitudinal survey experiment in Nigeria among students who were presented with the same hypothetical information campaign while the information sender was varied: each an international and local NGO, government and social contact. The results show overall similar effect directions for the different information senders, namely an increase in awareness of the campaign topic of irregular migration and a reduction of (irregular) migration intentions among the participants. However, notable differences are observed in effect size and effect persistence per sender and opposing actors are most influential regarding general versus irregular migration. Descriptive mediation analyses support the relevance of credibility per sender and imply the existence of a topic‐dependent sender credibility effect.",

          "authors": "Robert Forster",
          "abstract": "The neighbourhood of al-Mankubin was established as an encampment for the displaced of Tripoli, North Lebanon, after a disastrous flood in 1955. This article analyses the history of a lesser-known internal displacement camp in Lebanon and its urban consolidation. In contrast to narratives of Mankubin’s abandonment by the state, this article argues that actors within Lebanon’s fragmented state supported the establishment and growth of the quarter. The issue of squatting on state-owned land is interrogated through an analysis of the flood relief process in the 1950s and the subsequent derailment of the housing project for the flood-displaced. Today, al-Mankubin sits at the intersection of social housing and encampment, perpetuated over seven decades by the absence of land tenure and as a site of convergence for displaced persons and migrants from Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria.",

          "title": "Farming Technologies, Migration and Left‐Behind Women in China: A Socio‐Technical Perspective",
          "authors": "Lena Kaufmann, Han Tao",
          "abstract": "This article sheds new light on the connection between agriculture and rural‐urban migration in contemporary China. Focusing on migrants' places of origin and the case of paddy rice fields, it investigates how rural families cope with the dual challenges of migrating to cities for employment and preserving their fields as safety net resources. In the absence of the middle generation, and especially men, due to migration, it is especially older women who face a double burden of caring not only for the fields but also for their grandchildren. This article is based on multi‐sited ethnographic fieldwork in rural and urban China, including participant observation and interviews with migrating and left‐behind farmers, as well as the analysis of local gazetteers, media reports, agricultural reports and statistics. Taking a socio‐technical perspective on migration, which is also relevant beyond China, the article discusses three exemplary land‐use strategies with a focus on the gendered implications of these strategies. It demonstrates how women who stay draw strategically on available manual and industrial farming technologies and knowledge to actively deal with their households' predicament. It argues that paying more attention to those who stay and their material world enables a better understanding of migration processes and the specific agency of left‐behind women. Moreover, this provides insights into subtly changing family and gender dynamics, including challenging the binary division of technologies used for productive or reproductive labour. In so doing, this article contributes an original, qualitative exploration of the understudied rural side of migration.",
