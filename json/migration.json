          "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in significant disruptions to both international student mobility and labour markets. Against this background, this scoping review documents findings from 35 studies, published between January 2020 and February 2024, that focused on international student mobility, Covid-19, labour market outcomes, and related regulations. The review shows that the Covid-19 pandemic negatively impacted (1) the labour market outcomes of international students before studying abroad, through changes in visa regulations, (2) skill acquisition during their mobility, (3) the duration of their studies, and (4) the availability of jobs during and after their mobility period. These negative impacts occurred at a time when international students’ needs for work were heightened. This ‘double whammy’ was more pronounced among international students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, increasing pre-existing inequalities. It was also affected by students’ residency status and policy changes. These findings underline the critical role that temporality plays in shaping the returns to international student mobility. However, the existing literature on the topic is relatively sparse and has primarily relied upon qualitative approaches and rapid research. Future studies are needed to better understand the impact of Covid-19 on the labour market outcomes of international students.",

          "authors": "Ezgi Tuncer",
          "abstract": "This article seeks to position Istanbul through the practices of everyday life of middle-class, skilled migrants from both the Global North and South and their perceptions of urban safety and precarity. It examines individuals’ processes of migration to Turkey, revealing their initial impressions of Istanbul as a safe city of opportunities, and then analyses their everyday urban lives, highlighting hidden forms of precarity and discrimination. Through in-depth interviews with 45 women and 34 men—more than half of whom are North American and European—and participant observation in people’s living environments and at various social events, I argue that Istanbul, while perceived as a ‘safe haven’ at first, becomes a ‘zone of precarity’ where most of the participants have experienced intersectional forms of precarity, latent patterns of discrimination, and insecurities that belie the common perception that skilled migrants are privileged. To substantiate this argument, this ethno-spatial study presents an analysis of qualitative data as well as an online subjective mapping of Istanbul, where perceptions of urban safety and spatial precarity are displayed through socio-spatial experiences encountered in neighbourhoods, workplaces, and public spaces.",

          "authors": "Nina Willment",
          "abstract": "This paper draws on qualitative, empirical research conducted with nineteen British travel bloggers as distinctive examples of digital nomads, involved in unique forms of lifestyle migration. The paper analyses travel bloggers’ working lives, paying attention to how travel bloggers own migration geographies inextricably entwine with their digital labour. The paper makes three key contributions to the literature on digital nomadism and lifestyle migration. Firstly, the paper highlights how travel bloggers personal migration geographies are a key resource in travel bloggers commodified performances of digital nomadism to their online audiences. Secondly, that travel bloggers encounter ‘frictions’ associated with this intersection of migration geographies and digital work, namely issues of overwork, mental health struggles and instability of digital platforms. Thirdly, that although travel bloggers may understand themselves as lifestyle migrants, there is limited reflection on how, their own, privileged migration geographies may impact upon other migrants or communities. Within the conclusion, these reflections are used to ponder what travel blogging as a form of lifestyle migration may allow us to consider about the future of work, digital technologies and migration.",

          "authors": "Liam Haller",
          "abstract": "This study evaluates whether the trajectories of forced migrants, specifically Syrian refugees moving towards Germany, exhibit path dependency—meaning that their migration decisions are influenced by past events and their previous migration experiences. Using data from the IAB-BAMF-SOEP survey of refugees, this article investigates whether these migration trajectories adhere to a Markov process, where the likelihood of future migrations depends solely on the current state. By employing global and local Markov score tests, the article systematically tests the Markov assumption across different migration routes, focusing on Turkey, Lebanon, and Egypt as transit countries. The findings indicate that shorter, reactive migrations from Syria to Lebanon and Turkey exhibit path dependency, meaning their likelihood is influenced by recent events. Conversely, longer, logistically complex migrations, such as from Syria to Egypt and from transit countries to Germany, adhere to the Markov property, suggesting path independence. This distinction highlights the impact of route difficulty and destination accessibility on migration behaviors. The implications of the findings are also significant for the use of the Markov property in computational models of migration. Researchers should exercise caution when applying the Markov assumption indiscriminately across different migration contexts, as its validity can vary based on external factors such as policy changes and route accessibility.",

          "abstract": "This article interrogates whether, and if so how, political factors underlie the migration aspirations of US-born citizens—a group of people often assumed to have the privilege and options to relocate elsewhere, typically “voluntarily” and for a mix of economic or social/cultural/lifestyle reasons, rather than being pushed out politically by war, revolution, or violence. Drawing on a unique, nationally-representative panel of 1,764 US-born citizens surveyed in 2014 and 2019, and despite many media suggesting the contrary, we show that the overall prevalence and distribution of Americans’ migration aspirations period actually stayed stable during this volatile time period. Nevertheless, we do uncover evidence that political considerations do shape what aspirations US-born citizens do express, with both weaker national attachment and liberal political ideology consistently raising their odds, and political engagement operating in different directions, depending on panelists’ ideological affiliations and the specific governing regime. We discuss the relevance of these findings for literature on migration aspirations from the Global North, multicausal theories of migration, and the relationship between Hirschman’s classic concepts of loyalty, voice, and exit.",

          "title": "Marriage Channels, Temporal Inequality, and Migration Decision-Making Agency: Vietnamese Marriage Migrants in Asia",
          "authors": "Hsin-Chieh Chang, Susanne Yuk Ping Choi",
          "abstract": "Recent scholarship has examined the multiple dimensions of structural and cultural inequalities that impact the well-being of intra-Asia marriage migrants in both sending and receiving countries. One missing mechanism that may shape varied patterns of pre- and post-migration inequalities — the different marriage channels that facilitate different types of encounters between prospective brides from emerging economies and prospective grooms from advanced economies — deserves more theoretical and empirical attention. Based on over 100 life-history interviews with Vietnamese marriage migrants in Taiwan and South Korea, our analysis shows how women's meeting their foreign spouse through personal encounters, introduction networks, or commercial brokers denotes their relatively advantaged, constrained, or disadvantaged structural and cultural circumstances and, in turn, shapes the time available for them for expressing decision-making agency. We argue that marriage channel serves as an intermediate stratifying mechanism — an unequal space, reflecting migrant women's differential socioeconomic positions and gendered familial obligations in Vietnam and shaping a hidden dimension of inequality — temporal inequality — that is embedded in the processes of migration decision-making across different marriage channels. Our theorization of marriage channels and how they reflect the interplay between time for expressing agency and socio-cultural circumstances illuminates a comprehensive contextualization of the social phenomenon of intra-Asia marriage migration in the pre-migration phase. Through considering how both economic and non-economic factors shape marriage migration decision-making processes and their impacts on women's time for expressing agency across different marriage channels, our study contributes to scholarship on gender, time and women's agency, intra-Asia marriage migration, and international migration decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Increasing irregular crossings into Canada have put the asylum issue at the forefront of the political debate. This article explores Canadian citizens’ attitudes toward two distinct asylum policies: the long-established resettlement policy endorsed by the federal government, and spontaneous applications, which have sparked public debate over the past seven years. Analyzing original survey data from 2021, I show that a majority of Canadians support asylum policies, irrespective of type. Delving into opposition to these policies, I identify welfare chauvinism as the primary factor, although attitudes to international collaboration on refugee matters and to the United Nations also correlate with policy preferences. A comparative analysis of attitudes in Canada, the USA, the UK, and the Netherlands reveals similar influences on asylum policy preferences. By shifting the focus from attitudes to refugees to attitudes to asylum policy, this study provides novel evidence of an important dimension of Canadians’ attitudes toward refugee-related matters.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on theoretical frameworks from social movement studies, this article investigates the mobilization of the Ukrainian diaspora in the first 2 years of the full-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine. Based on desk research and in-depth interviews with activists from Ukrainian organizations in France and Poland, the analysis demonstrates that, despite different political opportunities, the Ukrainian communities reinforced their political position in relation to the institutions of residence countries and gained new spheres of influence in the respective national arenas. Pre-existing mobilizing structures and practices, mostly based on the Euromaidan legacy, facilitated the achievement of far-reaching objectives, the coordination of actions, and the integration of grass-root forms of activism within the community. This was framed by a sense of uniqueness, responsibility to the homeland, and strengthening of national sentiments, a series of factors that sometimes amplified the pressure on newly arrived war migrants. In both countries of residence, the full-scale war led to high levels of diaspora mobilization and consolidation.",

          "abstract": "As a consequence of the so-called ‘paradigm shift’, that defines all refugee protection as temporary, the last decade has seen the focus for refugee administration in Denmark move from ‘integration’ towards ‘repatriation and self-provision’. Through analysis of life stories from people arriving to Denmark as refugees before and after this shift, this article examines how people seeking protection experience and make meaning of their new reality as refugees within the Danish welfare state. Drawing on the perspectives of narrativity and hauntology, that acknowledges the workings of past injustices in the present, the analysis shows that people living in temporary protection experience being kept waiting in a never-ending present. Uncertain waiting destroys people’s sense of agency and belonging and counteracts their ability to reorient themselves towards a meaningful future. The article suggests that this ongoing uncertainty conjures up ghosts from the past that reappear and continue to haunt and ruin their present lives.",
