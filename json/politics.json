          "authors": "DANIEL STEVEN SMITH",
          "abstract": "A prominent literature on pre-modern warfare and institution-building holds that intense military competition in pre-modern Europe encouraged institutional innovations—for example, centralized bureaucracies and monopolies on coercion—that empowered rulers and enhanced state capacity, with salutary effects on long-run political development. States that adopted these innovations were more likely to survive, whereas those that did not succumbed to invading armies. Yet links between geopolitical competitiveness and capacity building are largely theorized and tested based on the European historical experience. A broader view of that period reveals a more complicated picture. The dominant mode of warfare throughout much of medieval and early modern Eurasia, Inner Asian cavalry warfare (IACW), favored succession institutions that selected for competent military leaders at the expense of long, secure reigns and cumulative capacity-building potential. I explore these links between IACW, succession practices, and rule duration with a novel dataset of over 300 Eurasian dynasties.",

          "authors": "Joan Barceló, Leonid Peisakhin",
          "abstract": "The literature on the long-term effects of violence suggests that the original cleavage that gave rise to conflict is perpetuated through intergenerational transfer of ingroup-outgroup hatred between victims and perpetrators. This assumes that conflicts usually have a single cleavage, whereas, much violence is multidimensional. We study the legacy of a multidimensional conflict, the Spanish civil war, where the Left-Right ideological cleavage co-existed with the center-periphery divide. Leveraging a natural experiment of history and using panel data on voting and original survey data we show how in a multidimensional conflict a cleavage that pre-conflict was secondary became dominant in the aftermath of violence in response to changes in political discourse. Specifically, we demonstrate how communities that suffered more from Rightist violence became more supportive of regional autonomy rather than Leftist parties. These findings suggest that historical memory of conflict can be redefined as a result of post-conflict politics.",

          "abstract": "Why do some rebel groups defeat the government while so many others fail? Scholars of civil wars note that rebels must often reach the capital to defeat the government. Yet, history is replete with rebels who have lost the war, despite reaching the capital. I offer a theory of rebel capital approach that helps explain why only some rebels are victorious. Introducing novel data on rebel approaches, and accounting for selection dynamics, I find that groups which lay siege to the capital are more likely to achieve victory than those that either blitz the capital from the periphery or form in the city and attempt to divide the government’s power from within. These findings underscore that both strength and wartime decision making are important to the outcome of war.",

          "authors": "Martin K. Dimitrov",
          "abstract": "This article proceeds from a novel empirical finding: namely, there is substantial divergence in the size of the communist party between two subtypes of communist autocracies (revolutionary vs. nonrevolutionary regimes). The communist party is small at the moment of the seizure of power in the revolutionary dictatorships (e.g., China) and remains relatively small throughout their lifespan. By contrast, in the nonrevolutionary subtype (e.g., Bulgaria) the communist party is large at the time of regime inception and remains so throughout the lifespan of the dictatorship. The article identifies the precommunist historical antecedents of this variation and offers an explanation of its effects, linking the divergence in party size to variation in outcomes of central theoretical interest to students of authoritarianism, such as regime origins, regime evolution, and regime durability. The article is based on an original communist party dataset constructed from qualitative corpora of archival materials, supplemented with relevant secondary sources.",

          "authors": "Adriane Fresh",
          "abstract": "This paper considers the consequences of England’s 17th-century dramatic expansion of overseas trade for the persistence and turnover of political elites. I study the extent to which “new” commercial economic interests—individuals involved in expanding trade—obtained Parliamentary representation, as well as the extent to which those individuals were connected to members of the incumbent parliamentary elite or hereditary aristocracy. I do so using an original dataset on Members of Parliament (MPs) spanning more than two centuries (⇠1550–1750). Despite the dramatic expansion of trade during the period, I find that only a modest share of Parliament represented the commercial sector, and overseas traders never constituted a majority of commercial representatives. The parliamentary entré of trading interests manifested most acutely via investors in trade rather than active participants. Moreover, the growing Atlantic economy was associated with little turnover in MPs’ social and family backgrounds. Broadly, I find that elites persisted across the economic changes of the long 17th century and were well-positioned to capture many of the early gains for themselves.",

          "authors": "Brandon K. Yoder, Michael D. Cohen",
          "abstract": "Alliance formation typically entails some risk of abandonment, wherein an ally may not honor its obligations in the future. When potential security partners’ preferences are misaligned, this risk looms large, discouraging mutually beneficial investment in an alliance. How can a prospective ally credibly reassure an uncertain patron that their preferences align, to mitigate abandonment risks and elicit a security commitment? We show formally that pre-alliance bargaining with third parties is one way to do so. When the patron holds abandonment concerns, the prospective ally can reassure the patron by making greater concessions to the patron’s existing allies, but more hard-line demands of its rivals. This finding implies that the prospect of an alliance can alternately promote conflict with a prospective patron’s enemies and forestall conflict with its friends. Indeed, we show that incentives for pre-alliance reassurance can result in war, even with perfect asset divisibility, no commitment problems, and complete information among the belligerents. The results are illustrated by China’s intervention in the Korean War and Australia’s post-World War II rapprochement with Japan, which were motivated largely to foster security cooperation with the Soviet Union and the United States, respectively.",

          "abstract": "When do leaders initiate international crises in which they fail to achieve their goals? I argue that poor crisis performance is more likely when a state’s bureaucracy provides incomplete or inaccurate information to leaders. Two characteristics of a state’s national security institutions—capacity for information search and interbureaucratic information sharing—shape the quality of information provision. Leaders are thus less likely to initiate international crises that fail to advance their goals when they sit atop institutions that ease transaction costs of relaying information to leaders and that allow bureaucracies to competitively evaluate each other’s information. To test my argument, I leverage data measuring bureaucratic institutions across the globe from 1946 to 2015. The analysis finds that crisis performance depends on institutional design, suggesting that some leaders are more prone that others to exhibit poor judgment in high-stakes international crises because of institutional constraints on their information. A case study on China’s decision-making prior to the Sino-Vietnamese War illustrates the theory’s mechanisms. Collectively, the theory and findings improve our understanding of how bureaucracy shapes international conflict.",

          "abstract": "Recent research on international organizations (IOs) has highlighted their capacity to influence state behavior by shaping domestic public opinion, a key channel for policy change. This paper investigates an important extension of this mechanism: whether domestic leaders can proactively leverage IO endorsements to bolster support for contentious policies. Drawing on a survey experiment examining attitudes toward a controversial tax increase in Japan, we test how the effectiveness of this tactic depends on how IOs are perceived across multiple dimensions, including neutrality and expertise. Our results show that referencing IO endorsements reduces resistance to the policy. Crucially, their impact is strongest when the IO is seen as aligned with national interests. In contrast, traits such as impartiality and technical expertise—emphasized in previous studies—play a more limited role. Moreover, the persuasive power of endorsements is concentrated among government supporters, further underscoring the importance of perceived interest alignment as a critical dimension of persuasiveness. These findings offer new insights into when and how IOs shape mass attitudes and call attention to the strategic value of perceived IO biases for domestic elites.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on international sovereignty generally adopts a binary conception: territories either have international recognition, or they lack it and remain unrecognized entities within fragmented states. In this article, we challenge this binary frame by introducing the notion of functional sovereignty: contested territories in practice enjoy varying degrees of sovereignty over governance functions that require external acceptance for their operation. To illustrate, we introduce a new dataset of functional sovereignty over vehicle license plates, currency, passport issuance, postal service, and national Internet domains within unrecognized (de facto) states. We theorize disputes over these functions as not only a matter of practicality, but also as contestations over symbolic assertions of sovereign statehood. Analysis of de facto state governance over these five functions shows that contested territories collectively exhibit gradations of functional sovereignty, defying binary classifications. Further, we draw conceptual and empirical distinctions between functional sovereignty and proximate phenomena, including statehood, rebel governance, and global governance. Our findings urge a greater focus on the practical dimensions of sovereignty, above and beyond its international legal aspect, for a more grounded understanding of the politics of international recognition.",

          "authors": "Ryan Yu-Lin Liou",
          "abstract": "Human rights organizations regularly publicize abuses and shame repressive regimes. But can such human rights messaging effectively mobilize public support for sanctions against these regimes? This study examines whether and under what conditions international advocacy influences citizens’ willingness to support sanctions. I hypothesize that advocacy effectiveness depends on who delivers the message, what type of violation is reported, and how the response is framed. I fielded a preregistered survey experiment with a sample of 2,204 Americans, varying the type of rights violation (physical integrity vs. empowerment rights), the advocacy messenger (UN Special Rapporteur vs. Human Rights Watch), and the sanctions framing (unilateral vs. multilateral). Results show that advocacy messages can increase public support for sanctions, but effects vary significantly across conditions. First, UN messaging produces robust effects, while Human Rights Watch messaging shows weaker and less consistent impacts. Second, messages describing physical integrity abuses generate strong support, while empowerment rights violations fail to mobilize public opinion. Contrary to expectations, multilateral framing does not significantly increase support. These findings advance our understanding of transnational advocacy by identifying the conditions under which international actors can effectively mobilize public backing for human rights enforcement and when advocacy efforts may fall short.",

          "abstract": "Whether armed or unarmed, Islamist non-state actors have a reputation for winning over citizens’ support and spreading their ideas through service delivery, reflecting a worldwide trend in non-state service provision. While existing research attributes the notable variation in service provision to strategic targeting, we argue that service allocation is also highly dependent on a non-state actor’s ability to marshal resources through local economic elites. Our findings demonstrate that service provision by religious non-state actors is more likely in areas and periods where there is associational involvement among elite supporters at the local level. For our inferences, we examine the spatial and temporal variation in the service delivery of a major Islamist group in Turkey. We use original data on non-state service infrastructure, local business associations, charitable endowments, and economic development, as proxied by average nightlight density, along with data on public service infrastructure and historical state-building institutions.",

          "abstract": "We consider how agreement terms create a national framework for development to address the root causes of conflict (public goods) and prevent recidivism through the economic reintegration of ex-combatants (private goods), thus offering agreement terms that are acceptable to both parties and enabling long-term peace. We argue that peace agreements that include promises of public goods, such as national development, and private goods, such as training opportunities and direct fund transfers to ex-combatants, are more capable of preventing violence resurgence. We examine variation in peace agreements contents and how these relate to the durability of peace using newly coded data on private goods. Using a series of Cox proportional hazard models, along with a variety of robustness checks to account for matching, placebo effects, selection bias and implementation factors, we offer evidence that peace agreement content has important implications for post-civil war outcomes. Our results suggest that agreements with provisions for fiscal federalism and for the economic reintegration of ex-combatants are more durable than those that do not. Moreover, contrary to expectations, most economic development promises do not affect the durability of peace.",

          "authors": "Michael Schwan, Marc Schneiberg, Mark K. Cassell",
          "abstract": "Conventional-politics approaches, emphasizing party ideology, electoral dynamics, committee membership, campaign donations, and industry clout, exercise a powerful hold over assessments of public policies and their distributional effects. Emerging from pluralist and business power perspectives, such accounts see “who gets what and why” as the result of how politics and power shape policies, their implementation, and distributional outcomes. This pervades our understanding of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the US government’s effort to avert mass unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic by lending $786 billion to small businesses to keep employees on the payroll. Yet contrary to prior studies of the PPP, we find that conventional-politics factors were strikingly uncorrelated with distributional outcomes, revealing limits to such approaches to this case. Instead, we find that an institutional politics or politics-in-time (IP-PIT) analysis better explains the program and its trajectories. IP-PIT revises the causal sequence by emphasizing how institutions and policies generate politics, distributional outcomes, and feedback loops. We engage both approaches via a mixed-methods analysis of the PPP and two new datasets. We conduct a qualitative process tracing of temporal variation in policy architectures, politics, policy revisions, and access to loans across the program’s three periods, and present quantitative analyses of loan flows across congressional districts and periods using data on the entire corpus of PPP loans. In so doing, we advance research and debate over the PPP, the dynamics and outcomes of US policy making during crises, and the American political economy in general. Ours is the first study of the PPP to conduct a mixed-methods analysis of loans across congressional districts or to use conventional and institutional approaches to address its politics, policy, and outcomes. More broadly, we document varieties of critical junctures, contribute arguments about what might shape policy or institutional innovation in those moments, and use the PPP to identify conditions under which systems are “their own grave diggers,” fueling negative-transformative rather than positive-reproductive feedback.",

          "authors": "Andrew Halterman, Katherine A. Keith",
          "abstract": "Codebooks—documents that operationalize concepts and outline annotation procedures—are used almost universally by social scientists when coding political texts. To code these texts automatically, researchers are increasingly turning to generative large language models (LLMs). However, there is limited empirical evidence on whether “off-the-shelf” LLMs faithfully follow real-world codebook operationalizations and measure complex political constructs with sufficient accuracy. To address this, we gather and curate three real-world political science codebooks—covering protest events, political violence, and manifestos—along with their unstructured texts and human-coded labels. We also propose a five-stage framework for codebook-LLM measurement: Preparing a codebook for both humans and LLMs, testing LLMs’ basic capabilities on a codebook, evaluating zero-shot measurement accuracy (i.e., off-the-shelf performance), analyzing errors, and further (parameter-efficient) supervised training of LLMs. We provide an empirical demonstration of this framework using our three codebook datasets and several pre-trained 7–12 billion open-weight LLMs. We find current open-weight LLMs have limitations in following codebooks zero-shot, but that supervised instruction-tuning can substantially improve performance. Rather than suggesting the “best” LLM, our contribution lies in our codebook datasets, evaluation framework, and guidance for applied researchers who wish to implement their own codebook-LLM measurement projects.",

          "title": "Beyond political connections: a measurement model approach to estimating firm-level political influence in 41 countries",
          "authors": "David C. Francis, Robert Kubinec",
          "abstract": "This paper puts forward a theoretically derived measure of firm-level political influence defined over a sample of firms from a diverse set of countries, permitting new inferences into state-business relations. We derive this measure from original surveys of 27,613 firms in 41 countries, which include information on several interactions with political actors. Using a Bayesian item response theory measurement model that incorporates non-ignorable missing data, we estimate influence scores that incorporate survey data on diverse mechanisms by which firms attempt to obtain influence. From the measurement model, we learn that membership in a business association contains the most positive information about a firm’s influence, while bribes, state ownership, firm size, and a reliance on collective lobbying tend to be substitutes for influence in equilibrium. Empirically, we are able to show for the first time how such influence is distributed across different types of political regimes using a measurement model, leading to intriguing hypotheses about how the costs and benefits of political activity structure corporate influence-seeking.",

          "authors": "Natalie Ayers, Gary King, Zagreb Mukerjee, Dominic Skinnion",
          "abstract": "Teaching political methodology classes typically requires a set of technical, instructor-led lectures on sophisticated statistical concepts (such as probability modeling, inference, and proper interpretation), followed by chances for students to iteratively adjust methodological specifications, parameters, and data sets so they can understand how each combination affects the results. Iteration is essential to learning complicated concepts, but until now has required simultaneous mastery of a statistical programming language (such as R), which makes learning both harder. Teaching R the semester before would make methods classes easier but also delay research experiences and demotivate our students eager to begin substantive research. We address both problems through a new type of interactive teaching tool that lets students iterate while learning the big conceptual picture and all its separate parts, without having to simultaneously become programmers. We make this tool available for use in classes now (via one click in a web browser) and as an example of a new type of more friendly methods instruction for students and instructors alike.",

          "authors": "Jeffrey Clemens, Julia Payson, Stan Veuger",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented federal transfers to state and local governments. Did this funding benefit incumbent politicians electorally? The conditions that triggered this funding influx might also affect incumbents for other reasons. We therefore develop an instrument to predict allocations to states based on variation in congressional representation. Using over a decade of election data, we find that incumbents in state-wide races performed significantly better in 2020 and beyond in states that received more relief funding due to their overrepresentation in Congress. These results are robust across specifications and after adjusting for a variety of economic and political controls. We uncover larger effects for governors and other statewide executive office holders than for legislators, providing suggestive evidence on underlying mechanisms. This paper contributes to our understanding of economic voting during times of crisis, the downstream electoral consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of unequal political representation.",

          "authors": "Reinhard A. Weisser",
          "abstract": "Over the last decades, Europe has attracted an increasing number of internationally mobile students. The related influx of talent into European labour markets constituted an important factor in the knowledge economy. This research addresses the question of whether changing political landscapes in Europe, such as increasing support for right-wing parties, could translate into a diminishing attractiveness of European economies. To this end, international graduates’ staying behaviour in 27 European destination countries is compared based on bilateral stay rates for 144 countries of origin from 2009 to 2019. International graduates are found to display a notable sensitivity concerning the electorate’s preferences: If the potential median voter is located on the right of the political spectrum, the number of international graduates willing to stay declines by about one quarter. This effect is stronger in election years when voters’ political preferences become more salient. Further results suggest that international graduates are also more prone to leaving if the political centre erodes or one of the political fringes becomes too dominant. Eventually, this amounts to a considerable loss for European economies since international graduates have acquired destination country-specific human capital and are easily integrated into host societies.",

          "authors": "Jeremy Ko, James Downes, Chun Kai Leung, Wai-Kit Ming",
          "abstract": "Populist leadership has surged globally, yet its influence on climate adaptation remains insufficiently explored. This study examines the effects of left-wing and right-wing populist regimes on national readiness for climate adaptation. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset encompassing 24 countries from 1995 to 2020, the analysis applies advanced econometric techniques, utilizing the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to assess changes in institutional and fiscal capacities for climate adaptation. The results indicate that (a) populist governments are generally associated with reduced readiness, with (b) left-wing populist regimes exhibiting the most significant decline. (c) The findings underscore the pivotal role of political ideology in shaping climate policy outcomes. This study highlights the politicization of climate governance and offers critical insights for public policy debates, demonstrating that leadership ideology substantially influences whether a country progresses toward or regresses from sustained climate change preparedness.",

          "title": "When repression surprises: Contextual deviations and protest mobilization",
          "authors": "Hansol Kwak",
          "abstract": "Many studies examine whether state repression deters or increases protest mobilization, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. This study argues that mobilization depends less on the absolute level of repression than on how current repression deviates from what people have come to expect in a given context. It introduces discrepancy-based measures that capture these deviations relative to cumulative patterns of state violence, offering a context-sensitive alternative to conventional absolute measures such as fatality counts or arrests. Drawing on event-level data from ACLED, NAVCO, and SCAD, this article analyzes both country- and local-level panels using two-way fixed-effects regression and cumulative link mixed models. Across multiple datasets and specifications, the discrepancy measures consistently produce a U-shaped relationship: participation increases when repression is either higher or lower than established baselines. Comparisons with absolute measures show that the discrepancy approach more reliably explains variation in mobilization, helping to reconcile fragmented results in the repression–mobilization literature. These findings highlight the importance of expectations and contextual baselines in shaping how repression is interpreted and acted upon, suggesting that studies of contentious politics should move beyond static metrics toward measures that account for how actors evaluate state actions over time.",

          "authors": "Leonardo Baccini, Costin Ciobanu, Krzysztof Pelc",
          "abstract": "Do different economic shocks favor different types of political leadership? Using a survey experiment conducted on 3500 American respondents, we offer causal evidence for an unexpected relation between different types of economic shocks and a demand for a radical political response. First, we show that individuals believe politicians have a role in preventing layoffs due to both offshoring and automation, compared to run-of-the-mill bankruptcies. Second, we find strong evidence that economic shocks due to offshoring lead to greater demands for leaders who display authoritarian traits, with no equivalent effect for layoffs due to automation. When presented with news of an offshoring event, respondents favor leaders who claim to be more willing to flout the rule of law, to implement divisive policies, and to employ force. By contrast, traits commonly associated with populism, such as siding with “the people” or preferring political outsiders, see no association with either offshoring or automation shocks. Our findings support the view that some economic shocks provide a greater opportunity for political candidates willing to turn to radical political solutions.",
