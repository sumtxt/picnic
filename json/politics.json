          "abstract": "We consider the classic veto bargaining model but allow the agenda setter to engage in persuasion to convince the veto player to approve her proposal. We show that the proposer‐optimal can be achieved either by providing no information or with a simple binary experiment. Proposer chooses to reveal partial information when there is sufficient expected misalignment with Vetoer. In this case, the opportunity to engage in persuasion strictly benefits Proposer and increases the scope to exercise agenda power. We discuss applications and how the optimal experiment can be implemented in practice.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth J. Perry",
          "abstract": "A notable feature of Chinese Communist rule, from revolutionary days on, has been the blurred boundaries of its governance mechanisms. The lines separating formal from informal, legal from illegal, and state from societal have – at least until quite recently – proven exceptionally permeable. This paper focuses on an especially fluid and flexible means of Chinese Communist governance: the deployment of mobile task forces, or “work teams,” for both routine and crisis policy implementation. Directed by higher-levels of the party-state to advance a specific mission at the grassroots, work teams mobilize society in a manner that reflects the continuing influence of China’s revolutionary experience. The paper assesses the contributions and costs of this “campaign-style” of governance in comparison to the practices of other Communist and non-Communist systems, past and present.",

          "authors": "Lisa Garbe, Nina McMurry, Alexandra Scacco, Kelly Zhang",
          "abstract": "Governments across the Global South have begun introducing biometric IDs (eIDs) in an attempt to improve citizen-state legibility. While such initiatives can improve government efficiency, they also raise important questions about citizen privacy, especially for groups with a history of mistrust in the state. If concerns about increased legibility produce differential uptake or changes in political behavior, eID initiatives may exacerbate societal inequalities. In a conjoint experiment with 2,072 respondents from four Kenyan regions, we examine how perceptions of and willingness to register for eID under different policy conditions vary across politically dominant, opposition, and “securitized” (heavily policed) ethnic groups. We find meaningful group-level variation in support for specific policy features, and suggestive evidence that policies facilitating surveillance may discourage opposition political participation. Our most surprising finding, however, is that there is such broad support for expanded legibility. The promise of access to government services appears to outweigh other considerations.",

          "authors": "Daniele Caramani, Siyana Gurova, Tobias Widmann",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the global cleavages that structure world politics from the mid-19th century to the present. It develops the concept of cleavage applied at the global level and measures empirically how territorial divisions give way to the politicization of various types of inequality along functional lines cutting across world regions. Covering over 300,000 articles from The Economist between 1843 and 2020, the analysis applies semi-supervised computational text analysis based on word embeddings to capture the territoriality−functionality continuum in global discourse. This method allows testing the theoretical expectation that the territoriality in the politicization of global divisions has diminished historically. Results reveal a trend toward the de-territorialization since World War II, primarily for cleavages about social and economic inequality. Although spikes of territoriality re-appear during interstate wars throughout the entire period, surges of territoriality are temporary and do not reverse the historical trend towards prevailing cross-territorial divisions.",

          "abstract": "When autocrats do not impose explicit rules of behavior on their subjects, what does political compliance look like? Existing research suggests that such conditions generate uncertainty, leading risk-adverse individuals to self-censor in an effort to minimize the risk of punishment. In this paper, we find that women and men differ in how they express political compliance under conditions of uncertainty. Focusing on Confucius Institute teachers who are given broad objectives but no specific rules of political behavior, we use interviews, a global survey, and an experiment to show that women express compliance by increasing uncensored discussions to persuade host country students toward the Chinese regime’s point of view. In contrast, men comply by vociferously defending the party line and censoring further discussions. These gendered strategies of political compliance are rooted in the differing gender socialization experiences of men and women, who face divergent expectations on how they should interact with others.",

          "abstract": "Why do some countries pass laws to reduce emissions that cause climate change while others do not? We theorize that climate change-related disasters cause politicians to view global warming as more proximate, but whether they have incentives to enact mitigation laws depends on their country’s geographic vulnerability to future damages. We use a spatial integrated assessment model to measure global warming’s local economic effects, which allows us to predict how political leaders respond to disasters based on their vulnerability. An analysis of mitigation laws from 1990–2020 in 155 countries shows that only governments in locations facing the greatest future climate damage react to disasters by passing mitigation policies. Distinct from the historical North-South divide, our findings highlight a growing geographic cleavage in national responses to climate change.",

          "authors": "MARIE‐ISABEL THEUWIS, CAROLIEN VAN HAM, KRISTOF JACOBS",
          "abstract": "Democratic innovations aim to strengthen citizen participation in democratic decision‐making processes. Building on theories of deliberative democracy, participatory democracy and direct democracy, different types of democratic innovations have been developed, ranging from mini‐publics, to participatory processes and referendums and citizens’ initiatives. Over the last four decades, an expanding number of scholars have investigated the effects of these democratic innovations on citizens. However, even though a considerable amount of research has been done, there currently exists no overview of the effects of different types of democratic innovations on citizens’ attitudes, behaviour and capabilities. In addition, it is unclear which effects prove robust across studies, and which effects require more investigation. The aim of this paper is to systematically evaluate what we know and what we do not know yet about the effects of democratic innovations on citizens who participate in them. In order to do so, we conduct a meta‐analysis of 100 quantitative empirical studies published between 1980 and 2020. We find, perhaps unsurprisingly, that mini‐publics are widely researched for their effects on citizens, whereas studies into the effects of participatory processes and referendums and citizens’ initiatives on participating citizens are much less frequent. We also find that participation in mini‐publics changes citizens’ policy attitudes and positively affects citizens’ political attitudes, knowledge, internal efficacy and reasoning skills. For participatory processes, our analyses indicate that they appear to have a positive effect on participants’ political attitudes and knowledge and no effect on participants’ internal efficacy, but there are too few studies to draw robust conclusions. Participation in referendums and citizens’ initiatives appears to have a positive effect on participants’ knowledge and internal efficacy, even though these findings should also be considered preliminary due to the limited number of studies.",

          "abstract": "The internal institutional structures of states greatly impact their citizens’ welfare. However, states are not at complete liberty to adopt any internal form. Competitive pressure arising from anarchy limits the range of viable domestic institutions to those that do not impose a significant disadvantage. We argue that technological change can alter the relative competitiveness of different state forms and, by extension, improve or degrade human welfare. We empirically support this argument through a macrohistorical survey of competitively significant technologies. We conclude that the true costs of international anarchy are greater than commonly appreciated, as competitive pressure may force states to evolve into forms detrimental to the welfare of their inhabitants. Moreover, the adoption of state forms that improve human well-being is often driven by technological change as much as human agency. Finally, the invention of seemingly beneficial technologies may decrease human well-being by improving the competitiveness of inegalitarian state forms.",

          "abstract": "The best empirical research in political science clearly defines substantive parameters of interest, presents a set of assumptions that guarantees their identification, and uses an appropriate estimator. We argue for the importance of explicitly integrating rigorous theory into this process and focus on the advantages of doing so. By integrating a theoretical structure into one’s empirical strategy, researchers can quantify the effects of competing mechanisms, consider the ex-ante effects of new policies, extrapolate findings to new environments, estimate model-specific theoretical parameters, evaluate the fit of a theoretical model, and test competing models that aim to explain the same phenomena. As a guide to such a methodology, we provide an overview of structural estimation, including formal definitions, implementation suggestions, examples, and comparisons to other methods.",

          "abstract": "Centralized agenda control is a feature of many parliaments, with important consequences for the conduct and outcomes of legislative politics. Much previous work has thus sought to understand the emergence of centralized agenda‐setting rules. We extend this literature by studying the “Balfour reforms”, which centralized agenda control in the early twentieth century UK House of Commons. Our aim is to probe a conventional claim in the existing literature: that the opposition supported these reforms. This is a counter‐intuitive claim, which rests on relatively little direct evidence. We analyze historical roll‐call data from 1902 to assess how far the opposition supported agenda centralization. We complement this analysis by examining attempted amendments and speech contributions to parliamentary debates. Contrary to the standard view, we find that the primary opposition party consistently resisted these reforms. This evidence of controversy rather than consensus revises our understanding of a key milestone in the development of the Westminster parliament, and contributes to the wider literature on the choice of agenda‐setting procedures.",

          "authors": "Thomas Mustillo, John Polga‐Hecimovich, Francisco Sánchez",
          "abstract": "Classic theories of political ambition assume relatively stable and programmatic party systems. However, in many parts of the world, ‘fluid’ or ‘inchoate’ party systems do not provide ambitious legislators with the electoral benefits associated with stable party brands. In this paper, we examine ambition in fluid party systems: What is the frequency of party switching for legislators who seek re‐election, and what are their characteristics? What incentives do parties create to push away or retain legislators? And which parties do ambitious legislators seek out? Using a systems approach, we argue that in fluid party systems, legislators' office‐seeking behavior is driven by their attitudes towards parties and their constituents, their prospective evaluation of party performance, and ideology. Incentives for politicians to switch parties act as negative feedback mechanisms which keep the party system stuck in a fluid state. We test the determinants of party switching using two data sources from Ecuador: a public records dataset of every legislator who earned re‐election from 1979 to 2021, and the Parliamentary Elites in Latin America ( PELA ) surveys of all legislators from 1994 to 2017. Both sources distinguish between switchers and non‐switchers. The results support the conclusion that ambitious legislators in fluid party systems are strategic actors that seek or keep parties to maximize their probability of re‐election—and thereby further exacerbate the party system's fluidity.",

          "abstract": "We examine presidential elections in the American South. Our empirical starting point is the 2008 election of Democrat Barack Obama. We discuss political dynamics leading up to this historic contest but focus our analysis on the last four elections concluding with the defeat of President Trump in 2020. Tapping into recent southern politics scholarship emphasizing partisan patterns that differ based on population growth (or lack thereof), we show how this factor affects presidential voting with an assemblage of data collected at the state-, county-, and individual-level. We first consider the prominence of presidential Republicanism across the 11 southern states. Next, we delve into these states’ counties to further assess two-party competition in presidential contests. Finally, drawing on Cooperative Election Study (CES) data, controlling for a host of factors, we examine whether varying population rates at the state- and county-level affect presidential preferences. The U.S. South is forever changing, and in presidential politics substantial alterations to its electorate generally favor an emerging Democratic Party.",

Despite this, limited research has explored how voters’ perceptions of leaders’ traits influence support for PRR parties. This study delves into the impact of perceived leaders’ traits on the vote for PRR parties, using original survey data collected during recent general elections in six European countries (Italy 2022, France 2017, Germany 2017, Austria 2017, UK 2017, Netherlands 2017). Combining descriptive findings and regression analyses, our results reveal three key insights: (1) Voters differentiate among leaders’ traits, with the influence of each trait varying across different party types; (2) the effect of leader’s perceptions on all traits is significant also after taking into account party identification; (3) PRR parties are particularly adept at attracting voters based on positive assessments of leaders’ strength and empathy, more so than other party types.",

          "abstract": "Are legislators ideologically close to their co-partisans? And, when not, what policies drive the lack of party unity? To address these questions, we propose two measures of intra-party ideological cohesion: dissonance and frustration. Based on a survey of legislators across 18 Latin American countries, we show that half of the region’s representatives self-identify as substantially far from the mean of their parties (dissonance) and almost 40% perceive large differences (frustration). Relying on a series of statistical tests, we find that these patterns are distinct for left-wing and right-wing legislators. The right is more dissonant than frustrated, and they are also more dissonant than the left. In terms of policy, we show that moral issues drive dissonance and frustration on both sides of the ideological spectrum, but disagreements on economic topics are more correlated with ideological distance for the left than the right. In presenting new measurements of intra-party disagreements, our paper proposes new pathways for the study of party cohesion.",

It investigates whether these parties attract individuals seeking purposive incentives and explores factors associated with such motivation. Data were collected from surveys of approximately 200 party activists across three major Ukrainian cities during the 2019 Parliamentary Elections. The analysis reveals that purposive motivation is more prevalent among party activists than previously thought. Older activists and formal party members demonstrate higher levels of purposive motivation compared to their younger and non-member counterparts, while the study finds no positive correlation between ideological extremism and purposive motivation. These findings challenge the conventional assumption of party activists as hired “mercenarie” in volatile party systems and extend the scope of party membership and activism research beyond established Western democracies.",

This article examines whether critical responses by other politicians can effectively counter the appeal of political candidates who have engaged in authoritarian behavior. We argue that costly action by fellow partisan politicians can reduce the electoral popularity of authoritarian politicians. We test this in a preregistered conjoint experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey in the United Kingdom. The results show that voters are less likely to choose politicians displaying authoritarian behavior, when they are criticized by other legislators, and that such counteractions are particularly effective when they are costly. These findings have important implications, as they show that politicians, especially co-partisans, can play an important role in reducing the appeal of authoritarian politicians.",

          "abstract": "We use four surveys from Ukraine asking respondents to name at most three emotions that describe their feelings toward Russian citizens to assess how and why responses have changed since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. We find that 76% of Ukrainians now feel anger, hatred, or contempt toward Russian citizens compared to about 15% before the invasion. Respondents who agreed that Russian citizens supported the war to build an empire were especially more likely to feel either hatred, anger, or contempt. Perceived public desire for conquest speaks to perceived responsibility associated with anger and failure to meet an important standard associated with contempt. Additionally, anger, hatred, and contempt toward Russian citizens especially increased among respondents who mixed the use of Russian and Ukrainian or were from Eastern Ukraine, suggesting the invasion shifted attitudes toward Russian citizens among previously more pro‐Russian Ukrainians. Anger, hatred, and contempt toward both Russian citizens and the Russian government also have distinct action tendencies, cumulatively reducing support for a peaceful settlement.",

          "abstract": "Although scholars have long understood the importance of psychology in international affairs, morality has often been overlooked as a factor in world leaders' decision‐making. This article seeks to fill this gap by introducing a new analytical tool: the moral portrait, a descriptive summary of a leader's moral values. The tool is built on the five cross‐cultural values of Moral Foundations Theory (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity) and the methodological approach of operational code. As a case study, the moral portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin is inferred from his rhetoric, policies, and decisions. Putin's moral portrait, specifically his interpretations of the Fairness, Loyalty, and Authority values, can help explain many of his views and actions, including his decision to launch a full‐scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",

          "title": "Gender on the mind? Gender heuristics and rationalizations in candidate evaluations",
          "authors": "Tobias Rohrbach, Philomen Schönhagen",
          "abstract": "As more women enter politics, public and scholarly narratives about the extent and nature of gender bias in mediated campaigning environments diversify. Yet there is still little understanding of how voters substantively think about gender in their evaluations of women and men candidates and how voters' thoughts are affected by different types of media coverage. Drawing on literature on gender stereotyping and rationalization, this paper distinguishes two roles in which gender manifests in the candidate evaluation process—as a heuristic and as a rationalization. We empirically investigate these different ways in which gender affects voters' thoughts following neutral and contextually rich candidate stimuli by means of a mixed methods think aloud study. The results show that voters think less—but more positively—about substantive aspects of women's political profiles. These favorable thoughts include heuristic inferences of communal traits for women but not men candidates. Moreover, we find that voter rationalizations involve gender as ex post vote justifications and socially desirable drivers of candidate evaluations. Together, the findings not only showcase the complex roles of gender in voters' candidate evaluations but also the importance of considering the normative context in which vote decisions take place.",
