          "authors": "Pierre‐Étienne Vandamme",
          "abstract": "Two of the founding principles of representative governments—the independence of elected representatives and popular accountability—are notoriously in tension. The more independent representatives are, the less citizens can exercise control over them. This article defends an institutional proposal—semi‐directed mandates—aiming to capture the main concerns of both advocates and critics of imperative mandates and to strike a better balance between independence and accountability than the one usually prevailing in contemporary representative governments. The proposal consists of (i) asking candidates or parties to put forward key priorities before the election; (ii) allowing voters to give a more specific mandate to their representatives, and (iii) allowing them to revoke the mandate in case of betrayal of key promises unless they can offer convincing justifications for departing from their mandate. More flexible than the traditional imperative mandate, this proposal also preserves the benefits of a partial division of political labor. It, therefore, seems better suited to the typical circumstances of mass democracies.",

          "abstract": "The Vietnam Draft Lotteries, which randomly assigned men to military service, enable researchers to assess the long-term effects of interracial contact on racial attitudes. Using a new draft status indicator for respondents to the General Social Surveys 1978–2021, we show that white men who were selected for the draft subsequently expressed less negative attitudes toward Black people and toward policies designed to help them. These effects are apparent only for cohorts that were actually drafted into service, suggesting that interracial contact during military service led to attitude change. These findings have important implications for theories of political socialization and prejudice reduction.",

          "authors": "VATSAL NARESH",
          "abstract": "This article presents a new theory of majoritarian domination drawn from Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar’s critique of majoritarian tyranny during the decades preceding British India’s decolonization. Ambedkar’s critique of British colonial pluralism and Congress-led Indian anticolonialism emphasizes attention to social structures and the mechanisms that produce and sustain communal majorities. He argues that caste prevents equality and fraternity, thus foreclosing the possibility of a democratic society. In such a context, Ambedkar argues that the majority is likely to be communal and fixed, rather than political, inclusive, and open to change over time. Ambedkarian majoritarian domination supplements nineteenth-century accounts of the institutional and epistemic dimensions of majoritarian tyranny. I defend comparison as a tool for theoretical analysis to show that Ambedkarian majoritarian domination can explain the interaction of hierarchical social structures with democratic politics in contexts beyond colonial India.",

          "authors": "Nicholas Buhmann-Holmes",
          "abstract": "Revolution in one country can inspire protests in another country, demanding responses from elites seeking to maintain power. Scholars typically use a policy-centered approach to analyze these responses, focusing on how policy strategies of repression or co-optation are used to prevent revolution. But in democracies, political survival is also electoral success. This article therefore argues that studying the communicative signaling of political elites allows us to see another important response to foreign revolutions: how democratic politicians through speeches use foreign revolutions to attract revolution-wary voters. Building on recent legislative debate scholarship, the article develops a parliamentary speech signaling framework and demonstrates its usefulness by analyzing Danish elite responses to revolutions in the 1910s. This approach enables us to see how democratic politicians use foreign revolutions for electoral advantages, and it addresses a noted difficulty of previous research in clarifying whether co-optation or repression in democracies emerged as responses to revolutions.",

          "abstract": "This paper highlights the overlooked role of prior grievances stemming from historical territorial loss as a significant factor behind support for nationalist populist parties. While not essential for the emergence of nationalist populism, territorial loss uniquely aligns with the backward-looking victimization framing crucial to these parties’ electoral success. Utilizing cross-national experimental and observational data from original surveys conducted in 2020–2021 in Romania, Hungary, Germany, and Turkey, we establish territorial loss attitudes as a robust predictor of nationalist populist party support. In addition to variations in national context, a trade-off emerges for governing populists, revealing that priming past losses attracts concerned voters but alienates those indifferent to territorial issues. Analyzing a quasi-natural experiment involving a new nationalist populist party that emerged in Romania between waves, we conclude that loss attitudes are stable over time and temporally prior to support for nationalist populism.",

          "authors": "Masaaki Higashijima, Austin M. Mitchell",
          "abstract": "How do core principles of modern democracy impact the development of state spending? Drawing on Dahl’s (1971) conceptualization of polyarchy, we explain that public budgets in modern states evolved according to how electoral competition and suffrage incorporated key actors within societies. Before contestation and suffrage, land-owning elites led states that focused spending on repressive capacity to maintain regime security. Contestation without broad participation incorporated urban elites who benefited from spending on economic development. Extending suffrage to the masses expanded spending on social welfare but only when regimes allowed for political competition. To test the hypotheses, we collect data on patterns of government finance for over thirty countries across the globe between the early 19th and mid-20th centuries. Two-way fixed effects models and multiple sensitivity analyses offer strong evidence for the theoretical expectations. The findings expand on a substantial literature to form a more complete understanding of democracy and public budgets.",

          "authors": "Nico Ravanilla",
          "abstract": "Sects and strict denominations are growing more rapidly and retaining members better than mainstream religions. To what extent do they influence vote choice? I investigate whether the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), a religious sect in the Philippines, can compel all members to “vote as one” and support a full ticket of endorsed candidates. Using a triple difference identification strategy, I show that the municipal-level vote-shares of INC-endorsed national candidates are unit elastic with respect to the share of INC voters across municipalities. Conventional low-information rationality models of voting cannot fully explain this. But augmented with social voting in which actions of other group members inform the objective function of voters, a voting model with religious sect endorsements can produce extremely large behavioral responses. These findings have implications on policy as well as on our understanding of strict religions’ influence on politics.",

          "abstract": "While conventional wisdom often equates liberalization with deregulation, theoretical arguments from different scientific backgrounds suggest that states tend to increase their rule stock when they adopt more liberal policies. This article studies the case of abortion policy to better understand the liberalization-rule nexus. By examining data from 25 countries over 50years, we empirically assess the dynamics between liberalization events and corresponding regulatory changes. Our findings reveal that while the majority of countries does indeed introduce more rules upon liberalizing abortion, the extent of these regulatory changes varies considerably. The analysis suggests that the extent of rule growth depends on the conflicts that characterize liberalization processes in particular countries and time periods. Right-leaning governments, religious groups and institutional veto players are shown to have a positive influence on rule growth. On the contrary, higher levels of liberalization reduce the necessity for additional rules. By illuminating a contested empirical relationship, the article helps to better understand the implications of liberalization in modern democracies.",

          "authors": "LOUISE HALBERG NIELSEN, MICHAEL BANG PETERSEN",
          "abstract": "During the COVID‐19 pandemic, public opinion regarding restrictions and lockdowns was quickly characterized by significant disagreement. In a societal crisis such as COVID‐19, it is important to understand the drivers behind citizens’ attitudes and behaviours. Political disagreement related to COVID‐19 restrictions and lockdowns has often been interpreted as an ideological or partisan divide along the left‐right dimension of political opinion. Here, we argue that there is more to unpack. There is increasing awareness that public opinion is structured by both left‐right orientation and trust in the system. In this paper, we examine the divide in COVID‐19 attitudes and behaviours and compare the influence of ideology and system trust as drivers across countries and across time during the pandemic. Based on monthly surveys from eight countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, France and Italy) from September 2020 to July 2021 (total sample of 49,414 respondents), we show that citizens with right‐wing ideologies and those who do not trust ‘the system’ perceived a lower threat from the coronavirus, were less supportive of government measures against the virus, report having changed their behaviour less and report lower intentions to vaccinate against COVID‐19 compared to citizens with left‐wing ideologies and those with high system trust. These results are stable across time and across countries. We also find that behavioural differences are larger between those who support the system and those who do not than between those with right‐ and left‐wing ideological outlooks, respectively. This implies that system trust is at least as important as ideology in terms of shaping cleavages in COVID‐19 attitudes and behaviours. The results suggest that in order to increase public support for societal responses during a crisis, it is not only important to appeal to both sides of the ideological spectrum, but also to appeal to those who do not trust ‘the system’.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of literature shows that the preferences of poorer groups in society are less well represented than the preferences of the rich. This paper scrutinises one possible explanation of inequality in representation: that politicians hold biased perceptions of what citizens want. We conducted surveys with citizens and politicians in four countries: Belgium, Switzerland, Canada and Germany. Citizens provided their preferences regarding concrete policy proposals, and then politicians estimated these preferences. Comparing politicians’ estimates with the actual preferences of different social groups, the paper shows that politicians’ perceptions are closer to the preferences of the richer than to those of poorer people for issues that matter most for economic inequality: socio‐economic issues. Further, we find that especially right‐wing politicians tend to think about the preferences of richer societal groups when estimating the preferences of their partisan electorates on socio‐economic matters.",

          "authors": "JANE GINGRICH, ANJA GIUDICI",
          "abstract": "How do political parties speak about education? While struggles over education played a foundational role in structuring modern partisan cleavages, scholars debate the extent to which parties still adopt distinct rhetorical stances on education. Existing data, however, is limited to studying broad public support or opposition to educational expansion, restricting both our empirical knowledge of the politicisation of education and our ability to theorise parties’ incentives to speak publicly about it. This paper provides the first systematic examination of the post‐war evolution of partisan rhetoric about education in advanced democracies. We develop a novel dataset ( Education Politics Dataset EPD) based on hand‐coded manifesto speech of the largest centre‐left and centre‐right parties for 20 countries in Europe and beyond, from 1950 to the present. The EPD distinguishes nine educational issues, grouped under the three fundamental policy dimensions of distribution, governance and curricular content. We theorise that parties use educational speech both to signal competence to a broader electorate and to signal credibility to a narrower base. The result is three distinct patterns of speech: consensual, differentially salient and polarised. Where education policies cross‐cut existing cleavages, parties devote similar attention to issues and adopt similar stances, creating a consensual pattern. We find this pattern for issues of participation and quality in education. Where education policies are universal but offer specific benefits to a partisan base, we find patterns of differential salience: some parties devote more rhetorical attention to the issue than others, but parties adopt common stances. We find this pattern for questions of spending and access. Finally, where education policies align with broader political cleavages and provide targeted electoral benefits to partisan bases, parties adopt distinct public stances leading to more polarised rhetoric. We find this pattern for issues related to academic tracking and traditional curricular content. In developing the first multidimensional theorisation and measurement of partisan rhetoric on education, the paper provides insight into parties’ evolving approaches to an area increasingly crucial to electoral and social life.",

          "abstract": "Power transitions among major states have shaped the course of cooperation in the history of the international system. We study this relationship from a public opinion angle by examining the effect of a potential power transition on attitudes towards bilateral trade liberalization. Power transitions can spur political and economic conflict because the rising power gains greater influence over the course of world politics, including trade rules, allowing it to assert its national interest and the interests of its citizens. This implies that citizens in the rising power are more supportive of bilateral economic cooperation than citizens in the declining power. Empirical findings from parallel, survey‐embedded experiments in China and the United States lend support to this conjecture. Great Power competition, therefore, interferes with current international economic affairs – an aspect that has received less attention in previous research on trade politics.",

          "abstract": "Does the intervention of an international organization in domestic politics render policy change more popular? While voters may ultimately care only about policy outcomes, the involvement of international actors often seems to lead to resentment. Still, citizens may have greater faith in the wisdom of international actors than in their own government. As others have argued, a well-respected international actor might provide a cue, especially for voters considering controversial policies like spending cuts. We test this argument in a novel pre–post experimental panel study conducted in Spain. We find that citizens become less opposed to unpopular spending cuts when informed that they are required by an international institution. The effects differ, however, across the two organizations that we test: They are stronger for the European Union than for the International Monetary Fund. Our findings lend support to studies arguing that the endorsement of specific international organizations can help push through otherwise unpopular policies.",

          "abstract": "This paper leverages firm-level data to examine the impact of the US–China trade war on the greenfield investment of Chinese investors. Our research yields a few interesting findings. Importantly, our longitudinal analysis of Chinese greenfield investment projects yields evidence that the tariffs have dampened overall Chinese investment. Further analyses for different world regions indicate that while the tariffs have generally had a chilling effect on Chinese investment in most world regions, they may have prompted Chinese investors to engage in “tariff-jumping” in the United States. Our analysis further shows that the trade war may have incentivized Chinese investors to increasingly invest in countries with good political ties with Beijing, presumably as a buffer against potential downturns in bilateral relations. It may also have contributed, at least in part, to a reduced willingness by Chinese state-owned enterprises to engage in overseas investment. However, we found no evidence that the tariffs have led to a perceptible shift in China's investment flows toward BRI countries. Overall, these findings help to illuminate the extent to which policies of “decoupling” may have induced shifts in Chinese investors’ investment patterns, at least in the short-run.",

          "abstract": "Empathy has been proposed as a solution to alleviate interparty antipathy. Recent findings from the US suggest that one aspect of empathy – empathic concern – increases rather than decreases affective polarization. Perspective-taking, another aspect of empathy, has no effect on affective polarization. In this article, we describe a preregistered replication and extension of these findings in the contrasting political context of the Netherlands, to see whether this relationship generalizes beyond the US. First, using a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of 1,258 Dutch voters, we show that empathic concern indeed fuels affective polarization while at the same time we find that perspective-taking reduces it. Second, using a two-arm survey experiment (n = 438), we show that perspective-taking reduces ingroup bias, whereas empathic concern does not. Reflecting on the American and Dutch findings, we conclude that while empathic concern likely contributes to affective polarization, perspective-taking may reduce it.",

We demonstrate ReChat by applying it to a specific phenomenon of interest to political scientists: conversations among co-partisans. We present results from two studies, focusing on (1) self-selection factors that make chat participants systematically unrepresentative and (2) a pre-registered analysis of loquaciousness that finds a significant association between speakers’ ideological extremity and the amount they write in the chat.

          "authors": "Sam A Erkiletian",
          "abstract": "What explains the variation in combatant socialization and resocialization outcomes? Why do some combatants adopt the intended norms of their organization while others resist them? Combatants regularly undergo intensive socialization and ‘resocialization’ processes within total institutions – regimented environments like armed organizations and re-education programs that seek to alter their norms. Total institutions profoundly shape the behaviors and attitudes of combatants during and after conflict. However, even within these controlled environments, combats develop norms differently, and it is still not clear what factors drive this variation in combatant preference formation. This article presents and tests a framework that combatant socialization is in part driven by subgroups – the smaller social units within total institutions that form the informal structure and environment of combatants. Specifically, subgroup leaders moderate socialization processes by reinforcing or undermining the official norms of the organization. To test this expectation, I leverage archival data from the British re-education program for German POWs (1946–1948) which sought to ‘democratize’ them. To facilitate re-education, British officials installed pro-democratic POWs into subgroup leadership positions in select camps. Using a novel dataset constructed from hand-coded administrative reports, I measure the effect of subgroup leadership type on socialization outcomes. The results suggest that subgroup leaders moderate socialization outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The impact of extreme weather events on electoral processes is not well understood, yet as the climate changes, such events are predicted to become more common. This highlights the need for scholars to investigate how natural hazards affect election campaigns and electoral administration. Drawing on data from the Electoral Contention and Violence dataset, this article uses a difference-in-differences approach to assess the effect of tropical storms on electoral contention over seven elections held in the Philippines between 1992 and 2010. It finds that storms that occur in the year leading up to an election increase, and that this effect is likely accounted for by both economic grievances consequent upon the negative impact of storms on agricultural output and grievances generated by storm-induced disruptions to the electoral process. These findings suggest that as climate change intensifies, – and the violence that contention often entails – could become more common in a number of contexts. This has implications for electoral administration, and it implies the need for cooperation across electoral and meteorological agencies in places where weather extremes are likely to occur in the runup to electoral events.",

          "abstract": "Do variations in local incomes influence peace and conflict in low- and middle-income countries? The present meta-regression analysis contributes to answering this question by delving into the narratives that researchers use to qualify how various shocks affect conflict risk through channels implicitly linked to income. After examining 2,464 subnational estimates from 64 recent empirical studies, we find that several publication biases related to authors’ methodological choices influence our understanding of this phenomenon. Importantly, studies that fail to uncover empirical effects that conform to researchers’ expectations on the theoretical mechanisms are less likely to be published. After accounting for publication selection bias, the analysis finds that, on average, income-increasing shocks in the agriculture sector are negatively associated with the local risk of conflict. Nonetheless, the analysis finds no average effect of income-decreasing shocks in the agriculture sector or income-increasing shocks in the extractive sector on the local risk of conflict. The article opens avenues for further study on the granular observed heterogeneity in the literature, particularly focusing on the conditional aspects of how shocks and conflicts are measured and the geographical coverage, among others.",

          "abstract": "This article presents a theory of policymaking at the federal and state levels where individuals locate based on the differences in state policies. Individuals have an ideology that represents the strength of preferences for redistribution and social policy. States (and individuals) separate with one state spending on redistribution and attracting individuals with stronger ideology and another that provides a public good and attracts individuals with weaker ideology. Polarization results, is natural, and originates in the states. States have a preponderance of like-minded residents and can be politically noncompetitive. The federal government is divided and bargains over policy but inaction on social policy results, which devolves social policy to the states. Devolvement reinforces the sorting among the states and amplifies polarization. Devolvement is welfare-enhancing but divisive. Devolvement does not occur on federal spending. Recent Supreme Court decisions create opportunities for additional social policy devolvement.",

          "abstract": "While academics have examined how term limits affect elected officials, little work has gone into understanding the way they alter challenger behavior. I argue that they reduce the number of candidates who challenge incumbents, leading to a lock‐in effect. By increasing the frequency of open races, term limits incentivize potential challengers to wait for an open race. To demonstrate this, I analyze primary data from 85 legislative chambers in 44 states over a two‐decade period to see how term limits alter challenger entry patterns. I show that term‐limited incumbents face fewer challengers in their last two terms in office and challenges are weaker, while competition for open races ramps up. In doing so, I provide a major insight into how term limits alter challenger decision‐making to run for entry‐level office while improving our understanding of candidate entry by accounting for multiple potential points of entry.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decades, increasing dissatisfaction with political parties and the rise of far-right populism have undermined the ability of party organizations to fulfill their traditional roles. In this context, new parties have emerged, offering alternatives for voters disillusioned with mainstream parties. This paper proposes a generational approach to examine whether the supporters of new parties exhibit distinct patterns of engagement and varying perceptions of democratic institutions. In order to explore incentives for engagement and compare the political attitudes of members from new and established parties, this paper relies on original data from the first national survey with party members in Brazil. Using multivariate analysis and experimental data, we first evaluate the appeal of enhancing intraparty democracy as a means of fostering party engagement in both old and new parties. Additionally, we assess whether members of new parties hold different attitudes toward key features of party politics compared to their counterparts in established parties. Our findings suggest that members of first-generation parties in Brazil demonstrate greater resistance to anti-democratic values. Furthermore, new members across all generations demonstrate greater skepticism regarding political institutions. These findings highlight the challenges facing contemporary democracies at both the organizational and individual levels.",

          "abstract": "In response to declining membership, European parties moved to offering direct participation of members and/or non-members in leadership and candidate primaries. However, their consequences for party members remains unclear. This paper aims to address this issue by suggesting a new conceptual framework exploring the combined effect of the degree of inclusiveness of the two key formal dimensions of “who can run” and “who can vote” in intra-party primaries and their joint positive or negative effect on party membership size, attitude toward the leadership and turnout during the primary. Based on secondary and new pre- and post-primary party membership surveys data and in-depth membership interviews, the paper qualitatively and comparatively studies primaries within the UK Conservatives, the German Greens and the French Parti Socialiste. It finds that mainly primaries limited to members combined with permissive candidate requirements have potentially positive consequences for parties, attracting citizens back to parties, leading to higher participation and membership satisfaction. Thus, the paper contributes to the understanding of the consequences of party reforms for parties and party members.",

          "abstract": "Motivated reasoning posits that ideological beliefs and goals bias individuals' information processing particularly regarding socio‐political information. However, most individuals are unaware that ideological bias shapes their perception and judgment making them easy targets for political polarization. This leads to the strong need to address and mitigate this bias. Utilizing an ideological bias task that assesses the degree of expressing one's ideological bias in the estimation of socio‐political facts, we test the effects of feedback on the reduction of ideological bias. With a three between‐factor design (feedback‐only vs. feedback + social norm nudge vs. no feedback control), we test a representative German sample at two time points ( N t 1 = 1229, N t 2 = 1001). Participants who received feedback on the extent of their ideological bias displayed a significant bias reduction between t 1 and t 2 compared to the control group. An additional social norm nudge emphasizing the societal value of unbiased decision‐making did not result in a stronger reduction of ideological bias. Moreover, general bias awareness did not moderate the effect of feedback on bias reduction. Our findings contribute to a growing understanding about the suggestibility of ideological bias and illuminate the (limited) potential of bias awareness in mitigating biased information processing.",

This article discusses challenges and recent innovations in collecting and documenting human-coded data. We review five datasets produced within the past 10 years and also reflect on our experiences in collecting a quarterly dataset that tracked state responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that scholars can deliberately produce and publish theoretically grounded human-coded data in an accessible format that promotes transparency, traceability, and readability. We highlight several ways that scholars are already doing this, including narratives, source lists, and coding justifications that enhance the quality of their human-coded datasets. We also discuss common issues during coding and how technological innovation through interactive web-based platforms can improve the documentation of coding decisions.",

There are many examples (and years) of exploitation, fraud, and violence in these exchanges, and more recent scholarship on fieldwork ethics has established new norms of reciprocal exchange rather than exploitation in these relationships. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, asymmetric access to health care, and global vaccine inequality has added yet another layer of complexity here. How do we continue move forward with the push to make our research exchanges ethical while dealing with the additional complexity of the pandemic? In this article, I reflect on the ethics of these exchanges and concerns around security for interlocutors in replacing in person fieldwork with virtual fieldwork, drawing from examples of my own doctoral dissertation research in the Pacific region of Colombia, which was interrupted by the outbreak of COVID-19. In this article, I describe how a turn to the digital archives helped mitigate additional ethical and security concerns that arose as a result of the pandemic.",

Conjoint designs, however, do not always mirror the real-world decision-making contexts that individuals engage in because respondents are typically forced to select one of the available options. Theoretically, we illustrate how offering respondents an abstention option can produce average marginal component effects (AMCEs) of differing signs and magnitudes relative to a forced-choice outcome. This difference depends on (1) the proportion of respondents who would rather abstain than select profiles lacking their preferred attribute-levels and (2) those respondents’ preference orderings. Empirically, we replicate two conjoint experiments and demonstrate how omitting a realistic abstention option could lead to different AMCE estimates.",
