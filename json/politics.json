          "authors": "JEREMY BOWLES, HORACIO LARREGUY",
          "abstract": "We examine how the effects of initiatives intended to promote programmatic competition are conditioned by candidates’ often mixed incentives to participate in them. In a nationwide debate initiative designed to solicit and widely rebroadcast policy promises from Liberian legislative candidates, we analyze the randomized encouragement of debate participation across districts. The intervention substantially increased the debate participation of leading candidates but had uneven electoral consequences, with incumbents benefiting at the expense of their challengers. These results are driven by incumbents’ more positive selection into participation on the basis of their policy alignment with voters; voters’ heightened attention to them; and how candidates’ campaigns responded in turn. The results underscore wide variation in candidates’ suitability for programmatic politics and highlight important challenges in transitioning away from clientelistic political equilibria.",

          "abstract": "Many Americans express a mix of conservative and liberal views across issues. Prior research indicates these voters are cross-pressured. A recent, influential article “Moderates” (Fowler et al. 2023) argues that these voters instead largely have centrist views on individual issues. To reach this conclusion, “Moderates” develops a method to determine which voters’ views are well-summarized by liberal-conservative ideology. “Moderates” finds that most voters’ views are. It therefore concludes that the large number of such voters with centrist estimated ideologies—“moderates”—must hold centrist views on issues. We show that this method systematically overstates how many voters’ views are well-summarized by liberal-conservative ideology: it assumes voters’ views are unless they either answer questions randomly or form a single cluster with distinctive views. In simulations, we show this problem is large. The article’s core conclusion that many voters who express a mix of conservative and liberal views can be inferred to support centrist policies therefore remains in doubt.",

          "abstract": "Information on social media is characterized by networked curation processes in which users select other users from whom to receive information, and those users in turn share information that promotes their identities and interests. We argue this allows for partisan “curation bubbles” of users who share and consume content with consistent appeal drawn from a variety of sources. Yet, research concerning the extent of filter bubbles, echo chambers, or other forms of politically segregated information consumption typically conceptualizes information’s partisan valence at the source level as opposed to the story level. This can lead domain-level measures of audience partisanship to mischaracterize the partisan appeal of sources’ constituent stories—especially for sources estimated to be more moderate. Accounting for networked curation aligns theory and measurement of political information consumption on social media.",

          "authors": "ANGIE N. OCAMPO-ROLAND",
          "abstract": "Examining group boundaries is instrumental to understanding intergroup relations, particularly differences in boundary drawing between prototypical and peripheral group members. Whether identity strength and prototypicality have an interactive effect on how group members draw boundaries has been underexplored. We also know less about how different Latinos are viewed, despite the group’s vast diversity. This paper takes up these questions and compares white and Black Americans’ views of Latinos as American. Strikingly, among all respondents, U.S. born Latinos are seen as less American when their parent is undocumented. The results suggest that Black Americans are driven by economic and political concerns and perceive greater commonality with more marginalized Latinos. Whites are driven by cultural concerns and prefer those who will not challenge their prototypicality. This illustrates a divergence in how Latinos are received among each group.",

          "authors": "Edmund Kelly, James Tilley",
          "abstract": "One reason given for declining levels of trust in politicians and institutions is the incidence of scandals involving voters' representatives. Politicians implicated in scandals, especially financial scandals, typically see their constituents' support for them decrease. It has been suggested that these specific negative judgements about a representative's misconduct spill over onto diffuse political trust in the system as a whole. We argue that the 2009 Parliamentary expenses scandal in the United Kingdom is a strong test of these scandal spillover effects in a non-experimental context. Yet, using a multilevel analysis of survey and representative implication data, we find no evidence for these effects. This is despite voters being aware of their MP's scandal implication, and this awareness affecting voters' support for their own MP. We conclude that voters' judgements about their constituency representatives are unlikely to affect their diffuse political trust.",

          "abstract": "The revived men’s movement, colloquially the “manosphere,” has recently increased in prominence and influence, and has been connected to numerous instances of violence, including mass shootings targeting women. Despite this, political science has paid scant attention to the manosphere, and the tactics these groups use against women, feminism, and gender equality, including violence. This theory-building paper begins to fill this gap by focusing on two goals. First, using an original dataset of manosphere blogs, forums, and websites, we provide a descriptive analysis of the manosphere. Second, we develop an original typology of the manosphere along two dimensions — communitarianism and their interactions with women — which helps us theorize about which manosphere subgroups are more prone to use violence. We also compare cases from each subgroup to show initial proof of concept for our theory. Ultimately, we show how excluding the manosphere from political conversation inhibits a comprehensive understanding of contentious politics.",

          "abstract": "Existing research contends that clientelist parties seek alternative voter mobilization strategies when material exchanges no longer guarantee office. This article argues that engaging in strategic interactions with influential interest groups constitutes an alternative way to mobilize support. Pressured by competition, clientelist parties align policy with interest group preferences and obtain support from members and followers in return. Using a comparative subnational design and primary data, I show how Mexico’s PRI passed a restrictive abortion amendment to obtain clergy support in Yucatán but abstained from reform in Hidalgo where it faced similar competition but perceived clergy as unable to bolster votes. The findings shed light on clientelist parties’ voter mobilization strategies and the policy effects of interest group interactions in new democracies and other developing contexts.",

          "abstract": "Is rising inequality an inevitable consequence of the transition to a knowledge-based economy? Departing from existing approaches in labor economics and comparative political economy, we develop an account of inequality in the knowledge economy that foregrounds the role of labor market institutions. We argue that collective bargaining institutions play a critical role in mediating the skill bias commonly associated with the diffusion of information and communications technologies (ICT), because they determine whether employers have the discretion to selectively reward strategically important high-skilled workers with greater wages and benefits. We then test our argument by carrying out cross-country analyses of both wage premia and non-wage benefits in the OECD countries. We find robust evidence in support of our theoretical propositions across a range of model specifications.",

          "abstract": "Under what conditions can the Left become electorally competitive in exclusionary contexts where actors championing redistribution face barriers to entry? We argue that leftist parties can significantly increase electoral support during inclusionary institutional openings, such as peace processes, when previously excluded grassroots actors find new spaces to mobilize for redistribution. By engaging in hinge institutions—non-binding, nationwide platforms—grassroots movements strengthen their organizational and ideational endowments, becoming potent brokers for heretofore weak leftist parties. Using a difference-in-differences design and a novel database on citizen proposals to the Colombian peace table, we show that grassroots mobilization mainly increases the Left’s vote share in post-accord presidential elections at the municipal level. We unpack the mechanisms through in-depth interviews with key actors and party manifesto analysis.",

          "abstract": "Scholars are increasingly drawing attention to the societal consequences of conflict-related violence. What remains unclear is the interplay between short-term and long-term legacies of wartime traumas. We consider the case of Mosul, Iraq, a setting in which inhabitants have experienced wide-ranging victimization during both recent and historical contexts. In a 2022 survey, we inquired across a broad range of self-reported conflict experiences involving personal and kinship-based victimization including physical and sexual violence, property destruction, forced imprisonment, and displacement as a result of ISIS occupation. We also probed for victimization dating back to the Iran-Iraq War. Examining altruism toward other ISIS victims in a dictator game, we find that while ISIS-related victimization increases out-group empathy and reduces in-group bias in altruism, earlier conflict experiences exert independent influence as well. We consider the implications of our findings for conflict research involving multiple layers and sources of trauma and victimization.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, international relations scholarship on shaming by non-governmental organizations has grown dramatically, providing us with many insights into how country-level improvement occurs in the areas of human rights and the environment, among other issues. Using machine learning techniques, this project built an updated dataset on NGO shaming from almost 1.5 million articles in the media from 2001 to 2020. The dataset covers a wide set of organizations with goals outside of the traditional focus on human rights. Our approach will allow researchers to explicitly examine shaming as a dyadic event, occurring from a specific NGO sender to a specific country target. Using our new dataset, we first validated existing research on shaming in the current populist era and then examined how the nature of the NGO and the nature of the country jointly facilitated shaming. Our approach and dataset will be useful to both academics and to the policy community.",

These practices help shape the behaviors of militant organizations in a variety of ways. However, despite their relevance, there is a dearth of systematically collected, cross-group data on the magical practices of rebel organizations. In response, we have constructed the Magical Acts by Groups in Civil Conflicts (MAGICC) dataset, which contains novel data on the magical practices employed by 106 African rebel organizations that were active at least at some point during the period of 1989 to 2011. To highlight the value of the data, we use them to test a hypothesis about the recruitment of child soldiers.",

I extend a one-dimensional voting model by taking into account that voters, in addition to having economic preferences, also care about cultural issues. Political parties diverge in the cultural dimension to be able to implement different tax rates. A higher level of pre-tax income inequality makes it more difficult to win the election by proposing a low tax rate, but the right-wing party may be able to win the election by bundling a low tax rate with a focus on cultural issues.",

Heterodox individuals are less likely to express their views if other peers refrain from doing so and if the elite is prestigious. In turn, corruption by the elite is less easily detected if orthodox views dominate. We characterize equilibrium self-denial and corruption and show that an exogenous increase in the range of orthodox views may result in a decrease in the total number of individuals truthfully expressing their views.

Despite this, there is a scarcity of academic literature on how conspiracy theories are utilised in parliaments. This study addresses this gap by examining how political parties in Turkey use and respond to conspiracy theories through an analysis of parliamentary debates. It employs the qualitative content analysis method, appropriate for the open-ended and exploratory nature of this inquiry. The investigation is guided by Weberian theory, which categorises types of thinking, to delineate the rationalities political parties use to interpret conspiracy theories. The findings indicate that Turkish political parties deploy conspiracy theories instrumentally to advance their agendas and discredit opponents. The research concludes that conspiracy theories are a regular and essential aspect of mainstream politics in Turkey, used pragmatically by political actors, rather than as marginal phenomena employed by extremists.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic latent variable models generally link units’ positions on a latent dimension over time via random walks. Theoretically, these trajectories are often expected to resemble a mixture of periods of stability interrupted by moments of change. In these cases, a prior distribution such as the regularized horseshoe—that allows for both stasis and change—can prove a better theoretical and empirical fit for the underlying construct than other priors. Replicating Reuning, Kenwick, and Fariss (2019), we find that the regularized horseshoe performs better than the standard normal and the Student’s t-distribution when modeling dynamic latent variable models. Overall, the use of the regularized horseshoe results in more accurate and precise estimates. More broadly, the regularized horseshoe is a promising prior for many similar applications.",

          "abstract": "Analysts often seek to compare representations in high-dimensional space, e.g., embedding vectors of the same word across groups. We show that the distance measures calculated in such cases can exhibit considerable statistical bias, that stems from uncertainty in the estimation of the elements of those vectors. This problem applies to Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and other similar measures. After illustrating the severity of this problem for text-as-data applications, we provide and validate a bias correction for the squared Euclidean distance. This same correction also substantially reduces bias in ordinary Euclidean distance and cosine similarity estimates, but corrections for these measures are not quite unbiased and are (non-intuitively) bimodal when distances are close to zero. The estimators require obtaining the variance of the latent positions. We (will) implement the estimator in free software, and we offer recommendations for related work.",

          "abstract": "Regression discontinuity designs (RDD) are widely used in the social sciences to estimate causal effects from observational data. Following recent methodological advances, scholars can choose from various RDD estimators for point estimation and inference. This decision is mainly guided by theoretical results on optimality and Monte Carlo simulations because of a paucity of research on the performance of the different estimators in recovering real-world experimental benchmarks. Leveraging exact ties in personal votes in local elections in Colombia and Finland, which are resolved by a random lottery, we assess the performance of various estimators featuring different polynomial degrees, bias-correction methods, optimal bandwidths, and approaches to statistical inference. Using re-running and re-election as outcomes, we document only minor differences in the performance of the various implementation approaches when the conditional expectation function (CEF) of the outcomes in the vicinity of the discontinuity is close to linear. When approximating the curvature of the CEF is more challenging, bias-corrected and robust inference with coverage-error-rate-optimal bandwidths comes closer to the experimental benchmark than more widely used alternative implementations.",

Our primary contribution is to characterize the relationship between replication and distinct formulations of external validity. Whereas conventional wisdom holds that replication facilitates learning about external validity, we show that this is not, in general, the case. Our results show how comparisons of the magnitude or sign of empirical findings link to distinct concepts of external validity. However, without careful attention to the research design of constituent studies, replication can mislead efforts to assess external validity. We show that two studies must have essentially the same research designs, i.e., be harmonized, in order for their estimates to provide information about any kind of external validity. This result shows that even minor differences in research design between a study and its replication can introduce a discrepancy that is typically overlooked, a problem that becomes more pronounced as the number of studies increases. We conclude by outlining a design-driven approach to replication, which responds to the issues our framework identifies and details how a research agenda can manage them productively.",

          "authors": "David A. Armstrong, William Poirier",
          "abstract": "Confidence intervals are ubiquitous in the presentation of social science models, data, and effects. When several intervals are plotted together, one natural inclination is to ask whether the estimates represented by those intervals are significantly different from each other. Unfortunately, there is no general rule or procedure that would allow us to answer this question from the confidence intervals alone. It is well known that using the overlaps in 95% confidence intervals to perform significance tests at the 0.05 level does not work. Recent scholarship has developed and refined a set of tools for inferential confidence intervals that permit inference on confidence intervals with the appropriate type I error rate in many different bivariate contexts. These are all based on the same underlying idea of identifying the multiple of the standard error (i.e., a new confidence level) such that the overlap in confidence intervals matches the desired type I error rate. These procedures remain stymied by multiple simultaneous comparisons. We propose an entirely new procedure for developing inferential confidence intervals that decouples the testing and visualization that can overcome many of these problems in any visual testing scenario. We provide software in R and Stata to accomplish this goal.",

          "authors": "Cornelius Fritz, Marius Mehrl, Paul W. Thurner, Göran Kauermann",
          "abstract": "Substantive research in the Social Sciences regularly investigates signed networks, where edges between actors are positive or negative. One often-studied example within International Relations for this type of network consists of countries that can cooperate with or fight against each other. These analyses often build on structural balance theory, one of the earliest and most prominent network theories. While the theorization and description of signed networks have made significant progress, the inferential study of link formation within them remains limited in the absence of appropriate statistical models. We fill this gap by proposing the Signed Exponential Random Graph Model (SERGM), extending the well-known Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to networks where ties are not binary but positive or negative if a tie exists. Since most networks are dynamically evolving systems, we specify the model for both cross-sectional and dynamic networks. Based on hypotheses derived from structural balance theory, we formulate interpretable signed network statistics, capturing dynamics such as “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”. In our empirical application, we use the SERGM to analyze cooperation and conflict between countries within the international state system. We find evidence for structural balance in International Relations.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic models of aggregate public opinion are increasingly popular, but to date they have been restricted to unidimensional latent traits. This is problematic because in many domains the structure of mass preferences is multidimensional. We address this limitation by deriving a multidimensional ordinal dynamic group-level item response theory (MODGIRT) model. We describe the Bayesian estimation of the model and present a novel workflow for dealing with the difficult problem of identification. With simulations, we show that MODGIRT recovers aggregate parameters without estimating subject-level ideal points and is robust to moderate violations of assumptions. We further validate the model by reproducing at the group level an existing individual-level analysis of British attitudes towards redistribution. We then reanalyze a recent cross-national application of a group-level item response theory model, replacing its domain-specific confirmatory approach with an exploratory MODGIRT model. We describe extensions to allow for overdispersion, differential item functioning, and group-level predictors. A publicly available R package implements these methods.",

Using one natural formalization of motivated reasoning as wanting to believe certain things (“once-motivated reasoning”), this is not possible. Anyone exhibiting this kind of motivated reasoning has a “Fully Bayesian Equivalent” with a different prior, who has identical posterior beliefs upon observing any signal. This result clarifies what we can and cannot learn from several prominent research designs and identifies a set of results inconsistent with both Bayesian updating and once-motivated reasoning. An expanded version of the model where subjects sometimes completely reject signals that lead to less pleasant beliefs (“twice-motivated reasoning”) can explain these anomalies. The models clarify which empirical tests can provide evidence for different kinds of motivated beliefs and can be incorporated into decision- and game-theoretic models.",

This study examines adolescents' perceptions of parties' left–right positions and their substantive understandings of ‘left’ and ‘right’ with an innovative battery of items. We use original survey data from Dutch adolescents and their parents to investigate differences and similarities in their perceptions of party positions and the meanings they attach to ‘left’ and ‘right.’ Our findings show that adolescents' understanding of ‘left’ and ‘right’ is remarkably similar to that of the generation of their parents. Even though left–right perceptions of adolescents seem to be influenced by their own parents, adolescents form their perceptions mostly in line with those of the median voter, particularly adolescents that are more engaged and knowledgeable.",

Or are antidemocratic people more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs? To answer these important questions, we collected longitudinal data during two concurrent democratic elections—the 2020 US Presidential Election ( N = 609) and the 2020 General Election in New Zealand ( N = 603). Random intercept cross‐lagged panel models tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect criticism of democracy in general, as well as support for authoritarianism, and both direct and representative democracy, specifically. There was little evidence that conspiracy beliefs temporally preceded changes in attitudes toward democracy or support for any specific form of government. Instead, people who supported authoritarianism more subsequently endorsed stronger conspiracy beliefs. The results suggested that, in the context of electoral contests (e.g., elections), antidemocratic people are more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs rather than conspiracy beliefs fostering antidemocratic views.",

Our study contributes to this national-level examination of gender diversity and inclusion by examining the extent to which a gender gap within the subfield of security studies, identified in the international literature, also is present in Canada. Research on gender representation and gendered experiences mostly centers on the academic workforce in the United States. However, in this article, we share the results of a multi-method investigation into the state of gender diversity in Canadian security studies—a national context in which the university sector has signaled a strong commitment to diversity and the government has actively promoted gender equality in official policy. By analyzing data collected from an online survey of security studies scholars in Canada and a document analysis of Canadian security-related journals and selected security studies syllabi, this contribution provides evidence that women are underrepresented in Canadian security studies and experience the subfield in less positive ways. We discuss the implications of these findings for the security studies subfield and suggest paths for future research and key recommendations.",

The goal of the laboratory was to revise which type of learning objectives our teaching should have and which type of assessment methods are best suited for an environment in which GenAI is present and used regularly. Should we ban it or should we instead focus on teaching students how to use it responsibly and ethically, as well as developing a shared understanding of what GenAI is good for (if anything at all)?

There is a nearly 10 percentage-point increase in support, including among partisan Republicans, when transgender rights in sports are preceded by priming and framing around the more general LGBT+ rights struggle. Our results underscore the importance of broader LGBT+ rights advocacy to public acceptance of the transgender community.",

Within a remarkably short time frame, the BSW has achieved significant electoral success, prompting a lively debate concerning the political origins of its voter base. A central question remains: to what extent can the BSW attract supporters from other parties such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD) or Social Democrats (SPD)? This study employs recent data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) panel to investigate voter flow dynamics and the issues motivating shifts towards the BSW. Our findings reveal that while the BSW struggles to attract core AfD supporters, the party has been notably more effective in appealing to recent AfD supporters. Overall, opposition to Ukraine support is the single most important issue that drives voters towards BSW.",
