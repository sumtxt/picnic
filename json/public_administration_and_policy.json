          "authors": "Howard H. Wang, Edmund W. Cheng, Xi Chen, Hai Liang",
          "abstract": "The prevailing view that authoritarian regimes primarily respond to threats of instability is challenged by our research, which posits that such regimes also take citizen complaints seriously, even when they do not pose a direct threat. Based on 238,835 citizen claims from China's largest national online petition platform from 2020 to 2021 and 793,119 citizen claims from Wuhan's local petition website, this study reveals that online complaints result in greater governmental responsiveness, compared to non‐complaints. This institutionalized feedback mechanism is driven by a mix of factors: the upper‐level officials' expectation for negative feedback, combined with bureaucrats' efforts to preserve themselves and avoid punitive consequences. Our findings thus enhance the understanding of what drives authoritarian responsiveness and signal a caution that an overreliance on managing complaints may deepen a stability‐maintenance mechanism, potentially impeding substantial reform.",

          "title": "Making Administrative Work Matter in Public Service Delivery: A Lens for Linking Practice with the Purpose of Office",
          "authors": "Kirstine Karmsteen",
          "abstract": "Among the general public as well as in the scientific literature, administrative work is widely associated with heavy bureaucratic procedures that are disconnected from serving clients. Less is said and written about the importance of administrative work in delivering public service. Drawing on a relational theoretical approach and based on an ethnographic field study in two municipal child welfare units in Denmark (including 38 days of observations and 30 interviews), this study shows how administrative work plays three key functions in various accountability relations, and that these functions aid street-level bureaucrats in mastering the complexities of their work. The study offers a theoretical framework that delineates the functions of administrative work in complex street-level practice. By demonstrating how administrative work may contribute positively to fulfilling the purposes of street-level work, this study contributes to developing our understanding of administrative work as an invaluable part of street-level work and provides a more nuanced foundation for future studies on the virtues and issues of administrative work.",

          "abstract": "Strategic program management (SPM) is an approach for advancing the aspirations of programs and their impact. While programs are omnipresent in government, concerns exist that they are not always strategically managed. Studies that examine SPM are lacking. This study defines and conceptualizes SPM, examines it in two national governments (Brazil and Indonesia), and focuses on felt performance accountability as a driver of SPM use. SPM use is highly uneven, and despite concerns about the effectiveness of performance accountability in the public sector, a key finding is that program managers' felt performance accountability is associated with increased SPM use by program officials. Managers' performance accountability also increases political appointees' support for programs and decreases their interference with program priorities. These findings are important because they provide a means for program officials, typically civil servants, to strengthen the strategic direction of public programs. Recommendations are made for strengthening the performance accountability of managers.",

          "authors": "Miyeon Song, Seung‐Ho An, Sun Gue (Susan) Yang",
          "abstract": "The literature on citizen satisfaction has predominantly focused on the key factors of service quality, with scant attention paid to the role of equity. Furthermore, these studies often rely on a single demographic identity within a single country, limiting their scope. This study aims to address these gaps by examining how outcome disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) affect satisfaction with service providers across countries. Using a cross‐national education database, we employ three SES measures—education, income, and occupation—to test how disparities in student performance across SES groups affect parents' satisfaction with schools. Our findings show that parents in less professional occupations express lower satisfaction with schools when their children underperform compared with students whose parents hold more professional jobs. However, this relationship does not exist for education‐ or income‐based disparities. This study advances the understanding of how outcome disparities based on SES are associated with citizen satisfaction.",
