          "authors": "Jostein Askim, Adam Gendźwiłł, Jan Erling Klausen",
          "abstract": "Territorial restructuring through amalgamating local authorities has figured prominently on the agendas of European governments for many decades. Precisely where and when restructuring occurs is poorly understood, although it is broadly assumed to be initiated in response to fiscal stress, urbanization, and functional decentralization. Using a large-N approach with a 30-year time series for 39 European countries, this article demonstrates that associations between these problems and territorial restructuring depend on institutional decision rules, specifically whether the power to decide on local government amalgamations is centralized or dispersed. The findings indicate that policymakers at the local level are particularly attentive to demographic problems, whereas policymakers at the central level pay more attention to problems related to policy delivery. We outline theoretical and practical implications.",

          "authors": "Cody R. Taylor, Saman Afshan, Kara L. Lawrence",
          "abstract": "Embracing participatory budgeting in meaningful ways gives the citizenry an increased voice in allocating local government funds. Using an integrated social equity framework, we compare ten communities in the U.S. that have implemented participatory budgeting. Qualitative interviews of public managers involved in participatory budgeting revealed that, when designed with equity in mind, PB can promote access, fairness, and quality, leading to meaningful outcomes for marginalized groups, such as support for homeownership, increased civic participation, and additional funding for education. Our sample largely favored the practice because of its ability to facilitate inclusion, provide citizens with a greater level of engagement, and the ability for individual and organizational learning. Despite challenges, our findings demonstrate the potential of participatory budgeting to enhance social fairness in local governments. Future research should concentrate on overcoming obstacles and the factors that lead communities to prioritize certain projects over others.",

          "authors": "Nicole Philippczyck, Harry Hoffmann, Simon Oertel",
          "abstract": "Mission statements are common instruments for the strategic positioning of universities. However, there are few large‐scale, cross‐national studies examining the factors that influence the content of universities' mission statements. We address this research gap, exploring the content of 413 mission statements from European universities by applying correlated topic modeling (CTM). Moreover, relying on institutional theories of organization, we study factors that explain differences in the content of mission statements. Our findings reveal six distinct topics addressed in mission statements. The prevalence of a specific topic is significantly shaped by the cultural rationalization of the universities' national context, the university's founding context, and institutional control. Our findings not only contribute to research on universities' strategic positioning but also shed light on the diffusion of global trends across organizations and the determinants of their adaptation. Moreover, our study offers an illustrative example of how big data analytics can enhance public administration research.",

          "title": "Beyond Simplification in Public Sector Accountability: Contradictions Between Principal‐Agent and Complexity Theories",
          "authors": "Tomi Rajala, Harri Jalonen",
          "abstract": "This conceptual study explores the complexity of public sector accountability, traditionally framed by principal‐agent theory (PAT), which simplifies relationships through rigid contracts. The findings reveal how PAT's assumptions often misalign with the intricate realities of public sector accountability, which are better explained by complexity theories (CT). Contradictions between PAT and CT assumptions are highlighted, underlining the need for more flexible and dynamic accountability frameworks. The study calls for further research to refine the concept of complexity‐based accountability and investigate tensions between practical accountability applications of PAT and CT. Such research could transform public administration practice and scholarship by better accommodating the complex realities of managing public services.",

          "authors": "Zhijun Pei",
          "abstract": "Compliance with government rules and guidelines is essential for effectively managing pandemic emergencies. Few studies have examined how street‐level bureaucrats (SLBs)' behavioral performance shapes citizen compliance decisions. This study combines the stereotype content model (SCM) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) of persuasion in a large‐scale randomized between‐subjects survey experiment conducted in China. The study tests the hypothesis that citizens' impressions of warmth and competence toward SLBs have respective and interactive positive persuasive effects on their compliance with government rules and guidelines during a pandemic emergency. The study finds that the impressions of competence and warmth are always important for citizen compliance in a pandemic emergency; and the impression of warmth matters more for citizen compliance for competent bureaucrats. An interaction effect between impressions of SLBs' warmth and competence in predicting citizen compliance was also confirmed. Citizens are more inclined to comply when they perceive SLBs as both competent and warm. The study concludes that citizens' compliance with government rules and guidelines during a pandemic emergency partly depends on their impressions of the quality of bureaucratic encounters. Thus, probing and highlighting citizens' impressions of SLBs during citizen–bureaucratic interactions is theoretically and practically worthwhile.",

          "title": "“Is Lobbying for Losers?”: Corporate Behavior and Canadian Military Procurement Contracting",
          "authors": "Andrea Migone, David Chen, Bryan Evans, Alex Howlett, Michael Howlett",
          "abstract": "Lobbying is a multi‐faceted phenomenon that involves interest groups and corporations contacting politicians and officials in order to try to achieve their policy preferences. While interest group policy‐related lobbying has received a great deal of attention, studies of corporate contract lobbying are rarer even though this is a much older phenomenon. The article critically examines the commonly‐held position that in the latter case “lobbying is for winners”; that is, that large scale corporate lobbying helps secure contracts that might otherwise have gone to a different firm. It argues instead that firms enjoying technological and other market‐related strengths enjoy an “insider advantage” and lobby less than firms in more competitive situations. In other words that in many situations “lobbying is for losers,” a tool used by weaker firms trying to match or offset the technological and other advantages enjoyed by dominant firms. The article draws on government lobbying registers to examine recent defense‐related procurement efforts in Canada to purchase fighter jets, naval surface ships, patrol vessels, and search and rescue aircraft and the contract lobbying they engendered. Evidence from the four cases provides support for the “loser” thesis with respect to large‐scale technologically advanced goods but also the need to carefully define what constitutes an “inside advantage” allowing firms to forego or delay their lobbying activity, often until only after a contract has been awarded.",
