          "title": "Does Transparency Reach Citizens? National Accountability Mechanisms and Public Perceptions in Europe",
          "authors": "Julia Trautendorfer, Nina Eder",
          "abstract": "Governments worldwide have introduced transparency and accountability regulations so that citizens can hold officials accountable for their actions and fulfill their role as “watchdogs” of the state. In the long term, this should legitimize government by mitigating information asymmetries between citizens and the government. Therefore, if adequate mechanisms that empower citizens to increase government transparency and the accountability of public officials are properly stipulated in the law, do citizens also perceive it that way? Understanding public perceptions of decision‐making processes and government activities is crucial for policymaking because citizens are the ultimate evaluators of policy outcomes. Thus, this study examines whether such institutionalized regulations reach citizens and (positively) affect citizens' perceptions of government transparency. Using individual‐level data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and country‐level data from the European Public Accountability Mechanisms Dataset (EuroPAM), we analyze the impact of five accountability indicators on citizens' perceptions of transparency in 28 European countries. Using the large‐N sample data from the ESS, we control for socio‐demographic variables and thus also shed light on covariates of citizens' perceptions of transparency. Contrary to our hypotheses, we find that the scope of accountability mechanisms is not indicative of perceived transparency. Rather, our findings point toward a more complex relationship between national policies and citizens' perception, and underline the importance of distinguishing between de jure, de facto, and perceived transparency.",

          "abstract": "Comparative social policy research frequently deals, implicitly or explicitly, with time and timing in the development of welfare states. We identify three types of such temporal theorizations – i.e. stage models, timed orders, and periodizations – and analyze their relevance for global social policy development. We do so by employing sequence and cluster analysis to a new comprehensive dataset of social policy adoption in 164 countries over 140 years (1880–2019). While our analysis reveals certain common stages of social policy consolidation – from education mandates and health care systems over work-related protections to care services – we also find varying trajectories which challenge conventional regional clustering narratives. Moreover, our analysis highlights two periods which have so far not featured prominently in comparative welfare state research: The interwar years (1919–1929) and the period of decolonization (1949–1969).",

          "abstract": "Public service exams are extremely competitive in East Asia. Does a high entry bar impede people with high public service motivation (PSM) from taking the exam? If so, what kinds of people are interested in taking a difficult public service exam? We employ a randomized control trial (RCT) to manipulate perceptions of exam competitiveness, using 1804 survey responses from online advertisements targeting individuals interested in public service careers in South Korea and Taiwan. OLS regression analyses (adjusted R 2 = 0.116, Model 7) with moderation tests show that when exam competitiveness is high (2.5% passing rate), public service positions are attractive to those who have high PSM, high academic competence, and low material desires. When exam competitiveness is lower (5% passing rate), public sector jobs remain attractive to individuals with high PSM, but public organizations become less likely to attract academically competent individuals and may not effectively screen out those primarily incentivized by material rewards. Our findings suggest that a high level of competitiveness in public service exams may have distinct merits, though given the modest explanatory power, we explicitly caution readers against overstating the strength of these findings.",

          "authors": "Brenda Sciepura, Alec Wall, Elizabeth Linos",
          "abstract": "Governments face significant challenges in attracting and retaining younger talent, leading to a workforce increasingly skewed towards older employees. This study examines the impact of public sector fellowship programs as alternative pathways into government roles for early career professionals. Leveraging data from 17 cohorts of applicants accross four US fellowship programs over 19 years ( N = 2141; 31,153 individual‐year observations), we employ a staggered difference‐in‐differences approach to compare the career trajectories of fellows and similarly motivated finalists. We find that fellowship participants are 30 percentage points more likely to pursue government careers, with a significant employment effect persisting up to 8 years after the launch of the fellowship. These findings suggest that scholarship can look beyond motivation‐based theories of who enters and stays in government to better understand how to bring new and different people into the public sector.",

          "authors": "Ahrum Chang",
          "abstract": "Representative bureaucracy theory posits that policy outcomes made by bureaucrats will reflect the interests of groups with whom they share social identities. However, the question remains whether each bureaucrat consistently acts on behalf of its constituents across a series of street‐level interactions. Considering the sequential nature of state‐citizen encounters, this study incorporates both social identity theory and identity theory into representative bureaucracy and examines whether Black and Hispanic officers' previous issuance of traffic citations affects their current issuance of citations toward same race/ethnic drivers. Tracking traffic citation practices of individual officers from Florida reveals that racial/ethnic congruence between officers and citizens results in fewer citations. However, officers who issued citations in their preceding encounters are more likely to cite the same race/ethnic drivers in current encounters. These results indicate that bureaucrats' previous interactional contexts may limit their current provision of substantive representation, overwhelming the influence of shared social identities.",

          "authors": "Mads Pieter van Luttervelt",
          "abstract": "Public managers at all levels of the political‐administrative hierarchy take on a dual role as both principal and agent simultaneously. Because of this dual role, it is relevant for public managers to maintain credibility with their agents and remain loyal to their principals. This article develops a theory arguing that public managers can approach their dual role in a given situation utilizing a strategy based on one of four ideal types: Squires prioritize loyalty, Chieftains prioritize credibility, Mavericks prioritize neither, while Diplomats prioritize both. The relative distribution of preferences and information among public managers, and their principals and agents determines the viability of utilizing each strategy in that situation. The article contributes with a theoretical framework that allows us to better understand and analyze the dual role of public managers. It also promotes a research agenda by outlining relevant situations to examine and potential implications of the theory.",

          "authors": "Kees Huizinga, Martin de Bree",
          "abstract": "There is growing evidence of the occurrence of several types of goal displacement in regulatory enforcement agencies. A major underlying determinant of these phenomena is the neglect of ambiguities characterizing the goals of these agencies. This paper proposes three strategies that carefully consider these goal ambiguities to contain goal displacement. Each of them relates to an important underlying process in enforcement regimes. The first, multifocal scope selection, seeks to establish a balanced process of selecting regulated organizations to inspect. The second, multitier compliance perception, aims to increase the robustness of the translation of regulatory requirements to the specific settings of regulated organizations. Finally, multi‐indicator means specification strives to solidify the subordinate position of means to goals in the process of means specification. These ambiguity management strategies may shed new light on how to optimally manage enforcement agencies to increase their effectiveness.",
