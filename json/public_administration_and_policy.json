          "authors": "Jostein Askim, Tobias Bach, Kristoffer Kolltveit",
          "abstract": "How do the professional backgrounds of senior bureaucrats affect their competence and political responsiveness? This article fills a gap by examining these questions in a meritocratic context that accommodates nuanced but potentially consequential variations in the recruitment of senior bureaucrats. Using a paired survey experiment with citizens, representatives, and administrators in Norway, the article demonstrates that agency heads are perceived as less competent and – to a lesser extent – more politically responsive if their profile deviates from the meritocratic ideal of the career civil servant with mission-specific expertise. The article also compares perceptions between groups of stakeholders, filling another gap in the literature. Treatment effects go in the same direction across groups, but the results reveal a mismatch between popular and insider perceptions of bureaucracy: whereas citizens are practically indifferent, administrators are deeply concerned about the competence of an agency head who is a former politician rather than a career bureaucrat. Perceptions of substantive expertise are more aligned: all stakeholder groups view agency heads with mission-specific expertise as more competent and less politically responsive than generalists. Overall, the results demonstrate that variations in who is recruited to senior bureaucrat positions may either strengthen or undermine stakeholders’ views on good governance.",

          "title": "A reputational perspective on structural reforms: How media reputations are related to the structural reform likelihood of public agencies",
          "authors": "Jan Boon, Jan Wynen, Koen Verhoest, Walter Daelemans, Jens Lemmens",
          "abstract": "Despite recurrent observations that media reputations of agencies matter to understand their reform experiences, no studies have theorized and tested the role of sentiment. This study uses novel and advanced BERT language models to detect attributions of responsibility for positive/negative outcomes in media coverage towards 14 Flemish (Belgian) agencies between 2000-2015 through supervised machine learning, and connects these data to the Belgian State Administration Database on the structural reforms these agencies experienced. Our results reflect an inverted U-shaped relationship: more negative reputations increase the reform likelihood of agencies, yet up to a certain point at which the reform likelihood drops again. Variations in positive and neutral reputational signals do not impact the reform likelihood of agencies. Our study contributes to understanding the role of reputation as an antecedent of structural reforms. Complementing and enriching existing perspectives, the paper shows how the sentiment in reputational signals accumulates and informs political-administrative decision-makers to engage in structural reforms.",

          "authors": "Jonathan E. Collins",
          "abstract": "How does the public form preferences on racialized policy issues that are both widely discussed and broadly misunderstood? This has been the question centering around the sudden attacks on academic terms like “critical race theory” (CRT). I argue that the politicization of, and opinion polarization around, critical race theory is evidence of what I call policy branding, where political parties or organizations brand an arbitrary concept that has national salience into a policy issue. Using a series of original survey experiments, this study shows that one of the primary sources of opposition to critical race theory is the literal use of the term. I juxtapose this with evidence that the education policy issue at the core, antiracist teaching, maintained strong public, bipartisan support. This study has implications for the consequences of political elite capture of academic concepts and ideas.",

          "authors": "Raquel Gallego, Lara Maestripieri",
          "abstract": "Social innovation has broadly been defined as citizen-led initiatives aimed at improving community welfare through collaborative relationships. However, numerous studies demonstrate that social innovation might actually create new inequalities. In this paper, we address the following questions: how might socially innovative projects influence public policy? How can we understand a policy shift leading to institutions not only giving support to social innovation projects but even promoting their own social innovation schemes? Is institution-led social innovation different from citizen-led efforts? If so, how? We provide evidence of local public policy change occurring in 0–3 education and care in Barcelona between 2015 and 2021. We explain how this happened, examining who redefined the issue and how, how the policy domain was reorganized, and how the policy subsystem was restructured. Our conclusions show how and why citizens and institutions define social innovation differently and how innovative 0–3 policy in Barcelona was adopted.",

          "authors": "Mette Jakobsen, Fabian Homberg",
          "abstract": "Public sector professionals are often negatively portrayed with ascriptions such as “ineffective” and “lazy.” Such negative connotations might disadvantage public sector organizations when trying to attract applicants, as it can reflect negatively on individuals' social identities. With this pre‐registered experimental study, we examine stereotypes of public and private sector workers with and without a signal of specific professions present across both the public and private sector. We examine how this influences attraction in the initial phases of a job search before tangible job attributes become visible. Our study among 290 job seeking citizens in the United Kingdom provides evidence for a generic public sector worker bias, but the bias diminishes when the specific profession is known. Furthermore, we find that job seekers are less attracted to public employment and that this relationship is influenced by a negativity bias against public sector workers. We discuss implications of the study.",

          "authors": "Daniel Rogger, Christian Schuster",
          "abstract": "With the digitization of administrative systems, governments have gained access to rich data about their administrative operations. How governments leverage such data to improve their administration—what we call government analytics—will shape government effectiveness. This article summarizes a conceptual framework which showcases that data can help diagnose and improve all components of a public administration production function—from inputs such as personnel and goods, to processes and management practices, to outputs and outcomes. We then assess to what extent public administration scholarship analyses these data sources and can thus inform government analytics. A review of 689 quantitative articles in two public administration journals in 2013–2023 finds that 50% draw on surveys of public employees and 25% on surveys of citizens or firms. By contrast, administrative micro data (14% of articles) are underexploited. Practitioners and scholars would thus do well to expand the data sources used to inform better government.",

          "abstract": "Evidence‐based practice (EBP) has become a global public management movement to improve constituents' lives through government decision making. However, how civil servants' decisions are influenced by scientific evidence remains unanswered. In this study, we answer two related research questions: (1) How do different elements of evidence impact civil servants' program preferences? (2) How does the rating of evidence influence their program preferences? Collaborating with major governmental and nonprofit agencies that promote the use of EBPs, we invited civil servants from three U.S. state governments to a paired conjoint experiment. Our analysis shows that: Civil servants prefer programs with evidence that is: (1) from their own states; (2) more recent; (3) shows positive effect on people from different demographic groups; and is (4) created by independent government teams and university research teams. We also find the “evidence‐based” rating drives civil servants' preferences toward evidence with higher internal validity.",

          "abstract": "How can understanding the practice of government ministers help us to understand changes in public administration over time? Interviews with former UK ministers suggest that their practice has changed over the last 25 years. Their executive role has been accentuated as they have come to emphasize the importance of delivery and implementation to policy making. Reasons for that are examined, and consideration is given to how that shift in emphasis affects the ministers–civil servant relationship.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between automation risk and policy preferences is receiving increasing scholarly attention, but the discussion has yielded mixed and even contradicting results. This study aims to reconcile the results and contribute to the literature by exploring the specific conditions under which citizens prefer government interventions to reduce automation risk and their preferences for specific policy options. Using a survey experimental design in the case of robot installation in China, we find that individuals prefer government interventions that address automation risk in dangerous workplaces vs. those in regular workplaces. Individuals appear to prefer social investment policies such as training programs rather than taxation (e.g., robot tax), regulatory policies (e.g., robot quota), and compensatory policies (e.g., unemployment benefits) when exposed to such risks. We explain that citizens support the government in reducing robot replacement risk only when they perceive the beneficiary groups to be deserving of social protection and that the adopted policies can balance technological progress and unemployment risks.",
