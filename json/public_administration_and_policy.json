          "authors": "Lauren Yehle, Patrik Michaelsen, Niklas Harring, Sverker C. Jagers",
          "abstract": "We conduct a survey experiment testing the causal link between ethical justifications and acceptability towards two environmental policies: conservation area expansion and wildlife infrastructure. In a 2 × 3 experiment with American participants ( n = 1604), we test two ethical justifications – anthropocentric justification (nature as instrumentally valuable) and a non-anthropocentric justification (nature as intrinsically valuable) compared to a control group. We find partial support that non-anthropocentric justification increases policy acceptability compared to no justification. Contrary to expectations, non-anthropocentric justification leads to higher policy acceptability than anthropocentric justification. These results are robust to individual differences in political orientation and environmental concern. Additionally, participants in the non-anthropocentric experimental condition respond that similar conservation policies generally are, and should be, passed to benefit wildlife and ecosystems compared to control group participants. Likewise, participants given the anthropocentric justification report that similar policies are, and should be, passed for humans and society compared to the control group.",

          "authors": "Huange Xu, Guangchen Li, Bo Chen",
          "abstract": "Based on monthly panel data from 2014 to 2020 and employing the staggered difference-in-differences (staggered DID) method, we examine the impact of environmental vertical management reform on data manipulation in the public sector. We reveal that environmental vertical management reform significantly reduces data manipulation in the public sector. Moderating effect analysis shows that economic growth targets weaken the inhibitory impact of this reform. Conversely, public environmental concerns could enhance the inhibitory impact of this reform on data manipulation. Mechanism analysis reveals that environmental vertical management reform works through strengthening grassroots environmental law enforcement. The increased independence of law-enforcing departments has reduced the tendency of local governments to engage in data manipulation.",

          "authors": "Emma Northcott, Sheela Pandey, Sanjay K. Pandey, Eiko Strader",
          "abstract": "The Asian American experience in the federal workforce remains poorly understood. This qualitative study, based on interviews with 41 Asian American federal workers, examines how this heterogeneous minority group experiences racialization in the U.S. federal government. The analysis of interview data revealed five aggregate dimensions that shape the experiences of Asian American federal employees: (1) racial identity formation, (2) racialization at work, (3) aspects of the federal government context such as organizational culture and practices, (4) individual strategies to overcome constraints, and (5) awareness of the political climate and social ties outside the work context. By probing how Asian American employees experience racialization and the strategies they adopt in response, this study contributes to a small but growing literature on inclusion and racialization processes beyond the Black‐White binary in the U.S. public sector.",

          "abstract": "To increase understanding of the intergovernmental dimension of addressing homelessness, the National Academy of Public Administration in 2022 formed a Working Group of Academy Fellows. In researching three case studies that have had a measure of success, local leaders reached across geographic and functional boundaries to forge agreement on shared goals and joint strategy. Five basic tasks at the local level contributed to effective initiatives: One, defining, committing to, and communicating the challenge of homelessness, with agreement on shared objectives and a coordinated strategy. Two, building a network to coordinate the contributions of each partner. Three, designing and delivering timely integrated services by aligning federal and state programs to the local context. Four, collecting, using, and sharing data to inform planning and targeted delivery of assistance. Five, building or strengthening governance and financing structures that support continued action and learning to sustain and improve local efforts over time.",

          "authors": "Petter Gullmark, Tommy Høyvarde Clausen, Ali Aslan Gümüsay, Gry Agnete Alsos",
          "abstract": "Which entrepreneurial opportunities do public servants find appealing, and what influences their evaluation? Our investigation of 14 Norwegian municipal entrepreneurial projects indicates that public servants positively assess the attractiveness of welfare, economic, and participatory opportunities. Their evaluations are shaped by public sector logics. Our contribution is twofold: first, we connect the discourse on entrepreneurial opportunities with that of institutional logics, demonstrating that evaluations of public entrepreneurial opportunities depend on the presence and hierarchy of state, market, and community logics. This underscores the limited yet meaningful agency of public servants in these evaluations. Second, we illuminate underexplored public entrepreneurial opportunities by proposing a taxonomy that categorizes them based on the interplay of state, market, and community logics.",
