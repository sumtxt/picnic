          "title": "Consumer Authorities in Europe: Policing Markets or Empowering Consumers?",
          "authors": "Jacint Jordana, Joaquín Rozas‐Bugueño, Juan Carlos Triviño‐Salazar",
          "abstract": "Consumer protection authorities are vital for domestic markets and the smooth functioning of the EU common market. Established several decades ago, these authorities have different institutional designs in different European countries. This paper aims to identify them and assess their main variations. Based on the literature at the intersection of consumer protection regimes and regulatory governance, we propose a theoretical distinction between enforcement‐focused authorities and service delivery‐oriented authorities. Specifically, we suggest these principles lead to either a supervisory model, which disciplines market actors, or an empowering model, which gives citizens the keys to prevent market abuses. To empirically test whether these two models capture the variety of institutional designs and practices consumer authorities may adopt, we have identified four different dimensions that characterize their connections to politics, business, and citizens: political autonomy, social accountability, administrative enforcement, and consumer awareness. We begin by discussing which dimensions are associated with which model and then examine the presence of the two models across Europe. Our analysis is based on Bayesian factorial analysis and a Ward.D cluster construction grounded in an original dataset of institutional characteristics from general consumer authorities in 27 EU countries, the UK, and Norway, offering empirical evidence to support our argument. The results suggest that EU efforts to build institutional harmonization have had limited success. Likewise, traditional administrative models across Europe may no longer hold the same relevance as previously indicated in research. Our findings show instead that consumer authorities in Europe can generally be distinguished from each other based on these two principles, though many operate with a hybrid approach.",

          "abstract": "We examine how legislative hearings, mandatory in the appointment process for top executives, shape presidential management of cabinet. Research on legislative confirmation suggests that such a requirement generates a trade‐off in choosing between loyalty and competence types. Building on this insight, we argue that the appointees' career paths after entering presidential cabinets differ significantly after legislative hearings are adopted, according to which type they are. Using a quasi‐experimental identification strategy, we analyze original data on the careers of over 560 ministers from South Korea appointed pre‐ and post‐hearings. We find that competence types are more likely to be retained than loyalty types after legislative hearings. However, loyalty types are more likely to receive promotion—that is, transfer from their initial cabinet appointment to a higher‐prestige post—than competence types after legislative hearings. Additionally, we find that agency performance is better under competence types than under loyalty types.",

          "abstract": "Do the same management practices lead to greater job satisfaction in poorer and richer countries? Despite the centrality of this question, prior research has not statistically assessed it through multi‐country studies. We address this omission for one quintessential OECD country management reform: linking rewards—pay and promotion—to performance. We argue that performance rewards matter more for job satisfaction in richer than in poorer countries—for instance, because of fewer concerns with pay variability and fewer value clashes between cultural expectations and performance reward systems. In multi‐level analyses of an original survey of 19,300 bureaucrats in 10 countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we find that the association between performance rewards and job satisfaction significantly increases with country GDP per capita. Our findings underscore the potential limits of management practices inspired by evidence in OECD states for job satisfaction in developing country governments.",

          "authors": "Marta Almeida, Anne Stafford, Robert Scapens",
          "abstract": "Public‐private partnerships (PPPs) have long contract terms, requiring strong governance arrangements. When uncertainty arises, renegotiation is a commonly‐used contractual governance mechanism for ensuring fairness and dispute resolution. Notably, 100% of Portuguese road projects have been renegotiated. Prior studies have examined the tensions between the public and private parties which can become acute during times of crisis. One understudied aspect which complicates renegotiations but is important in terms of understanding how perceptions around governance issues contribute to renegotiation delays and outcomes is the intra‐partnership tensions which can arise between different partners with different objectives making up the private sector consortium. This study explores the complexities of a lengthy Portuguese renegotiation process. The findings uncover a nuanced reality where the renegotiation led to a worse outcome for all parties. This research contributes to the extant literature by exploring governance complexities in reshaping public services amid the wicked problems of the 21st century.",

          "authors": "Marta Ingaggiati, Marco Guerci, Giovanni Barbato, Renato Ruffini",
          "abstract": "In the historical trajectory of public administration (PA), bureaucratic and post‐bureaucratic models have competed and coexisted in unstable relations. Recent studies have put forward the idea that those models constitute two poles of the paradox. Despite growing interest in this paradox perspective in PA literature, extant studies have not extensively explored it across time and multiple organizational domains. To address these gaps, this article investigates how PAs have navigated the bureaucracy versus post‐bureaucracy paradox over almost 30 years in two interrelated organizational domains: managers' selection and training. Our study reveals that the balance between bureaucracy and post‐bureaucracy poles has changed over time and across two organizational domains, thus influencing different coping practices. We contribute to theoretical development by unraveling the (i) time‐specificity and (ii) domain‐specificity of the practices adopted to navigate the bureaucracy versus post‐bureaucracy paradox. Finally, we draw implications for policymakers and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of context‐sensitive ambidexterity.",

          "abstract": "Much of scholarly writing on compliance is derived from the experiences of Western multi‐national corporations operating in developed economies. This introduction to the special issue “China in Compliance” departs from such convention by asking how compliance works in China. By broadening the scope of compliance studies to include non‐Western contexts, including China and its relationship to the “Global South” and nondemocratic settings, the special issue breaks new ground in the empirical analysis of compliance industries, practices, and professionals. The special issue is comprised of seven articles that illustrate specific compliance problems for compliance in Chinese overseas direct investment. This introduction first provides a detailed overview of the growth of domestic corporate compliance in China over the last several years and then puts this growth in the context of Chinese companies engaging in overseas projects. It subsequently gives a roadmap of the articles and highlights their key themes and findings. The broader goal is to provide a conceptual foundation for the comparative study of compliance.",

          "authors": "R. Beetsma, F. Nicoli",
          "abstract": "During and following the Covid‐19 pandemic, the European Union (EU) is taking first steps toward a European Health Union (EHU). There is no set definition of what an EHU is, but in this paper, we explore the popular support for different designs of an EHU, including a pillar in which healthcare policy competences are shared between the EU and national governments, a risk‐sharing, and a redistributive pillar among countries. The analysis draws on two conjoint experiments in which respondents are presented with policy packages, as well as on a follow‐up survey on political attitudes. One of the experiments focuses on a central fiscal capacity that provides financial help to countries hit by adverse shocks, including financing of national healthcare spending, while the second focuses on joint procurement of medical countermeasures. The surveys were fielded in five EU countries at the end of March/beginning of April 2020, in July 2020, and in November 2022. Our findings are the following: there is support for all three pillars of an EHU, which moreover rises with trust in the EU; respondents tend to prefer a health‐related fiscal capacity to other forms of EU fiscal capacity; direct experience with serious Covid‐19 infection raises both trust in the EU and support for the EU sharing in social policy competences; and more trust has a larger positive effect on support for an EHU for those without serious Covid‐19 experience than for those with. These findings suggest that to promote further EU integration, the European Commission may want to develop strategies to bolster trust in the EU.",

          "abstract": "A recent raft of due diligence regulation (DDR) addressing social and environmental conditions in global value chains (GVCs) has spread across the UK and Europe. An emerging literature on DDR highlights the politics of its formation. Yet, we know little about how existing sustainability governance along GVCs interacts with DDR or the wider structural context in which DDR is implemented. Empirically, we examine European DDR relevant to the South African wine sector before analyzing the sustainability requirements set by the state monopoly wine buyer in Sweden to assess the likely future impacts of DDR. We ask: How do existing sustainability governance initiatives shape the intended effects of due diligence in the South African wine value chain? We find that DDR tackles the symptoms as opposed to the root cause of predatory purchasing practices as a key impediment to improving sustainability outcomes. Finally, we suggest how to address these shortcomings.",

          "abstract": "For the law to function effectively in society, it must not only be enforced but also promote compliance, particularly in emotionally charged, polarized, or uncertain situations. This study explores the impact of legal sanction stringency and perceived sanction risk on the perceived legitimacy of and willingness to comply with mandatory vaccination laws in Czechia post‐COVID‐19. Using a 4 × 2 experimental design, we examined the effects of four sanction stringency levels and two levels of perceived sanction risk, alongside variables like trust in institutions, fear of disease, vaccination attitudes, and conspiracy beliefs, on a representative general sample. The findings provided no support for deterrence; neither sanction stringency nor perceived risk affected perceived legitimacy or compliance willingness, except for a small negative effect of the most stringent sanction. Perceived legitimacy, however, had a strong link to compliance willingness, and vaccine attitudes influenced both. Trust in institutions, fear of disease, and conspiracy beliefs were associated with perceived legitimacy but not compliance. These results challenge traditional views on legal creation and enforcement.",

          "abstract": "In established democracies, the threat of regulatory capture—often implicated in major crises—is usually less about financial mechanisms like bribery and more about the subtle social processes of cultural capture. But how exactly is cultural capture defined, theorized, and assessed, and what are its underlying mechanisms, manifestations, and impact? This article presents a systematic review ( n = 39) of cultural capture, identifying 7 descriptions and 10 mechanisms. We consolidate these into five underlying concepts (CHAIN): Closeness; Homogeneity; Avoidance; Identities; and Networks. We introduce a parsimonious definition of cultural capture: social and psychological processes that bias regulators' beliefs and behaviors, aligning them with those of the regulatees and marginalizing alternative viewpoints. A key contribution of this article is developing a set of 33 novel behavioral indicators to examine these five concepts empirically and clarify their relationship to regulatory capture. Finally, the review highlights theoretical and methodological issues to address for the field to advance.",

          "authors": "Erik Neimanns, Björn Bremer",
          "abstract": "Governments in many of the advanced economies expanded childcare, an exemplary social investment policy, in recent years. Yet, considerable regional variation exists in expansion efforts, and often the supply of childcare still does not match demand. We explore the politics of this regional variation by studying Germany, a country that recently introduced a legal entitlement to childcare. Despite this legal entitlement, we argue that local political and economic factors (continue to) matter for childcare expansion and regional variation in coverage. We expect left‐wing local political majorities to be associated with higher expansion and coverage rates. At the same time, tight local fiscal constraints should limit partisan room for maneuver and should slow down expansion. Analyzing local‐level data on childcare coverage rates, socioeconomic context factors, and government partisanship, we find evidence of conditional effects between fiscal and partisan variables. We furthermore examine how local governments reconcile gaps in childcare provision with the legal entitlement and what distributive consequences this has.",
