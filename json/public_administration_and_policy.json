          "authors": "Wenchi Wei",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how local institutions in U.S. municipalities can affect budget allocations for socially disadvantaged groups, specifically focusing on eight key institutions related to electoral rules, power dynamics, and bureaucratic authority. Additionally, we develop a composite index to assess the overall level of (de)politicization within the local institutional framework. Theoretically, local institutions can shape public officials’ political accountability and administrative discretion during policy processes, thereby influencing their decision‐making on budget allocations. Empirical analyses primarily use data from ICMA's multiround national surveys and employ the historical background of municipalities as an instrumental variable (IV) to address potential endogeneity problems associated with local institutions. We find that local institutions that strengthen politicians’ political accountability to citizens lead to greater budget allocations for redistributive social welfare, thereby fostering social equity in public budgeting. Conversely, the institutions that enhance the authority of senior bureaucrats negatively affect budget allocations for redistributive social welfare.",

          "authors": "Sergio Fernandez, Faisal Cheema",
          "abstract": "Appointing bureaucrats based on merit and protecting them from excessive political interference have become bedrocks of modern bureaucracy. Populist leaders throughout the world, however, are looking to undermine merit systems and politicize bureaucracies. This study analyzes the impact of merit‐based appointments and bureaucratic autonomy on service delivery effectiveness, using longitudinal data from a panel of African countries. Throughout Africa, social, economic, and political conditions have made it difficult for meritocratic and autonomous bureaucracies to take root and flourish as they have elsewhere. Despite these challenges, the study's main finding is that the practice of appointing bureaucrats based on merit has a positive effect on the provision of public services like transportation infrastructure, standardized education, drinking water, sanitation, and waste disposal. Political leaders undercutting meritocratic civil services and expanding patronage appointments do so at their own peril due to the adverse consequences of their actions on governmental performance. Little evidence is found of a relationship between bureaucratic autonomy and service delivery effectiveness.",

          "title": "Managing cyberattacks in wartime: The case of Ukraine",
          "authors": "Iryna Fyshchuk, Mette Strange Noesgaard, Jeppe Agger Nielsen",
          "abstract": "Cybersecurity specialists face continual challenges in protecting organizations and societies from ever‐evolving cyberattacks. These challenges intensify dramatically in the context of war, yet our understanding of cyberattacks during wartime is limited. This is in part because it is difficult to gather information about cyberattacks and cybersecurity in highly tense wartime environments. Against this backdrop, we present evidence from a unique case study that examines cyberattacks and cybersecurity issues in the context of the Russian‐Ukraine war. Compared with peacetime, the nature of cyberattacks in wartime both intensifies and expands. During armed conflict, nation‐state funded cyberattacks are typically better financed, more prolonged, and have concrete aims, including to disrupt military operations, sabotage infrastructure, spark civil unrest, and spread disinformation. Countries at war experience extreme pressures due to resource scarcity, poverty, and societal conflicts, all of which make it difficult to effectively manage cyberattack threats and experiences. Based on interviews with public authority representatives in Ukraine, our study found four main challenges to managing cyberattacks during wartime. First, limited financial resources were a major hindrance. Decision‐makers said that they were forced to set tough economic priorities and to oscillate between allocating resources to physical assets (e.g., conventional military operations and rebuilding infrastructure devasted by bombing) and to cybersecurity. In such situations, cybersecurity came in second to more immediate wartime needs; this complicated sufficient investment in IT infrastructure, cyber‐awareness training, and implementing response plans. Second, the country faced serious recruitment difficulties . Attracting IT and cyber personnel has been hard—and sometimes impossible—as the war forced people to leave the country or parts of it, and many IT professionals left the field to become soldiers. Further, salary disparities between the public and private sectors, as well as regional differences, thwarted recruitment efforts in certain areas of the country. Inappropriate human behaviors , such as clicking insecure links, poor password practices, and using risky apps, always pose significant cyberattack risks. War magnifies these challenges due to lack of training, as well as to increased financial incentives for employees to compromise security. Unclear cybersecurity guidelines added an extra layer of complexity in managing cyberattacks. Public authority representatives at the local level said that they lacked the clear, actionable guidelines they needed for cyberattack management in a wartime situation plagued by resource scarcity. These four challenges are not unique to wartime situations; all are recognized in the cybersecurity literature covering routine IT contexts. However, our study illustrates how these four cyberattack challenges are magnified, entail critical dilemmas, and are more difficult to manage during wartime, not least because prioritizing cybersecurity is a challenge in itself. Hence, while Ukraine had upgraded its digital government capacities before the war, and government actors have attempted to continue managing ongoing cyberattack challenges—including adapting legislation and providing cyber‐awareness training for public servants to decrease inappropriate human behaviors—effectively managing cyberattack threats has remained extremely difficult. Our article contributes new insights into the challenges of managing cyberattacks in extreme situations. We showcase the challenges and dilemmas in wartime and offer practice‐based knowledge on cyberattacks and cybersecurity efforts in highly tense environments.",

          "authors": "Emily Frank, Anton Nivorozhkin",
          "abstract": "What factors influence refugees' perceptions of justice in bureaucratic institutions? As global migration movements draw increasing attention, migrants' experiences as constituents in destination countries merit further research. Drawing evidence from the 2018 survey of refugees participating in the German Socio‐Economic Panel, this article examines the role of legal status in shaping perceptions of justice at government offices. Our findings highlight a stark contrast: refugees with unstable legal statuses often perceive bureaucratic proceedings as less just compared to those with firmer legal standings. However, refugees' perceptions of a more positive encounter their encounters with street‐level bureaucrats can act as a buffer against the negative effects of legal status on perceptions of justice at government offices. These insights underscore a pressing policy implication: asylum procedures, currently marked by ambiguity and delays, could benefit significantly from enhanced communication quality on the part of street‐level bureaucrats.",

          "title": "How does government feel? Toward a theory of institutional pathos in public administration",
          "authors": "John Boswell, Jack Corbett, Dennis C. Grube, Mari‐Klara Stein",
          "abstract": "In the study of policy and administration, emotions are largely conceived as an exogenous factor that impacts on institutions and processes. Still ignored are the emotions felt and performed not just individually by civil servants, but collectively within government organizations. This article turns to insights on emotions from organizational studies to offer a conceptual framework through which to understand the lifeworld of government, or “institutional pathos.” It then applies this framework to an extreme case: Whitehall's response to the Brexit vote. Drawing on rich interview material from the Brexit Witness Archive, this article illustrates how the experience of individual and collective emotions deeply colored the work of British Government in delivering Brexit. The article concludes with a research agenda for public administration that foregrounds emotions.",

          "title": "Analysis of Institutional Design of European Union Cyber Incident and Crisis Management as a Complex Public Good",
          "authors": "Mazaher Kianpour, Christopher Frantz",
          "abstract": "Effective cyber incident response and crisis management increasingly relies on the coordination of relevant actors at supranational levels. A polycentric governance structure is one of the institutional arrangements that can promote active participation of involved actors, an aspect decisive for the rapid and effective response to cyber incidents and crises. This research aims to dissect whether, and to what extent, a polycentric structure is manifested within the cyber crisis management framework of the European Union (EU) and assesses the extent to which these policies signal a balance between centralization and decentralization. By employing Institutional Grammar 2.0, we examine the roles and interactions among actors delineated within four key policies to identify the structural characteristics, institutional essentials, and prerequisites indicative of a polycentric governance system. Additionally, we apply network analysis to evaluate dyadic relationships of actors, further assessing the balance between centralization and decentralization in the EU's cyber crisis management framework. Our analysis reveals that the EU has adopted a polycentric governance model for cyber crisis management, characterized by a nuanced distribution of responsibilities and authorities. The findings highlight a tendency toward centralization, especially in the roles of Member States and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), while maintaining a polycentric structure that blends centralization and decentralization. This balance can ensure structural integrity and coherence of the system, while theoretically providing the flexibility and resilience needed to adapt to the dynamic cyber threat landscape. The study contributes methodologically, offering a framework that can be applied to other domains, and provides insights into the effective coordination of cyber incident response and crisis management at supranational levels.",
