          "authors": "Matias Giaccobasso, Brad Nathan, Ricardo Perez-Truglia, Alejandro Zentner",
          "abstract": "Do perceptions about government spending affect willingness to pay taxes? We test this hypothesis with a natural field experiment that focuses on the allocation of property taxes to public schools. Our results show that taxpayers often misperceive the destination of their tax dollars. By introducing shocks to households' perceptions via an information-provision experiment, we find that perceptions of how tax dollars are used significantly affect the probability of filing a tax appeal. Moreover, the effects are consistent with reciprocal motivations: individuals are more willing to pay taxes if they believe that the government services funded by those taxes will provide greater personal benefit.

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between the franchise and policing. We find that, following the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Black arrest rates in counties that both had more newly enfranchised Blacks and were covered by the legislation fell, compared to similar Southern counties that were not covered. We document no corresponding patterns for White arrests. Our results are driven by arrests by sheriffs, who are always elected, and by less serious offenses. These results indicate that voting rights, when combined with electoral accountability, lead to improved treatment of minority groups by police. (JEL D72, J15, K16, K42, N32, N42)",

          "abstract": "We study the impact of entertainment technology on labor supply. Using Social Security work histories and a natural experiment arising from the regulated US rollout of television, we estimate that a station launch reduced the probability of working by around 0.3 percentage points, driven mainly by an increase in older-age-group retirement rates. The results support the hypothesis that television's rise contributed to the midcentury transition of retirement from a necessity to “golden years” of enjoyment. Our findings indicate that entertainment innovations have a less pronounced effect on overall labor supply trends than model calibrations in the previous literature suggest.

Theft-resistant cables reduced losses. This occurred primarily through decreases in unbilled consumption, with the number of formal utility customers and their billed consumption both increasing. Load-shedding outages decreased. In areas with these cables installed, consumers have more appliances and higher electricity-related expenditures. Revenue recovery rose, but consumers' billing-related complaints also increased. (JEL D24, L94, O13, Q41)",

I extend the bunching formula of Saez (2010) to a dynamic setting that accounts for the value of future benefits tied to taxation. This yields new tests of tax-benefit linkage based on bunching heterogeneity. I verify in quasi-experiments that UI extension programs that decrease the value of future preserved benefits lead to more bunching and to lower labor supply. Last, a quantification exercise of the dynamic bunching formula provides extra support for a strong tax-benefit linkage. (JEL H24, H31, H71, J22, J65)",

Although common within-group time effects are shown to be a key driver of labor market inequalities across gender, important additional differences by birth cohort emerge with more recent cohorts of women delaying child rearing and, by implication, the onset of child penalties in wages. These cross-cohort differences help account for the stalling of progress in gender wage gaps over the past quarter century. (JEL D15, J13, J16, J24, J31)",

Using data on predominantly rural Swedish migrants who returned from the United States during the Age of Mass Migration, we estimate returns to temporary migration in terms of wealth, income, demographic, and social outcomes. We find substantial wealth effects but limited evidence of increased labor income or occupational upgrading. Male returnees held nearly double the wealth of stayers, likely due to overseas savings, while female returnees gained wealth mainly through marriage. These findings highlight the need to consider wealth when evaluating the economic returns of temporary migration. (JEL F22, G51, J15, J16, N31, N33)",

The merit-based system generates oversubscribed schools, which favor high-GPA students at the expense of displacing low-GPA ones. We use the potential outcomes framework to analyze the effects of the reform, separating the effects for those gaining access to competitive schools from those losing access and identifying these parameters by using the reform as an instrument within subpopulations defined by admission cutoffs and GPA. The small and negative overall effect of the reform hides large negative effects for the crowded-out students. (JEL H51, I21, I28)",

Multiple tests—surveys, event studies, analyses of wage premia and promotions within the firm, and a field experiment—further highlight how business owners’ political preferences directly influence firms’ employment decisions.

A Bernoulli-randomized trial allows consistent estimation of direct effects and of treatment-heterogeneity measures that enable welfare-improving targeting. Estimating spillovers—and providing confidence intervals for the direct effect—requires estimates of price elasticities, which we provide using an augmented experimental design.

Correlation between skill and locational preferences yields optimal transfers to poor areas, while sorting based on comparative advantage can motivate transfers in either direction.

We examine the impact of migrant exposure to reproductive health policies on origin-country fertility in the Philippines. We exploit temporal variation in destination-country reproductive health policies combined with spatial variation across Philippine provinces in their migration intensity and historical composition of migrant destinations. Migrant exposure to more liberalized reproductive health policies reduces origin-community fertility. This reduction is driven by increased adoption of modern contraceptives. Visible policy changes, such as commercial advertising of contraceptives, lead to this change in behavior. Firmly established family planning values moderate the fertility response.

We develop a model that nests cases between the extremes of no segmentation and perfect segmentation typically considered, estimate an elasticity that pins down the degree of segmentation, and use it to calibrate our model.

Private preschools show higher test score value-added in math and language (∼0.59 − 0.74σ) and outperform government providers in nearly all villages. This productivity difference explains 60% of the socioeconomic test score gap before school entry. These results contrast starkly with primary schooling, where we find no evidence of a private sector premium in math and negative effects in local language. Test score value-added is positively correlated between private and government options in a village, both at the preschool and primary school levels. Quality is also correlated across levels; villages with more productive primary schools also tend to have more productive preschools. Our findings inform debates on achieving universal foundational skills and highlight the need to improve the quality of preschools available to lower-income families.",

The tutoring ban significantly increases expected total fertility by 7–8%, with larger effects in cities under greater policy intensity. Decomposition reveals that the primary driver is perceived reduction in educational competition, followed by improved parental health, parent-child relationships, and reduced time and monetary costs.

Depending on the heterogeneity of such needs, equilibrium may feature either complete financial market segmentation or only partial segmentation. Firms respond to greater hedging needs by issuing more debt and allocating most of the proceeds to shareholders. How much more debt, depends on the availability of competing risk-sharing instruments. When the capital structure is jointly shaped by hedging demand and agency (asset substitution), the greater risk induced by asymmetric information has countervailing effects on debt: Debt is reduced to nudge shareholders into choosing lower risk; however, the greater risk in production affects the state prices and calls for more debt.",

          "abstract": "Violence against civilians has killed nearly one million people worldwide and displaced millions more over the past three decades. This paper examines the economic forces driving civilian persecution in Myanmar. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that violence against civilians increases in rice-suitable townships when rice prices rise, the opposite pattern from that documented in the literature on two-sided conflicts. We argue that large power asymmetries inherent in civilian persecution explain this difference. Higher returns from expropriating rice harvests and rice-growing inputs during these periods drive the pattern we observe in Myanmar, which we corroborate with an original survey of Rohingya refugees forcibly displaced to Bangladesh. Our work demonstrates how to generate systematic and representative evidence on civilian persecution in politically sensitive and data-poor contexts.",

          "abstract": "To understand the household decision-making process regarding food expenditures for children in poor households in Nairobi, we conduct an experiment with 424 married and monogamous couples. In the experiment, the spouses (individually and jointly) allocate money between themselves and nutritious meals for one of their children. We propose a novel and simple test to distinguish between cooperative/collective and non-cooperative decision behaviour. We find strong empirical support for the collective model of household consumption. This collective model indicates that the spouses’ structural bargaining weights derived from observed consumption patterns strongly correlate with more traditional indicators of power. Furthermore, our results suggest that women do not have stronger preferences for children’s meals than men. Finally, we document a significant heterogeneity in both individual preferences and intra-household decision-making processes.",

          "abstract": "This paper unveils a novel externality of product market regulation in the labour market. It shows theoretically and empirically that higher barriers to entry in product markets translate into higher employers’ labour market power, measured by the wage markdown–the ratio between the marginal product of labour and the wage. Using quasi-exogenous variation in investment restrictions across 389 manufacturing product markets in Indonesia, the analysis finds that wage markdowns would have been almost 10% lower without restrictions and workers would have earned a larger fraction of their marginal product. The analysis supports the model’s prediction that lower entry is the main driver of the positive relationship between investment restrictions and wage markdowns, and that restrictions increase markdowns more in commuting zones where employers have already substantial labour market power. The restrictions do not affect employment, consistently with recent models based on search frictions and wage bargaining, but not with classical monopsony models.",

          "abstract": "This study leverages personnel system reforms within economics departments at Chinese universities to assess the impact of the tenure-track system on research productivity. Using individual-level data on faculty members, we show that tenure-track faculty produce 0.135 (or 100%) more publications in high-quality journals annually during their probationary period compared to faculty hired under the traditional personnel system. Our findings suggest that this increase in productivity is driven by the recruitment of high-potential researchers, heightened pressure due to performance-based employment risks, and enhanced incentives, including higher salaries and increased research funding. Moreover, we observe that the varied implementation details influence the actual effects of the reform. Overall, the university tenure-track reform has been a significant contributor to the increased productivity in Chinese economic research.",

          "abstract": "Information plays a critical role in shaping behavior, particularly in conflict environments where access to and interpretation of information can significantly influence decisions. This review synthesizes recent empirical research at the intersection of information, media, and conflict. It is structured around three central themes. First, we examine how traditional and social media affect the dynamics of violence, ethnic tensions, hate crime, protests, and terrorism. We draw on historical and contemporary case studies to discuss how media influences conflict through incentives, persuasion, and coordination. Second, we explore how information and uncertainty shape the indirect socio-economic impacts of violence. They significantly alter the expectations and economic behavior of individuals, firms, and investors, even in regions not directly exposed to violence. Finally, we review recent advancements in conflict prediction using big data and artificial intelligence, with a focus on news-based models that identify early warning signals and latent risks of violence. Within each theme, we also outline key policy implications and identify gaps in the literature. These gaps call for greater synthesis across research areas to better understand and mitigate the impacts of conflict.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies how broadband internet affects bank credit supply to non-financial firms. We rely on loan-level data from the Italian Credit Register and quasi-experimental variation in the diffusion of broadband. Our estimates include firm-time fixed effects to control for the effect of broadband on firm demand. We find that branches in municipalities reached by fast internet increase loan supply and reduce interest rates. Fast internet is used to acquire additional information on borrowers after loan origination, improving monitoring. This, in turn, drives credit expansion through increased branch efficiency, broader geographical reach, and reduced local market concentration.",

We develop measures of local labour market exposure to prospective trade barriers on both goods and services exports if the UK were to leave the EU without a trade deal. We find that regions that were more exposed to potential barriers on professional services exports to the EU experienced a substantial relative decline in online job adverts in the period after the referendum, particularly for higher skilled jobs and professional and managerial occupations. This effect was distinct from the impact of the exchange rate depreciation, uncertainty surrounding future immigration policy and the threat of future barriers on trade in goods.",

          "authors": "Susan Athey, Raj Chetty, Guido W Imbens, Hyunseung Kang",
          "abstract": "A common challenge in estimating the impact of interventions (e.g., job training programs, educational programs) is that many outcomes of interest (e.g., lifetime earnings or other labor market outcomes) are observed with a long delay. In biomedical settings this is often addressed by using short-term outcomes as so-called “surrogates” for the outcome of interest, e.g., tumor size as a surrogate for mortality in cancer studies. We build on this literature by combining multiple, possibly qualitatively distinct, short-term outcomes (e.g., short-run earnings and employment indicators) systematically into a “surrogate index.” Under the Prentice surrogacy assumption, which requires that the primary outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogates, we show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome. We also relate the surrogacy assumption to a set of structural, causal assumptions. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of each of the key assumptions, and we provide simple methods to validate these assumptions using additional observed outcomes. We apply our method to analyze the long-term impacts of a multi-site job training experiment in California. Rather than waiting a full nine years to directly observe the long-term impact, we show that it is possible to use short-term (the first six quarters) outcomes as surrogates. One could have estimated the program’s long-term impacts on mean employment rates using the employment rates observed in the first six quarters, with a 35% reduction in standard errors.",

          "abstract": "How do localized conflicts disrupt supply chains and prompt firms to reorganize them? How do these forces affect firm-level and aggregate economic activity? Using firm-to-firm Ukrainian railway-shipment data before and during the 2014 Russia–Ukraine conflict, we document that firms with prior supplier and buyer exposure to the conflict areas substantially decreased their output. Simultaneously, firms reorganized their production linkages away from partners directly or indirectly exposed to the conflict shock. We build a general-equilibrium production-network model with endogeneous link formation, and we show that our model’s sufficient statistics accurately explains the observed relative decline in firm output once we account for network reorganization. Calibrating our model to the Ukrainian economy, we find that the localized conflict decreased aggregate output in nonconflict areas by 5.5%. This effect increases to 8.4% if we abstract from endogeneous link formation, suggesting that production-network reorganization partially mitigates the detrimental, far-reaching aggregate economic costs of conflicts.",

We consider patients with four chronic, deadly, but manageable illnesses, where the relationship with the provider may have the most direct impact on health. We find striking evidence that provider racial diversity leads to reduced disparities in maintenance of preventive care and mortality.",

Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the benchmark information reduces salary dispersion by 25\\\\%. Thus, salary dispersion must stem partly from aggregate uncertainty about the salaries offered by other firms. Our model formalizes how salary dispersion can arise even in competitive labor markets for identical workers when such uncertainty exists, and we discuss implications for an ongoing policy debate.",

I offer a new explanation: when house prices grow faster in large cities, middle-income households increasingly cannot afford to own a house there. They move to smaller cities and the middle of the income distribution in large cities hollows out, making them more polarized and unequal. I document that (1) cities with higher price growth experienced larger polarization and increase in inequality since 1980 and (2) middle-income households migrate more often to cheaper locations for housing-related reasons than low- or high-income households. Using a spatial equilibrium model with tenure choice and skill heterogeneity, I find that excess growth of prices relative to incomes and rents in large cities accounts for nearly all of the gap in polarization and almost one-half of the gap in inequality growth between large and small cities from 1980 to 2019.",

          "abstract": "As a complement to the federal earned income tax credit (EITC), some states offer their own EITC, typically calculated as a percentage of the federal EITC. In this paper, we analyse the effect of state EITC on education using policy discontinuities at US state borders. Our estimates reveal that an increase in the state EITC leads to a statistically significant increase in the high school dropout rate. We then use a life-cycle matching model with directed search and endogenous educational choices, search intensities, hirings, hours worked, and separations to investigate the effects of EITC on the labour market in the long run and along the transitional dynamics. We show that a tax credit targeted at low-wage (and low-skilled) workers reduces the relative return to schooling, thereby generating a powerful disincentive to pursue long-term studies. In the long run, this results in an increase in the proportion of low-skilled workers in the economy, which may have important implications for employment, productivity, and income inequality. Finally, we use the model to determine the optimal design of the EITC.",

We show that sanctions limiting a country's exports or freezing its assets depreciate the exchange rate, while sanctions limiting imports appreciate it, even when both types of policies have exactly the same effect on real allocations, including household welfare and government fiscal revenues. Beyond the direct effect from sanctions, increased precautionary savings in foreign currency also depreciate the exchange rate when they are not offset by the sale of official reserves or financial repression of foreign-currency savings. We show that the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 are quantitatively consistent with the combined effects of these forces calibrated to the observed sanctions and government policies. We evaluate the associated welfare, fiscal and inflationary consequences for both Russia and the coalition of Western countries.",

Using novel administrative data, we characterize the evolution of Indonesia’s Islamic education system and religious school choice after the introduction of mass public primary schooling in the 1970s. Funded through informal taxation, Islamic schools competed with the state by entering in the same markets. While primary enrollment shifted towards state schools, religious education increased overall as Islamic schools absorbed growing demand for secondary education. In the short run, electoral support for the secular regime weakened in markets with greater public school construction. Over the long run, Islamic schools established at this juncture are more differentiated in terms of religious curriculum, and cohorts exposed to mass public schooling as children are more invested in religion than in the national identity. Our findings offer a new perspective on the political economy of education reforms and the emergence of parallel systems of public goods provision.",
