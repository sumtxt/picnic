          "authors": "Barış Sevük",
          "abstract": "Fumagalli and Motta (The Economic Journal, 2008) argue that competition among downstream buyers limits the ability of a dominant upstream firm to deter entry by a more efficient competitor. This comment demonstrates that the impact of downstream competition is, in fact, more complex. In particular, competition can motivate buyers to favor the incumbent due to a ‘raising rivals’ costs’ effect.",

          "abstract": "We study the effects of ethnic religious organizations on immigrant assimilation, assembling novel data on Italian Catholic churches across US counties between 1890 and 1920. Exploiting variation in the timing of church entry, we find that Italian churches reduced social and economic assimilation along dimensions that require more inter-group interactions, but had null or positive effects on outcomes for which cross-group coordination is less important. We provide evidence that coordination within the Italian community and natives‚ backlash are plausible pathways for our results. We also document that churches increased literacy and English speaking ability of immigrant children.",

          "abstract": "Exploiting rich administrative data from Norway, we estimate nonparametric bounds around the average causal effect of parental welfare participation on children’s welfare participation for children that grew up in welfare-dependent families. We find upper bounds well below the intergenerational association and substantially below existing LATE estimates in the literature. Our results show that a substantial portion of the observed intergenerational correlation in welfare dependency is due to selection, and that there is important heterogeneity in the intergenerational effects both between participants (and their children) within a welfare program, as well as across different welfare programs.",

          "abstract": "The introduction of oral contraception (’the pill’) was a watershed in fertility control. Yet, the pill’s impact on childbearing has been hard to establish due to limited data. I exploit rich data on pill sales across markets and time to characterize how Swedish teens’ access to pharmacies shaped pill sales and fertility after the pill’s introduction. Pill sales are highly sensitive to pharmacy access, and teen fertility responds strongly to pill sales. The unique data establish an important link in the causal chain from pill access to women’s fertility. Estimated fertility responses to the pill could explain the halving of teen births after the pill’s introduction, a finding which is robust to accounting for trends in female education, abortion provision, and other factors.",

          "abstract": "A large literature shows that people’s valuation of delayed financial rewards violates exponential discounting, exhibiting a hyperbolic pattern: high short-run impatience that strongly decreases in the length of the delay. We test the hypothesis that the hyperbolic pattern in measured discount rates reflects mistakes driven by the complexity of evaluating delayed payoffs. We document that hyperbolicity (i) is strongly associated with choice inconsistency and cognitive uncertainty, (ii) increases in overt complexity manipulations and (iii) arises nearly identically in computationally similar tasks that involve no actual payoff delays. Our results suggest that even if people had exponential discount functions, complexity-driven mistakes would cause them to make hyperbolic choices. We examine which experimental techniques to estimate present bias are (not) confounded by information-processing constraints.",

          "abstract": "Using the National Compensation Survey from 2009 to 2022 and difference-in-differences methods, we find that state-level sick pay mandates are effective in broadening access for U.S. workers. Increases in coverage reach 30ppt from a 63% baseline five years post-mandate. Mandates have more bite in jobs with low pre-mandate coverage. Further, mandates reduce inequality in access to paid sick leave substantially, both across and within firms. Covid-19 reinforced existing positive trends in coverage and take-up. Sick leave use increases linearly, whereas costs plateau after five years. Finally, we find crowding-in of non-mandated benefits which we label “job upscaling” by firms to differentiate jobs and attract labor.",

          "abstract": "A vast scholarship questions whether voters are sufficiently informed to act in their best interest at the polling booth, which may also have implications for the quality of political representation. In this study, we examine cognitive and non-cognitive ability tests conducted on (male) military conscripts by the Finnish Defense Forces, and compare local and national election candidates nominated by political parties and representatives elected by voters with each other and the general population. We show that non-elected candidates fare better in the tests than the population, on average, and elected politicians demonstrate even higher levels of ability. Local politicians’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills are on par with individuals who work in high-skill occupations or have at least an undergraduate degree and national politicians are even better. Our findings suggest that, despite the complex decision-making environment inherent in voter-oriented systems, a political class that is more competent, motivated, and honest than the general population emerges. We further discuss the scope for positive political selection of women, show that there is no evident trade-off between politician quality and descriptive representation, and present evidence on the mechanisms for and the policy effects of positive selection.",

          "authors": "Marco Bassetto, David S Miller",
          "abstract": "This paper posits an information channel as an explanation for sudden inflations. Households saving via nominal government bonds face a choice whether to acquire costly information about future government surpluses. They trade off the cost of acquiring information about the surpluses that back bond repayment against the benefit of a more informed saving decision. Through the information channel, small changes in the economic environment can trigger large responses in consumers’ behavior and prices. This setting explains why there can be long stretches of time during which government surpluses have large movements with little inflation response; yet, at some point, something snaps, and a sudden inflation takes off that is strongly responsive to incoming fiscal news.",

          "authors": "Jacob D Orchard, Valerie A Ramey, Johannes F Wieland",
          "abstract": "We present evidence that the high estimated MPCs from the leading household studies result in implausible macroeconomic counterfactuals. Using the 2008 tax rebate as a case study, we calibrate a standard macro model with the estimated micro MPCs to construct counterfactual macroeconomic consumption paths in the absence of a rebate. The counterfactual paths imply that consumption expenditures would have plummeted in spring and summer 2008 and then mostly recovered in September 2008. We use narratives and forecasts to argue that these paths are implausible. We then show that standard two-way fixed effect estimates of the micro MPCs are upward biased. When we correct for the biases, we estimate smaller micro MPCs using the CEX data than the previous literature. We also show that realistic modifications of the model result in general equilibrium forces that dampen rather than amplify micro MPCs. The combination of smaller micro MPCs and dampening general equilibrium forces implies general equilibrium consumption multipliers that are below 0.2.",
