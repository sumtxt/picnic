          "abstract": "We study a large-scale family planning intervention in which more than 260,000 Peruvian women were sterilized. Many of these medical procedures are alleged to have been performed without patient consent. The subsequent disclosure of alleged illegal sterilizations caused reductions in the usage of contraceptive methods and prenatal and birth delivery services and, more generally, the demand for medical services in affected areas. As a result, child health worsened. The results persist for at least 17 years after the information disclosure and are driven by disappointed supporters of the implementing government. Learning about the government’s malpractices undermined trust in institutions. (JEL I12, I18, I38, J13, J16, J18, O15)",

This is evident for mean and median incomes and access to high earning percentiles. Results do not appear driven by differences in student composition, including parental income. Using a unique dataset of recruiting strategies for prestigious firms, I highlight one channel through which university selectivity may have a causal impact: high-wage firms concentrated their recruiting at elite universities during the recession. The results are informative for policies increasing lower-income students’ representation at selective universities. (JEL D31, E32, I23, I28, J31)",

We study the effect of financial incentives on the adoption of electronic payment technology and on tax compliance by firms. Exploiting administrative data and policy variation from Uruguay, we show that (i) consumer VAT rebates for credit and debit transactions trigger an immediate 50 percent increase in the number of card transactions, (ii) firms’ use of card machines increases only on the intensive margin, and (iii) tax compliance is unaffected. Endogenous card machine adoption and a low share of card sales in total reported sales can rationalize the findings. (JEL E42, H25, H26, O16)",

This paper estimates experimental effects of a holistic, individualized wraparound service intervention for low-income individuals. The intervention includes a detailed assessment, an individualized service plan, intensive case management administered by a two-person team with small caseloads, and strategic financial assistance. The program improved employment and housing outcomes two years postenrollment. Given the customized nature of the services, overall program effects mask heterogeneity. Exploratory analysis suggests that the program helped employ participants who lacked employment but had stable housing and that those without stable housing were helped in securing it.

We exploit differential timing across countries and vaccines to estimate the effects of this public health initiative. We find that Gavi’s support for a vaccine increased coverage rates by 2–5 percentage points across all vaccines and by 10–20 percentage points for newer vaccines. We also find that Gavi’s support reduced child mortality from related causes by 1 child per 1,000 live births.

This paper analyzes a large, federally mandated provider payment increase for primary care services provided to low-income elderly and disabled individuals. Using comprehensive administrative data, we leverage variation across beneficiaries and providers in the policy-induced payment increase in difference-in-differences and triple differences research designs. We find the payment increase led to a 6 percent increase in the targeted services for eligible beneficiaries, implying a payment elasticity of 1.2, and decreased the fraction of low-income beneficiaries with no primary care visit in a year by 9 percent.

We test this claim by randomizing the pre- or postpayment of sales bonuses at 294 car dealerships. Although somewhat statistically imprecise, our analysis provides strong indications that the random assignment of loss framing had quantitatively important negative effects. We document that the negative effects of loss framing can arise due to an increase in incentives for “gaming” behaviors. Based on these claims, we reassess the common wisdom regarding the desirability of loss framing. (JEL C93, D91, J24, J33, L62, L81)",

We estimate a model of gasoline drivers’ refueling preferences and simulate how these potential future EV drivers value refueling time under counterfactual charging networks. Drivers value refueling time at $19.73/hour. EV adopters with home charging receive $675 per vehicle in benefits from avoiding travel to gas stations, whereas refueling travel and waiting time costs $7,763 for drivers using public charging. Increasing network charging speed yields three times greater time savings than a proportional increase in station density. (JEL D12, H54, Q42, Q58, R41)",

We show that a 1 percentage point decrease in subsidy rate leads to a 1 percent decrease in manufacturing employment. We document important local spillovers for the untreated construction and retail sectors, counties connected via trade, and local tax rates. There is no evidence for regional reallocation, within-firm spillover, or changes in commuting and residential decisions. The cost per job amounts to about $19,000. We show local subsidies are substantially more effective in curbing regional inequality than place-blind policies. (JEL G31, H71, L60, L74, L81, R23, R51)",

Relying on detailed panel data of R&amp;D-active firms in Germany over two decades, we exploit identifying variation induced by more than 10,000 municipal changes in the local business tax rate and federal tax reforms with locally varying effects. Using event-study techniques, we find a sizable, negative effect of profit taxes on establishments’ total R&amp;D spending and patents filed. Zooming into the innovation production process, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in the impact of profit taxation for various R&amp;D input factors, among firm characteristics, and for different types of research projects.

We are the first to measure the consequences of US maritime emissions standards on air quality, human health, racial exposure disparities, and behavior. The introduction of US maritime emissions control areas significantly decreased fine particulate matter, low birth weight, and infant mortality. Yet, only about half of the forecasted fine particulate matter abatement was achieved by the policy. We show evidence consistent with behavioral responses among ship operators, other polluters, and individuals that muted the policy’s impact, but were not incorporated in ex ante models.

We calibrate a municipality-level structural model with quasi-experimental estimates of taxpayer mobilty by family type. Households with children are found to be less mobile than households without children and to have stronger preferences for locally provided public goods. Combined with capitalization of taxes into housing prices and nonhomothetic housing demand, this implies that the incidence of local income taxes mainly falls on high-income childless households. Increases in local income taxes, even if flat rate, turn out to be more progressive than property taxes. (JEL H22, H71, R21, R31)",

A regression-discontinuity design exploits the sharp increase in the weeks of paid leave available under the law. We find no evidence that CPFL increased employment, boosted earnings, or encouraged childbearing, suggesting that CPFL had little effect on the gender pay gap or child penalty. For first-time mothers, we find that CPFL reduced employment and earnings a decade after they gave birth. (JEL H24, J13, J16, J31, J32, K31)",

Using high-resolution data, we find that the 2005 regulation reduced PM 2.5 levels by 0.4 μg/m 3 over five years, with larger effects in more polluted areas. Standard difference-in-differences overstates these effects by a factor of three because time trends differ by baseline pollution, a bias we overcome with three alternative approaches. We show that the regulation contributed to narrowing Urban-Rural and Black-White PM 2.5 exposure disparities, but less than difference-in-differences suggest. Pollution damages capitalized into house prices, however, appear larger than previously thought when leveraging regulatory variation. (JEL D63, K32, Q52, Q53, Q58, R31)",

While tax protests can provide a unique opportunity to study the (un)willingness to pay taxes, they have received little attention from researchers. Using a field experiment and a quasi-experiment, we study what motivates households to protest their property taxes. We find that both expected savings and filing frictions play significant roles. We estimate the magnitude of filing frictions using a money metric.

This paper examines the role of family background in shaping the choice to enter civil service and investigates the impact of the 2012 anti-corruption campaign on this process. We find that college graduates with cadre parents are more likely to work as a civil servant. However, using a difference-in-differences approach, we show an 18% decline in this occupational persistence post-campaign. Evidence suggests that reduced use of parental social networks may drive this change. Furthermore, the campaign appears to have improved civil servants’ quality.",

          "abstract": "This paper offers a new approach to measuring the size of the informal economy based on VAT data for the European Union. Although data intensive, our EVADE measure is simpler and more transparent than existing measures. EVADE also shows more variation across countries of Europe than earlier measures, including higher informality in Greece, Italy and Spain, for example. Moreover, we find considerably higher variation within countries across time; in a cross-country time series regression, controlling for tax rates, we confirm that the informal economy grows significantly in recessions and decreases in booms, which we term the “Hugo effect”.",

          "abstract": "Despite the implementation of negative nominal interest rates by several advanced economies in the last decade, there is still much we do not know about the effectiveness of this instrument. In this paper, we analyze the pass-through of the ECB’s changes in the deposit facility rate to mortgage rates in Finland between 2005 and 2020. We use monthly data and three different empirical methodologies: event studies, high-frequency identification, and exposure-measure regressions. We provide robust evidence that there continues to be pass-through of a cut in the policy rate to mortgage rates even when the policy rate is in negative territory, but that this pass-through is smaller than when the policy rate is in positive territory.",

          "title": "Wage Hysteresis and Entitlement Effects: The Persistent Impacts of a Temporary Overtime Policy",
          "authors": "Simon Quach",
          "abstract": "This paper studies the unexpected retraction of a U.S. federal policy in 2016 that would have more than doubled the “overtime exemption threshold” from ${\\$}$455 to ${\\$}$913 per week and thereby grant overtime protection to an additional 20 percent of salaried workers. Although the policy was blocked by a federal court injunction a week before it was supposed to take effect, I show that it nevertheless had a persistent positive impact on workers’ earnings. Leveraging a bunching design with administrative payroll data from ADP, I find that employers raised workers’ salaries to the ${\\$}$913 threshold even after the policy was repealed. Over the following 18 months, difference-in-difference estimates reveal that employers did not slow the wage growth of workers affected by the policy relative to those already earning above ${\\$}$913 per week, nor did they hire new employees at a lower pay rate. Real wages remained persistently elevated relative to what they would have been absent the policy and separation rates decreased among workers bunched at the ${\\$}$913 threshold. Comparing highly exposed firms to unaffected firms, I find an increase in employers’ wage bill but no change in aggregate employment. Taken together, the results indicate that temporary policies impacting wage levels can have permanent impacts on the labor market. Survey responses collected by the Department of Labor suggest that morale concerns play a key role in driving the wage hysteresis.",

          "authors": "Ryan Hill, Carolyn Stein",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates how competition to publish first and thereby establish priority impacts the quality of scientific research. We begin by developing a model where scientists decide whether and how long to work on a given project. When deciding how long they should let their projects mature, scientists trade off the marginal benefit of higher quality research against the marginal risk of being preempted. Projects with the highest scientific potential are the most competitive because they induce the most entry. Therefore, the model predicts these projects are also the most rushed and lowest quality. We test the predictions of this model in the field of structural biology using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for structures of large macromolecules. An important feature of the PDB is that it assigns objective measures of scientific quality to each structure. As suggested by the model, we find that structures with higher ex-ante potential generate more competition, are completed faster, and are lower quality. Consistent with the model, and with a causal interpretation of our empirical results, these relationships are mitigated when we focus on structures deposited by scientists who — by nature of their employment position — are less focused on publication and priority. We estimate that the costs associated with improving these low-quality structures are between 1.5 and 8.8 billion dollars since the PDB’s founding in 1971.",

          "abstract": "We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI–based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer-support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. The effects vary significantly across different agents. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output, while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for moderately rare problems, where human agents have less baseline experience but the system still has adequate training data. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along several dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.",

          "title": "Can Pollution Markets Work in Developing Countries? Experimental Evidence from India",
          "authors": "Michael Greenstone, Rohini Pande, Nicholas Ryan, Anant Sudarshan",
          "abstract": "Market-based environmental regulations are seldom used in low-income countries, where pollution is highest but state capacity is often low. We collaborated with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to design and experimentally evaluate the world’s first particulate matter emissions market, which covered industrial plants in a large Indian city. There are three main findings. First, the market functioned well. Treatment plants, randomly assigned to the emissions market, traded permits to become significant net sellers or buyers. After trading, treatment plants held enough permits to cover their emissions 99% of the time, compared to just 66% compliance with standards under the command-and-control status quo. Second, treatment plants reduced pollution emissions, relative to control plants, by 20% to 30%. Third, the market reduced abatement costs by an estimated 11%, holding constant emissions. This cost-savings estimate is based on plant-specific marginal cost curves that we estimate from the universe of bids to buy and sell permits in the market. The combination of pollution reductions and low costs imply that the emissions market has mortality benefits that exceed its costs by at least twenty-five times.",
