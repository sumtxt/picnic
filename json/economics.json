          "authors": "Nicolas Lagios, Pierre-Guillaume Méon, Ilan Tojerow",
          "abstract": "We study the electoral impact of protesting against the far right by investigating the demonstrations held during the 2002 French presidential elections against far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen. Instrumenting rally attendance with rainfall while factoring in that some municipalities never host protests, we find that larger protests reduced the number of votes for Le Pen and abstention, while increasing the number of votes for the incumbent president, Jacques Chirac. We find that the effect spread out beyond the municipalities that hosted protests and worked through media exposure. Using survey data, we show that protests reduced support for the policies advocated by Le Pen. Moreover, the positive effect on voting for Chirac resulted from right-wing voters switching from Le Pen to Chirac and left-wing voters not casting a blank ballot, implying that some voters voted expressively. Finally, we show that protests reduced the social desirability of voting for Le Pen.",

          "authors": "Eliza Forsythe, Russell Weinstein",
          "abstract": "We investigate employer recruiting behaviour, using detailed firm-level data from a national survey of employers hiring recent college graduates. We find this behaviour is responsive to the business cycle, beliefs about labour market tightness, and the intended number of hires. Specifically, employers adjust planned recruiting effort and compensation. We then show that when firms expend greater recruiting effort they ultimately hire more individuals per vacancy. These results suggest that when firms want to increase hires they adjust both the quantity of vacancies and the recruiting intensity per vacancy. If this is true more broadly in the labour market, it may help explain the breakdown in the standard matching function during the Great Recession.",

          "title": "Does Inequality Affect the Needs of the Poor?",
          "authors": "Clément S Bellet, Eve Colson-Sihra",
          "abstract": "We investigate how inequality affects what is considered most necessary to purchase. Combining detailed consumption surveys in India with an instrumental variable approach, we first provide evidence that inequality is associated with a decrease in calorie consumption for poor households. This effect is driven by upward comparisons and associated with poor households spending more on luxuries, consistent with relative deprivation theory. We then estimate a structural demand system to isolate the impact of inequality on needs from supply-side effects. We find that inequality increases the need of the poor for “little luxuries” (e.g., dairy products, energy use) at the expense of necessities (e.g., cereals). This shift in the hierarchy of needs accounts for more than two third of the decline in the calorie consumption of the poor over the period.",

          "authors": "Adam M Rosen, Takuya Ura",
          "abstract": "We provide a finite sample inference method for the structural parameters of the semiparametric binary response model under a conditional median restriction originally studied by Manski (1975, 1985). This is achieved by exploiting distributional properties of observable outcomes conditional on the observed sequence of exogenous variables. Moment inequalities conditional on the size n sequence of exogenous covariates are constructed, and the proposed test statistic is a monotone function of violations of the corresponding sample moment inequalities. The critical value used for inference is provided by the appropriate quantile of a known function of n independent Bernoulli random variables, and does not require the use of a cube root asymptotic approximation employing a point estimator of the target parameter. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable finite sample performance of the test in comparison to several existing approaches. Empirical use is illustrated with an application to the classical setting of transportation choice.",

          "abstract": "I introduce a generic method for inference about a scalar parameter in research designs with a finite number of heterogeneous clusters where only a single cluster received treatment. This situation is commonplace in difference-in-differences estimation but the test developed here applies more broadly. I show that the test controls size and has power under asymptotics where the number of observations within each cluster is large but the number of clusters is fixed. The test combines weighted, approximately Gaussian parameter estimates with a rearrangement procedure to obtain its critical values. The weights needed for most empirically relevant situations are tabulated in the paper. Calculation of the critical values is computationally simple and does not require simulation or resampling. The rearrangement test is highly robust to situations where some clusters are much more variable than others. Examples and an empirical application are provided.",
