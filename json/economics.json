          "title": "Is Secessionism Mostly About Income or Identity? A Global Analysis of 3,153 Subnational Regions",
          "authors": "Klaus Desmet, Ignacio Ortuño Ortín, Ömer Özak",
          "abstract": "This paper analyses whether the propensity to secede by subnational regions responds mostly to differences in income per capita or to distinct ethnolinguistic identities. We explore this question in a quantitative political economy model where people’s willingness to finance a public good depends on their income and identity. Using high-resolution economic and linguistic data for the entire globe, we predict the propensity to secede of 3,153 subnational regions in 177 countries. We validate the model-based predictions with data on secessionist movements, state fragility, regional autonomy, and conflict, as well as with an application to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Counterfactual analysis shows that removing ethnolinguistic identity differences reduces the average support for secession from 10.1% to 0.2% of the population, while removing income differences has no major quantitative impact. Although both forces affect secessionism, identity trumps income in determining a region’s propensity to secede.",

          "abstract": "We evaluate the aggregate and distributional effects of climate change mitigation policies using a multi-sector equilibrium model with intersectoral input-output linkages and worker heterogeneity, calibrated to various countries. Carbon taxes induce changes in relative prices and input reallocation, notably in labor. In the United States, achieving its Paris Agreement commitment results in, at most, a 0.8% reduction in output, unevenly affecting different sectors and individuals. Some workers in dirty energy sectors, forming less than 2% of the labor force, endure welfare losses six times larger than others. China, reliant on high-carbon energy, experiences larger economic effects from an identical emission reduction.",

          "title": "Transport and urban growth in the First Industrial Revolution",
          "authors": "Eduard J Alvarez-Palau, Dan Bogart, Max Satchell, Leigh Shaw-Taylor",
          "abstract": "The Industrial Revolution led to dramatic economic changes which persist to the present. This paper focuses on urban areas in England and Wales, the birthplace of the First Industrial Revolution, and the role of early transport improvements, like improving rivers and roads, building canals, and reducing sailing costs. We estimate how much inter-urban freight transport costs declined from all such innovations between 1680 and 1830 using a new multi-modal transport model. We find that relative to producer prices, transport costs declined by nearly 75%. We then estimate how lower trade costs led to significantly higher urban population through increased market access. Our empirical strategy addresses confounding factors and potential endogeneity. A counterfactual suggests that without any change in the ratio of transport costs to producer prices between 1680 and 1830, the population in 1841 would have been more coastal and inland towns would have been 20 to 25% smaller. In extensions, we show that levels of market access in 1830 had persistent, positive effects on urban population up to 1911. It also led to significantly higher property income, more migration, and fewer unskilled occupations by the mid-nineteenth century. Broadly, early transport improvements significantly shaped the spatial structure of urban economies during the First Industrial Revolution and beyond.",

We test this hypothesis using adjustments to the gold standard during the Great Depression.

We calibrate a general equilibrium model to obtain aggregate effects from cross-sectional estimates. We show that the trade channel deepened the Great Depression and was a key driver of the economic recovery in 1933.",

          "abstract": "We introduce group cohesion to study the economic relevance of social relationships in team production. We operationalize measurement of group cohesion, adapting the “oneness scale” from psychology. A series of experiments, including a preregistered replication, reveals strong, positive associations between group cohesion and performance assessed in weak-link coordination games, with high-cohesion groups being likely to achieve superior equilibria. In exploratory analysis, we identify beliefs rather than social preferences as the primary mechanism through which factors proxied by group cohesion influence group performance. Our evidence provides proof of concept for group cohesion as a useful tool for economic research and practice.",

          "abstract": "This article quantifies the impact of the battery electric vehicle subsidy program in China. We build a structural model of dynamic demand and Bertrand Nash supply to study price elasticity and changes in production costs. The model highlights four channels through which the subsidy program impacts the market: temporal elasticity, in response to a current price change; intertemporal elasticity, in response to a future price change; and multiplication effects through peer and learning by doing. Combining these estimates, we simulate outcomes under four subsidy schemes and find a phase-out policy could be the most cost-effective while achieving higher sales promotion compared with alternative policies that provide larger subsidies over more prolonged periods.",

A large resume audit study suggests a small premium for new college names in most jobs, and a significant penalty in lower-status jobs.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find substantial fade-out of the test score gains after one year but some persistence thereafter. Unlike other interventions that produce similar initial increases in performance, we do not observe benefits to long-term outcomes.

Far-apart location pairs were more affected, and the local average causal response is approximately 34.92% to 82.29%. The effect is mainly driven by increased matches among highly productive innovators. The entry of new innovators, relocation of existing innovators, and collaborations among low-productive innovators also contribute to the increase in collaborative matches, especially in the long run.",

However, misclassified imagery can lead to misleading conclusions about transition processes. We propose a correction for transition rate estimates based on the econometric measurement error literature to extract the signal (truth) from its noisy measurement (satellite-based classifications). No ground-truth data are required in the implementation. Our proposed correction produces consistent estimates of transition rates, confirmed by longitudinal validation data, while transition rates without correction are severely biased. Using our approach, we show how eliminating deforestation in Brazil’s Atlantic forest region through 2040 could save $100 billion in CO2 emissions.",

We test whether this gap is due to asymmetric information using newly collected data on occupational licensing laws that ban workers with criminal records. We find evidence supporting this hypothesis. The licensing premiums for Black men are largest in licensed occupations that restrict felons, particularly in states with banthe-box laws and at small businesses. In these contexts where a worker’s criminal history is difficult to infer, we find that occupational licensing reduces asymmetric information and reduces the racial wage gap.",

First, I find couples co-hold 42% more as units than as individuals relative to income. Moreover, in a natural experiment, couples do not cooperate to reduce high-cost debt, suggesting that intra-household frictions contribute to co-holding. Second, I find individuals who regularly make credit card debt payments equal to or near the minimum account for 59% of individual co-holding. The evidence suggests anchoring to the minimum payment contributes to co-holding via these low payments.",

It delivers optimality with approximately equal within-group weights when latent block equicorrelation patterns dominate the high-dimensional sample variance-covariance matrix of the individual forecast errors or the assets. Its wide applicability is highlighted in three real data examples in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and finance.",

Exploring monthly data on judicial output and cross-court movement, we estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in the number of cases disposed. With novel data on admission examinations, we show that judges with higher grades perform better than lower-ranked peers.

          "authors": "Stanton Hudja, Brian Roberson, Yaroslav Rosokha",
          "abstract": "We investigate the role of performance feedback, in the form of a public leaderboard, in a sequential-sampling contest with costly observations. We show theoretically that for contests with a fixed ending date (i.e., finite horizon), providing public performance feedback may result in fewer expected observations and a lower expected value of the winning observation. We conduct a controlled laboratory experiment to test the theoretical predictions and find that the experimental results largely support the theory. In addition, we investigate how individual characteristics affect competitive sequential-sampling activity.",

          "authors": "Gerard Domènech-Arumí, Silvia Vannutelli",
          "abstract": "We exploit an unanticipated labor market reform to estimate the effects of procyclical changes in long-term unemployment assistance (UA). In July 2012, Spain raised the minimum age to receive unlimited-duration UA from 52 to 55. Using a difference-in-differences design, we document that shorter benefits caused (1) shorter unemployment duration, especially among younger workers; (2) higher labor force exit and other programs’ take-up, especially among older workers; and (c) lower wages upon reemployment. The reform induced moderate government savings. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interplay with labor market conditions when designing long-term benefit schedules that affect workers close to retirement.",

          "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that a large economic shock such as an oil boom increases intergenerational earnings mobility among directly affected men, mostly through increased bottom-up mobility, but not for women. Preexisting local differences in mobility or shifts in the earnings distributions do not drive these findings. Instead, changes in relative earnings paid to workers with different skills offer the best explanation. Moreover, we document that intergenerational mobility is significantly higher for the indirectly affected third generation and that the oil boom broke the earnings link between first- and third-generation men.",

          "abstract": "I propose a new method of identifying firms’ subjective beliefs in dynamic models. In settings where actions are continuous and substitutable in contributing to an endogenous state, I show how beliefs about exogenous state transitions can be separately identified from static payoffs. Applying this method to identifying beliefs about future SO2 allowance prices in the U.S. Acid Rain Program, I find that electric utilities underestimate the movements in the allowance price, leading to compliance strategies that respond too slowly to changing market conditions. Biased beliefs increase an average utility’s compliance cost by equivalently 11.2% of its profits.",

Leveraging quasi-random assignment of veterans to PCPs, we measure effectiveness using ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits for mental health or circulatory conditions. PCPs’ variation along these dimensions predicts future outcomes. For example, a 1 standard deviation improvement in mental health effectiveness reduces patient risk of death by 3.8% and lowers costs by 4.4% over the next three years. More effective PCPs do more with less: their patients have fewer primary care visits, specialist referrals, lab panels, or imaging tests.",

We conduct an event study on the decision to export to Angola using data on Portuguese firms and workers. We evaluate the impact of the presence of managers with experience in exporting to the Angolan market on a firm’s entry success in the aftermath of an exogenous shock: the sudden end of the Angolan civil war. We show that the presence of managers doubles the probability of a firm entering the market. We do not find any significant impact on the intensive margin of exports.",

Utilizing a unique dataset of all flights departing from Beijing to 113 domestic destinations in China since January 2009, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the effects of HSR entry on on-time performance and to identify the channels. We document two main findings. First, the entry of HSR leads to significant reductions in the mean and variance of travel delays on the affected airline routes. Second, the reductions in departure delays and taxi-in time at the destination airports are identified as the main channels.",

          "abstract": "From a new data set, we infer time series of term structures of yields on U.S. federal bonds during the gold standard era from 1791–1933 and use our estimates to reassess historical narratives about how the United States expanded its fiscal capacity. We show that U.S. debt carried a default risk premium until the end of the nineteenth century, when it started being priced as an alternative safe asset to U.K. debt. During the Civil War, investors expected the United States to return to a gold standard so the federal government was able to borrow without facing denomination risk. After the introduction of the National Banking System, the slope of the yield curve switched from down to up and the premium on U.S. debt with maturity less than one year disappeared.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a novel strategy to study the intergenerational transmission of human capital skills, net of genetic skill transfers. For this purpose, we use unique Danish data on children conceived through sperm and egg donation in in vitro fertilization treatments to estimate the relationship between child test scores and parental years of schooling. Because the assignment of donors is not selective, these parental schooling estimates allow for a causal nurture interpretation. Once we take account of genes, we find that only the education of mothers matters: the association between father’s education and child test scores (in reading and math) is insignificant and practically zero, whereas the association between mother’s education and child test scores (in reading, not in math) is significant and large, and as large as the association we estimate for mothers of non-donor children.",
