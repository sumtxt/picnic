          "title": "A caution on sibling comparisons in studying effects of the rearing environment",
          "authors": "Per Engzell, Martin Hällsten",
          "abstract": "Recent studies use sibling fixed effects to estimate the influence of the family environment on children, a practice we call the ‘discordant family design’. These studies suffer from a disconnect between the use of within-family variation, on the one hand, and relevant theories which mostly refer to variation between families on the other. In addition, reverse causality, within-family confounding, selection into identification, and measurement error complicate their interpretation further. We discuss three applied examples—the effects of parenting, family income, and neighbourhood context—and provide some general guidance. To avoid misinterpretation, researchers should have a strong grasp of the variance that enters into estimation, and not just the potential confounders a given strategy is designed to deal with.",

          "title": "Understanding trends in social fluidity in Western Europe: class structural change and the OED triangle",
          "authors": "Erzsébet Bukodi, John H Goldthorpe",
          "abstract": "We start from a general theory of intergenerational class mobility previously proposed as an alternative to the ‘liberal’ theory. In further evaluating these theories, we report empirical analyses of relations within the origins–education–destinations (OED) triangle, drawing on data for individuals born 1923–1977 in 17 European societies. In contrast with earlier research, we treat education in relative terms. We find that the tendency for fluidity to increase within class structures after World War II, rather than being the expression of a ‘worldwide secular trend’, was restricted to a distinctive historical period of rapid economic growth and class structural change. Furthermore, in accounting for this increasing fluidity, the role of education may easily be exaggerated. The weakening of the ‘direct’ OD association is of at least comparable importance to changes in the OE and ED associations. Consistently with the proposed theory, class structural change, insofar as it promotes greater upward mobility, would also appear to provide a favourable context for increasing fluidity. Where downward mobility increases, the growing motivation and the capacity of more advantaged parents to protect their children against déclassement constitutes a powerful source of resistance to change in endogenous mobility regimes.",

          "title": "How neighbourhood effects vary by achievement level",
          "authors": "Nicolai T Borgen, Henrik Daae Zachrisson",
          "abstract": "After long-standing calls for research into ‘for whom’ neighbourhood matters, the literature has recently gained traction, focussing on background characteristics such as gender, race, and socioeconomic background. However, there is still scarce and only indirect evidence on whether neighbourhood effects vary by children’s academic ability. In this paper, we combine the Neighbourhood Choice Model with quantile regressions to investigate whether neighbourhood effects vary by children’s academic proneness. Using Norwegian register data, we demonstrate heterogeneity in the effects of neighbourhood deprivation as a function of students’ proneness to academic achievement. Students with the very lowest and highest academic potential are the least affected by neighbourhood disadvantage, while those with below average—but not at the lowest end—are most strongly affected. Moreover, while girls are less affected than boys, and children from less educated and affluent families are more affected by neighbourhood disadvantage than their more privileged peers, the effects of these observed moderators are considerably smaller than the heterogeneity observed as a function of academic proneness. Overall, our use of quantile regressions opens up new venues for understanding ‘for whom’ neighbourhoods matter, with individual-level academic vulnerability and strengths being an influential source of neighbourhood effects variation.",

          "title": "Intergenerational family life courses and wealth accumulation in Norway",
          "authors": "Bettina Hünteler, Theresa Nutz, Jonathan Wörn",
          "abstract": "While prior research has widely acknowledged the consequences of specific family transitions (e.g., parental death, parenthood, grandparenthood) for individual wealth holdings, the interplay of multiple family transitions and positions occurring at different life stages and in various orderings has received little attention. This is despite the fact that these transitions and positions most likely jointly shape wealth accumulation, both in the shorter and longer run. We apply (1) sequence analysis to identify typical family life course clusters defined by the timing of the death of the parent generation, the timing of the transition into parenthood, and grandparenthood and (2) regression analysis to describe how the accumulation of wealth between ages 40 and 64 differs by family life course cluster. Using Norwegian register data of individuals born in 1953 (N = 47,945), we identified six clusters of family trajectories ranging from childless individuals to individuals who were sandwiched between their parents, children, and grandchildren because of relatively early (grand)parenthood and late parental death. Individuals experiencing patterns with a later transition into (grand)parenthood occupied stable and high wealth positions over time. Individuals without children exhibited a steady increase in their wealth position. Additionally, experiencing parental death later in life was associated with increasing wealth, whereas early parental death was not. These results held net of gender and education. Pronounced and even increasing wealth differences over the life course seem to be associated with the interplay of multiple family transitions.",
