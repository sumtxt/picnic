          "authors": "Mireia Triguero Roura",
          "abstract": "Existing literature has found that there is a negative effect of increased immigration on native support for redistributive policies. In this paper, I refocus the debate from ’immigrants’ to ‘natives’ and I argue that this negative effect is moderated by how strongly the ‘nation’ is understood as an ethnic category by natives. Using data from 30 European countries and 270 regions, I show that the negative association between the share of immigration and support for welfare is driven by those who imagine the nation in ethnic terms. Moreover, I show that this is not purely driven by a desire to protect natives in the face of all newcomers, but rather ethnic nationalists’ support for welfare policies is only sensitive to non-European foreign-born populations, even after controlling for the education level of these populations. This suggests that ethnic nationalism, more than xenophobia, is the mechanism behind this solidarity retraction. These findings have important consequences for understanding how the rise of the right-wing in Europe, which activates ethnic nationalism, can have consequences for the European welfare states, and in turn, for national cohesion and solidarity.",

          "title": "Confronting linked immobility: how Chinese migrants managed family crisis during a global catastrophe",
          "authors": "Ken Chih-Yan Sun, Lijun Lin",
          "abstract": "Drawing on qualitative interviews with 51 Chinese migrants who live in the US but strive to support frail parents back home, this article analyzes the impact of China’s zero-COVID policy on transnational family caregiving. We argue that the restrictions sending states enforce on individuals’ movement across locales affect migrants’ negotiation of critical family life transitions in unexpectedly complex and challenging ways. This article offers the concept of “linked immobility” to examine migrants’ immobility in relation to their loved ones’ spatial and social constraints. Such linked immobility exposes migrants and their at-home parents to risks, uncertainties, and anxiety. Concurrently, many respondents confronted China’s multi-scalar immobility regime, either from afar by coordinating the care and resources their parents needed, or by braving the trip. Our findings advance the scholarships on transnational migration and immobility by making visible how migrants react to situations where mobility is highly desired but difficult to achieve.",

          "title": "Competing social influence in contested diffusion: contention and the spread of the early reformation",
          "authors": "Sascha Becker, Yuan Hsiao, Steven Pfaff, Jared Rubin",
          "abstract": "The spread of radical institutional change does not often result from one-sided pro-innovation influence; countervailing influence networks in support of the status quo can suppress adoption. We develop a model of multiplex and competing network diffusion to describe how competing actors compete through multiple types of networks. Specifically, we hypothesize three types of contested diffusion: market competition, inoculation, and firefighting. To apply the contested-diffusion model to real data, we look at the contest between Martin Luther and Desiderius Erasmus, the two most influential intellectuals of early 16th-century Europe. In the early phase of the Reformation, these two figures utilized influence networks, affecting which cities in the Holy Roman Empire adopted reform. Using newly digitalized data on both leaders’ correspondence networks, their travels, the dispersion of their followers, and parallel processes of exchange among places through trade routes, we employ empirical tests of our theoretical model. We find that although Luther’s network is strongly associated with the spread of the Reformation, Erasmus’s network is associated with the stifling of the Reformation. This is consistent with a “firefighting” mechanism of contested diffusion, whereby the countervailing force suppresses innovations only after they have begun to spread.",

          "title": "Turning protest into power: how the Women’s March worked",
          "authors": "Jonathan Pinckney",
          "abstract": "How does protests’ size shape their electoral impact? Recent years have seen frequent, loosely coordinated public days of protest with historically unprecedented participation. Yet scholars and activists debate whether even massive protest size translates into electoral outcomes. Resolving this debate is difficult because protest participation is influenced by underlying political conditions, and thus any correlation between protest size and electoral results may be due to unobservable omitted variables. In this article, I conduct a rigorous test of the electoral impact of protest participation in a case that also allows for further insight into the mechanisms for protest’s impact: the 2017 Women’s March. I test the impact of the Women’s March on 2018 county-level election results using detailed geo-coded data on local marches’ location and participation. To address omitted variable bias, I employ an instrumental variables analysis, instrumenting march size with precipitation and temperature data. I find that the number of Women’s March participants had a significant positive effect on the 2018 Democratic party vote share. To understand why, I further test the impact of instrumented march participation on two other variables: the creation of “Indivisible” groups and donations to Democratic politicians. This analysis shows that larger Women’s Marches led to higher levels of sustained organizing and political donations. Rapidly organized, social media–based days of protest can impact elections through activating participants for future political action.",

          "abstract": "This special issue of Sociological Methods &amp; Research presents a collection of papers that develop a range of new statistical approaches and empirical insights on intergenerational mobility. The papers in the special issue involve four broad themes: the development of new statistics to characterize mobility, the exploration of methods to establish causal explanations, the enrichment of statistical models to better characterize heterogeneity in mobility across families, and the development and application of ways to employ machine learning tools to enrich mobility analysis. These papers demonstrate the excitement of the methodological frontier in mobility research.",
