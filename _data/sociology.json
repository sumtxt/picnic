          "title": "Racial prisms: experimental evidence on families’ race-based evaluations of school safety",
          "authors": "Chantal A Hailey",
          "abstract": "Racial segregation is an enduring social reality in the United States. Since safety is central to residential and educational decisions, one explanation is, when choosing neighborhoods and schools, individuals use racial composition to signal safety. However, few studies have focused on race-based perceptions of school safety. To examine racialized school safety beliefs, I leverage an original survey experiment with 995 White, Asian, Latine, and Black eighth-grade parents and students. Respondents examined school profiles with randomly varied racial compositions, school and neighborhood safety ratings, metal detector presence, and graduation rates. Among Whites, Asians, and Latines, school racial composition shapes their beliefs about school safety, even when schools have identical safety ratings and security measures. White and Asian respondents believed that Black and Latine schools were less safe than White schools; Latine respondents believed that Black schools were less safe than all other schools; and school racial composition did not influence Black respondents’ beliefs about school safety. Non-Black respondents, with stronger anti-Black and anti-Latine personal racial biases and more knowledge of cultural stereotypes of Black violence, were more likely to express race-based beliefs about school safety. Non-Black respondents’ anti-Black perceptions of school safety contributed to their avoidance of Black schools. These findings suggest that anti-Blackness undergirds the public imagination of physical spaces and has implications for understanding contemporary segregation, discrimination, and racial inequality.",

          "authors": "Mikkeline Munk Nielsen, Peter Fallesen, Michael Gähler",
          "abstract": "Increasingly children whose parents no longer live together are living in two households, alternating between family contexts. A growing literature documents strong, descriptive heterogeneities in children’s wellbeing across living arrangements. We combine longitudinal survey and administrative population data on 6000 Danish children born in 1995 to study how children’s emotional and behavioral problems change following parental union dissolution. Extending the existing, predominantly descriptive literature, we use several panel regression strategies that aim to control for unobservable confounding together with repeated measurement of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire to study children’s problems increase after parental union dissolution and examine heterogeneity across post-dissolution living arrangements. We find a substantial increase in emotional and behavioral problems following union dissolution, but only little evidence for substantial heterogeneity existing across post-dissolution family constellations and living arrangements. Our findings indicate that not only there is casual effect of parental union dissolution on children’s long-term wellbeing, but also that existing descriptive findings on differences across living arrangements likely are due to selection.",
