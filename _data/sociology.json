          "title": "Social networks and distributive conflict: the class divide in social ties and attitudes to income inequality across 29 countries",
          "authors": "Arvid Lindh, Anton B Andersson",
          "abstract": "The theoretical proposition that social networks contribute to class divides in political attitudes has rarely been further developed or empirically scrutinized with individual-level data on a large cross-national scale. In this article, we theorize and empirically examine how the class profiles of personal networks may shape individual attitudes to income inequality from a country-comparative perspective. Using multilevel modeling and data from the ISSP Social Networks and Resources module, covering 29 countries, we find that having more family, friends, and acquaintances in upper-middle-class positions is associated with lower support for reducing inequality, while having more social ties to working-class positions is associated with higher support for reducing inequality. We also assess how these relationships differ across countries depending on the institutional context, finding that both own class location and the class profiles of personal networks are more strongly related to attitudes to income inequality in countries with a higher rate of government redistribution. The study provides new theoretical and empirical insights into the importance of personal networks’ class profiles for shaping individual attitudes and structural ideological divisions linked to economic inequality, while also suggesting that social networks are key to understanding institutionally embedded distributive conflicts from a country-comparative perspective.",

          "title": "Parenthood and poverty risk within couples: individual and household poverty risks by gender and education in four European countries",
          "authors": "Christina Siegert",
          "abstract": "This study examines how the presence of children is associated with poverty risk within different-sex couples across welfare state regimes, using no- and full-income pooling scenarios. It focuses on whether partners can achieve an adequate living standard without relying on family ties, and how the costs of children shape poverty risk within these scenarios. Using cross-sectional EU-SILC data (2016–2019) on 30,150 coresidential couples from Austria, France, Spain, and Sweden, I use linear probability models (LPM) to estimate household and individual poverty risks among partners with/out children, by education, gender and country. The results indicate that poverty risks vary by gender, income pooling scenario and country. While partners bear household poverty risks together, there is a pronounced gender gap in individual poverty risk across countries. Men, regardless of their education and fatherhood status, have a relatively low individual poverty risk, with little difference between income pooling scenarios. Conversely, women, especially low-educated mothers, have a higher individual than household poverty risk. Observed cross-country variations highlight that the relationship between motherhood and poverty risk is context-specific. Although education is often promoted as a shield against poverty, in some countries, such as Austria, highly educated mothers also face a high individual poverty risk.",

          "title": "Double standards in status ascriptions? The role of gender, behaviors, and social networks in status orders among adolescents",
          "authors": "Mark Wittek, Xinwei Xu",
          "abstract": "We examine the gendered distribution of peer-ascribed status in schools. Using network data from more than 14,000 students in 676 classrooms, we explore gender differences in the ascription of status and the types of behavior rewarded with status. On average, girls receive slightly fewer status ascriptions than boys, and students tend to grant status more frequently within the same gender. Contextual analyses show that classroom demographics can moderate some of these patterns. We also uncover gender-specific differences and similarities in status-related behaviors. Notably, girls engaging in substance use are awarded with slightly more status ascriptions than boys. However, network models reveal that most behaviors affect peer status similarly for both genders, suggesting that previous findings of gender-behavioral differences based on regression analysis may be conflated with network processes. Our study updates long-held notions regarding gendered status orders in schools and highlights the value of a multidimensional approach to status processes. We discuss implications for future social network research on status ascriptions and other relational cognitions and consider how school-based interventions might benefit from our findings.",

          "title": "Networks rewired: quota enforcement and the unintended mobilization of native place ties",
          "authors": "Enying Zheng, Wei Hong, Yasheng Huang, Rongzhu Ke",
          "abstract": "We explore how institutional designs can have unintended consequences, especially by rewiring social networks. Using archival data on the civil-service examinations in historical China, we argue that the enforcement of a regional quota system in 1427 reshaped group boundaries along native place, turned emotional affinities for one’s hometown into political stakes, and reinforced the influence of native place ties among political elites. Analyzing approximately 30,000 individual records, we confirm this argument by documenting a macro-level shift from a highly unequal to a more balanced provincial distribution of students who passed the examinations following the enforcement of the quota system. As native place became a primary basis for network homophily, elites deliberately cultivated these connections, seizing the opportunity as ad hoc examiners to provide preferential treatment based on shared place of origin. Our micro-level analysis of 12,752 passing students between 1400 and 1580 identifies this in-group favoritism, with examiners often ranking students from their own provinces higher. A mechanism of safeguarding political stakes underscores this baseline effect, which became more pronounced during the quota stage, especially under weaker state capacity, among examiners from disadvantaged provinces, and when examiners had greater vested interest in their hometown. These findings enrich theories of group boundaries and categorization, network homophily and formation, and the unintended consequences of institutional designs while also providing policy insights for affirmative action.",
