          "authors": "Leisy J. Abrego, Lucia León",
          "abstract": "US immigration policies have profound impacts on immigrant families. In a robust field of study across disciplines, scholars have documented how the multi-layered, complex immigration regime opens and closes doors to opportunity, health, education, safety, and peace. With a rise in harsh and unpredictable enforcement practices, immigrant families—including undocumented, liminally legal, and US citizen members—navigate the contradictory laws at the federal, state, and local levels to thrive as best as they can. In our review, we encourage scholars to extend their analysis to what happens during the migrant journey and at the border, as these experiences are also impacted by US immigration policies and potentially impact families long after they settle in the United States. The ever-changing labyrinthine legal landscape and its expansive reach provide fertile ground for further research, and we urge scholars to center ethics in their work with immigrant families made vulnerable through immigration laws.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the relationship between biography, chance, and persistence in accounting for the assembly of an American sociologist. It traces the accumulation of experiences involved in a research journey aimed at explanation of social behavior and institutional change. The process of discovery leading to a new theory may arise from serendipitous observations gained through fieldwork, while new combinations of ideas also emerge from social interactions with acquaintances, colleagues and friends. Cross-disciplinary intellectual trade offers rich opportunities for advances in the social and behavioral sciences.",

          "authors": "Neda Maghbouleh",
          "abstract": "Research on Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) populations in the United States has been shaped by a fundamental paradox: MENAs are statistically invisible in the administrative data infrastructure yet socially hypervisible in other domains. This review outlines key demographic characteristics of the MENA American population and argues that by addressing the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox through innovative research questions and methods, previous scholarship has advanced sociology in three areas: identity, racialization, and integration. As upcoming changes to federal race and ethnicity standards take effect, the invisibility/hypervisibility paradox may shift as sociologists more easily collect and analyze data about MENA Americans. However, this information may be misused, misinterpreted, or handled unethically without sufficient background context and responsibility to community members. Future research will require data disaggregation to explore intersectional and intragroup minority issues, examination of the evolving content and meaning of MENA panethnicity, and ongoing assessment of the MENA group's relative racial position.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on legislation that targets nongovernmental organizations working on human rights issues (HR NGOs) has mostly focused on state actors in authoritarian regimes. In this study, we theorize the role of nonstate actors in political repression in a relatively more democratic setting, that of Israel. We conducted a systematic content analysis of thousands of legal documents, parliamentary archives, and media reports, complementing these with ethnographic work in several NGOs and in-depth interviews with NGO staffers. In contrast with theoretical views that see legislative processes as merely window dressing, we found that the Israeli legislative process has had a profound impact on Israeli HR NGOs, entailing a significant loss of public and political support, legitimacy, and scarce resources. We argue that scholars of political repression must pay greater attention to the crucial role played by nonstate actors in advancing and enforcing repressive legislation and to the entire legislative process—rather than only its formal legal results.",

          "title": "Limits to helping in a helping profession: the social context of psychiatrist opt-out from public insurance",
          "authors": "Daniel Tadmon",
          "abstract": "In the United States, most mental health services are provided by independent helping professionals, individually deciding where to operate, whom to treat, and in which insurance networks to participate. In making such decisions, these market actors often navigate conflicts between financial, professional, and prosocial considerations. This article investigates the phenomenon of psychiatrist opt-out from Medicaid and Medicare, aiming to elucidate how social contexts influence such decisions. Assembling a census of all licensed Georgia psychiatrists and, assisted by a telephone audit, leveraging granular data about the environments in which clinicians operate, findings show that limits to helping in the form of opt-out from public insurance systematically correspond to the social ecologies in which psychiatrists are embedded—with their prospective clientele and local peers. Evidence of alignment between insurance participation and population needs, when financially justified, and of spatially dependent monopolistic and competition-curbing behavior point at the power of these ecologies in shaping the balance actors negotiate between local economic and normative pressures. Theoretically, findings support the argument that meso-level conditions mediate countervailing social forces and their translation to action—here, spatially configuring how markets and morals interact. In the context of the mental health crisis, where demand for care far exceeds supply, understanding how spatial conditions ultimately shape the pressures that helping professionals face and their opt-out decisions is crucial. In aggregate, these individually decided yet ecologically conditioned limits to helping impact the availability of mental health services to some of society’s most disadvantaged populations, thus shaping the contours of the crisis.",

          "authors": "Laura Tach, Emily Parker, Alexandra Cooperstock, Samuel Dodini",
          "abstract": "This paper assesses the growth and spatial distribution of federal place-based policies in the United States. Using a novel dataset of federal place-based policies from 1990 to 2019, we show how the dual forces of fiscalization and financialization have fueled a substantial increase in federal place-based funding to communities via competitive tax credit and grant programs. We consider whether federal place-based funding has been distributed in a compensatory way by prioritizing more disadvantaged communities or whether it has compounded neighborhood inequalities by prioritizing more advantaged communities. We find that federal place-based funding has gone overwhelmingly to communities experiencing economic disadvantage, as intended, but at the same time such policies have compounded other forms of spatial inequality via disproportionate investment in areas with more nonprofit organizations and stronger housing markets. Economically disadvantaged neighborhoods that are spatially embedded within counties with strong housing markets and robust nonprofit sectors received the most federal place-based funding. These organizational and housing market inequities are strongest for tax credit and competitive grant programs, precisely the forms of funding that have grown most over this period. The funding trends reveal a pattern of cumulative advantage, as poor communities with initial funding advantages in the 1990s went on to receive the vast majority of federal place-based funding in the subsequent decades, leading to growing divergence among high-poverty communities in the distribution of federal place-based resources over time.",

          "title": "Understanding the “package deal”: disentangling parents’ intertwined preferences for schools and neighborhoods",
          "authors": "Elly Field",
          "abstract": "The racial segregation of schools and neighborhoods are mutually reinforcing because school districts assign students to schools based on residential address and parents account for this link when deciding where to live. Parents cite a desire for the “package deal” of a good neighborhood with a good local school. Yet, in studying how race shapes parents’ preferences, scholars typically examine these contexts in isolation. Using an original stated choice experiment, I propose and test two theoretical frameworks for how the package deal influences parents’ joint preferences for schools and neighborhoods. I find that school and neighborhood preferences are interactive, meaning that neighborhood characteristics shape the effects of school characteristics on parents’ decisions and school characteristics shape the effects of neighborhood characteristics, and the nature of this interaction varies by parent race. I find that White parents’ preferences for Whiter schools and neighborhoods are magnified across contexts, such that White parents prefer racial isolation in both their schools and neighborhoods. Latino parents also prefer greater Latino representation in both neighborhoods and schools, but these preferences are only activated in majority Latino contexts. In contrast, Black parents prefer to avoid being a racial minority in both schools and neighborhoods but are satisfied when just one context is majority Black. These intertwined, interactive preferences mean that our understanding of how parents decide where to live and where to send their children to school must account for the relationship between these contexts.",

          "authors": "Pablo A. Mitnik",
          "abstract": "Although there is an extensive methodological literature on the measurement of intergenerational income mobility, there has been limited research on the conceptual interpretation of mobility measures and the methodological implications of those interpretations. In this article, I focus on the three measures of mobility most frequently used in the literature—the intergenerational elasticity (IGE), the intergenerational correlation (IGC), and the rank-rank slope (RRS)—as well as a recently introduced measure, the intergenerational elasticity of expected income (IGEE). I make two main contributions, both related to the conceptual interpretation of mobility measures. First, I specify the formal relationships between those four mobility measures and the measures of inequality of opportunity developed in the luck egalitarian empirical literature on the topic, and determine the methodological implications of the analyses. I show that (a) the IGC is a measure of relative inequality of opportunity for monetary income, (b) the RRS is both a measure of relative inequality of opportunity for income rank and a rescaled measure of absolute inequality of opportunity for income rank, and (c) the products of parental income inequality by the IGEE and IGE are both measures of absolute inequality of opportunity for monetary income that differ in how they measure the value of opportunity sets. Second, relying on a conceptual distinction that has been influential in the field of public finance, the IGE and IGEE have been characterized as “person-weighted” and “dollar-weighted” elasticities, respectively, thus raising doubts about the desirability of a recent proposal to replace the IGE by the IGEE as the workhorse elasticity of the mobility field. I show that this contrasting characterization of the two intergenerational elasticities is the joint result of a category mistake—equating quantile-specific elasticities to person-specific elasticities—and of misconstruing the nature of the IGE and the epistemic goal it has been meant to serve. Based on this analysis, I conclude that the case for replacing the IGE with the IGEE remains well-founded.",

          "abstract": "Current research on intergenerational mobility (IGM) is informed by statistical approaches based on log-level regressions, whose economic interpretations remain largely unknown. We reveal the subjective value-judgments in them: they are represented by weighted-sums (or aggregators) over heterogeneous groups, with controversial economic properties. Log-level regressions tend to overrepresent the experiences of middle-class children while underrepresenting those from disadvantaged families. We propose a general construction of IGM measures that can incorporate any transparent economic preferences. They are interpreted as the marginal effect of parental normalized social welfare on children’s normalized welfare. Conventional regressions are special cases with implicit economic preferences that fail inequality-aversion and the Pigou–Dalton principle of transfers. Empirically, a variety of economic preferences, with varying inequality aversion, demonstrate a nuanced view of mobility, and perspectives on geographic-differences and dynamics of it.",

          "abstract": "Inattentive respondents pose a substantial threat to data quality in web surveys. We evaluate methods for preventing and detecting inattentive respondents. First, we test the effect of asking respondents to commit to providing high-quality responses at the beginning of the survey on various data quality measures. Second, we compare the proportion of flagged respondents for two versions of an attention check item instructing them to select a specific response versus leaving the item blank. Third, we propose a timestamp-based cluster analysis approach that identifies clusters of respondents who exhibit different speeding behaviors. Our findings show that the commitment pledge had no effect on the data quality measures. Instructing respondents to leave the item blank significantly increased the rate of flagged respondents (by 16.8 percentage points). The timestamp-based clustering approach efficiently identified clusters of likely inattentive respondents. Lastly, we show that inattentive respondents can have substantial impacts on substantive analyses.",
