          "authors": "Robin Bartram, Japonica Brown-Saracino",
          "abstract": "The sociology of housing has clear implications for and overlaps with sociological studies of inequality. However, gender is still overlooked and undertheorized in housing research. Drawing on gender scholars, we caution against the tendency to treat gender as a synonym for women, as a variable that compares outcomes to those of men, and/or as synonymous with binary roles (e.g., poor mothers of color versus affluent, White gentrifiers). We demonstrate how a subset of scholars departs from these tendencies and model avenues for further research, for example by viewing housing and gender as coconstitutive. Overall, we argue that the measurement of inequality at the city and neighborhood level stymies focus on gender. However, by taking housing units—and, crucially, the households that they contain—as their unit of analysis, sociologists of housing are well-positioned to merge attention to the importance of gender identities, expectations, and roles with analyses of multiple overlapping levels and sites of inequality.",

          "title": "No one-size-fits-all solution. Effects of social policies on in-work poverty",
          "authors": "Jan Brülle",
          "abstract": "The paper studies effects of social policies on in-work poverty risks, distinguishing between measures that either intervene in labour market processes - i.e. predistribution policies - or redistribute towards those with low incomes. The analyses use data from EU-SILC and macro-level indicators from various sources to estimate general as well as household-typespecific effects using longitudinal methods. Results reveal important differences between specific policies: increasing minimum wages contributes to reducing low-wage risks, but has no significant effect on in-work poverty risks. In contrast, there is a negative effect of strict employment protection legislation across almost all household types on in-work poverty, which is consistent with the positive role this measure plays for supporting earnings that are sufficient to provide not only for one person, but also potential dependants in the household. With respect to redistributional policies, both unemployment benefits and benefits to low earners reduce poverty due to their contribution to public poverty-reduction. However, whereas unemployment benefits only reduce in-work poverty among couple households, benefits to low earners mainly contribute to lower poverty risks among employed single parents. Overall, the results underscore that predistributional and redistributional as well as universal and targeted interventions cannot easily substitute each other.",

          "title": "How perceived income inequality affects charitable giving and volunteering: assessing four mechanisms",
          "authors": "Michaela Neumayr, Joris Melchior Schröder",
          "abstract": "Public concerns about economic inequality are large and growing, and they have been shown to affect people's charitable giving and volunteering. While empirical literature addresses this issue, it provides little evidence on the underlying mechanisms linking inequality and civic engagement. Scholars from different disciplines have proposed numerous hypotheses about these mechanisms, with the social disintegration hypothesis, the conflict hypothesis, the relative power hypothesis, and the unmet needs hypothesis among the most frequently suggested. In this study, we apply mediation analysis to survey data from Austria and Germany (N=1,691) to assess which of these mechanisms help explain the relationship. Our results support the social disintegration hypothesis and the unmet needs hypothesis: Individuals who completely agree that income inequality is too high are slightly less likely to give to charity (volunteer) due to the indirect relationship through generalized social trust, and substantially more likely to give to charity (volunteer) due to the indirect relationship through impure altruism, when compared to those who completely disagree that income inequality is too high. These findings imply that multiple mechanisms work in opposing directions. Our study provides an important step in theory development in this field and serves as a basis for future experimental studies.",

          "title": "The making of ethnic segregation on the labor market - evidence from a field experiment",
          "authors": "Moa Bursell, Magnus Bygren",
          "abstract": "Western labor markets are typically segregated by country of birth, with immigrants often employed in roles such as cleaners, taxi drivers, and fast-food cooks. This paper examines whether employers are more likely to select immigrants for these low-skilled jobs. We use data from correspondence tests conducted in Sweden in the 2010s, with about 7,000 job applications submitted. While ethnic discrimination is widespread in occupations dominated by native-born workers, it decreases as the proportion of immigrants in an occupation rises. There is no discrimination against immigrant men applying for positions of cleaners and drivers. We conclude that discriminatory employer hiring choices contributes to reproducing male-dominated and low-qualified immigrant niches in the labor market.",

          "title": "Presentation of self in the neoliberal society: comparing an elite- and a working-class community in Sweden",
          "authors": "Mikael Holmqvist, Jon Sunnerfjell",
          "abstract": "In this paper, we ethnographically explore the neoliberal society from two contrasting social and economic perspectives in Sweden: an elite community characterized by well-educated people, full employment and affluence and wealth, and a former working-class community with high unemployment rates, poverty and poor education level. Analysing rich and varied field data from 2010 through 2023, the theoretical framework is rooted in Erving Goffman's ideas on self-presentation, providing a lens through which to study the shifts in societal structures and expectations. More specifically, we examine the enactment of the neoliberal society through three interlaced practices: (a) aesthetic self-presentation; (b) behavioural self-presentation; and (c) attitudinal self-presentation. We suggest that the neoliberal society, driven by the ethos of market rationality, contributes to primarily strengthening “the employable self” among residents in the elite community, through such expressions as leadership, commitment, energy and activity. In the working-class community, however, we show how an emphasis on modesty, perseverance and loyalty, are qualities framed as “unemployability”. Despite radically different socio-economic conditions, we suggest how both communities share significant commonalities in the way individuals' self-presentations of employability are shaped by the cultural and communal contexts in which they reside.",

          "title": "To what extent do disadvantaged neighbourhoods mediate social assistance dependency? Evidence from Sweden",
          "authors": "Cheng Lin, Adel Daoud, Maria Brandén",
          "abstract": "This article investigates social assistance dependency and its relation to neighbourhood disadvantage in Sweden. We combine Swedish register data, tracking and analysing a cohort from 1998–2017, with the help of causal mediation, our analysis identifies the impact of early-adulthood social assistance on mid-adulthood social assistance. More specifically, we examine the mediating roles of neighbourhood conditions and compare this effect to the well-known mediating effect of unstable work experiences. Our findings suggest a differential effect for individuals with a high versus low probability of receiving social assistance in early adulthood. For individuals with a baseline high probability of receiving early-adulthood social assistance, the total estimated effect of early-adulthood social assistance on mid-adulthood social assistance recipiency is over 15 per cent points. Neighbourhood disadvantage only has a minor mediating effect on average, however, for individuals with a high risk of early-adulthood social assistance, the effect is substantial, over 5 per cent points, even more than the mediating effect from unstable work. The findings suggest that for high-risk individuals, social assistance recipiency in young adulthood is linked to subsequent entrenchment in disadvantaged areas and unstable employment, reinforcing a cycle of poverty. Our findings contribute to understanding the complex interactions between policy, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors in perpetuating social assistance dependency.",
