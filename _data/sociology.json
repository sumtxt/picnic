          "title": "Rationality or Relationality in Life and Death: Regulating Organ Donation in Singapore and Taiwan",
          "authors": "Wan-Zi Lu",
          "abstract": "Lawmakers often attempt to settle conflicting values. However, we know little about how regulatory reasoning influences organizational practices and shapes the conditions under which people respond. This article examines unexpected outcomes of deceased organ donation in Singapore and Taiwan, whose governments have had to address cultural and emotional resistance to the practice. Adopting an opt-out law, Singapore created a larger pool of legal organ donors yet generated worse donation outcomes than Taiwan, whose opt-in regulation has resulted in a smaller pool of potential organ donors. Drawing from interviews and archival research to solve this puzzle, I argue that moral infrastructure—the regulation-endorsed organizational arrangements to tackle cultural and emotional tensions—determines whether and when people change their minds regarding shared cultural norms. Singapore’s regulation prioritizes instrumental rationality and generates efficiency-driven organizational practices. These practices lead to affective circumvention , sidestepping emotions to expedite organ procurement and, in turn, prompting patients’ families to withdraw from hospital care. By contrast, in Taiwan, relational reasoning creates arrangements that promote affective coordination , a process that empowers intermediaries to work with grieving families and morally reframe donation. An institutionalized emphasis on relationality fosters cooperation and provides opportunities to re moralize a contested practice.",

          "title": "Workplace variation in migrant job searches: cohesion unites, bonuses do not divide",
          "authors": "Luuk Mandemakers, Eva Jaspers, Tanja van der Lippe",
          "abstract": "Dutch workplaces suffer from labor shortages and interest in diverse workforces is growing, making the retention of employees with a migration background vital. Yet, migrant employees continue to experience exclusion in the workplace, making them more prone to search for different jobs than non-migrant employees. This article is novel as it locates drivers of migrant job searches at the organizational level and examines the impact of indicators of relative distances between groups within organizations. First it assesses whether workplace cohesion mitigates differences between migrant and non-migrant employees, as cohesion may reduce intergroup distances through positive inter-ethnic contact. Second, it is examined whether workplaces that divide resources through bonus payment systems have lager job search disparities, as in such workplaces individual performance based incentives may reinforce intergroup conflict. Using unique employer-employee linked data from the Netherlands, this research finds that migrants search for jobs more often than non-migrants, that being part of cohesive workplaces as a migrant mitigates this gap and that the prevalence of bonus payment systems has no effect. To retain migrant employees and to improve the diversity of workforces, organizations should invest in increasing workplace cohesion. Further implications for theory, research and practice are discussed.",

          "authors": "Ea Hoppe Blaabæk, Sam Friedman, Mads Meier Jæger, Aaron Reeves",
          "abstract": "Research shows that cultural tastes are socially stratified. Yet, most of this research relies on small-sample surveys and includes only a few dimensions of stratification. To address these limitations, we analyse registry data on library borrowing for the entire adult population of Denmark and consider four dimensions of social stratification: wealth, education, income, and occupation. We find considerable social stratification in library borrowing and in highbrow literary tastes by wealth and education, but not by income and occupation. As Denmark is characterized by higher wealth and educational stratification than income and occupational stratification, our results suggest that although cultural tastes always seem to be socially stratified, the type of stratification likely depends on the nature of the wider inequalities within a given context. We end by discussing the implications of our results, including how stratification of tastes according to wealth represents a type of stratification not considered in existing research on cultural stratification.",

          "authors": "Fabian Kratz, Josef Brüderl",
          "abstract": "Assessments of age trajectories are crucial for various strands of sociological research. This study provides guidance on how to estimate age trajectories by discussing a research design to answer the question, ‘How does aging affect subjective well-being?’ We define the estimand, discuss key identification and estimation assumptions, and propose—informed by this discussion—a research design. By contrasting our design with those of previous studies, we conclude that many prior investigations were affected by three biases related to identification and one bias concerning estimation. Using extensive panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), we demonstrate that these four biases contributed to mixed empirical evidence, producing distortions that led to even qualitatively different conclusions. Finally, we discuss implications of our study for life course research and for enhancing the credibility of social science more broadly.",

          "title": "Beyond the ‘integration paradox’: educational attainment similarly predicts gender discrimination among women and ethnic discrimination among minorities",
          "authors": "Chloé Lavest, Lucas G Drouhot, Meta van der Linden, Frank van Tubergen",
          "abstract": "Highly educated individuals of immigrant origins perceive more ethnic discrimination than their less educated counterparts—a now well-established finding referred to as the ‘integration paradox’. In this paper, we study whether this purported paradox captures general educational effects on the lived experiences of historically disadvantaged populations going beyond the scope of integration among immigrants. We compare the educational gradient of perceptions of ethno-racial discrimination among ethnic minorities with the educational gradient of perceptions of gender discrimination among women. We also study intersectional dimensions in the experiences of minority women and those reporting multiple grounds for discrimination. Analyses based on representative data from two cross-sectional surveys in France - Trajectoires et Origines 1 and 2—involving over 35,000 respondents show that highly educated individuals, including both ethnic minorities and women, are more likely to report discrimination. Individuals who report discrimination on one ground are also more likely to report it on another ground. Our results suggest that the so-called integration paradox reflects more general educational effects on subjective experiences of exclusion that are not unique to immigrant-origin populations.",

          "title": "Rethinking migrant reception in the age of color-blind racism: an experimental approach",
          "authors": "Michael Middleton",
          "abstract": "A large and robust literature has emerged in recent years that looks at the acceptance of migrants into Western countries. Surprisingly, these studies have consistently found that residents in Western countries accept non-White migrants at virtually the same level as White migrants. Missing from these studies is an engagement with racism in its modern form, which is often more “color-blind,” or hidden, rather than overtly expressed, and thus can be more difficult to capture. In this study, I ask the following questions: (1) What role do racialization processes play in attitudes toward migrants? and (2) Do these processes vary across different questions of acceptance? To answer these questions, this study utilizes Duboisian insight to argue that, while White attitudes toward non-White migrants may be positive in the abstract, when Whites are forced to give up their symbolic and material power in the process, this positive reception wanes. The study utilizes a conjoint design experimental online survey to test the acceptance of migrants applying for refugee status across multiple outcomes: (1) legal acceptance, which measures the acceptance across the physical border, and (2) symbolic acceptance, which measures the acceptance into American society. These findings replicate prior research in finding no significant difference between the legal acceptance of White and non-White migrants among White respondents. However, when the acceptance outcome becomes symbolic, this parity dissipates. This study contributes to the literature by adding a symbolic layer to migrant acceptance in the United States, an important distinction in the era of color-blind racism.",

          "title": "Unpacking the nexus of Islamic religiosity and attitudes towards individual liberties and gender equality: a person-centered analysis among Dutch Muslims",
          "authors": "Marija Dangubić, Fenella Fleischmann",
          "abstract": "Public discourses frequently portray religiosity as a problem for the emancipation of women and sexual minorities, and in Europe, Muslims are particularly singled out as threatening liberal values. Empirical studies indeed often document negative associations between Muslims’ religiosity and attitudes such as support for gender equality and acceptance of homosexuality. However, research so far mainly applied variable-centered analyses which neglect that there might be different ways in which Muslim minority members combine their religiosity and attitudes towards individual (sexual) liberties and gender equality. To provide a more differentiated understanding of these complex associations, we conduct a person-centered analysis and identify different subgroups in the Turkish- and Moroccan-origin oversample of the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (NELLS 2011, N = 1829). Two subgroups confirm findings from variable-centered approaches: we find a profile that combines high levels of religiosity with low acceptance of sexual liberalism, and one with the opposite pattern of low religiosity but high levels of acceptance of sexual liberalism and gender equality. A sizable additional subgroup combines high levels of religiosity with acceptance of homosexuality, and to a lesser extent divorce and chosen childlessness. Our findings suggest that the acceptance of homosexuality is particularly relevant in differentiating between subgroups of Muslims, whereas attitudes towards gender equality do not differ remarkably between profiles. In conclusion, liberal attitudes are complexly related to religiosity, warning against over-simplified interpretations of religion as generally threatening progressive values or the emancipation of minoritized groups on the basis of gender or sexuality.",

          "authors": "Samuel L Perry",
          "abstract": "Political knowledge, including knowledge of basic civics and current political conditions, is associated with a host of pro-democratic outcomes including institutional trust and civic and political participation. Religion is also historically associated with these outcomes, yet a link between religion and indicators of political knowledge remains underexamined. Integrating research on religion/secularism and political engagement with work on partisan sorting, I theorize self-consciously secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted politically, will exhibit the strongest grasp on basic civics and current political conditions. Analyses of data from a recent, nationally representative survey affirm my expectations. Self-identified atheists/agnostics consistently score significantly higher than religious or non-affiliated Americans on questions about basic civics and current political conditions. Interactions reveal that education helps most other religious groups catch up to atheists/agnostics on civics knowledge, but not knowledge about current politics. And on knowledge of both basic civics and current politics, atheists/agnostics’ advantage is strongest among liberals and Democrats and disappears among conservatives and Republicans. A similar pattern appears for evangelical Protestants in the opposite direction with their scores on both civics and current politics increasing significantly as they identify more with ideological conservatism, but this does not apply to partisan identity. Findings extend literatures on political knowledge, religious/secular political engagement, and partisan sorting by showing that (1) self-identified secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted, tend to be the most knowledgeable about basic civics and current political conditions, and (2) this pattern is to a weaker extent mirrored by evangelicals, another politicized religious group.",

          "authors": "Berenike Firestone, Ruth Ditlmann, Oguzhan Turkoglu",
          "abstract": "Awareness of past atrocities is widely seen as critical for restoring justice and building resilient democracies. Cultural representations are often deployed by cultural elites to keep the past alive. Yet, we know little about how ordinary citizens respond to them. Through a survey experiment (n = 2198), we measured the effect of three different prototypical cultural representations of the Holocaust on intentions to commemorate the Holocaust, intentions to counter antisemitism, and attitudes towards minoritized groups. We find that all three forms demonstrate overall effectiveness in motivating individuals in support of commemoration and against antisemitism and improving their attitudes towards minoritized groups. We find heterogeneous treatment effects by party affiliation. For far-right supporters, reading about the story of an individual victim is particularly effective. For others, representations that center the sheer extent of atrocities or focus on symbolic justice efforts show a greater effect on action intentions. We repeated the survey with the same respondents three months later (November 2023), following the start of the Israel–Gaza war, and found that means and treatment effects remained overall stable despite the change in context. The results demonstrate the power of cultural representations of historical injustice for motivating people to take action and reducing their prejudice today.",

          "abstract": "This study uses nationally representative data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) to estimate the impact of parental education on children’s cognitive development using a prospective approach. The analysis focuses on a subsample of participants and their first-born children (n = 1,042, aged 3 to 16). Previous research often overlooked selective patterns of childbirth, potentially introducing endogenous selection bias, and did not fully account for genetic confounding in the association between parental education and children’s cognitive outcomes. To address these limitations, we used the BCS70’s multigenerational design and inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighting to correct for nonrandom selection into parenthood and control for confounding parental and grandparental factors. Our findings show that accounting for endogenous selection bias increases the estimated effect of parental education, while adjusting for confounding—primarily driven by parental cognitive ability—substantially reduces this effect. These results underscore the importance of disentangling the effects of parental education from the broader intergenerational factors that shape children’s cognitive outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption, developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking method.",
