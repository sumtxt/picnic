          "authors": "ALBERT CHIU, XINGCHEN LAN, ZIYI LIU, YIQING XU",
          "abstract": "Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced numerous new estimators and procedures, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 studies from leading journals that employ TWFE models for causal inference using observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.",

          "title": "Beyond Retraumatization: Trauma-Informed Political Science Research",
          "authors": "Amanda Weiss",
          "abstract": "Ethics guides for political science instruct researchers to avoid retraumatization of human subjects (for example, APSA 2022; Fujii 2012). Meanwhile, human subject research on sensitive topics, including violence and repression, has increased. This paper clarifies what is at stake when we talk about research participant distress and provides recommendations for handling concerns about trauma and retraumatization. It offers a new framework for trauma-informed political science research. This framework reflects the conclusions of the empirical literature on the risk of distress in different research settings as well as critical normative perspectives on consequentialist research ethics. In particular, it identifies two approaches for trauma-informed political science research: one for research in less vulnerable contexts and one for research with contexts that are vulnerable in terms of limited resources, ongoing suffering, and/or geopolitical instability. The framework details best practices for informed consent, debriefing, and more within each approach. The paper also addresses the special challenges of political violence research. While the literature suggests that retraumatization as such is rarely a major risk of research, the paper highlights that a narrowly defined concept of retraumatization can lead us to neglect other trauma-informed concerns.",

          "authors": "Taehee Whang, Young Jun Choi, Wooseon Choi, Hyung-min Joo",
          "abstract": "Since the collapse of the command economy in the 1990s, North Korea has experienced profound changes driven by bottom-up marketization. This paper examines the impact of informal marketization on “social capital” (defined as shared norms and social networks) in North Korea. Our study investigates whether and to what extent the shadow economy has influenced social capital in the region. We gathered data through a survey of 1309 defectors, interviews with approximately 100 defectors, and in-depth interviews with 24 former high-ranking North Korean officials. Both quantitative tests and qualitative analyses indicate a significant transformation of social capital in North Korea. The traditional “old” social capital, which was previously centered around official workplaces, has diminished. In its place, a “new” social capital has emerged, primarily revolving around marketplaces in recent years. The shadow economy has been instrumental in fostering this new type of social capital, influencing both the “bonding” (shared norms) and “bridging” (social networks) aspects. Despite the emergence of a new social capital facilitated by bottom-up marketization, its evolution into a civil society remains uncertain due to two critical limitations: a lack of both civic engagement and social autonomy.",

          "abstract": "How does an authoritarian donor’s domestic political economy shape its aid practices? We probe into the case of China, the largest authoritarian donor in the world, and contend that the logic of regime survival drives China’s aid policies to prioritize commercial interests and sustain the state capitalism model. By leveraging multiple data sources, we employ a difference-in-differences design and conduct our analysis at the country, industry, firm, and product levels. We empirically document that Chinese aid projects lead to a substantial surge of Chinese exports to aid recipient countries, generating large revenues primarily for Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In particular, the aid-induced trade benefits are concentrated among SOEs with low performance and large employment. Our analysis also rules out decreased trade costs, favorable trade terms, and the product price difference between SOEs and private firms as alternative explanations.",

          "abstract": "Radical parties’ electoral surge has intensified debates about their inclusion in government coalitions. This article presents the most extensive analysis of ministry allocation to date, covering data from 555 coalitions from 33 OECD countries since World War II. While Gamson’s Law suggests coalition participants receive ministries proportional to their parliamentary seats, both coalition formation theory and ministry allocation theory imply that radicalism weakens bargaining power. Additionally, empirical research links radical parties to prioritisation of policy payoffs. I propose a theoretical model distinguishing between types of radicalism, identifying distinct mechanisms leading to ministry undercompensation. My findings show that radical parties systematically receive fewer ministries, primarily due to reduced bargaining power rather than because of payoff preferences. Moreover, I demonstrate that the factors facilitating coalition entry are closely linked to those shaping ministry allocation. Using selection bias-robust modeling, this study offers new insights into the constraints radical parties face in government formation.",

          "abstract": "Political scientists confront serious ethical dilemmas when deciding whether and how to compensate research participants, without clear disciplinary guidelines or shared norms. Our paper presents a systematic framework for developing and refining compensation plans and contributes to the political methodology and research ethics literature. The analysis draws on published methodological and empirical research across subfields, and the authors’ original data collection in a range of political regimes across urban and rural contexts in the Global North and Global South. We argue that researchers must confront seven types of compensation decisions, and we detail specific criteria that should guide their choices. We highlight the wide range of monetary and non-monetary compensation options available to researchers and offer strategies to navigate complex ethical dilemmas. Our findings demonstrate the value of contextual knowledge and relationships when creating and updating compensation plans and offer researchers a rigorous framework to guide difficult ethical compensation choices.",

          "authors": "Kai M. Thaler",
          "abstract": "Why do some victorious rebels invest in statebuilding and public goods, while others prioritize private enrichment? I theorize that post-victory governance is rooted in rebels’ pre-victory ideologies, distinguishing between rebels’ ideologies on two dimensions: how much they aim to transform society (programmatic or opportunistic) and the proportion of the population they wish to benefit (inclusive or exclusive). Programmatic transformation and delivering inclusive benefits require building infrastructural power and expanding state reach, while opportunistic use of power for exclusive, private gains does not necessitate non-coercive power. Fieldwork-based case studies of three victorious rebel organizations—the more programmatic-inclusive FSLN in Nicaragua, the more opportunistic-exclusive NPFL in Liberia, and the middle-ground NRM in Uganda—provide support for the theory, and the conclusion addresses implications for scholarship and policy.",

          "authors": "Antonio Postigo",
          "abstract": "Firms in production networks often favor liberalization through free trade agreements (FTAs) over multilateral liberalization because of its potential discriminatory effects against firms outside the FTA, but also, as this article explores, relative to competing firms within the FTA area. The selectivity and flexibility inherent in FTA liberalization accommodate heterogeneity among firms in trade preferences, incentivizing them to lobby individually for specific FTA design configurations aligned with their particular production organizations. This article theorizes how the interaction between two variables—(1) inter-firm heterogeneity in production organization and (2) asymmetric liberalization through FTA design configurations—determines heterogeneity in FTA utilization among firms, favoring some over others within the trade area. These arguments are examined in the context of the Thai automotive industry and the FTAs signed by Thailand with other Southeast Asian countries, Japan, India, and Australia, drawing on interviews and administrative records. The empirical evidence supports the explanatory power of these variables in accounting for inter-firm heterogeneity in trade preferences, lobbying patterns, and FTA utilization. Automakers lobbied for FTA configurations that selectively liberalize their trade flows relative to competitors within the trade area, primarily using FTAs for hierarchical and captive cross-border input trade with subsidiaries and long-term suppliers.",

          "abstract": "Who files petitions against repressive regimes in the United Nations? Victims of human rights abuse face high personal costs of participation, including retaliation from the government against whom they are filing a complaint. There is also a significant information barrier. Despite these costs, several hundred petitions (or complaints) have been filed against repressive governments in just one United Nations treaty body. I frame filing international petitions as a form of antiregime mobilization; if mistreated, political individuals and organizations file petitions as a part of their broader mobilization efforts to improve human rights. This article introduces individual-level data of individuals who file complaints in the United Nations. I find there are two main categories of petitioners: (1) individuals with prior political involvement and (2) individuals represented by civil society organizations. This dataset includes identities of individuals, involvement of legal representation, specific rights under contestation, and other identifying individual characteristics. These data on individuals who overcome high costs help improve our understanding of broader processes of mobilization, both domestic and international.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how natural disasters impact ongoing civil wars is increasingly important as more extreme weather events are expected due to climate change. Existing literature suggests that there is substantial unexplained variation in the consequences of natural disasters for conflict. I present a theoretical model, which provides insights into how the pre-disaster spatial configuration of territorial control can moderate the impact of natural disasters on conflict dynamics. Investigating these insights empirically, I introduce a new measure of natural disasters based on precipitation data, which improves geographical precision and mitigates endogeneity concerns in existing literature. Using the ongoing civil war between the New People’s Army (NPA) and the Philippine government as a testing ground, results show that the impact of natural disasters on both shifts in territorial control and battle-related violence varies by the pre-disaster spatial configuration of territorial control.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge when surveying political elites is recruitment. Low response rates can lead to biased samples and underpowered designs, threatening the validity of descriptive and experimental scholarship. In a randomized control trial, we test the effects of sending postal invitations in a large survey of local elected officials. We find that German and UK local politicians are more likely to complete the survey if invited by postal mail, rather than simply by email. Recruitment mode does not impact the quality of responses but shapes the population of local officials recruited. Officials invited via postal letter were more likely to come from smaller municipalities and less likely to have a college degree. Costs per response are relatively high but can be reduced as we learn more about selection into elite surveys.",

          "abstract": "How can states credibly commit to peace and assure other countries? One source of credible assurance identified in previous studies is the cost to a state’s international reputation. When a state violates a prior commitment to peace, it suffers reputational damage, which can be costly in various ways. These reputational costs, in turn, serve as a tying-hands signal that enhances the credibility of peaceful commitments. Nonetheless, empirical research on whether and under what conditions such reputation costs arise remains limited. To address this gap, this study conducts a preregistered survey experiment in the United States, using a hypothetical scenario involving military buildups by China and Japan. The results indicate that violating commitments to peace undermines the credibility of future commitments, particularly when the violator is a rival country. These findings suggest that, with some limitations, international reputation costs can serve as a reliable mechanism for ensuring the credibility of assurances.",

          "abstract": "This article examines global trends in organized violence based on new data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). In 2024, the number of state-based armed conflicts rose from 59 to 61, marking the second consecutive year in which the UCDP recorded a historically high number of conflicts. The number of wars increased from nine to 11, the highest count since 2016. The UCDP recorded marginal declines in both state-based fatalities and organized violence as a whole. In contrast, one-sided violence saw a sharp increase, driven primarily by escalating attacks by Islamic State in Africa and widespread killings by non-state actors in Haiti. Non-state conflict declined, both in the number of active conflicts and in total fatalities. In total, the UCDP recorded almost 160,000 deaths in organized violence in 2024. The article also addresses challenges in the classification of casualties, highlighting how limitations in data quality and information access contribute to uncertainty around the civilian-to-combatant fatality ratio. These challenges are particularly acute in cases of organized crime violence, in which the distinction between civilians and combatants is often blurred, and in which indiscriminate types of warfare, such as artillery and aerial bombardment, are used in urban settings.",

          "abstract": "Does the legacy of women’s participation in non-state armed groups impact women’s post-war political representation? Existing research suggests that women’s inclusion in rebel groups is typically a short-term strategy, creating logistical and tactical advantages without commitment to long-term gendered change. Relatedly, after wars, patriarchal backlash can close the space for women, limiting their newfound political access. This paper argues that despite the incentives to leave women behind, the political parties evolving out of rebel groups (‘rebel parties’) continue practices of women’s inclusion to capture the continued benefits of their representation after war. I argue that the legacies of women’s roles will have symbolic effects on the rebel party’s recruitment of women, women’s candidate emergence, and voter support for women. I present novel data on women’s representation in rebel parties from 1970 to 2020 and find that rebel parties run and elect more women post-conflict when rebels had women wartime participants. I show that these results are consistent across the types of roles that women held during conflict and over time. These findings underscore the wartime legacies of rebel parties and show how women’s wartime contributions affect their post-war political standing.",

Specifically, we contend that Black legislators who attended HBCUs are more likely than their non‐HBCU Black colleagues to represent co‐racial political interests, perhaps because of the cultural and institutional environments unique to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Using an original dataset of over 18,000 congressional bills introduced across the 114th through the 116th Congresses, we find that Black legislators who attended HBCUs are more likely to introduce bills for Black communities relative to co‐racial legislators who attended other higher education institutions.

However, much of what scholars know about delegation is gleaned from an exclusive focus on landmark legislation. We introduce a method to identify delegating language across a larger universe of legislation. Using an active learning convolutional neural network on bill text, we classify bill sections by their delegation content, applying an iteratively improving coding scheme that enhances existing supervised learning approaches. We develop a novel dataset that allows us to answer important questions about interbranch relations. First, we find that legislator ideology, partisanship, and institutional position affect the delegatory content of introduced legislation. We then explore the role of delegation in the advancement of bills through the legislative process. Finally, we evaluate the ally principle, finding that variation in delegation is driven by cross‐agency differences in ideology and structural independence.",

In this article, we expand this research to understand radical right parties’ environmental issue emphasis and what explains this increasing emphasis. We argue that radical right parties engage in a two-pronged strategy of responsiveness and differentiation on the environment. In response to green parties’ and the public’s increase in environmental salience and green parties’ polling success, radical right parties increase their emphasis on both the environment more generally and on environmental chauvinism, a particular nationalist brand of environmentalism. We demonstrate this using Twitter/X data from radical right parties in Western Europe from 2019 to 2021. These findings have important implications for understanding issue evolution and party competition in the changing party systems of Europe.",

          "authors": "Ian O’Flynn, David Russell",
          "abstract": "Veto rights are a prominent institutional feature in ethnically divided societies, especially power-sharing democracies. Yet while vetoes are intended to protect the vital interests of each ethnic community, they can give rise to serious concerns about political deadlock and instability. In response, we argue that vetoes should be subject to a justificatory test grounded in public reason. On the face of it, one troubling consequence of this approach is that a community’s assessment of its own vital interests cannot be decisive. Yet as we explain, the critical issue is not who should be the arbiter of an interest but the need to be fair to the interests of all concerned. To illustrate how a public reason approach of this sort might be rendered sufficiently specific to be of practical use, we take human rights law as our example. Having considered a number of potential difficulties that this example throws up, we conclude by noting how a justificatory test can help to deliver not just greater political stability but a more democratically progressive form of politics.",

          "authors": "Jennifer M. Welsh, Emily Paddon Rhoads, Juan Masullo",
          "abstract": "Over the last decade, a range of international actors has moved away from direct forms of intervention to protect civilian populations in favor of “bottom-up” approaches that emphasize external support for civilian self-protection (CSP). While this indirect action is often perceived to be less costly, more legitimate, and potentially more effective, we argue that external support for CSP is a “risky business” that presents a significant dilemma for international governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Drawing on literature from sociology, economics, and civil war studies, we conceptualize and categorize the risks of unintended consequences that could accompany external support for CSP and suggest why they are likely to arise in this context. We then empirically explore whether and how these risks manifest with an in-depth study of four purposively selected organizations supporting CSP in their programming. We also assess whether and how organizational type matters for the prevalence of these consequences and how the risk of their occurrence is managed. Our analysis shows that, across a range of conflict settings, all four organizations encountered unintended consequences of three main kinds: increased vulnerability and insecurity for local communities, challenges to organizational mandates and values, and strained relations with key protection stakeholders. International actors supporting CSP thus confront the dilemma of seeking to enhance their effectiveness and legitimacy by “localizing” protection, but potentially create new challenges and perverse effects and/or compromise their organizational identity in the process. While this dilemma is inherent in all external protection assistance, our study highlights the importance of actor embeddedness: organizations that are more proximate to the communities they work with are in a better position to minimize these unintended consequences and manage the risks associated with supporting CSP. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about civilian protection in comparative politics, international relations, and humanitarian studies, but also offer concrete insights for practitioners engaged in support for CSP. More broadly, our study could have implications for other policy areas where the legitimacy of so-called top down approaches is being questioned and where these approaches are giving way to the empowerment of local actors and processes.",

          "abstract": "Labor organizations increasingly rely on political communication campaigns to win broader support from bystanders. How do framings of worker mobilization influence public support for strikers’ demands? This paper explores the effects of different framings of teacher strikes on support for labor unions and strikes in Mexico by employing an original vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey. We find that how strikes are framed alters responses to them. Our treatment effects indicate that mentioning the political interest of union leaders decreases support for unions, while informing voters about teacher grievances increases support for ongoing strikes. Our finding suggests the importance of disaggregating attitudes toward strikes and unions and proposes new avenues for research on how media strategies are used by various actors to gain political leverage during labor conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Thomas Paine’s and Thomas Jefferson’s writings on the relations between generations continue to attract much attention among political theorists and historians of political thought. They have been described as two of the most important theorists of the intergenerational characteristics of rights and of the significance of ascribing “sovereignty” to every generation. Jefferson’s work has often been portrayed as shaping Paine’s thinking on intergenerational obligations. This article contends that such characterizations of Paine misapprehend the development of his thought. By examining previously overlooked writings in Paine’s corpus, it becomes clear that his account of intergenerational rights and obligations was substantially different from Jefferson’s. The supposed parallels between their work obscure more than they illuminate. Indeed, the most interesting arguments Paine offered for reconceiving the capacities of each generation have thereby been neglected. These conceptual resources are worth returning to, especially given that Paine’s and Jefferson’s work on intergenerational relations is often mobilized to theorize a range of contemporary problems from constitutional interpretation to climate change.",

We investigate whether police engage in boundary maintenance at geographic points of racial difference. Critical race scholars suggest that police explicitly serve this function. Yet empirical studies are rare and limited to snapshots of a single city, making it hard to distinguish practices employed across departments from agency- and officer-level idiosyncrasies. We leverage high resolution data on police activity in seven U.S. cities to evaluate how police engage with racial boundaries. We find evidence that police activity is elevated in racial boundary zones relative to non-boundary zones, exceeds observed crime, and that racialized outcomes are as much a product of policing practices as they are of conflict between private citizens. We reorient the study of boundaries around top-down processes that lead to their regulation and identify an agenda for future research.",

          "abstract": "We investigate a bracketing property that purports to yield upper- and lower bounds on the treatment effects obtained from a fixed effects (FE) and lagged dependent variable (LDV) model. Referencing both analytical results and a Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the conditions under which the bracketing property holds, confirming this to be the case when the data generating process (DGP) is characterized by either unobserved heterogeneity or feedback effects from a lagged dependent variable. However, when the DGP is characterized by both features simultaneously, we find that bracketing of the treatment effect only holds under certain conditions—but not in general. Practitioners can nevertheless obtain the lower bound estimate by referencing a model that includes both FE and an LDV. While the Nickell bias in the coefficient of the LDV is known to be of order $1/T$ , we show that the Nickell-type bias in the estimator of the treatment effect is of order $1/T^2$ .",

          "authors": "Jaap van Slageren, Michelle Rosmalen, Hester I. Mennes",
          "abstract": "While democracy is meant for all, not all citizens feel equally confident to participate in it. This sense of confidence, often referred to as political efficacy, is important since it boosts citizens’ engagement with political democracy. The literature on political efficacy shows sharp sociodemographic inequalities in how self-efficacious citizens feel regarding political processes. These differences are already manifesting before adolescents formally take part in political democracy. Yet, there is limited understanding of how these inequalities develop over time and what accounts for these inequalities. In this paper, we analyze panel data among Dutch adolescents during their formative years (ages 12 to 16). The results demonstrate that internal and external political efficacy develop differently during adolescence; while internal political efficacy constantly rises, external political efficacy fluctuates more. In addition, while stark inequalities in internal political efficacy are already visible at age 12, these inequalities are less prominent in external political efficacy. The existing inequalities in internal and external efficacy, however, are substantially diminished by the time adolescents are 16 years old. Furthermore, political conversations with parents and peers correspond with growth in internal political efficacy but do not play a role in external political efficacy. Finally, contrary to our expectations, discussions with teachers play no role in the development of both political efficacy types. Our results show the stark distinct nature of internal and external political efficacy and that we should study them separately. Additionally, the results indicate that the sharp differences among adults are not yet solidified during adolescence.",

          "abstract": "When diversification becomes salient, a sizable share of white Americans experiences status threat and reacts with backlash. In this paper, we argue that status threat arises because white Americans tend to perceive racial minorities as competing outgroups, not as fellow Americans. Building on recent research suggesting that shared American identity primes can reduce partisan conflict, we test whether reminders of a shared American identity may reduce status threat and thus mitigate subsequent backlash. Across four experiments (total N = 4,062), we replicate status threat as the key mechanism between diversification salience and backlash. Despite various American identity primes and accounting for confounding variables, however, we find little indication that a shared American identity could reduce racial (and, in exploratory analyses, partisan) conflict in America. We discuss the implications for future research and the practical use of a shared American identity when little remains that is shared.",

          "abstract": "The highly polarized nature of American politics today has been attributed, in part, to the power of partisanship as a social identity and the increasing alignment of party affiliation, political ideology, and other social identities. The overlap between political and racial identities in particular has been given much attention. The current report compares results from two cross‐categorization studies designed to (a) examine the relative weight of race and political identity in cooperative decision‐making and (b) to explore individual differences in pattern of response as a function of participant's own race and political ideology. Study 1 was a re‐analysis of data reported in an earlier research article by Ugular and colleagues (2023, Experiment 2) and Study 2 was a conceptual replication with some modifications. Results from both studies revealed significant interactions between participant identities and partner characteristics such that the relative effects of partner race and partner political ideology on cooperative behavior differed as a function of the combined racial (Black or White) and political (liberal or conservative) identity of the respondent. Similarities and differences in the pattern of results between the two studies are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of political polarization.",

Through in-person interviews, an online experiment, and survey experiments, we identify and assess an open-ended approach to incorporating respondent-provided gender identity in face-to-face interviews. Our results affirm that the measure is comparatively effective in minimizing discomfort and does not have substantial consequences for data quality across a diverse set of LAC countries. We discuss the potential traveling capacity of our approach and identify paths for further research on best practices in recording interviewee gender in face-to-face surveys in the LAC region and beyond.",

What is found is a rapid spike in the use of words that are unremarkable except for their popularity in ChatGPT’s output as determined by an AI professional. This shows that this method can be used to indicate the likelihood of plagiarism in a given article.

This sexual domination produces and sustains manifold forms of anti-queer violence. As such, the article not only proffers the queering of modernity as a critique of sexuality but also provides an intersectional analysis with raced, classed, and gendered implications.

We developed a new three-step method for elucidating the trade-off between turnout and the representativeness of election results and applied it to a referendum held in the Netherlands in 2018. First, we used regression analysis to decompose election results into the voting preferences of two voter groups: those who voted irrespective of any turnout shock and those who voted because they were affected by the shock. Second, we obtained an estimate of a fully representative counterfactual election result using the results of a survey. Third, we estimated how the exogenous shock affected the representativeness of the election result and analyzed the trade-off between turnout and representativeness.",

          "authors": "Juan Ignacio Martín-Legendre, Paolo Rungo",
          "abstract": "This paper argues that the characteristics of place of residence, be it urban or rural, influence how income inequality translates to political behavior. We build on previous research that posits an inverted U-shaped relationship: Rising inequality initially boosts turnout but ultimately discourages participation. We extend this framework by examining how location influences this association. In low-inequality contexts, the combination of institutional support for mobilization and increased awareness of inequality’s effects in large cities may lead to a steeper rise in turnout compared to small towns. Conversely, small towns may experience a sharper decline in turnout at high inequality levels due to heightened feelings of marginalization and disenfranchisement. Employing a panel data set of Spanish municipalities and an interaction-based regression model, our findings support the inverted U-shaped relationship and the moderating effect of location. Urban areas exhibit a stronger initial positive association between inequality and turnout, while rural areas and smaller cities see a steeper decline at high inequality levels. These results underscore the importance of social and geographical context in understanding the link between inequality and political participation.",

We explain the MLP system’s mechanics, simulate election results based on recent election data, and discuss variants.

          "abstract": "Roe vs. Wade (1973) recognized a constitutional right to abortion under various circumstances and, in doing so, facilitated a political environment in which politicians could endorse more restrictive abortion policies that Roe prohibited. Indeed, many states enacted “trigger” laws that would only carry the force of law if Roe were overturned. The Supreme Court in Dobbs vs. Jackson (2022) removed the constitutional right to abortion, ending a situation in which this type of position taking lacked policy consequences and creating an environment in Republican-led states where many policies seemingly contrast with public opinion. To investigate potential sources of support for a variety of types of restrictions, we analyze an original survey of over 7,500 verified donors, 1,500 affluent individuals, and 1,000 members of the general public conducted in 2019–2020. The most extreme restrictions, such as bans with no rape exception, are not popular with Republicans in the aggregate from any of the three groups—Republican donors, affluent individuals, or voters—but they are supported by the small and potentially influential group of highly religious Republicans who report that abortion is one of their most important issues.",
