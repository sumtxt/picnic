          "authors": "Holly Jean Buck, Prerna Shah, Janet Z. Yang",
          "abstract": "Climate anxiety and climate distress are receiving growing attention as psychological conditions that deserve individual interventions, but potential social and structural drivers of these conditions warrant further study. Is there a relationship between climate anxiety and climate doom, and social media use? If so, what are the collective social and political implications of this? These questions matter for developing effective interventions in climate anxiety and climate doom on the individual, psychological level as well as the broader social level. If climate doom is related to support for authoritarian policies or extremist action, this presents an understudied risk for how we communicate about climate. We explore these questions in a survey of US adults ( N = 1,400) and find that social media use correlates with increased climate distress and climate doom. We find that climate doom, but not climate distress, is associated with support for radical actions such as sabotage, threatening CEOs, and hacking fossil fuel cyberinfrastructure. Together, these results suggest a need for further research into both the role of social media in climate anxiety interventions and the broader social and political implications of climate doom.",

          "authors": "Ondřej Císař, Veronika Frantová, Michal Kolmaš, Eva Hejzlarová, Karel Čada, Lucie Němcová",
          "abstract": "Mini-publics, including citizen panels, assemblies, and juries are increasingly being used as a way to build a bridge between elite level politics and ordinary citizens, especially on divisive and complex issues such as climate change. While previous studies have illustrated the effectiveness and usefulness of these settings in political deliberation, much less attention has been paid to how outcomes are formed within these settings. We seek to fill this gap by inductively theorizing the process of deliberation within mini-publics. Building on the Citizen-Expert Panels that we organized in three Czech cities, we identified six types of processes that advance specific outcomes within mini-publics: consensus-building, discussion, balance of power, imposition, dissent, and domination. We show that there are two key factors around which these processes materialize: emotions and leadership. Identifying the modalities of mini-publics allows us to observe a wider range of interaction patterns beyond the usual dichotomy of consensus and conflict and contributes to the growing interest in mini-publics as a form of political deliberation.",

Here we investigated the effects of polylactic acid contamination in marine ecosystems by assessing its degradation over time in an experimental mesocosm, along with its impact on microbial abundance, microbiome diversity, viral infections, and rates of organic matter cycling. We report here that, as polylactic acid gradually lost its integrity, a microbial biofilm rich in Marinobacter sp. developed on the biopolymer, reshaping the marine microbiome, promoting polylactic acid-associated bacteria such as the Saccharospirillaceae, and in turn increasing viral activity and accelerating the degradation of organic matter. These effects, which were further amplified at the temperatures experienced during heatwaves, suggest that high levels of polylactic acid contamination might influence the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems, particularly during extreme temperature episodes.",

          "abstract": "Earthquake stress drop (Δσ) may increase with depth and stress in the brittle lithosphere. However, the range of uncertainty in Δσ and the lack of constraints on absolute stress make it difficult to establish whether they are correlated. Here, we investigate Δσ dependence on depth and maximum shear stress ( τ max ) based on ~11 years of seismicity in the northeastern Japanese forearc following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki megathrust earthquake. We interpret Δσ estimates computed using both individual spectra and spectral-ratio methods and find that Δσ exhibits a clear depth dependence within the seismically active upper ~60 km of the forearc lithosphere ( ~ 0.8 MPa per 10 km). We further compare Δσ values with quantitative τ max estimates from finite-element models of force balance. We find that median Δσ values increase with τ max in the brittle forearc lithosphere and that earthquake stress release is proportional to τ max . The dependence of Δσ on τ max explains the apparent depth dependence of Δσ and suggests that average Δσ values provide a relative measure of the stress at failure. In the northeastern Japanese forearc, Δσ values remained roughly constant in the decade following the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, suggesting negligible changes in failure stress in the forearc since the mainshock.",

          "abstract": "Passenger aviation carbon footprint calculators often lack breadth, accuracy, transparency, and communication effectiveness, leading to underestimations of environmental impact and mistrust. This study addresses these gaps by developing a comprehensive methodology that broadens scope and improves accuracy. It incorporates nitrogen oxides, water vapour, contrail-induced cloudiness, upstream emissions from in-flight services, and life cycle emissions from aircraft and airports, offering a complete carbon footprint assessment. Accuracy is improved through detailed modelling of flight distance, fuel consumption, and emissions allocation adjusted for passenger class, luggage, and cargo. Historical adjustment factors refine pre-flight estimates by integrating real-world variations. The tool outputs a full emissions breakdown by source, offering unparalleled granularity and clarity. Validated against over 30,000 historical flights, the historical adjustment factor model achieves ~0.5% mean squared percentage error and shows current methods underestimate emissions. This study sets a standard for aviation carbon footprint calculators by enabling transparent, dynamic assessments for industry stakeholders.",

          "authors": "Chaohui Li, Prajal Pradhan, Guoqian Chen, Jürgen P. Kropp, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber",
          "abstract": "Achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals of holding global temperature rise well below 2 °C with efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C requires rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The built environment embodies substantial emissions, posing a challenge to meeting these goals. We quantify the carbon cost of constructing the global built-environment over the past three decades and project it to 2050. Our findings indicate that the global construction carbon footprint has doubled over the past three decades and is projected to more than double by 2050. In 2022, over half of the construction industry’s carbon emissions stemmed from cementitious materials, bricks, and metals, while glass, plastics, chemicals, and bio-based materials contributed 6%, and the remaining 37% arose from transport, services, machinery, and on-site activities. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the construction carbon footprint alone will exceed the per-annum carbon budget for the 1.5 °C and 2 °C goals in the next two decades. It will use up all remaining carbon budget for the 1.5 °C goal by 2050, as our analysis highlights. Therefore, we advocate for a material revolution, such as replacing traditional materials with biobased materials, which leverages economies of scale and paves the way for a transformative and sustainable future in construction.",

          "authors": "Wei Qi, Yanpeng Cai, Qian Tan, Xingxing Kuang, Junguo Liu, Deliang Chen",
          "abstract": "Flood hazards across High Mountain Asia present pronounced complexity due to the combined influence of rainfall, meltwater, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The eastern Himalayan Brahmaputra basin is a critical hotspot of this integrated risk. However, a basin-wide quantification of the individual contributions of these drivers to flood exposure has been lacking. Here, we employ a calibrated coupled hydrological-hydraulic model to provide the first comprehensive assessment. We show that meltwater (snow and glacier melt) contributions to annual maximum floods increase with altitude. At the basin scale, meltwater amplifies population and gross domestic product (GDP) exposure to flooding by 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. This amplification rises dramatically to 27.9% for population and 33.3% for GDP in high-altitude regions (≥2000 m). Rainfall-derived discharge constitutes the dominant source of flood exposure, followed by meltwater; GLOFs present the least contribution. Nonetheless, GLOFs increase basin-wide population and GDP exposure by 1.2% and 1.3%, and notably intensify to 31.1% and 33.5% above 2000 m. Our findings deliver critical insights for developing targeted flood management strategies in the Brahmaputra basin.",

          "authors": "Eszter Szedlacsek",
          "abstract": "In Sub-Saharan Africa, climate policies without progressive redistribution risk exacerbating poverty, potentially undermining the achievement of SDG1 (No Poverty) while striving to meet Paris Agreement goals. The concept of 'just transitions,' which integrates both environmental and social interventions, is essential for advancing climate and poverty reduction objectives. Both climate change impacts and climate action may exacerbate existing inequalities, underscoring the urgency of addressing both environmental and social justice concerns. Equally, developmental aspirations may threaten to aggravate environmentally detrimental patterns. To this end, the paper examines how domestic efforts balance climate and poverty priorities in the governance of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It develops a conceptual framework that links the governance of climate and poverty to justice outcomes within the global political economic context, using the illustrative case of Kenya. Kenya presents a compelling case due to its relevance to the conceptual framework amidst high dependence on climate-sensitive economic sectors; aspirations both to act as a climate leader and reach middle-income status; and its high financial dependence on development partners and transnational capital. By connecting political economy dynamics to justice outcomes, the framework contributes to a deeper understanding of governance efforts that aim to link climate and poverty objectives but do not necessarily deliver a just transition. Through the case of Kenya, the paper illustrates the challenges and opportunities faced by Sub-Saharan African countries in managing the interdependence between climate and poverty reduction objectives, contributing to ongoing debates on just transitions in the global South.",

Using an enhanced version of the Global Change Analysis Model, we simulate reductions of within-region income inequality that allow for narrowing differences in energy and food demand across deciles by 2050 in a Paris-compliant world. The energy demand increase by lower-income consumers is greater than the decline in demand by wealthier and more satiated income groups, leading to an overall rise in total demand. Nevertheless, the projected higher energy demand in the proposed more egalitarian societies only slightly increases the regional carbon prices and mitigation costs associated with the emission targets, therefore posing minimal impact on the achievement of the existing portfolio of climate pledges.&amp;#xD;",

          "abstract": "The increasing frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events driven by climate change poses challenges for flood risk management. In this study, we use a high-resolution, convection-permitting (CPM) ensemble from the UK Climate Projections (UKCP) Local dataset to explore how the spatiotemporal characteristics of heavy rainfall events may evolve across the UK. Adopting an event-based framework, we analyse 5km hourly rainfall data from 12 ensemble members and compare changes in future rainfall events to those derived from applying intensity-based scaling factors alone. This comparison allows us to identify aspects of rainfall change that are not captured by shifts in intensity distributions. Our results show that short-duration winter events become increasingly localised, with peak intensities increasing by up to 47%, amplifying flash flood potential. In summer, rainfall events exhibit expanded spatial extents – expanding by 25-40% - magnifying total precipitation volumes. While we find small changes in the number of clustered events (i.e. heavy rainfall events that occur within a 21-day window), there are large changes to the contribution these have to seasonal precipitation, particularly in summer (7-11% in the baseline to 11-16% in future period). These findings highlight new insights into how heavy rainfall may change under future climate conditions, identifying aspects of change beyond intensity increases alone that are relevant for informing current practice for flood risk estimation.",

          "authors": "Xuejing Leng, Xiaoming Feng, Bojie Fu",
          "abstract": "Grasslands cover over 50% of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP), playing a critical role in water conservation, soil retention, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and supporting pastoral livelihoods. Due to the high-altitude and cold-climate conditions, the QTP is highly vulnerable to climate change. Understanding the relative importance of the drivers of grassland degradation is essential for developing adaptive management strategies. While numerous studies have explored these drivers, the impacts of large-scale ecological restoration efforts since 2000, particularly across different grassland types and degradation-recovery phases, remain underexplored. This study analyzes 40 years of grassland vegetation dynamics on the QTP, identifying key inflection points and classifying regions into four ‘degradation-restoration’ trajectory types. The effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers across distinct temporal phases are quantified. The results indicate that 6.56% of grasslands are in continuous degradation, while 28.97% are at risk of potential degradation risk. Drought and grazing emerge as the primary drivers of vegetation change, while restoration and afforestation programs play a significant role in enhancing recovery. Our findings underscore the spatiotemporal variability of grassland responses and emphasize the need for targeted grazing management and integrated water resource planning to optimize restoration outcomes. This study provides a framework for differentiated grassland management in the face of climate change and human pressures on the QTP.",

          "abstract": "The dramatic impacts of global climate change have driven marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) innovation, including ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), in an attempt to keep global warming under 2 °C. We conducted a laboratory experiment to assess the impacts of brucite inspired alkalinity addition (BIAA) as an OAE approach on the carbonate chemistry, biogeochemistry, and composition of the Santa Barbara Channel phytoplankton community sourced from a spring upwelling event. The BIAA treatment used MgCl 2 * 6H 2 O and NaOH to yield a total alkalinity (TA) concentration of ~3000 µmol/kg, in contrast with the untreated seawater controls (TA = ~2300 µmol/kg). Our results suggest that BIAA altered the phytoplankton community composition, including reduced contribution of diatoms and enhanced numbers of Prymnesiophyceae (coccolithophores and Phaeocystis sp.). These results are in agreement with observations that biogenic silica content was lower under BIAA treatment. While the concentration of particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) was consistently higher compared to controls, these differences were not statistically significant. Results revealed no differences between control and BIAA treatment in particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) concentrations. The proxy for cellular photosynthetic health (F v /F m ) revealed that cells were photosynthetically healthy for both control and BIAA treatments, but values were lower in the BIAA treatment at the beginning of the exponential phase. While statistical power limitations of laboratory results might restrict applicability to other systems, our overall results suggest that BIAA has a differential impact on phytoplankton functional groups and their biogeochemical performance.",

          "authors": "James Carruthers, Hayley J Fowler, Daniel Bannister, Selma Guerreiro",
          "abstract": "Although precipitation increases have been observed in different areas of the globe and at various temporal resolutions, changes in precipitation can be difficult to detect and attribute to anthropogenic forcing in observational records due to the significant influence of natural variability. Here, we quantify the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation variability on total winter precipitation for Europe using dynamical adjustment with synoptic-scale weather patterns. Variability in atmospheric dynamics, through frequency changes in weather patterns, is shown to be a significant driver of observed wetting and drying trends, linked to observed trends in the North Atlantic jet stream. After removing dynamical variability, trends emerge in non-dynamical winter precipitation which are attributable to anthropogenic forcing: a north-south signal of a drying Mediterranean and increasingly wetter mid-to-high latitudes. Although this spatial pattern is well-represented by CMIP6 models, the magnitude of observed changes is approximately 23 years ahead of the CMIP6 multi-model mean predictions. Our results suggest that current adaptation strategies, based on multi-model means, may underestimate the nearterm risk of climate-related hazards, and therefore require critical re-evaluation.",

          "abstract": "To limit global warming below 1.5–2°C, 140+ countries pledged carbon neutrality. However, many less-developed countries and regions face economic constraints and often suffer from severe ecosystem degradation, which jointly hinder their ability to meet these commitments. Here, we used the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a less-developed region that has experienced ecosystem degradation, as a case study. Using a novel multi-scenario modelling framework to assess the impact of different combinations between natural climate solutions (NCS) and carbon emission reduction policies (CERP) on carbon neutrality and associated costs. Our findings show that carbon neutrality was achieved on the QTP by 2020, with a surplus of 18.16 MtCO₂/yr. However, without CERP, carbon emissions on the QTP are projected to increase fivefold by 2060 compared to 2020 levels. Even with stringent NCS, nearly 375.34±99.05 MtCO2/yr shortfall in maintaining carbon neutrality remains in 2060. If CERP are implemented without NCS, the cost of maintaining carbon neutrality in 2060 is estimated at US$ 199.07±25.96 billion during 2020-2060. Notably, integrating NCS with CERP reduces costs by nearly half (US$ 111.51±21.48 billion). Furthermore, the integration of aggressive CERP and NCS on the QTP could contribute more additional surplus by 2060 toward national carbon neutrality goals at pretty lower carbon price. Our research highlights that combining NCS with CERP yields greater climate benefits at significantly lower costs, providing potential pathways for financially constrained regions to enhance climate mitigation, especially when supported by international climate finance and cooperative mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Current air quality monitoring through the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) network faces significant coverage gaps particularly in vulnerable communities that experience disproportionate exposure to air pollutants. While satellite instruments provide extensive geographic coverage for monitoring tropospheric ozone (O 3 ) precursors, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and formaldehyde (HCHO), these space-based measurements cannot replace ground-based observations for an accurate assessment of air quality conditions near the surface. Attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for tropospheric O 3 is determined using surface measurements rather than satellite-derived column values. Using the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping (EJScreen) demographic and health variables, we identify underserved counties, those that lack adequate ambient air quality monitoring. We present a comprehensive method for optimizing AQS site placement by integrating satellite data from NASA's TEMPO instrument, demographic indicators, and population density. We introduce the Integrated AQS Placement Index (IIAP), which combines normalized demographic overlap, satellite-measured HCHO or NO 2 column values, and population density to prioritize future monitoring locations. Our analysis reveals significant monitoring gaps in the Eastern and Southeastern United States, notably in the \"isoprene volcano\" region, as well as clusters along the I-95 corridor in the Northeast. These areas are characterized by high population, high concentrations of HCHO, which is an under-monitored carcinogen, and vulnerable demographic profiles. We identify existing AQS sites that could benefit from expanded species monitoring as an economical approach to comprehensive coverage. This research underscores the critical need for proactive policies in air quality monitoring to address disparities and ensure that resources are allocated to protect the most vulnerable populations.",

          "abstract": "Fires have a significant impact on the regional carbon budget, the ecosystem, and public health. We analyzed the fire dynamics and its impact on carbon flux across three fire prone regions in South Asia, Region-1 (southwestern Nepal, Uttarakhand), Region-2 (central India), and Region-3 (northeast India) from 2010 to 2021, with a focus on the significant fire season of February, March, and April (FMA) of 2021. We find high burned areas (5,000-10,000 km 2 ), and fire carbon emissions (0.3-4 TgC season –1 ) across these regions in FMA, 2021, as compared to a climatological mean from 2010–2020. Each of the three regions shows distinct drivers that preceded the fires. In Region-1, snow-induced soil moisture deficits drive fire activity, leading to a subsequent decline in gross primary production (GPP). In Region-2, human activities, likely cropland burning, contributed to the forest fire. In Region-3, the scattered distribution of burned areas hints that human activity is the likely cause of the forest fire. During FMA, 2021, fire carbon emission in Region-1 (~4 TgC) were almost twice of the fossil fuel emissions (~2.2 TgC), while in Region-2 (~3.8 TgC), it remained below fossil fuel emissions (~16 TgC). In both regions, emissions from forests and croplands contributed equally to the total fire carbon emissions. In Region-3, fire carbon emissions exceeded fossil fuel emissions in 2012 (~4.7 TgC), 2013 (~6.18 TgC), and 2014 (~9.75 TgC) but remained lower in 2021 (~3.37 TgC), with most emissions originating from forests. This analysis highlights the critical role of forest fires in the carbon budget, the ecosystem and the need for better forest carbon management.",

          "authors": "Philip Zylstra, David B Lindenmayer",
          "abstract": "Forest communities that have a positive flammability feedback to fire can enter a ‘landscape trap’ if disturbance levels are too frequent. It is not known whether this landscape trap constitutes an alternative stable state, or whether a forest can return to its original state when disturbance levels are reduced. Here, we examine a likely landscape trap caused by the frequent burning of a 528,343 ha forest environment in Australia and previously shown to have a positive fire-flammability feedback. We ask whether the now flammable landscape can be returned to its original low-flammability state, or if the transition is irreversible in the warming climate. Using site-specific empirical models of biophysical and climatic influences on fire frequency, we predict fire frequency up to the year 2100 for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways in the context of different management approaches. A warming climate primarily increased wildfire area in our study area by increasing the frequency of synoptic changes, likely reflecting increased rates of escape from suppression firing efforts. Declining winter rainfall had the opposite effect, reducing wildfire area consistent with trends in other seasonally dry environments. The overall effect of warming was therefore a small but significant increase in wildfire area that was more severe under higher GHG emission scenarios. In contrast, removing prescribed burning and incentives for suppression firing had an effect size 2-5 times larger than did the increasing emissions scenarios, demonstrating that the landscape trap was reversible even under the worst-case emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). Correcting fire management policies immediately reduced annual fire area by 87%, of which 77% was prescribed fire, and 43% of the remaining wildfire proportion was a byproduct of the two policies. This allowed forests to escape their flammable age range, reversing a landscape trap. Our study is the first to demonstrate that such states are reversible.",

          "authors": "Meiqiutong Ma, Tim Li, Pangchi Hsu, Yan Zhu, Dong Guo",
          "abstract": "The Maritime Continent (MC), a critical region for Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagation, is also a global hotspot for biomass burning aerosol emissions. While the barrier effect on MJO propagation over the MC is well documented, the role of aerosols in this process and its underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. Combining observations, reanalysis datasets and moisture budget diagnostics, this study demonstrates that absorbing aerosols from El Niño-enhanced wildfires significantly modulate MJO eastward propagation. During the boreal autumn (August-November), the peak season for aerosol loading, El Niño-induced subsidence over the MC exacerbates regional dryness and promotes widespread wildfires, further elevating aerosol concentrations. To isolate the aerosol impact from El Niño effects, we classified the MJO events under high-and low-aerosol conditions while controlling for similar Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Composite analyses reveal that the high aerosol loads disrupt the propagation of MJO convective envelopes, whereas MJO sustains eastward propagation under low-aerosol conditions. Mechanistically, enhanced shortwave absorption by elevated aerosols induces a boundary layer cold anomaly that suppresses low-level convergence, while simultaneous heating of the lower-to-mid troposphere enhances atmospheric stability. This combined thermal and thermodynamic effect weakens boundary layer moisture anomalies, inhibiting the development of shallow convection east of the MJO deep convection that is essential for sustained propagation. The findings highlight the overlooked role of MC aerosols in the MJO barrier effect via aerosol-radiation-convection interactions, suggesting that improved representation of aerosols in climate models may enhance MJO predictability.",

          "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a critical natural nitrogen input that sustains terrestrial carbon cycling, yet it remains poorly represented in terrestrial ecosystem models. Here, we refine the nitrogen cycle representation in a terrestrial ecosystem model by incorporating free-living and symbiotic nitrogen fixation processes along with atmospheric nitrogen deposition effects. Our updated model provides a new assessment of present-day and future global natural ecosystem biological nitrogen fixation rates and their spatial distribution. We estimate that present-day (1981 - 2020) free-living nitrogen fixation contributes to 36 Tg N yr⁻¹, ranging from 33 to 38.5 Tg N yr⁻¹ and symbiotic nitrogen fixation is 88 Tg N yr⁻¹ with a range of 80–95 Tg N yr⁻¹, resulting in a total BNF 124 Tg N yr–1, ranging from 112 to 134 Tg N yr⁻¹. Under the SSP5-8.5 warming scenario, our projections indicate that total BNF could increase to 178 Tg N yr⁻¹ by the end of the 21st century. Our model results highlight that the free-living nitrogen fixation plays a dominant role in low-temperature environments, and plant functional type emerges as the primary factor for both symbiotic and free-living nitrogen fixation pathways, thus precise global vegetation classification is highly necessary for N2 fixation simulation. Our refined model advances global nitrogen cycle modeling and will improve future quantification of both global carbon and nitrogen cycles.",

          "abstract": "Amid accelerating urbanization and severe biodiversity loss in global drylands, reconciling urbanization with habitat conservation is crucial for sustainable development. Focused on China’s Loess Plateau (LP), a typical arid to semi-arid region, this study quantified the dual effects of urbanization on both the size and quality of natural habitats (NHs) from 1990 to 2050 by multi-scenario land cover simulations with the SD-PLUS model, combining landscape indices and habitat quality (HQ) analysis. The study revealed that urbanization directly consumed 3,470 km2 of NHs and indirectly resulted in the loss of 4,706.4 km2 between 1990 and 2020. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, direct and indirect NHs losses are projected to increases of 7.75 and 7.39 times respectively, from 2020 to 2050. Nevertheless, LP’s landscape pattern exhibited an optimizing trend: the increasing Aggregation Index of urban patches, coupled with an enhanced Largest Patch Index for forests and grasslands, indicates that intensified urbanization can mitigate the disordered encroachment on NHs, reduce landscape fragmentation, and preserve larger and more contiguous habitat patches, thereby improving overall HQ. The LP case demonstrates urbanization and NHs conservation are not inherently antagonistic; well-planned urbanization can catalyse NHs protection. We further proposed strategies including spatially concentrated urbanization to advance sustainable urbanization and enhance HQ, fostering synergies between social progress and ecological preservation in global arid regions.",

          "authors": "Peter Dauvergne, Hamish van der Ven",
          "abstract": "Eco-anxiety is surging as environmental crises escalate. As the ecopsychology literature reveals, the effects and intensity of eco-anxiety vary across cultures, circumstances, and personality types. Eco-anxiety can prompt some people to disengage from environmentalism and can even become a debilitating disorder. Yet, high eco-anxiety also correlates with pro-environmental lifestyle choices, increased participation in environmental collective action, and a spirit of resistance. In this Forum article, we consider the implications of eco-anxiety for global environmental politics (GEP) and argue that it can be harnessed to create positive change. Historically, periods of heightened environmental concern have preceded GEP milestones. Eco-anxiety may now be contributing to a resurgence of youth advocacy, grassroots activism, and direct-action environmentalism. Such trends highlight potentially positive influences of eco-anxiety on GEP, although further research is needed to disentangle the sociocultural dimensions and subemotions of eco-anxiety and determine how these can be productively harnessed within GEP.",

          "authors": "Eszter Szedlacsek",
          "abstract": "Aligning the implementation of climate efforts under the Paris Agreement with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is essential to ensuring socially just green transitions. Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, national approaches to green transitions vary widely, particularly in how they integrate poverty reduction into climate action. Prevailing theories of policy integration frame such variation as a function of effective institutional and policy design. I advance an alternative explanation: that integration outcomes are shaped by contestations in rule- and norm-setting processes within a fragmented global environmental governance structure. I probe the plausibility of this argument by studying the co-constitutive interplay of structure and agency in two illustrative cases’ just transitions: South Africa and Kenya. I find that dominant actor coalitions strategically leverage the global environmental governance structure to reinforce liberal environmentalism as the core norm of the climate regime. The resulting, incremental changes to the core norm ultimately constrain the integration of poverty reduction into climate action in just transitions.",

          "authors": "Matt McDonald, Brent J. Steele",
          "abstract": "In recent years, forest fires have brought destruction to large swathes of land around the world and will increase in frequency and intensity with the onset of climate change. This article examines dominant discourses of fire origins, prevention, and management among the key policy communities in two Western countries that have been (and will be) affected by forest fires/bushfires: the United States and Australia. Alongside this analysis, the article also draws out Indigenous approaches to fire ecology in these settings, noting both different relationships to fire and the different sets of relationships to nature of which these are a part. In the process, the article draws on the concept of the Anthropocene to illustrate the mutually reinforcing harms of colonization and ecological destruction. More positively, the article reflects on examples of Indigenous fire management in these settings and points to the possibility they represent for a more productive relationship to nature, informing Western approaches to disaster and ecological stewardship more broadly.",

          "authors": "Milan Babić, Caroline Ahler Christesen, Jacob Hasselbalch",
          "abstract": "Three critiques of the environmental state shape the discussion of its possibilities and limits. First, states are deemed structurally unable to mitigate climate change due to the “glass ceiling” of systemic transformations. Second, governments play contradictory roles in sustainability transitions because of the manifold societal demands they are facing in an age of overlapping crises. Finally, state bureaucracies and agencies are often branded “lame ducks” that prefer to uphold the status quo and stall sustainability transformations. We argue that those critiques describe important but not ultimate limits for the environmental state to reach at least Paris-aligned decarbonization targets by mid-century. On the contrary, bureaucratic agency, specialization, and coordination offer real possibilities for state-led decarbonization beyond the limits of existing environmental governance. We describe these possibilities and propose a research outlook for global environmental politics that emphasizes the importance of empirically dissecting the environmental state and its various apparatuses and functions.",

          "authors": "Işık Girgiç, Rakhyun E. Kim, Frank Biermann, Harro van Asselt",
          "abstract": "Clustering has been proposed as a strategy to enhance the problem-solving effectiveness of international environmental regimes. But does it fulfill this promise? We explore this question by assessing whether clustering reduces problem shifting—when solving one environmental issue inadvertently creates new problems. We assess the potential of clustering to preempt such dynamics by fostering more coherent, crosscutting governance that accounts for interlinkages across regimes. Our analysis focuses on the only clustering initiative to date: the synergies process of the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions. We investigate three types of problem shifting: within a single convention, between conventions in the cluster, and from a clustered convention to an external regime. Our findings reveal that the clustering arrangements of the BRS synergies process have not fully realized their potential to reduce problem shifting. While the arrangements support the identification of problem shifts and, at times, the formulation of corresponding responses, they have not addressed the underlying gaps that drive these shifts. We conclude by reflecting on how clustering could better enable environmental regimes to achieve a net positive impact.",
