          "authors": "Stephen A Rains, Shelby N Carter, Levi S Ross, Michelle I Suarez",
          "abstract": "Drawing from theory about rumination, we examine the impact of verbal rumination over time and in conjunction with co-rumination in online health communities. Our analyses show that when users verbally ruminated in a message starting a thread (compared to when they did not), they were more likely to again verbally ruminate and to report a negative mood in the next thread they started. These relationships, however, varied over time as well as when other community members co-ruminated. When co-rumination from stronger ties or weaker ties in the community was present in responses (compared to when co-rumination was absent), users were less likely to continue engaging in verbal rumination. Users were also less likely to report a negative mood over time when co-rumination by stronger and weaker ties was present. This project advances our understanding of verbal rumination and co-rumination as communication phenomena in the context of online health communities.",

          "authors": "Shani Orgad, Divya Srivastava, Diana Olaleye",
          "abstract": "The article explores the democratic value of listening by examining what listening to radio phone-in programmes and listening more broadly mean to people in times of crisis. Drawing on focus groups with London residents severely affected by the cost-of-living, health and social care crises, the article discusses how participants engaged in listening and discussed its significance. Against what we call a ‘crisis of listening’, namely, a rapid shrinking of the spaces and possibilities for listening and a profound sense among people of not being listened to by the political system, the health system and other authorities, participants appreciated listening to phone-in shows and to fellow focus group participants. Listening unifies listeners around common experiences, facilitates building commonalities and enables the public expression of vulnerability in a period of increased isolation and intensifying individualism. At the same time, commercial and exploitative logics shaping phone-in shows foster polarised debate and delegitimise differing opinions, thus reinforcing a deepening crisis of listening. The article concludes by calling for a reorientation of public life around listening and a reorganisation of our commitment as researchers to contribute to listening as an ethical project.",

          "authors": "Nadia Haq",
          "abstract": "This article contributes a missing insight into the everyday experiences of local journalists when reporting on stories involving Muslims. Using qualitative interviews with local and national journalists on their experiences of reporting stories involving Muslims, I investigate how ideas of belonging shape their journalistic practices. The study finds that the experiences of national journalists mirror the Othering of Muslims found in studies of press discourse, reflecting national newspapers’ preoccupation with questions relating to the loyalty and belonging of British Muslims. In contrast, the experiences of local journalists’ and their very different interpretations of journalism built on ideas of community, audience and public interest reflect conscious efforts towards fairer reporting on stories involving Muslims. Using Charles Taylor’s concept of social imaginaries to make sense of these findings, I demonstrate how the accounts of the local journalists reflected a social imaginary of their audiences that very much included, rather than excluded, local Muslim communities. This inclusive social imaginary became reflective of the practices of local newspapers, both in terms of their media outputs and their own journalistic identity.",
