          "authors": "Muniba Saleem, Ismaharif Ismail",
          "abstract": "Guided by social identity gratification theory, this study examines the reciprocal relationship between media consumption and social identity among 220 ethnically and linguistically diverse Muslim American adolescents over three years. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found stronger evidence for media-to-identity influence, particularly in predicting within-person changes over time. Media consumption was significantly associated with identity centrality and private esteem but not public esteem, highlighting the multidimensionality of social identity. The impact of media also varied by genre and language: native-language entertainment media positively influenced identity centrality and private esteem, whereas English-language media showed distinct effects at the between- and within-subject levels. Additionally, increased time on social networking sites was linked to a decline in Muslim private esteem over time. These findings highlight the complex ways media consumption shapes the social identity development of marginalized youth in the United States.",

          "authors": "Jane Shawcroft, Drew P Cingel",
          "abstract": "We examined whether multiple approaches to media parenting could be supportive of adolescent well-being. Using a Latent Profile Analysis, we identified approaches to media parenting and examined associations between media parenting profiles and adolescent well-being in four world regions. Data for this study were drawn from parents (N = 1,232) of adolescents and adolescent-parent dyads (adolescent ages 13–17; N = 266 dyads) living in Australia/New Zealand, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Analyses found five profiles of media parenting: Hands-off &amp; Low Confidence, Permissive, Value-Neutral &amp; Moderately Engaged, Engaged but Low Conversation, and Proactive &amp; Engaged. We found some evidence for differences in media parenting profiles by country of residence, as well as limited evidence of differences in adolescent well-being by media parenting profiles, country of residence, or an interaction between profiles and country of residence.",

          "title": "Researcher risks: a typology for qualitative risks to researchers in communication studies",
          "authors": "Rebecca M Rice, Kirstie McAllum",
          "abstract": "Discussions of risk in qualitative research tend to focus on risks to research participants. However, qualitative researchers also face risks—or uncertainties with potential for harm—because they serve as the research instrument. Communication researchers are uniquely suited to problematize the meaning of risk and extend theory about what risk is by noting that risk is subjective and communicatively constructed, both in qualitative methods and in research contexts. We create a typology of five risk contexts that pose a danger to researchers: crisis, disruptive, vulnerable, emotionally risky, and ethically fraught contexts. For each context, we define the risk, propose representative examples, and critically discuss proposed coping strategies. By doing so, we make three key contributions to scholarship on qualitative methods in communication research: (1) we explore how communication concepts of temporality, care, and resilience can be extended via discussion of researcher risks; (2) we show that researcher risk is ongoing, fluid, and constantly evolving; and (3) we argue that risk management strategies must include collective support that embraces the extended temporality of researcher risk.",

          "abstract": "This essay forward the theory of memorable messages (ToMM), a framework useful for examining the messages that individuals remember for long periods of time (i.e., memorable messages) and their influence on identities, beliefs, and behaviors. The ToMM empowers researchers to ask how messages deemed unhelpful, harmful, or incomplete (e.g., absent) can be disrupted, or meaningfully transformed, to make room for new messages and meanings. To this aim, we first overview 40 years of atheoretical memorable messages scholarship, before detailing recent advancements in the ToMM. Next, we offer warrants for five propositions of the ToMM, aligning with metatheoretical assumptions for an interpretive approach to memorable messages scholarship. Lastly, we discuss future directions for ToMM scholarship, including opportunities to advance qualitative approaches to communication research and approach the ToMM from alternative metatheoretical perspectives.",

          "authors": "Raluca Creangă",
          "abstract": "My research delves into the intricacies of smart speakers technology and its adoption by Romanian users, despite the absence of direct sales and Romanian language support. Interest in smart devices, particularly smart speakers, has been evident in Romania since 2018. This unique context, similar to other countries in the Global South, prompted me to investigate the usage and implications of these devices. In this article, I explore the subtle and often unconscious meanings associated with smart speaker usage in Romanian households. In this article I use the concepts of “Big Mother,” “smart wife,” and “digital housekeeping” to interrogate how smart speakers are transforming the domestic sphere under the auspices of caregiving. Smart speaker usage in Romania reveals a globally prevalent technological mindset that indicates a male-dominated approach to introducing technologies into the domestic space, with women often considered passive adopters of these technologies. Although women’s roles have greatly expanded, within the domestic space, women are still struggling with secondary positions and are carrying the burdens of household management. This disparity is exacerbated by the introduction of smart speakers and similar devices, which, rather than simplifying life, complicate it and deepen the gender divide.",

          "authors": "Jane Freeland, Alice Baroni, Melissa Jogie",
          "abstract": "The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action developed at the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women acknowledged the media as a vital arena for the advancement of women’s equality. Now, thirty years after the Beijing Declaration, it is clear that structural inequalities within journalism and the media continue to shape representations of women and thus the advancement of gender equality. From this starting point, this article examines how images are used in print media reporting on femicide within intimate relationships. It asks how newspapers have visualized incidents of femicide, how this shapes narratives and understandings of domestic violence, and what this means for women’s equality. Drawing on two examples from the media in the United Kingdom and Italy, this article situates the cases within national regulatory frameworks and compares the visual representation of femicide in the printed press in the two countries as a means of understanding core principles of cultural and political narratives (visual and written) in the reporting on femicide in both countries.",
