          "authors": "Timothy R. Levine, Kim B. Serota",
          "abstract": "A reanalysis of Bond and DePaulo’s meta-analysis of deception detection accuracy from the perspective of truth-default theory is reported, focusing on truth bias, the veracity effect, and the implications of the ubiquitous 50%–50% base rates used in primary experiments. Unlike Bond and DePaulo, we examine the relationships among truth bias, the veracity effect, and overall accuracy providing new insights from old data. Truth bias is substantially positively correlated ( r = .88) with accuracy for truths, negatively correlated ( r = −.88) with accuracy for lies, uncorrelated with overall accuracy ( r &lt; .03), and functionally isomorphic with the veracity effect. When accuracies for truths and lies are reported separately, the results may reflect truth bias, message veracity, or both. Substantially improved overall accuracy would be expected with more realistic base rates and levels of truth bias. The reanalyzed data highlight insights from truth-default theory and suggest that the 54% accuracy claim needs to be contextualized.",

          "authors": "Xiao Han",
          "abstract": "Datafication is reshaping feminism, as feminist pioneers, groups and communities increasingly engage with data practices for advocacy, activism and social change. This is a netnographic study exploring how feminist actors in China appropriate the emerging technology of datafication to develop grassroots narratives for pursuing gender justice, focussing on two pioneering feminist collectives as key studies. The study begins by reviewing the role of gender data in women’s empowerment within China’s socio-political context, followed by an outline of the feminist data narrative concepts that combine Couldry’s theory of data as narrative with insights from data feminism. Using these two cases, it illustrates how and why these collectives engage in data feminism to foreground gender justice. These examples demonstrate the ways in which data narratives offer transformative and empowering potential, generating new epistemic imaginaries of feminism in China. Ultimately, this paper underscores a paradigm shift towards the datafication of feminist narratives, connecting the contextual realm to the relational dynamics of data science for her social good.",

          "authors": "Taewoo Kang, Kjerstin Thorson, Chankyung Pak",
          "abstract": "This article examines a model positing that overconfidence in political understanding resulting from social media use for news and politics hampers traditional media use. It confirms a positive relationship between Facebook political information experiences and overconfidence in political understanding. However, contrary to expectations, there is a positive relationship between overconfidence and traditional media use. An exploratory post hoc analysis, viewed through the lens of truth vs. false-default orientations, suggests overconfident users might use traditional news outlets to confirm their sense of knowledge, thereby exhibiting a false-default orientation on social media political information.",

          "title": "“Cash Masters” Coming Out as “Straight”: Social Media and the Changing Dynamics of Gender and Sexuality",
          "authors": "Sozen Basturk",
          "abstract": "This article explores a novel concept called “straight cash master” emerging on social media platforms, especially X. The concept refers to relationships where self-identified straight men act as masters and primarily gay individuals take on the role of slaves. Several factors make this concept worthy of examination. First, these relationships are complex, involving dimensions of financial domination, sexuality, emotionality, and psychology. Second, while elements of sex work, fetishism, and BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, and Masochism) culture are present, categorizing these masters solely as sex workers or performers and using a single theoretical framework for analysis may be inadequate. Third, the “straight” identity of these cash masters does not orient them toward the opposite sex but rather involves same-sex interactions. Thus, their “straightness” lacks the opposite sex and can only be articulated if relied on the same-sex slaves, thereby queering the notion of straightness. Finally, while social media perpetuates traditional norms of gender, sexuality, and masculinity, it also enables such relationships to emerge, having a queering effect. Despite its relevance, there is a noticeable gap in the literature addressing the interplay between social media and this concept. Drawing on unstructured, in-depth interview and qualitative content analysis methods, this article represents the first attempt, to the best of the author’s knowledge, to address this gap and offers a queer reading of it.",

          "abstract": "In the era of ubiquitous mobile internet, Chinese youth are engaging in dual pursuits of knowledge and employment through various social media platforms, showcasing unique social media practices. Via semi-structured interviews with 14 platform-swinging youth and NVivo12-assisted three-tier qualitative analysis, this study reveals the psychological mechanisms behind their “wandering” behavior. Spontaneous engagement, fulfillment of needs, resonance with peers, preservation of meaning, self-management, and intermittent swinging characterize youth’s complex wandering online activities. It further explores new dimensions of youths’ media practices, emphasizing subjective expression, identity reconstruction, boundary clarification, and visibility control. Moreover, wandering youth also encounter challenges like context collapse, losing their true selves, and self-pulling, which raises a critical question: Where will they wander?",

          "authors": "Bridget Barrett, Shannon C. McGregor",
          "abstract": "Studies on digital advertising effects claim that the primary purposes of online ads are persuasive: They seek to change vote choice or voters’ attitudes toward candidates. But recent scholarship has noted that social media’s unique affordances encourage electoral campaigns to use them in specific ways, such as using Facebook’s ads for email list-building. We conceptualize such strategic campaign goals as instrumental purposes of advertisements. We develop novel measures to test these instrumental effects. In an online survey experiment using Facebook ads from the 2020 Biden and Trump campaigns, we test our theory with list-building, fundraising, and persuasion ads. In a factor analysis, we find that instrumental and persuasive effects are related, but distinct, aspects of candidate support. We also test the effects of these ads on persuasive and instrumental outcomes. Our control treatment was an ad for a can of Progresso soup. We found no main persuasive or instrumental effects of any advertisement type. These ads performed no better than soup.",
