          "title": "Network Agenda Setting, or Networked Framing? (Non)correspondence Between User and Right-Wing Media Semantic Networks on YouTube",
          "authors": "Yuan Hsiao, Matthew Hindman",
          "abstract": "How does media shape and reflect right-wing rhetoric in the U.S.? Theories of media effects have moved towards networked approaches to agenda setting and framing, but it remains uncertain how issue attributes or frames emerge in the U.S. media ecosystem in which users themselves can shape political rhetoric through discussion on social media. We provide the largest test to date of the different predictions of networked agenda setting (NAS) theory and networked framing, through a semantic network analysis of all 19,112 video transcripts and 661,958,464 user comments posted on the YouTube channels of four major U.S. conservative media outlets between January 2019 and March 2021. Both overall, and within key topics like COVID-19 or Black Lives Matter, we find that user comments diverge strongly from video transcripts, with users repeatedly introducing associations, emotionally charged rhetoric, and conspiracy theories not originally present. Our results challenge claims by network agenda setting scholars that “objects and attributes can be transferred simultaneously in bundles” from the media agenda to the public agenda, but are more consistent with scholarship on networked framing. We argue that future work should strive to synthesize both approaches.",

          "title": "Beyond Mere Algorithm Aversion: Are Judgments About Computer Agents More Variable?",
          "authors": "Jürgen Buder, Fritz Becker, Janika Bareiß, Markus Huff",
          "abstract": "Several studies have reported algorithm aversion, reflected in harsher judgments about computers that commit errors, compared to humans who commit the same errors. Two online studies ( N = 67, N = 252) tested whether similar effects can be obtained with a referential communication task. Participants were tasked with identifying Japanese kanji characters based on written descriptions allegedly coming from a human or an AI source. Crucially, descriptions were either flawed (ambiguous) or not. Both concurrent measures during experimental trials and pre-post questionnaire data about the source were captured. Study 1 revealed patterns of algorithm aversion but also pointed at an opposite effect of “algorithm benefit”: ambiguous descriptions by an AI (vs. human) were evaluated more negatively, but non-ambiguous descriptions were evaluated more positively, suggesting the possibility that judgments about AI sources exhibit larger variability. Study 2 tested this prediction. While human and AI sources did not differ regarding concurrent measures, questionnaire data revealed several patterns that are consistent with the variability explanation.",

          "authors": "Matthew L Meier, Marie-Louise Mares",
          "abstract": "Teen boys often face peer pressures to avoid “feminine” emotions, such as tenderness. Media selections may reflect such pressures and constitute emotional self-socialization into traditional gender roles. An online experiment with 402 13- and 14-year-olds, based on Knobloch-Westerwick’s SESAM model, tested hypotheses about gendered selections/avoidance of hostile and tender content. Randomized to imagine watching a film alone or with friends, teens rated their interest in different film emotions and their likelihood of viewing eight films (pre-tested hostile or tender), then selected and viewed four trailers. Boys (vs. girls and nonbinary youths) gave higher ratings to hostile films and lower ratings to tender films. Baseline tender affect (lower in boys vs. girls and nonbinary youths) negatively predicted number of hostile trailers viewed which in turn negatively predicted post-test tenderness, consistent with emotional self-socialization. Imagined viewing condition did not moderate gender differences except in post hoc interactions with gender mix of friends.",

          "authors": "Cristina Monzer, Daniela V Dimitrova",
          "abstract": "Values are consequential for opinion formation and remain a persuasive factor in shaping public attitudes. Still, the role of values remains under-researched in the context of online news production and engagement. This study investigates the intricate role values play by analyzing patterns of value references in online news coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in two culturally distinct nations, Romania and the U.K. Conceptually, the study is based on Schwartz’s value typology; methodologically, it relies on the Concept Mover’s Distance method. Analyzing half a million Facebook posts, the study identifies four types of value references: universal, cultural, topic-based, and situational. We show that cultural values prevalent in British posts, such as stimulation and tradition, resonate with the culturally congruent context. Universal values, however, do not guarantee a high level of engagement. The findings underscore the nuanced impact of values in shaping online news engagement.",

          "authors": "Adam Shehata",
          "abstract": "Understanding the conditions behind media-driven belief maintenance and reinforcement is critical for a comprehensive account of long-term media effects. Focusing on news coverage and beliefs about crime developments in Sweden, this study addresses the so-called “filtering function” of interpersonal communication: the idea that media messages and beliefs are validated in social networks. Using a longitudinal mixed-methods approach—combining content analysis of news coverage, a six-wave panel survey, and (focus) group discussions—the study analyses the long-term processes as well as the social validation mechanisms embedded within interpersonal discussion networks to understand belief reinforcement over time. Both the quantitative and the qualitative data support the basic social validation mechanism underpinning reinforcement effects, suggesting several distinct ways in which news coverage and beliefs are validated (and rejected) in social communication. These findings contribute to research on dynamic media effects, cultivation theory, and social networks.",

          "abstract": "People are frequently exposed to different extents of affective and cognitive appeals, but it remains unclear whether appeals targeting emotions or beliefs are differentially effective across cultures. Hence, this meta-analysis investigates the relative influence of affective versus cognitive appeals for persuasion outcomes as a function of individualism-collectivism. Using 133 samples across 22 countries (N = 29,338), we found affective appeals to be relatively more effective than cognitive appeals in collectivistic societies, but both appeals were similarly effective in individualistic societies. These analyses demonstrate the fruitfulness of examining affective–cognitive appeals through a cultural lens, and suggest new directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "The seemingly global nature of English-language hashtags often obscures activism from outside the Global North (GN). This systematic review explores geographic representation in this field ( N = 315 articles) through an investigation of case study location, author affiliation, methods of data collection and analysis, and researched social media platforms. The results show a preponderance of GN/Majority cases and non-region-specific social media groupings such as hashtag publics, particularly in research employing digital methods. As such, extant research in the field has disproportionately produced what we term Northern Visibilities—groups and movements based in GN countries (above all the United States) and platforms popular within them. We use the findings of the review to critically interrogate notions of the Global South in digital social research and provide recommendations for rectifying geopolitical underrepresentation and promoting more inclusive research practice.",

          "authors": "Inessa De Angelis",
          "abstract": "The online harassment of female politicians who focus on climate change and environmental policy has become a major problem in Canada and other democratic nations. Despite growing awareness of the problem, there is little agreement among scholars on how to measure these nuanced forms of harassment. This study develops an original seven-point scale to measure the severity of harassment three Canadian female politicians receive when Tweeting about climate change and a six-point schema to categorize the types of accounts behind the replies. My results reveal that 86% of replies contained some form of harassment, most often name-calling or questioning the authority of the female politicians, and come from users with spam or anonymous accounts. Further results from my Bayesian hierarchical model suggest that despite differences in status and political affiliation across the three politicians, they are almost equally impacted by harassment when Tweeting about climate change. These findings contribute to understanding the intersection between climate change denialism and the gendered nature of online harassment. This article contains language and themes that some readers may find offensive.",

          "authors": "Andreas T. Hirblinger, Sara Kallis, Hasini A. Haputhanthri",
          "abstract": "Social media is increasingly viewed as a venue for organized peacebuilding efforts. However, current research has paid little attention to the vast array of everyday, self-organized social media interactions that could help overcome societal divisions. This article analyses the role of online memes in everyday online reconciliation, using Sri Lanka’s 2022 political crisis as a case study. We argue that memes contribute to a DIY-approach to dealing with the past, helping to renegotiate inter-group boundaries in the aftermath of conflict. Memes articulate grievances, but they also engage with inter-group relations in a playful manner, thus enabling both a “sincere” and a “subjunctive” approach to group relations by describing them both as they “are” as well as how they “could be.” In combination, they can be used as a “weapon of the weak,” through which vulnerable social media users may communicate in ways that transcend dominant perspectives on group relations.",
