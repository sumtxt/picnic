          "authors": "Emma Christensen",
          "abstract": "This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI) is constituted as valuable within organizational settings through communicative practices that mobilize sociotechnical imaginaries of AI and expectations of specific AI models. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a commercial collaboration between an AI company and its client, the study explores how organizational actors manage, negotiate, and anticipate expectations surrounding a customized AI model. Rather than focusing on AI’s technical properties, the analysis attends to how collectively held visions of desirable futures and anticipated capabilities constitute AI’s organizational value. The findings highlight the role of sociotechnical imaginaries and expectations in co-constituting investments and the development of AI, suggesting how AI may function as a placeholder for broader managerial aspirations, especially when actors lack technical knowledge. In doing so, the article contributes to research on AI as a co-organizing force, offering insights into the communicative (re)constitution of technology’s worth and its impact on organizational realities.",

          "authors": "Brian Manata, Andrew C High, Shannon M Cruz, Timothy R Worley",
          "abstract": "Communication science has been criticized for relying on WEIRD samples. One question that arises from such criticisms is whether core communication constructs and measures generalize to different demographic groups. In other words, are measures of common communication variables interpreted similarly across groups? In this study, we assess the measurement invariance of numerous scales that are used commonly in research on communication science across five U.S. racial groups, seven English-speaking countries across five continents, and four age groups that are recognized by the American Psychological Association. Results indicate that respondents from different racial, national, and age groups exhibited measurement invariance. That is, people with different backgrounds responded to scales in similar ways, thereby indicating that some core communication constructs might be generalizable across certain groups. The implications of these results are considered, while noting that the invariance framework used herein can be used to continue examining the problem of construct invariance.",

          "abstract": "This commentary investigates platformization in global south and global north labor markets, arguing they are linked via a process of uneven and combined development. Focusing on platformization in India and the United States, we briefly describe long-standing patterns of formal and informal labor in the United States and India, which prepare the ground for the 21st-century explosion of gig platforms. We conclude by returning to the global scale of uneven and combined development, drawing on contemporary Indian Marxists to explain the global spread of gig platforms post-2008 as a global financial response to the political problem of surplus workers within premature deindustrialization.",

          "authors": "Moira Weigel",
          "abstract": "This article examines the key role that Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs have played in the growth of Amazon and the varied ways in which they interact with its marketplace platform. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, I highlight differences in how Amazon addresses such entrepreneurs, in how they produce for Amazon, and how they brand their goods for global markets. These differences do not simply reflect distinct national cultures. Rather, they emerge from how Amazon crosses national borders, bringing actors from different political and regulatory contexts, with different levels of development and symbolic resources, into direct contact and competition with one another. I propose that to make sense of these configurations, we must conceptualize global platform capitalism not only as a collection of national cases but as a world system—a differentiated unity that reproduces inequality at the same time it drives innovation.",

          "authors": "Marianne Aubin Le Quéré, Sanjay R. Kairam",
          "abstract": "In the void left by struggling local media, localized social media systems have proliferated on the web as key avenues for the exchange of location-specific information. Yet, as local ecosystems shift, there is a need to understand the types of audiences localized social media spaces attract, and whether these spaces can foster healthy communities. This article presents the results of a multi-national, longitudinal user survey of participants ( N = 2789) on the social media platform Reddit. We show, for the first time, that people who join localized social media spaces also report higher community attachment and political participation intent than users who join other social media spaces. We find evidence that these pro-community attitudes are stronger for longer-term members of localized social media and those who actively contribute through posts and comments. Surprisingly, we also identify that new residents to an area are more likely to belong to a localized social media forum than long-time residents. This article provides context for how the affordances of technology platforms influence the audiences, behaviors, and community impacts of localized social networks.",

          "authors": "Haiwei Valerie Huang",
          "abstract": "As the space for discussing feminism and related issues on domestic social media platforms in China narrows, Chinese women and feminists are increasingly seeking new platforms that provide a more supportive digital environment for advancing gender justice. This article explores the growing transnational engagement of Chinese digital feminism, with a focus on its presence on the foreign-based social media platform, Instagram. Based on interviews with 12 Chinese female Instagram users and an analysis of 184 of their women-focused posts, this study employs thematic and content analysis to explore the intricate, multi-layered transnational connectivity and social representations that contribute to a distributed form of gendered collective memory. The article argues that the digital engagement of Chinese women on Instagram plays a critical role in offsetting the limitations found in domestic social media platforms. This is vital for preserving certain vanished recollections, disseminating feminist narratives, and building gendered collective memory that challenges and reframes the often-distorted and stereotypical perceptions of Chinese women in public consciousness within China’s domestic media landscape. Despite the constrained impact and visibility of their gendered collective memory on Instagram, largely due to the specific class and group these women socially represent, their transnational efforts in shaping a more equitable collective memory remain noteworthy.",

          "authors": "Jessica Kühn, Claudia Riesmeyer",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ self-presentation on social media as an expression of identity development is influenced by personal norms and perceived social norms of relevant others. Snapchat is popular and widely used by adolescents to express themselves. A Bitmoji, as an alternative to a traditional profile picture, offers a wide range of self-presentation options through an avatar editor, including body stature and pose, individual facial features, and (branded) clothing. Based on 53 in-depth interviews with adolescents between the ages of 11 and 16, we investigated how Bitmojis are used for self-presentation and where the underlying action-guiding norms come from. Our study revealed the high perceived relevance of Bitmojis among adolescents who consciously use their Snapchat avatar to express themselves. True self-behavior is essential for some adolescents, evidenced by single, regular, or daily changes to Bitmojis’ hairstyles and clothing. Others engage in false self-behavior, displaying an ideal self to hide disliked body features or showing a false self to experiment with their digital identity. The perceived social norms of the peer group play an important role for adolescents as their personal norms.",
