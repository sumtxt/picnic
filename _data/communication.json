          "authors": "Austin Y. Hubner, Jason C. Coronel, Jared Ott, Matthew D. Sweitzer, Samuel Lerner",
          "abstract": "People often learn about science from various sources including scientists, journalists, and friends. Many studies assume people pay different levels of attention to expert and non-expert sources. This foundational assumption has largely been tested with selective exposure and reading time measures. In Study 1, we used eye-tracking to measure attention and found that individuals paid more attention to experts than non-experts. The results are promising as it suggests that people can discriminate between expert and non-expert information. But in Study 2, we showed that expertise cues do not survive person-to-person transmission via serial reproduction. Our studies highlight the need to use new methods to validate key theoretical assumptions about attention and the presence of expertise cues during social transmission.",

          "authors": "Jia Liao, Arthur A Raney, Katherine R Dale, Mary Beth Oliver",
          "abstract": "Research demonstrates how entertainment can promote self-exploration and coping through portrayals that resonate with audiences on concrete, biographical levels (i.e., social resonance). We contend that entertainment can also foster resonance through abstract content and themes that celebrate aspects of an individual’s global meaning system (i.e., existential resonance). We first tested this idea through a thematic analysis of personal essays (n = 54) describing eudaimonic experiences with films featuring portrayals of moral beauty. The results provided initial support for our contention, revealing that many respondents resonated exclusively with themes that venerated their core values. Inspired by the qualitative insights from Study 1, we examined the intercorrelations among moral identity, existential resonance, elevation, and the moral ideal self in a second study (online survey; n = 236). The findings revealed significant positive intercorrelations, offering preliminary insights into potential upward spirals of moral functioning in the context of positive media psychology.",

          "authors": "Camille J Saucier, Nathan Walter",
          "abstract": "Although research on misinformation and conspiracy theories has grown exponentially in recent years, false and misleading content remains difficult to combat. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind conspiracy theory engagement may provide unique insight. Drawing upon distinct literatures around self-affirmation and motivation theories, this study aims to: (a) determine if conspiracy theories serve to bolster self-worth among those predisposed to believe them and (b) examine whether a priori affirmation reduces the desire to engage with these theories. To test these predictions, two experiments assessed participants’ likelihood of engaging with a conspiracy theory. Results were mixed, suggesting conspiracy theories serve a self-affirming function, yet also illustrating the complex nature of conspiracy beliefs and the diverse means to test them. Together, these findings speak to the continued importance of research into conspiracy theory engagement with an eye toward identifying boundary conditions and elucidating underlying mechanisms.",

          "authors": "Rik Ray, Sakshi Bhalla, Harsh Taneja",
          "abstract": "Fact checkers have low reach, and their limited efficacy is often attributed to perceived partisanship. Yet little research exists investigating the reach of or engagement with fact checkers among their intended audiences. We argue that given their small audience size, fact checkers’ usage is likely driven by heavy media users regardless of their partisan leanings. We examined a slice of Twitter (X) users, following certain partisan and fact checking outlets from India and the United States. Our analysis of over 7 million news users suggests that exposure to and engagement with fact checkers remains largely restricted to heavier users, with little evidence that these interventions penetrate among selectively partisan news audiences. This study is thus among the first to highlight complementary explanations for the limited efficacy of fact checkers beyond the partisan inclinations of either audiences or news outlets.",

VCE centers participant identities and life experiences, empowering historically marginalized communities to engage in emic knowledge production and meaning-making. VCE builds on established scientific methodologies, foregrounding a critical approach to stimulate action against social inequities. In utilizing the empathetic nature of visual storytelling, VCE mirrors the method, ethics, and purpose of photojournalism. In this article, I share details of VCE’s application in rigorous field research, providing evidence from civic leaders that VCE projects can generate policy change. I also provide examples of VCE as pedagogy, sharing student perspectives about how this approach presents opportunities for self-expression and critical inquiry, giving their learning experiences more meaning.",

          "authors": "Peter Arne Johnson",
          "abstract": "Private equity firms and institutional stakeholders increased their investments in television production amid the streaming boom of the late 2010s and early 2020s. Taking advantage of new regulations and demand from streaming services for localized production in Europe, U.S.-based private equity firms started purchasing local film and television production companies and concentrating power in regional production conglomerates. A simple “follow the money” approach to this phenomenon might over-assign ownership and thereby operational control to these financial stakeholders. However, a more holistic approach to following the money, which offers a plastic and relational ecology with different axes of power between different stakeholders for a given television production, complicates our understanding of private equity in transnational television. This article examines the transnational financial ecology of one of these private equity firms’ regional production conglomerates (KKR’s Leonine Studios) and the capital threads connected to one of its programs ( Pagan Peak ). Relying on publicly available industry deep texts and background interviews with television professionals, this case study presents the paradoxical opportunities that private equity capital specifically and television investment generally offer at the same time that they can exploit, concentrate, and extract.",

          "authors": "Fan Liang",
          "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between content creators and multi-channel networks (MCNs) in China’s platform economy through the lens of labor coercion. While previous literature has mainly addressed the flexibility and precarity of creators, little attention has been paid to understanding how profit-driven entities like MCNs shape creative practices. Drawing on lawsuit documents and in-depth interviews with creators, this study introduces the concept of “tethered labor” to examine the tension between creation and coercion across three key dimensions: dependency, de-flexibilization, and resilience. The findings reveal that creators are heavily reliant on MCNs for content production and monetization, often involuntarily due to the threat of MCNs’ punitive power. This dependency enables MCNs to exert substantial control over creators, making creation increasingly de-flexible. However, creators develop tactics to navigate such coercion, and the ongoing struggle has the potential to destabilize MCNs. The results demonstrate that tethered labor constrains the autonomy and flexibility traditionally associated with creative work.",

          "abstract": "Micro-celebrities have become an integral part of social media culture, engaging with small but loyal audiences even if they do not generate significant income or wield substantial social influence. This study explores a particular subset of micro-celebrities, referred to as “micro-intellectuals.” Unlike influencers who gain popularity by showcasing idealized, often unattainable lifestyles, micro-intellectuals are perceived as authentic and obtain distinctive online status through curating and sharing knowledge. By examining how micro-intellectuals strategically craft their unique online personas, this research seeks to uncover how digital distinction sheds light on the logic behind individual self-presentation in the digital age. Our findings reveal that digital distinction is not only achieved through content but also through the manner and context in which it is presented. Digital platforms function as taste assemblages, where cultural production by users actively contributes to the process of distinction-making. In addition, the study illustrates that digital distinction is often a personalized choice rooted in identity construction, rather than merely a reflection of social class structures.",

          "abstract": "Advancing an affective-discursive approach, this article examines how distant witnessing bolsters digital activist organizing that challenges a Southern authoritarian regime’s nationalist politics on international social media. The research foregrounds an initiative coordinated by a group of overseas dissidents who sought to expose China’s foreign policy regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine on X (Twitter). Amid ongoing battlefield stalemates that have prolonged the war, this initiative has evolved into a broader form of resistance, staging distant witnessing through X postings to circumvent the party-state’s internet censorship. As this process unfolds, activists capitalize on social media affordances to curate witness testimonies that counter China’s distorted geopolitical narratives and beyond. Resorting to both pre-discursive and discursive gestures, this repertoire contributes to the formation of affective publics, thereby stimulating public contention over the party-state’s authoritarian rule from afar. The findings highlight how such digital platforms as X enable an informal model of organization, allowing Southern activists to act as mediators who coordinate distant witnessing in a transnational context.",

          "abstract": "Using survey data from a sample of 378 women who live in the United States and self-identify as either Black or Latinx, this study explores predictors of women’s digital monitoring practices in intimate relationships in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). We use literature about surveillance, monitoring, and IPV to frame our study. Our results show three significant instances that influence the odds of monitoring a romantic partner: (1) past experiences with digital abuse, (2) past experiences with offline psychological abuse, and (3) age, with younger women having increased odds of engaging in digital monitoring compared to older women. Although relationship satisfaction was negatively associated with digital monitoring, it was not a predictor variable. This suggests that casual surveillance behaviors are highly ambiguous and not necessarily indicative of a poor relationship. In fact, for women with past abuse experiences, digital monitoring may function as a coping mechanism that brings personal reassurance.",
