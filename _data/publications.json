          "authors": "Adrián Lucardi, Agustín Vallejo, Germán Feierherd",
          "abstract": "Successful coordination around a Duvergerian equilibrium requires accurate and consistent information about parties’ expected electoral support. In practice, such information is often unreliable and rarely available at the local level, thus hindering voters’ coordination. In this paper, we leverage Argentina’s Open, Mandatory, and Simultaneous Primary Elections as a large-scale survey of voter preferences. Using data from 135 municipalities in the province of Buenos Aires (2011–23), we show that a narrower margin between the top-two placed parties in the primary increases both turnout and the proportion of positive votes in the general election, while decreasing electoral fragmentation. We further show that the second-placed party in the primary is substantially more likely to win the election than the third-placed one. Also consistent with theory, these effects are more pronounced (a) in concurrent elections; (b) in smaller municipalities; and (c) when the second-placed party is closer to the first-placed one.",

Even as authoritarianism takes center stage in the subfield, the most important authoritarian regime type of the 20 th century has faded into a footnote. Proceeding in a similar spirit but with less sweeping ambition than the “Varieties of Capitalism” and “Varieties of Democracy” projects, this special issue and wider research agenda considers how communist regimes have differed both from other authoritarian regimes and from each other. Even while sharing certain ideological and institutional features that made them analytically distinctive, communist regimes historically emerged and evolved in very different contexts and in very different ways. Assembled essays on communist regimes in East Asia and Eastern Europe reveal the promise of bringing communism as a category back into our comparative conversations.",

          "abstract": "Abundant prior research has analyzed the mass public’s role in democratic backsliding. Comparatively little research has studied democratic restoration, the rehabilitation of democratic institutions following backsliding. We investigate this issue using the case of Poland, where the pro-democratic alliance led by Donald Tusk won the parliamentary election in 2023 after eight years of democratic backsliding under the Law and Justice party. A central concern is whether such an opportunity to restore democratic institutions fuels anti-democratic sentiment among vengeful winners and disappointed losers in a polarized society. Using panel survey data, we show that the election result did not exacerbate anti-democratic attitudes on either side. At the same time, survey experiments reveal that pro-democratic elites may jeopardize the winners’ benevolence by using an aggressive, confrontational restoration strategy. The findings may inform current and future endeavors to restore democratic institutions in Poland and other cases such as the United States.",

Why did people on the Left oppose, and Right support, European integration in the 1980s, but this pattern reverse in the 2020s? We argue that citizens evaluate European integration in a transactional way in terms of their assessment of EU policy outputs. If the European Union offers citizens policies in line with their political preferences, they support it. If not, they oppose it. We find support for this argument using individual level public opinion data ( n &gt; 1,100,000) from all EU member states over almost 50 years (from the mid 1970s to the present) and novel approaches for measuring the left-right policy location of EU legislative outputs.",

Protests may lead governments to address certain policy issues, but can also exert pressure on politicians by causing shifts in public opinion. We examine the effects of peaceful and disruptive protest on public opinion using evidence from South Africa, where citizens regularly use protests to express dissatisfaction with public services. First, we test the effects of protests on public opinion in a difference-in-differences design, using multiple waves of a nationwide survey matched to geo-coded protest data. Second, we use a survey experiment that randomly exposes respondents to images of disruptive or peaceful protests. Third, we run a conjoint experiment to disentangle the effects of the different dimensions of protest. We find that peaceful protest where protesters attribute blame for their grievances attract more sympathy and public support. However, under specific conditions, disruptive protests are capable of attracting sympathy and support from the public.",

          "abstract": "Political corruption is a leading governance challenge, yet governments often lack the will to tackle it and may use anti-corruption to undermine democracy. This dilemma has given rise to international anti-corruption commissions (IACCs), which rely on partnerships between international experts and domestic personnel. Why are some IACCs granted independence, while others are politically subordinate? Focusing on northern Central America, this article argues that where coalitions comprised of government insiders and domestic activists maintain a seat at the negotiating table, they use their agenda-setting capacities, expertise, and ability to raise the audience costs of incumbent maneuvers to dilute anti-corruption to ensure greater IACC independence. Additionally, struggles over IACC autonomy are influenced by transnational dynamics, as political leaders learn from one another how to limit anti-corruption enforcement.",

          "abstract": "Why can support for cash transfers decrease among beneficiaries when poverty is growing? This article argues that support for redistributive policies is dynamic and shaped by citizens’ evaluations of policy results. When beneficiaries feel cash transfers help them cope with hardship, support can increase. However, if recipients perceive these policies as insufficient in offsetting their economic situation, they may view them as ineffective in consistently alleviating poverty. Consequently, recipients may oppose expanding cash transfers while continuing to support deeper redistributive policies—such as education and job-training programs—that offer long-term economic improvement. Using a multi-method design that combines weighted difference-in-differences estimations, machine learning models, focus groups, and a novel face-to-face survey in Argentina, the findings show how preferences for redistribution can change in different contexts.",

This is the case when treatment effects are heterogeneous and compliance to the instrument depends on the interaction variable. We suggest estimating marginal treatment effects to address this problem. Our estimation results show complementarities between education and genetic predisposition in determining later-life memory. The marginal treatment effect estimates suggest substantially larger gene-environment interactions than the 2SLS estimates.",

To derive a counterfactual that resembles traditional tacit collusion, I conduct market experiments with humans in the same environment. Across different treatments, I vary the market size and the number of firms that use a pricing algorithm. I demonstrate that oligopoly markets can become more collusive if algorithms make pricing decisions instead of humans. In two-firm markets, prices are weakly increasing in the number of algorithms in the market. In three-firm markets, algorithms weaken competition if most firms use an algorithm and human sellers are inexperienced.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of markets for on-demand online physician consultations —direct-to-consumer telemedicine (DCT) — is currently transforming many healthcare settings. DCT may be a cost-effective substitute for in-person consultations, but the convenience of seeking DCT may increase the demand for the service and consequently also the costs for health insurers. To causally assess the degree to which DCT consultations substitute for in-person primary care consultations, we exploit exogenous changes in patient fees in a fuzzy difference-in-discontinuities analysis of young adults in Sweden. We estimate that 45% of DCT consultations replace in-person visits; the rest represents new utilisation. We further estimate that the increase in volume could be close to cost neutral, and we find no evidence that quality deteriorates due to the increased use of online care.",

Households adapt to temperature through two channels: an intensive margin– adjusting energy use for heating and cooling– and an extensive margin– deciding whether to purchase temperature-control equipment such as a heater, air conditioner or heat pump. I estimate the production functions for household heating and cooling from a unique product-level data set and calibrate the remaining parameters to match variation in energy expenditures and budget shares with income. I find that the welfare effects of climate change vary substantially with income and region. In colder areas, climate change increases inequality in lifetime welfare. While all households experience greater cooling needs, the costs are particularly acute for lower-income households, who purchase air conditioners that they did not previously need. In warmer areas, the opposite pattern reduces welfare inequality.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we experimentally investigate the effect of public consumer ratings on market outcomes in credence goods markets. Contrary to search or experience goods, consumers cannot evaluate all dimensions of trade for credence goods, which may inhibit the information and reputation-building value of public rating systems. We implement a market in which experts have an informational advantage over consumers with respect to the appropriate service level. The rating system takes the form of a five-star rating system as is common on online rating websites. The value of this rating system is compared in two different expert market settings: First, one in which consumers cannot rely on information from personal experience with the expert, reflecting markets in which consumer-expert interactions are often first-time and infrequent (e.g., specialist visits in healthcare markets). Second, one in which consumers have personal experience with the expert, reflecting markets in which consumer-expert interactions are frequent and repeated (e.g., general practitioner visits in healthcare markets). We find that the public rating system significantly improves market outcomes. Furthermore, a public rating system is a good substitute for personal experience information in terms of market efficiency and consumer surplus. Combined, however, we find no complementarity between public ratings and personal experience information, mainly due to the already high market efficiency in the presence of either one.",

This process yielded 4,428 individual evaluations. Our results show that, regardless of the GPT version employed, human-generated responses achieve significantly and substantially higher average scores than machine-generated responses in open tasks. Conversely, AI-generated responses outperform human ones in closed tasks. Furthermore, we estimate that human imagination accounts for between 22% and 45% of the creative score in open tasks.",

Our findings reveal mixed equilibrium and welfare effects. ZHCs stimulate job creation among firms facing highly volatile business conditions, increasing total employment but potentially reducing regular jobs. Simultaneously, ZHCs boost labour force participation by attracting individuals who prefer flexible work schedules, which may create more congestion for regular jobs in a random-search environment. Our calibration demonstrates that the macroeconomic consequences of alternative work arrangements depend crucially on the job creation margin and on workers’ valuation of flexibility.",

Demand shock dispersion increases by more than productivity shock dispersion in recessions and explains most of the variation in sales growth dispersion. Productivity shocks pass through incompletely to prices and hence have a limited effect on sales dispersion. We directly estimate demand curves and reject the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) benchmark. We incorporate our non-CES demand curves into a heterogeneous-firm model, show it matches these micro facts, and study its implications for uncertainty shocks. Demand shock dispersion has unambiguously negative effects on output via a “wait and see channel”, while productivity shock dispersion instead affects output negatively by inducing markup dispersion.",

          "abstract": "This paper views migration management campaigns through the lens of involuntary immobility and containment development, which aim to geographically localise Gambian desires and imaginations, to the extent that they are being subjected to border controls that discriminate and dehumanise irregular migrants. Migration Information Campaigns (MICs) advocate a sedentary bias that positions Gambian migrants with the injustice of migration departheid, whereby Western states intentionally implement a racialized mobility regime. I present the results of ethnographic field work undertaken in The Gambia, West Africa during the period 2018 through 2022. Border externalisation measures in all their forms are having dire consequences for the youth of the Gambia. So‐called development is cloaked in containment development initiatives, which are benefiting few and damaging to many. MICs have been documented to be ineffective, and the respondents in this study say the same. Expanding beyond their ineffectiveness, however, is the perpetuation of global mobility injustice, which hasn't clearly been articulated in the literature. Against the backdrop of Gambians pleading for more open visa acquisition, the EU is far more likely to spend their time and money working on campaigns to do just the opposite: keep Gambians at home. Gambian youth are making choices to take dangerous routes to Europe and other international destinations because visas are elusive and their economic prospects at home remain bleak. The discrepancy between MICs and the wishes of Gambian youth to migrate and the associated injustice they feel is presented. This work therefore contributes to the recent and growing literature on migration departheid and mobility justice.",

Leveraging a new, original data set on coup ideology, the article's findings show that successful coups d’état performed by ideologically inspired military personnel significantly increase chances for future political violence, evidenced in torture, political killings, and repression. Programmatic statements amid military takeovers of power establish expectations for future policy directions and set the stage for creating winners and losers in society beyond renegotiating elite coalitions at the time coups occur. Empirical findings provide robust support for this theory and help explain why military coups increase political violence. Understanding the logic of programmatic coups offers a valuable contribution to multiple research programs, including civil–military relations, authoritarian regime change, and political violence.",

          "abstract": "AI is expected to reshape society and labor markets, yet experts remain divided on whether AI will primarily displace human labor or generate new employment opportunities. Despite the importance of this debate, little is known about how the public perceives AI’s labor market impact—and how these perceptions affect democratic attitudes and behaviors. Large-scale survey data ( N = 37,079; 38 European countries) indicate that the public tends to view AI as labor-replacing rather than labor-creating. Controlling for technology-related, political, and sociodemographic factors, these data further show that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Two preregistered, nationally representative experiments ( N = 1,202, United Kingdom; replication study N = 1,200, United States) provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democracy and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may decrease democratic legitimacy and public engagement in shaping the future of AI.",

          "abstract": "In light of continued foreign interference in the US presidential elections, where undisclosed digital voter suppression advertising has been deployed, this study addresses the questions of who is exposed to these ads and whether and how such exposure influences voter turnout. Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey responses to identify voter suppression content and its targeting patterns. By further matching individual-level exposure to voter suppression ads with the same individual’s verified voter turnout records, the study estimates the effects of voter suppression on actual turnout. The study findings from the 2016 US Presidential Election reveal clear geo-racial targeting patterns in voter suppression: non-Whites residing in the racial minority counties of battleground states were exposed to substantially more voter suppression ads than their counterparts. Moreover, exposure to voter suppression ads was associated with decreases in voter turnout at the population level, albeit small. The sharpest declines were observed among non-Whites residing in minority counties of battleground states, suggesting that the intensified turnout suppression among the targeted segments of the electorate may have played a role in shaping turnout.",

To address this gap, we analyze 2,801 socio-environmental mobilizations documented in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas). These mobilizations produce diverse outcomes that reveal distinct spatial, temporal, and sectoral patterns and proactively and reactively respond to environmental impacts across the globe. Notably, about 40% of these mobilizations occur within the top 30% of global priority lands for species conservation and their actions contribute to the achievement of key Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework targets focused on ecosystem protection, restoration, sustainable use, and inclusive spatial planning. Yet, one-third of mobilizations face repression, criminalization, or violence—pressures that are even more common in high-priority conservation areas. Moreover, mobilizations facing repressive outcomes contest environmental threats relevant for the KMGBF targets more extensively than those with progressive outcomes, underscoring the risks faced by movements driving biodiversity protection in critical regions. To amplify the transformative potential of socio-environmental mobilizations, we emphasize the importance of recognizing, strengthening, and protecting them through coordinated action among diverse social actors. By fostering collaboration and targeted resource allocation, these efforts can empower socio-environmental mobilizations to catalyze meaningful and lasting change for biodiversity conservation.",

          "authors": "Qinya Feng",
          "abstract": "The consequences of migration-induced diversity for social cohesion have received significant attention, yet recent research highlights the positive influence of social trust in shaping native-born people’s views on immigration. It remains unclear, however, whether the relationship is partially driven by prosociality, which is closely associated with but distinct from trust, or other confounders. This study uses Swedish twin data to examine these relationships, employing twin fixed effects to control for confounding factors shared within families. The findings show that generalised social trust and several forms of prosocial behaviour are associated with more favourable views on immigration policy, but only the effects of trust remain robust within the identical twin subsample. The influence of trust appears independent of prosociality and primarily relates to immigrant acceptance. Overall, the findings suggest that generalised trust reflects an inclusive outlook. The results are also discussed in light of recent changes in Sweden’s sociopolitical landscape.",

          "abstract": "Proportional electoral systems, especially when coupled with voluntary party or legislative gender quotas, have been considered beneficial for advancing women’s representation. Extant research on preferential voting in proportional systems, however, yields conflicting evidence. We focus on recent electoral reforms in two German Länder, Hamburg and Bremen, that converted their proportional system from closed to open party lists with preferential voting. Through calculating a counterfactual, we assess the gendered outcomes differentiated between elections, parliaments and parties, to show that party culture plays a pivotal role in shaping the effects of voluntary party quotas within the context of electoral system changes. Our findings underscore the nuanced interaction between electoral system reform and a party’s commitment to gender parity, highlighting the significance of pre-reform party positions and their dedication to prioritizing gender quotas.",

          "abstract": "Centrism, an ambiguous political term, requires greater analytical scrutiny. After summarising conceptualisations of centrism – and of a centre in politics – that can be derived from existing literature, this article is focused on centrism as a purported set of ideas: a centre beyond left and right. As a case study for this outlook, the centrist project of French president Emmanuel Macron is analysed. A new theory of centrism is then presented – centrism as a structure for political action – which recognises both the lack of political concepts within centrism and the inclusion of a political strategy which makes it an observable phenomenon: a politics which oscillates between left and right. Within liberal democracies, centrism offers a strategy for action, derived from a critique of left and right political establishments. Yet it does so in an ideational context largely shaped by existing ideologies of left and right, moderate and extreme. While oscillation may ease political decision-making, as a strategy, it does not inscribe specifically centrist political ideas. A distinct centrism which transcends left and right remains elusive.",

          "abstract": "In studies of non-majoritarian institutions, there is a widespread idea that political neutrality, epistemic authority, and technical expertise are sources of legitimacy. Empirical studies tend to find that such appeals are effective sources of legitimacy, but theorists are overwhelmingly skeptical of their normative appeal. This article’s conceptual ambition is to unify the disparate debates under the term technical legitimacy . The article’s theoretical ambition is to improve on the normative debate on technical legitimacy. Existing defenses fail to robustly satisfy the reasons that ground delegation to non-majoritarian institutions. I propose conditions for accepting technical legitimacy that are reasonably robust against counterfactuals. Technical legitimacy must meet three criteria. Institutions must promote a functionally specified common good; build on sound and undistorted expertise; and, perhaps counterintuitively, contain appropriate venues for value input.",

          "abstract": "Who supports populist radical right parties? And under what circumstances? A longstanding argument in political psychology suggests that populist radical right support is deeply rooted within one’s personality. Yet, while this model assumes an effect of stable personality traits, populist radical right support tends to fluctuate. This study addresses this inconsistency and examines to what extent the link between personality and populist radical right support depends on cultural threats as induced by negative contact with non-natives. Using two-wave German panel data, we find no evidence that increased negative contact strengthens the personality–populist radical right link. However, our findings reveal two nuanced yet tentative patterns. First, initial exposure to negative contact may increase populist radical right support among those low in Agreeableness/Openness. Second, when the outgroup is framed as “foreigners,” increased negative contact may strengthen the role of personality, but not when defined as “Muslims” or “refugees.” These findings bear important implications for our psychological understanding of populist radical right support.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing attention to visual political communication (VPC), we still know little about how visuals are produced by populist and non-populist actors. This article addresses this gap through in-depth semi-structured interviews with high-profile members of the communication teams of the major Italian political parties and leaders—that is, the experts shaping their communication strategies. Our exploratory study offers an unprecedented “insider” perspective on the conception, design, and deployment of political visuals, providing new insights into VPC. Notably, the findings challenge common assumptions about the distinctiveness of populist VPC, revealing that hallmark features often associated with populism—such as emotionally charged imagery and specific chromatic and stylistic choices—are frequently adopted by non-populist actors as well. This convergence suggests that social media platforms incentivize all political actors to adopt particular visual strategies. Consequently, it is misleading to consider specific visual elements intrinsically populist; instead, VPC appears primarily as a strategic choice.",

          "abstract": "Existing research on citizen participation in co‐production has largely focused on instrumental factors, with limited attention to value‐driven motivations. This study investigates the role of value‐driven factors in shaping citizens' willingness to engage in co‐production, specifically examining benefit creation and responsibility‐driven motivations. It develops an analytical framework and tests it through a survey experiment on community environmental governance. Results show that both public and individual benefit creation enhance participation, with public benefit having a stronger effect. Individual responsibility fosters engagement, while shared responsibility has no significant impact. Compared with other forms of integration, the combination of public benefit creation and individual responsibility yields the highest level of participation willingness, highlighting their synergistic interaction. This study advances the understanding of citizen participation in co‐production by incorporating value‐driven motivations, particularly benefit creation, and responsibility‐driven motivations into theoretical and practical frameworks.",

          "abstract": "Ad hoc commissions are well known in policymaking, yet their strategic deployment during crises remains less understood. This study examines how governments rely on expert commissions to manage blame and political risk in response to critical events. I argue that while commissions facilitate blame avoidance, their use is constrained when delegating authority to experts poses greater risks than benefits. Using logit models on longitudinal data from Chile (1990–2022), I assess how critical events affect commission appointments. The study draws on a novel dataset constructed through archival research and develops an original indicator of critical events using billions of media records from Google Jigsaw's Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The findings reveal a conditional logic: high presidential disapproval and frequent critical events are associated with greater use of commissions, whereas sustained or severe events are linked to lower use. These results suggest that the deployment of expert commissions as a blame avoidance strategy is conditional on governments' political risk calculus.",

          "abstract": "Globally, technological innovations are driving governments towards e‐government adoption. Digitization efforts have met with more resistance and challenges in the Global South context due to high levels of financial, logistical, and technical constraints. The information and communication technology for development literature provides two lenses for examining e‐government adoption: structural conditions (e.g., infrastructure, financial resources) and the affective orientations (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, values) of actors towards technology. Connecting these two lenses frames the analysis of a case study on a nascent digital nonprofit registration process in Ghana built by drawing on historical information, country context, observations, and interviews with public bureaucrats representing the central government and 17 local government authorities. The findings identify key structural conditions and affective orientations, including informal bring‐your‐own‐device norms, that have become necessary for leveraging technological capabilities. Insights may be extended to other world regions and contexts that face similar constraints in their pursuit of digital transformations.",

We differentiate between “normalized” sexual issues, like same-gender marriage, which have gained mainstream acceptance, and “nonnormalized” issues, such as nontraditional sexual practices and relationships, which remain stigmatized. Through a conjoint experiment in Catalonia, Spain, we investigate public attitudes toward adoptive parents with varying sexual orientations, relationship types, and age differences, confirming that discriminatory preferences are prevalent in contexts with low social desirability. By highlighting the continued prejudice against both normative and nonnormative sexual issues, this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of sexual attitudes and the challenges facing LGBTQ+ politics and rights.",

          "abstract": "We examine how the rise of institutional ownership has influenced firms' political activities. We find that, after the acquisition of a large stake, a firm's political action committee giving mirrors more closely that of the acquiring investor. Consistent with a causal interpretation, this pattern is also observed for acquisitions driven by new index inclusions. The pattern is stronger when firms' management faces contentious proposals in shareholder meetings and may thus need institutional investors' support. We further show that firms' giving shifts away from business-relevant politicians and is strongly aligned with the individual campaign donations of the institutional investors' employees. These results, together with the finding that the effects are larger for more ``partisan\" and privately owned investors, suggest that the influence we uncover is driven by institutional investors' own political views, rather than a profit-maximizing strategy for the portfolio firms.",

This pattern of capital flows is consistent with the predictions of an open-economy model with nominal rigidities where cost-push shocks generate an inflationary episode and capital flows freely across countries. Yet, by raising demand for domestic non-tradable goods and services, capital inflows cause unwelcome upward pressure on firms’ costs in countries most severely hit by these shocks. We find that a reverse pattern of capital flows would have improved the output-inflation trade-off globally, hence requiring a less aggressive monetary tightening in the most severely hit countries and delivering overall welfare gains.",

The linchpin of our approach is a class of rotation-invariant TV SVARs in which the prior and posterior densities of any sequence of structural parameters belonging to the class are invariant to {orthogonal transformations} of the sequence. Our methodology is new to the literature. In contrast to existing algorithms for inference based on sign restrictions, our algorithm is the first to draw from a uniform distribution over the sequences of orthogonal matrices given the reduced-form parameters. We illustrate our procedure for inference by analyzing the role played by monetary policy during the latest inflation surge.",

Specifically, college-educated workers’ allocative wages are highly pro-cyclical, while high school dropouts’ wages exhibit only moderate cyclicality. Further, as education increases, an increasing share of the sensitivity of allocative wages is driven by the persistent scarring effects of the cyclical position at the time of hiring on the wages associated with higher levels of tenure, amounting to more than a third of the overall sensitivity for the college educated. The greater job stability of the more educated—and therefore the exposure to scarring—contributes to these differences. In addition, more significant scarring at each horizon of tenure amplifies the effect. In service of documenting these facts, I develop new methods for inferring the sensitivity of labour costs to shocks when agents are forward-looking and wages may be intertemporally smoothed.",

          "authors": "Koji Chavez, Katherine Weisshaar, Tania Hutt",
          "abstract": "Discrimination in hiring screening decisions against Black men, Black women, and White women compared to White men has been well-documented in social science research, yet a fundamental aspect of the hiring process—the extent to which job applicants meet the job requirements—has not been clearly integrated into our understanding of hiring discrimination. In this paper, we develop an intersectional framework that conceptualizes applicant-job requirement matching as a form of “proof” that the applicant meets the evaluative standard for the job, and that the burden of proof is unequally distributed across job applicants’ combined gender and racial statuses. White men applicants, who align with the abstract evaluative standard for professional positions, benefit from assumed abilities even without evidence of matching job requirements, whereas Black men, Black women, and White women applicants must match job requirements to “prove” that they meet screening standards. We test this theory empirically with two original experimental studies: a nationally representative survey experiment and a correspondence audit study of accountants. We find that stereotyping and hiring screening discrimination varies across the applicant-job requirement match: discrimination is heightened when job applicants do not meet the requirements, and reduced when matched to requirements. The burden of proof through matching requirements therefore falls to Black men, Black women, and White women—and we find that Black women applicants experience unique outcomes due to their “intersectional invisibility.” This article contributes to our understanding of hiring discrimination and gender and racial inequality in the labor market.",

          "abstract": "abstract: This article investigates whether citizens meaningfully distinguish between profiles of politicians—government ministers in particular—based on the paradigms of democracy that the ministers embody. Although previous research shows that sociodemographic characteristics and political beliefs influence voters’ candidate choices, research has paid little attention to whether candidates’ representational paradigms influence voters. Using a con-joint experiment conducted across fifteen Western and Eastern European countries, this study examines respondents’ preferences for candidates who embody six representational paradigms, which the authors derive from the literature. The findings reveal that citizens value candidates who represent the will of the people and do not belong to a particular political party, compared to those who are affiliated with political parties and are primarily accountable to a parliament. Moreover, the study demonstrates that trustful citizens prioritize candidates who embody a paradigm resembling the well-known responsible party model more than do distrustful citizens, and those with populist attitudes favor candidates with an instructed delegate paradigm and to a lesser extent, a technocratic paradigm.",

          "abstract": "abstract: Voters commonly respond to economic downturns by punishing incumbents. But what about the fate of the opposition? When assessing policymaker performance in tough times, do voters choose an established party with experience as head of government, or an inexperienced challenger? Research on the rise of challengers emphasizes issue opinions and elite strategies. The authors argue instead that perceptions of competence shape voter choices for incumbents, for main opposition options, and for challengers alike. Although selecting unproven challengers is risky, the authors predict that voters are more likely to take a chance when the duration of economic underperformance is long and the government’s tenure is short. Depressing the competence of dominant parties opens a window for parties that lack executive experience. A series of analyses provides evidence to support this argument. By showing that parties in opposition can be distinguished on competence grounds, the study’s findings widen the lens on how electoral accountability works.",

          "abstract": "abstract: Prior scholarship finds that migrants embrace democratic ideals and promote democracy back home, but this work focuses on migration to high-income Western democracies. How does moving to autocracies shape migrants’ democratic attitudes and behavior? Leveraging a field experiment facilitating migration from India to the Persian Gulf, the authors isolate the causal impact of migration on migrants’ political preferences. After migrating, treated individuals exhibited significantly higher trust in Indian democratic institutions and greater political participation—except for voting, which is difficult to do from abroad. Additionally, they were no more willing to trade democracy for economic growth than control group subjects. The treatment group’s political preferences stem from comparing their experiences under democratic and, as migrants, autocratic governments. The findings suggest that migrants value democracy for its political benefits, which outweigh preferences for higher economic development. This article clarifies the mechanisms by which migration shapes preferences for democracy and sheds light on how migration to autocracies shapes politics in sending regions more generally.",

          "abstract": "abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that authoritarian states bear a cost to social stability for disclosing information. This study investigates the effect of an increasingly common transparency initiative in authoritarian countries: open government information (ogi). By publishing policy information, ogi allows citizens to identify illegal government behavior. Drawing from the Chinese case, the author theorizes that although such policy transparency reveals whether governments violate laws, it encourages the use of institutional channels for resolving disputes. By redirecting popular discontent from the streets to institutions, such transparency initiatives foster social stability in autocracies rather than threatening it. Using online and in-the-field survey experiments about ogi on land-taking compensation, the author shows that policy transparency improves citizens’ preference for legal and political institutions and causes them to prioritize institutions over protest when they have grievances against the government. Multiple findings about the mechanisms suggest that policy information increases citizens’ perceived fairness of institutions in resolving their specific cases.",

          "abstract": "abstract: The population of advanced capitalist democracies (acds) has aged substantially in the last decades. Yet we know little about the consequences of aging for the electoral politics of economic performance. This article develops a novel theoretical framework linking aging to lower economic growth in four interrelated steps. First, elderly voters care more about pensions than other voters do, but less about policies related to child care, family, and education. Second, elderly voters are less likely to penalize governments for low growth and unemployment. Third, gray power pushes governments to protect the growing share of budgets allocated to pensions at the expense of more growth-enhancing policies, most notably social and public investments, while also weakening policy responsiveness during recessions. Fourth, this policy reallocation undermines economic growth. The author tests this theory using multilevel and fixed-effects regressions, an instrumental variable approach, and causal mediation analysis on micro- and macrolevel data across twenty-one acds from the 1960s onward. The results show that aging fundamentally alters the electoral politics of economic stagnation in acds.",

          "abstract": "Researchers routinely face suspicion during fieldwork. This article presents findings from interviews with 34 ethnographers who were suspected of being spies while conducting fieldwork in Turkey. I find that the way the ethnographers experienced and responded to this suspicion depended on whether they reported being questioned about whether they were spies versus accused of spying. Questioning was interpreted as sense-making, and researchers reported several common strategies for addressing the suspicions they faced. Accusations, in contrast, were associated with threats and motivated the researchers to mitigate risks to themselves and their interlocutors. Engaging with scholarship on social cognition, high-risk fieldwork, and reflexivity, I discuss how my findings offer practical insights for navigating suspicion and risk during fieldwork—even in seemingly low-risk environments—and I make the case that interrogating how researchers react to suspicion can help them clarify their positionality and aid reflexivity.",

The “Hermarchus-Spinoza complex” refers to the Epicurean articulation of a politics that is inherently incompatible with the contrast between naturalism and constructivism. The Epicurean approach manages to overcome this binary because of its conception of phronesis as performative. The Hermarchus-Spinoza complex both provides a historical depth to the undoing of the naturalism vs constructivism binary and describes performativity in instrumental terms, which challenges ingrained assumptions arising from the critique of instrumental reason.",

          "abstract": "What role do canonical figureheads play in the process by which philosophical ideas gain political substance? This paper explores an interpretive shift in the reception of Plato in eighteenth-century Europe, focusing on Voltaire’s Socrate (1759), a three-act play dramatizing the trial and death of Socrates. I advance a reading of the play as an effort to offer a new political extension of a recent epistemological realignment in interpretations of Plato’s philosophy. Plato’s eighteenth-century readers developed an understanding of his epistemology that negotiated a compromise between Neoplatonism and Academic Skepticism. Working out the political ramifications of this compromise, I argue, was central to Voltaire’s reimagination of Socrates’s trial. In turn, Voltaire’s play calls attention to a neglected dimension in which the contingencies of historically situated, idiosyncratic interpretations can bear out in the dynamics of disciplinary canons: how authors’ philosophical receptions interact with their receptions in political thought. At the same time, the play also offers a case study of an intervention in the symbolic meanings of Plato, one in which the deep-rooted associations he accrued in two ancient traditions that claimed him as a figurehead were reshuffled in a distinctly modern, political key.",

          "authors": "John Medearis",
          "abstract": "For decades, the most prominent philosophical work on protest has focused on disobedience. Such work has deemphasized protests that are presumed lawful, especially strikes, boycotts, and mass street protests. It has also perpetuated an inadequate vision of law, lawmaking, and their relationship to protest in liberal constitutional polities—a vision of who makes law, how it is made, the posture of lawmakers toward protest, and the democratic significance of law. A survey of the legal history of strikes, boycotts, and mass street protests demonstrates that this vision is too limited. Most significantly, it shows that disobedience is not necessarily disobedience to democratic authority, even where liberal constitutions reign. Historical review also uncovers the vital importance of legal repression. So any critical philosophy of protest should incorporate a much more realistic vision of law. And these findings about law and protest, when considered along with longstanding doubts about some of the ideas that are foundational to the disobedience literature, also undermine the case for sustaining a special focus on disobedient protest.",

          "authors": "Lucy Britt",
          "abstract": "What would it look like to flee oppression and violence if you could not get very far away? Although enslaved people’s fugitivity in the United States is often understood through the story of complete escape, there were many more enslaved people who fled within slave states. This article defines liminal fugitivity as a type of flight in which enslaved people fled to peripheral spaces near sites of enslavement, such as crawl spaces, edges of forests, or borders of towns and plantations. It reads Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl as an illustration of liminal fugitivity. Jacobs spent seven years hiding in an attic near the home of her enslaver in order to watch over her children and secure their escape. Her narrative both shows how enslaved women’s lives often necessitated fugitivity within slave states and illustrates some of the generative possibilities of liminal fugitivity. In particular, liminal fugitivity illustrates the importance of kinship and social ties, as hiding in liminal spaces allowed fugitives to escape while retaining networks of care. This article contributes to recent work on fugitivity and fugitive democracy by theorizing liminal fugitivity’s relational characteristics as a form of resistance to slavery itself, as enslaved people who fled to keep their families together were refusing the regime of family separation on which U.S. chattel slavery partially depended. This political ethos may be generative for fugitive politics and theory today, particularly regarding fleeing injustice within systems of oppression that are impossible to fully escape.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of “speculative expropriation” to reframe Marx’s analysis of expropriation in the context of settler colonialism and capitalism in the West. I begin by examining Marx’s ideas of primitive accumulation and original expropriation, showing how his incomplete analysis of social relations to land can be extended to the trans-Atlantic context. Drawing on Marx’s pre- Capital manuscripts, I examine his treatment of ground rent and its relationship to feudalism, highlighting how the development of capitalism in the West relied on mechanisms overlooked in conventional readings of Marx’s work. I argue that settler colonialism in the New World did not follow the same logic as European primitive accumulation, where land was taken from peasants. Instead, speculative expropriators gave land to settlers, but only under specific racial and gendered conditions that tied landowners to the financial and political systems of the settler state. The land was often granted with mortgages and preemptive land sales, which placed settlers in debt and subjected them to the control of colonial institutions. This financial framework, grounded in the dispossession and genocide of Indigenous peoples, allowed capitalism to expand through speculative real estate and colonial constructs. By theorizing speculative expropriation, I show how the dynamics of settler colonialism reinvented capitalist accumulation, turning land ownership into a means of controlling settlers through debt rather than directly extracting their labor. This framework provides a new lens for understanding how capitalism expanded across the Atlantic and solidified its global reach in tandem with Indigenous dispossession and population replacement.",

This large‐scale study was further supported by two experimental studies (Studies 2 and 3, n = 449) elucidating the mechanisms and causality involved in these processes. Our findings showed that corruption leads individuals to ascribe lower morality to politicians, which in turn is associated with lower perceptions of justice. Our data show that this process is negatively associated with well‐being, contributing to a broader understanding of how corruption impacts individuals and societies.",

We base our study on large‐n representative survey data from Denmark ( N = 1048) and the United States ( N = 1046), including the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) battery of questions. We observe strong cross‐country similarities that adjusting positively correlates with trust, while concealing negatively correlates with trust. We furthermore show that affective style contributes novel explanatory power beyond personality traits. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the role of emotions in politics, providing salient insights into individual ways of processing and responding to emotions and how that impacts politically salient outcome variables like trust.",

In three studies (total N = 4144), we demonstrate that (1) national collective narcissism independently predicts higher need for chaos and anti‐establishment orientation, (2) non‐narcissistic ingroup satisfaction independently predicts lower levels of both contrarian orientations, (3) grandiose narcissism independently predicts higher need for chaos but not anti‐establishment orientation, and (4) vulnerable narcissism independently predicts higher levels of both outcomes. We provide evidence for these relationships in cross‐sectional regression analyses and in panel analyses that examine within‐person construct changes from before to after the 2023 Polish election and better account for time‐invariant confounders. Together, these findings suggest contrarian orientations may reflect a (frustrated) narcissistic demand to be recognized as better than others, both collectively and individually.",

Typically, they have knowledge of, identification with, and internalization of more than one culture. This allows them to support international knowledge flows and facilitate intercultural social networks by engaging in cultural brokering — the act of facilitating interactions across cultures. In a series of four studies employing qualitative and quantitative methods, we developed and validated a context-general assessment of cultural brokering. The result is a scale assessing the frequency of five cultural brokering behaviors: interpreting culturally based behavior, teaching others about a cultural group, mediating between cultures, advocating for a cultural group, and advising people across cultures. Since this scale is not limited by organizational context, it can be used to assess and leverage cultural brokering across a wide range of settings that would benefit from cultural brokering, including multinational enterprises (MNEs), international nongovernmental organization (NGOs), and intergovernmental associations.",

          "authors": "Michiel de Haas, Ewout Frankema",
          "abstract": "Popular and political concerns about accelerating migration from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are often framed through migration transition theory, which posits that as poor regions develop, migration rates first rise and later decline after surpassing a certain development threshold. SSA is widely viewed by scholars, pundits, and policymakers as the region where migration rates have only just begun to climb the upward slope. Adopting a long-run historical perspective, we revise this image in three respects. First, although migration out of SSA has recently increased, Africans overall have not become more migratory since colonial times. The share of Africans living abroad was high in the 1960s, reflecting the legacy of large-scale interterritorial migration during the colonial era. Second, voluntary mass migration within Africa expanded rapidly in an era that is not typically regarded as “developmental,” after the abolition of slavery in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Large numbers of voluntary migrants, often extremely poor by historical standards, moved toward zones of cash-crop production and mining, and later increasingly to urban destinations. Third, we argue that the recent surge in extracontinental migration reflects a shift in destinations within a much longer migration transition rather than its early stage. This shift was driven by narrowing spatial opportunity gaps within Africa, growing hostility to intra-African migration in the context of nation building, and the simultaneous expansion of capabilities and opportunities for migration beyond the continent.",

This study investigates how frequent relocations during childhood influence the development of social capital in adulthood. Using a combination of retrospective and longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of the Swiss population (N = 4,451), we examine how identity formation and the sense of agency jointly shape individuals’ ability to sustain supportive networks over time. Results from structural equation modelling show that individuals who experienced frequent moves in childhood tend to identify less with the city, region, and country in which they live; yet this appears to have no direct consequences for their social capital. In contrast, they report a stronger sense of personal agency—defined as feeling more confident in addressing problems and making decisions—which, in turn, enhances their ability to maintain supportive networks. Overall, the findings highlight that residential mobility in childhood is a complex phenomenon that reshapes how individuals relate to the communities they belong to, to themselves, and to others across the life course.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to curb online hate speech depend on our ability to reliably detect it at scale. Previous studies have highlighted the strong zero-shot classification performance of large language models (LLMs), offering a potential tool to efficiently identify harmful content. Yet for complex and ambivalent tasks like hate speech detection, pre-trained LLMs can be insufficient and carry systemic biases. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for the given task and empirical context could help address these issues, but, as we demonstrate, the quality of data used for fine-tuning decisively matters. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini using a unique corpus of online comments annotated by diverse groups of coders with varying annotation quality: research assistants, activists, two kinds of crowd workers, and citizen scientists. We find that only annotations from those groups of annotators that are better than zero-shot GPT-4o-mini in recognizing hate speech improve the classification performance of the fine-tuned LLM. Specifically, fine-tuning using the highest-quality annotator group – trained research assistants – boosts classification performance by increasing the model’s precision without notably sacrificing the good recall of zero-shot GPT-4o-mini. In contrast, lower-quality annotations do not improve and may even decrease the ability to identify hate speech. By examining tasks reliant on human judgment and context, we offer insights that go beyond hate speech detection.",

          "authors": "Leonardo Carella, Francesco Raffaelli",
          "abstract": "This paper considers how issue salience environments affect long-term patterns of political choice via processes of political socialization. Drawing on the well-known ‘impressionable years’ hypothesis, we theorize that voters who grew up in high-immigration salience contexts subsequently exhibit higher levels of voter-party agreement on immigration (issue congruence). We find support for this hypothesis from two studies, which leverage cross-sectional variation within cohorts in exposure to immigration salience in voters’ formative years. The first employs congruence data from a survey of 10 European countries, linked to historical salience data from the Comparative Manifesto Project. The second is a within-country study, measuring salience and congruence from two long-running German public opinion survey series. The analysis suggests that growing up at times when immigration is high on the political agenda can have long-term consequences for the relationship between voters’ preferences on that issue and their political choices, shedding light on the mechanism behind ‘generational realignment’.",

Yet, this perception can be corrected through the provision of actual information, which in turn enhances the support for the sanction. Contrasting sanctions’ costs with other costs – Covid-19 costs and costs imposed on target countries – has no additional effect.",

          "abstract": "New parties have emerged across European democracies, forcing established parties to develop strategies to campaign against them. But how do supporters want their established parties to respond to these new parties? Using survey experiments in 14 European countries, we examine how party supporters react to responses their preferred parties might take to the rise of a hypothetical new party. Our results primarily highlight that voters care about substantive representation. They endorse accommodative responses towards a new party offering a policy they agree with. Thus, the extent to which party responses bind supporters to established parties is highly contingent on the distribution of policy positions among their supporters. Often, established parties must walk a precarious tightrope, balancing the need for unity with some degree of tolerance for dissent. Hence, our results explain why parties accommodate the position of new parties, despite recent evidence that doing so can be electorally detrimental.",

          "abstract": "We introduce and seek to explain a new and surprising fact about members of the US Congress: since at least the 1980s, Congresswomen have been substantially wealthier than Congressmen serving in the same party and decade. We articulate three mechanisms that could explain this gender wealth gap, and use new data on the backgrounds and families of members of Congress to evaluate each mechanism. We find no evidence that the wealth gap arises because districts likely to elect women also elect wealthier members, or because women had more lucrative pre‐Congressional careers. We do find evidence that the gap can be explained by women facing steeper challenges that wealth helps them overcome—particularly related to caregiving—and by Congresswomen's spouses earning more money than Congressmen's spouses. Our analysis sheds light on how obstacles facing ambitious women can lead to apparently counterintuitive advantages among the women who manage to succeed.",

Based on fieldwork with two LGBTIQ+ organizations and in-depth conversations with trans applicants in Belgium, this article demonstrates the need for a grounded, intersectional understanding of their gender identity, gender expression, and migration status. The applicants’ encounters with a variety of discourses and practices expand their understanding of transness as a category of protection and vulnerability. In addition, the applicants’ transness constantly intersects with their refugeeness, forcing them to navigate new isolations and discriminations instead of enjoying the freedom they expected to find. This article not only shows how interconnected and fluid transness and refugeeness are, but how this affects the lived experiences of trans refugees, and how they strategically learn to adapt their self-identification and -presentation to the gendered, racialized, and classed structures of their country of arrival.",

Leveraging a recent institutional reform in China, where municipal-level environmental courts were introduced to strengthen China’s environmental governance, we use a multi-period difference-in-differences approach to assess their influence on environmental misconduct among a key group of policy targets: local businesses. Our findings indicate that these specialized venues significantly deter environmental misconduct, with stronger effects observed among larger firms and those in less-polluting industries. Mechanism analyses further show that increases in firms’ innovation efforts, rather than enhanced government attention to environmental issues, help explain these observed compliance improvements, clarifying the causal pathways through which venue specialization enhances policy compliance. By linking institutional design directly to compliance outcomes, we move beyond the conventional process-oriented focus of policy venue research and demonstrate how new, specialized institutions affect governance outcomes. Additionally, our study offers new insights into the distinctive institutional capacities and policy impacts of judicial venues, complementing prior research that has primarily examined executive, legislative, or hybrid collaborative policy venues.",

We develop the concept of fictive politics to illuminate how actors simulate selective, alternative, or entirely fictional representations of reality while dissimulating incompatible facts. We distinguish three ideal types: deceptions, where audiences are unaware that they are facing a fiction; veiled facts, where audiences suspect a fiction but choose not to probe it; and open fictions, where audiences are fully aware that they are witnessing a fiction. We show that fictions answer critical political needs, including maintaining systems of domination, managing conflicts between competing interests and values, and facilitating cooperation between state and society.",

Situating the multiple crises in a long-term perspective on the transformation of party systems, we emphasize their reinforcing effect on the structuring capacity of the new cultural divide. In some countries, this divide and its main driving forces have become so powerful in transforming the political space that we observe an emerging multi-polar pattern of party configurations. This pattern is characterized by a green new left opposed to the populist radical right on the new cultural dimension. In contrast, the center-left and the center-right, despite converging, still oppose each other on the economic dimension. Empirically, the article examines election campaigns in Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, drawing on the original PolDem relational content analysis of mass media coverage published before national elections from the 1970s up to 2022.",

          "abstract": "Far-right communication often portrays a division between ‘the people’ and perceived antagonists, potentially fuelling intergroup tensions. A pivotal element is the politicisation of religion: in Christian-shaped regions, far-right parties invoke Christianity as part of Western identity – despite their weak religious ties and growing secularisation. This paradox raises questions about religion’s function in far-right discourse. I argue that far-right parties systematically use a conservative reading of Christianity as a demarcation tool – marking not only Islam but also cultural liberalism as incompatible with a Christian-framed ingroup. Using parliamentary data from Europe, I conduct automated text classification to identify religious markers and their co-occurrence with inclusionary–exclusionary rhetoric across countries and over time. Results reveal group-specific framing, distinct patterns of religious invocation compared to other parties, and links of these patterns to events. This study demonstrates how Christian narratives serve as rhetorical resources for boundary construction, challenging the cohesion of even secularised societies.",

          "abstract": "Early studies of policy termination focused on identifying the drivers and barriers to ending programs, such as the emergence of fiscal and other exigencies, which can lead to policy and program cancellation, but also noted that such factors do not always lead to closure. More recent work has advanced thinking on the subject and acknowledged a wider range of possible policy choices beyond simple cancellation, including modest reform or termination of small parts of a policy and more substantial partial dismantling, and in so doing has altered the nature of the field. Both these literatures to date, however, have struggled to identify the underlying reasons for alternative courses of action, focusing almost exclusively on the relative strengths and balance of power of social coalitions promoting termination versus those supporting the status quo, which is at best indicative. This logic also fails to deal with terminations that occur in spheres where social actors are less prominent, which are the subject of this article. The article uses examples from defense policy and military spending in Canada to examine the rise, cancellation, resurrection, and downscaling of several interlinked major naval weapons programs over the period 1975–2025 in order to explore the dynamics present in state-driven terminations. It focuses particular attention on the role of changing government commitments to programs and requests desired by armed forces, highlighting program continuation when government-service visions remain aligned and termination or dismantling when they do not.",

A comparative content analysis of 2053 debunking articles by 16 Meta partners across 8 European and Latin American countries reveals that most false content was labeled or remained online, with deletion occurring in approximately 30% of cases—though it remains unclear whether the removal was carried out by Facebook or by the original spreaders. In addition to 30 expert interviews, the study finds that fact-checkers prioritize counter-speech and transparency, rejecting a permissive “anything goes” stance. Some support removals in cases involving incitement to violence, illegality, or harmful health misinformation. Most agree that freedom of expression should not guarantee algorithmic amplification. Concerns were also raised about the politicization and potential manipulation of Community Notes.",

          "abstract": "To explore the strengthening role of influencer marketing agencies, this study turns its focus away from creators to the ‘backstage’ of feminised social media work. Using an algorithmic ethnographic approach informed by critical feminist inquiry, this study investigates how influencer marketing agencies’ data practices shape content creation. Through observation and content analysis of creator events, staff meetings, briefings, webinars and other educational material, as well as interviews with staff members, three distinct categories connected with data practices were recognised: anticipation, adaptation and negotiation. It is argued that while influencer agencies negotiate between creation and platform control, they only rarely resist the algorithmic logics of platforms or negotiate practices to fit their ideals instead of adapting to platforms and their business models. Situating agencies’ daily work within the larger historical tradition of advertising, commodification of audiences and feminised labour, this study offers pathways for understanding how influencer marketing shapes social media today.",

This study examines how youth groups, known as coletivos , from low-income communities in Brazil used social media platforms during the pandemic to organize themselves. Our analysis focuses on the intersectionality of place and digital activism. Using in-depth interviews and online observation, the findings are analyzed through three lenses: the groups’ understanding of place, how the pandemic affected their place functioning and sense-making (agenda-focused, local-focused, and agenda-local groups), and how this process strengthens the different types of places (ranging from online to physical communities, encompassing local neighborhoods to national level groups). We show a significant variation across groups in the relationship between Internet dependency and place of action. Findings also demonstrate how the groups adapted their collective action toolkit to suit the digital platforms and developed new ones.

Our analysis mobilizes primary data from ethnographic fieldwork collected at music trade conferences between 2023 and 2024 and secondary data from trade press, corporate statements, reports published by governments, unions, and trade bodies. Our analysis illuminates tensions and contradictions among protectionist, liberalizing, and conciliatory views toward generative AI. Some corporate actors and public stakeholders advocate for protectionist business policies and “responsible” AI development that foregrounds potential harms of AI. Other corporate actors offer more liberalizing views, encouraging investment, experimentation, and adoption of generative AI systems to cut costs and increase profits. We also note conciliatory positions, mainly from musicians’ unions and trade bodies, trying to find compromises between these two poles. We argue that these contradictions reveal a fundamentally misunderstood notion of universal AI ethics in the music industry.",

          "abstract": "Social media is where most people report experiencing toxicity. While existing research has documented the prevalence and predictors of toxic behaviors, less is known about how individuals who engage in toxicity perceive and justify their actions, especially on mainstream platforms. This study addresses this gap by conducting 25 in-depth interviews with individuals who were toxic in political discussions on Facebook and Twitter. The findings reveal that many view their toxicity as a form of political participation. Three distinct justifications for toxicity were identified: venting political frustrations, pursuing truth through blunt deliberation, and seeking to persuade or mobilize others. These findings suggest that toxic speech can function as a deliberate, albeit hostile, form of political engagement, and they highlight the diverse functions social media serves for politically motivated users. The study calls for targeted interventions to address the distinct motivations underlying toxicity.",

While challenges such as electricity, Internet connectivity, and cost of airtime persist, the key drivers for adoption emerged as community trust in co-designed low-power tools, alongside their usability.

Despite its widespread utility, there have been limited remarks on the perils of the screenshot feature as a methodological tool to capture the digital world. This article reflects on human communication research which has leveraged the screenshot feature. In doing so, I focus on bystanders , or non-consenting participants whose data are implicated by researchers’ use of the screenshot feature. Considering relevant US law, internationally recognized ethics frameworks, and user expectations across digital platforms from which screenshots are collected, this article offers guidelines for researchers and policymakers about usage of and building formal restrictions around the screenshot feature, respectively. I argue usage of the screenshot feature in human communication research must (1) obscure sensitive and extraneous participant data, (2) recognize platform-specific user expectations, and (3) protect bystander privacy.",

          "abstract": "This study employed virtual reality (VR) to examine how avatar embodiment (self vs stranger), virtual human race (ingroup vs outgroup), and contact valence (positive vs negative) influence intergroup attitudes. US participants ( N = 262) assigned to avatars displaying a stranger’s face, rather than their own, showed greater acceptance of outgroup virtual humans. Perceived identifiability mediated the influence of avatar face on self-other overlap. Social dominance orientation moderated this effect, as mediation was strongest among individuals with average and high scores. Positive contact enhanced self-other overlap with virtual humans, whereas negative contact unexpectedly increased empathy for outgroup members. Ingroup negative contact boosted positive ingroup feelings among participants using avatars that mirrored their own face. Consistent with positive ingroup biases, individuals reported greater positive feelings and empathy toward ingroup members following ingroup (vs outgroup) interactions. The results provided evidence regarding the theoretical mechanisms through which VR contact reduces and boosts prejudice.",

Against this background, we rely on a pre-registered experimental study in the United States ( N = 982) in which we exposed participants to various modes of textual and visual disinformation on two different issues: The disappearance of flight MH370 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Findings show that, for MH370, there was no difference in credibility between textual, AI-generated, or video-based disinformation. Yet, for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, video-based disinformation was perceived as more credible than textual or image-based disinformation. Our findings indicate that the consequences of visual disinformation are context-bound: Especially in the case of polarizing issues, the out-of-context placement of videos can serve as a plausible form of deceptive evidence.",

          "abstract": "People-Nearby Applications (PNAs) can impact users’ local social capital and sense of community (SoC), by allowing users to meet new people locally and enhance their SoC through increased local social capital and active involvement in the community of belonging. An online questionnaire was administered to 595 Italian and Dutch PNAs users to detect their PNAs community-related use, frequency of face-to-face encounters with other users, local social capital, active involvement, and SoC. A multiple mediation model was run using structural equation modeling. PNAs use associates to face-to-face encounters among local community members and community social capital, but not to community involvement. Through social capital, PNAs use indirectly enhances SoC. These results show that PNAs community-related use may enhance local community experiences through prompting face-to-face encounters among community fellows and making users feel more embedded into local social networks. This confirms PNAs community-related use potential to improve users’ neighborhood social and community experiences.",

          "abstract": "Anti-democratic counterpublic news media frequently open up participatory spaces, inviting their audiences to partake in the discussion of their content. However, research on how commenters engage in such participatory spaces opened up and overseen by anti-democratic actors is scarce. In order to fill this gap, we present in this article a case study of the 250 most active commenters on RT German’s Facebook page in a 6-month period at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Using a mixed-methods approach combining large-scale data scraping with quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we find that the majority of these highly active commenters constituted an anti-democratic counterpublic. However, we also observed a smaller collective of commenters, whom we theorize as “disruptive public” as they vigorously sought to challenge the activities of the anti-democratic counterpublic. We discuss the benefits and risks of various strategies of disrupting anti-democratic counterpublics and consequences for democratic debate.",

Using the administrative burden framework to compare interventions, I reclassify each intervention by the stage it measures on (application vs. final receipt) and whether it reduces the learning demands by providing information or the compliance demands by providing assistance. The results indicate that it is significantly easier to increase application rates than actual take‐up rates. On average, estimated treatment effects are about twice as large when outcomes are measured at the application stage as when they are measured on final benefit receipt. The most effective interventions are the ones reducing compliance demands, as these are estimated to increase actual take‐up by 8.31 percentage points on average. Interventions reducing learning demands are estimated to increase actual take‐up by 3.39 percentage points on average. These findings consolidate the field experimental evidence on how to improve take‐up rates and highlight the need for further research on application stages, treatment compliance, and variation across welfare regimes.",

This article charts and provides explanations for the principal shifts in how we understand climate change as political, focusing on the constantly diversifying sets of sites and actors involved; its expanding scope, from interstate negotiations to the full range of daily practices; the “climatization” of many realms of political and social life; and its increasing framing as a problem of political-economic transformation. We conclude by interrogating whether politics as such is now something that can be fully understood and practiced only via many interventions and conflicts where climate change is central.",

Drawing on articles published in GEP and twenty political science and interdisciplinary journals, we identify three key research themes: the persistent problem of time inconsistency and credible commitment, the rapid rise of net-zero targets and long-term low emissions development strategies, and a shift from analyzing climate mitigation as an international collective action problem toward framing it as a distributive-conflict problem within domestic economies. Building on these themes, we outline four open research challenges for the long-term environmental policy community—ranging from assessing long-term targets and policy instrument mixes to designing intergenerational compensation schemes—that may guide future research and improve the practical design of credible climate and environmental policy.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, three overlapping trends have fundamentally reshaped and now characterize the global geopolitical order: the rise of emerging powers, increasing military conflicts, and growing international trade tensions. These features of the global order are deeply connected to global environmental politics (GEP) and governance, as a warming world spurs some aspects of geopolitical change, while the geopolitical dynamics themselves have far-reaching environmental consequences. Given this, we call on GEP researchers to bring geopolitics more fully back into their analyses to better explain the new dynamics of environmental politics and governance in a changing world. We identify four priority areas for future inquiry for GEP scholarship: the race for critical minerals, ecological dimensions of land conquests, the trade–environment nexus in the context of trade tensions and blocs, and the interplay of the rise of authoritarian populism and political polarization and global environmental change.",

          "abstract": "China’s role in global environmental politics (GEP) has evolved dramatically over the past twenty-five years to occupy an increasingly paradoxical place in global climate politics. It has become both the world’s largest builder of renewable energy and its largest consumer of coal, as well as a climate leader of the South that rejects mandatory climate finance or technology obligations while providing support through South–South cooperation. This dual role presents a contradiction at the heart of global climate governance, leading to ambiguity surrounding China’s likely future climate leadership. We demonstrate how many of China’s key negotiating positions can be explained as a two-level game balancing domestic and international priorities. We focus on technology transfer and climate finance and on developments since Paris and outside of the UNFCCC context. Our findings contribute to an understanding of new dynamics in GEP, including changing power and leadership dynamics, and the increasingly central role of domestic industrial policy.",

          "abstract": "Negative out-group attitudes are often attributed to perceptions of competition or threat. We propose an alternative source: culture, conceptualized as cultural scripts—interconnected networks of meanings that link particular group identities to negatively connoted phenomena. Evidence comes from three studies on the reactivation of the cultural script of traditional antisemitism in Germany. We begin our analysis by isolating the cultural script through automated analysis of a corpus of antisemitic texts. Next, using survey data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic ( n = 17,800), we document an increase in antisemitism among Christian believers. This, we argue, is due to the pandemic activating the cultural script of traditional antisemitism, which links Judaism with the spread of disease. By means of an additional survey ( n = 2,000) and a concept association task, we demonstrate the presence of the cultural script in the minds of Christian believers. Two priming experiments explore how elements of the script can be triggered. Our work demonstrates the deep cultural roots of negative out-group attitudes and suggests a novel set of methods for studying them.",

          "authors": "Lauren Sukin, J. Luis Rodriguez, Stephen Herzog",
          "abstract": "Backers of nuclear deterrence are thought to use strategic logic, while nuclear disarmament advocates are believed to embrace moral reasoning. Yet policy makers and diverse publics may hold both—ostensibly contradictory—preferences. Recent studies find that publics in Western democratic countries support the nuclear strikes underpinning long-standing conceptions of deterrence policy. But other scholarship indicates that these very same publics want to abolish nuclear arsenals. A lack of comparative analyses across the Global North and the Global South limits the generalizability of these claims. Does a categorical dichotomy between nuclear deterrence and disarmament really reflect global public views on the bomb? What explains a multitude of seemingly inconsistent scholarly results? In this reflection essay, we argue that deterrence and disarmament are not necessarily incompatible tools for reducing nuclear dangers. We point to several ways that individuals might simultaneously accommodate both pro- and antinuclear weapons policy positions. To investigate this proposition, we offer a new observational dataset on global nuclear attitudes from a survey we conducted in 24 countries on six continents ( N = 27,250). Unlike isolated studies of these phenomena, our data strongly confirm that publics do not subscribe to categorical views of nuclear weapons. This headline finding and novel dataset open new possibilities for studying nuclear politics.",

          "authors": "Kris Hyesoo Lee, Yi′En Cheng, Sivarin Lertpusit, Yun Ge, Brenda S. A. Yeoh, Kong Chong Ho",
          "abstract": "Chinese student mobilities within Asia have expanded significantly amid the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and shifting geopolitical conditions. This paper examines Chinese youth studying in two prominent Southeast Asian destinations—Thailand and Singapore—to understand how their aspirations intersect with macro‐structural forces to shape differentiated mobility pathways. Drawing on interviews with 59 participants, we explore three interrelated themes: (1) how geopolitical and geoeconomic developments reconfigure opportunity structures for Chinese youth; (2) how students navigate enduring hierarchies within the regional and global landscapes of higher education; and (3) how transregional education spaces reshape future‐making projects under conditions of heightened uncertainty. Our findings reveal that in Thailand, the BRI has widened access to regional education‐migration opportunities for Chinese youth by expanding institutional linkages and legitimising alternative mobility routes. In contrast, Chinese students in Singapore rarely frame their educational choices through the BRI, instead mobilising other forms of capital within established hierarchies of international education. Despite the emergence of diversified intra‐Asian pathways beyond traditional Western destinations, students' aspirations remain structured by stratified geographies of higher education and calibrated to broader geopolitical dynamics. By foregrounding the interplay between macro‐structural forces and individual mobility projects, this paper highlights how diversified yet hierarchical aspirational pathways are forged within an evolving transregional educational landscape.",

          "authors": "Yiqing Gan, Yuying Tong",
          "abstract": "The debate over whether migration serves as a viable livelihood strategy for enhancing rural household economic development has persisted for decades. Existing research is limited by three key shortcomings: neglecting the roles of key household members, oversimplifying the dichotomy between migrants and nonmigrants, and adopting a static view of household income without considering its growth trajectory. This study addresses these gaps by employing growth curve models and analyzing six waves of data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) spanning the period from 2010 to 2020. We examine how the livelihood choices of rural household heads—farming, local nonfarm work, and migration—affect household income growth trajectories. Our findings indicate that the livelihood choice of the household head is a significant predictor of household income growth. Although migrant‑headed households typically enjoy an economic advantage, the beneficial effects of migration for this depend on the household's life stage, with younger and female‑headed households and those undertaking short‑term migration experiencing more substantial gains. Extending the migration period has minimal effect on accelerating the rate​ of household income growth. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between migration and rural household economic well‐being in China, thereby advancing the literature on development and gender equity in migrant‐sending areas.",

          "abstract": "Regional economic disparities and fertility decline have intensified concurrently in South Korea, yet few studies have directly examined their relationship. This study investigates how widening regional inequality, a spatial form of socioeconomic stratification, influences fertility outcomes by applying Yitzhaki's relative deprivation index. Using spatial panel models with two‐way fixed effects for 229 districts from 2015 to 2021 and multilevel models of married women aged 19 to 49 from the 2020 Population and Housing Census, the analyses consistently demonstrate negative associations between regional disparity and fertility. In the spatial panel analysis, growth in disparity reveals a significant negative effect on crude birth rates, while the multilevel models confirm that regions with sharper increases in inequality recorded fewer births per woman. These findings suggest a potential mechanism through which the demographic–economic paradox operates and provide empirical support for extending relative deprivation theory to the regional scale.",

Research on talent attraction and in particular retention of in‐migrated talent in peripheral regions is still limited. Based on a case study in the Cradle Coast region of Tasmania, Australia, we argue that, although local stakeholders are working towards attracting more creative talent, they are also reproducing dynamics that work against job creation and retention on various levels, such as promoting quietness or prioritising social embeddedness, and long‐term ties to the region. These dynamics are hard to address as they are tied up in social values and notions of what constitutes the good life in a rural setting.",

          "authors": "Louis Stockwell, Ece Özlem Atikcan",
          "abstract": "In the contemporary ‘age of participation’, referendums are often celebrated as cornerstones of democratic engagement. Yet political parties sometimes take the seemingly paradoxical step of calling for referendum boycotts, urging citizens to abstain from direct democratic processes. This paper investigates the conditions under which such boycott calls occur and the motivations behind them. While previous research has largely focused on single cases or experimental designs, we offer the first comprehensive, comparative study of party-led referendum boycotts across Europe since 1972. Drawing on a novel dataset of 223 referendums in 37 countries, we combine quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how regime context, institutional design, and issue type shape boycott behavior. Our regression analyses show that turnout quorum requirements, lower levels of democratic maturity, and sovereignty-related referendum issues significantly increase the likelihood of boycotts. To complement these findings, we qualitatively analyze boycott justifications and develop a typology of six motivation types: legitimacy-based, procedural unfairness, instrumental, tactical, minority interest, and ideological boycotts. These results reveal a complex interplay between democratic institutions and political strategy, challenging the assumption that referendums are universally inclusive tools. Our findings have implications for the design, interpretation, and normative evaluation of direct democratic practices across diverse political systems.",

Its increasing threat to ecological stability and intergenerational well‐being has propelled corporations, once viewed solely as economic entities, into the forefront of climate‐justice debates. This Advanced Review surveys scholarly developments, mainly from the early 2000s to 2025, on the ethical principles, institutional structures, and practical performance of corporate climate responsibility. Focusing on traditional distributive factors, such as causality and capacity, along with the emerging importance of collaboration, the article examines how the literature addresses corporate responsibility in climate issues. It differentiates between corporations as secondary justice agents or market‐driven actors, whose duties involve mitigation, and primary agents or political actors, tasked with influencing regulations, advocating responsibly, and addressing systemic inequalities. The review clarifies the spectrum of interventions and evaluation metrics while exploring conflicts between profit motives and sustainability. It concludes by outlining a future research agenda at the intersection of political philosophy, business ethics, and climate ethics.

Our findings reveal that ignoring contamination significantly underestimates the role of maternal non‐cognitive skills in the evolution of child noncognitive skills. Additionally, we find evidence of stronger feedback effects from child skills to mothers than fathers. Simulation exercises demonstrate how contamination can distort evaluations of early childhood policies, underscoring the importance of robust measurement approaches.",

Our model considers relative capital‐skill complementarities across tasks, leading to the polarization of capital and technology by task complexity, which in turn drives the polarization of job and wage growth by talent levels. Regarding optimal tax policy, the wage compression channel remains effective through the trickle‐down effect of subsidizing high‐wage earners and taxing low‐wage earners. Yet, the wage compression channel via capital, corporate, and R&amp;D taxes, aimed at reducing wage inequality, does not operate via a trickle‐down effect. Instead, it works by taxing capital income and R&amp;D investments in high‐task‐complexity sectors while subsidizing those in low‐task‐complex sectors. Moreover, we identify a Pigouvian effect that arises to address spillovers, which modifies the marginal tax rates on labor income, capital income, firm profits, and R&amp;D investments.",

Our approach works by first characterizing how an agent is linked in the network using the configuration of other agents and connections nearby as measured by path distance. The impact of a policy or treatment assignment is then learned by pooling outcome data across similarly configured agents. We demonstrate the approach by deriving finite‐sample bounds on the mean‐squared error of a k‐nearest neighbor estimator for the average treatment response as well as proposing an asymptotically valid test for the hypothesis of policy irrelevance. We illustrate the empirical applicability of our method with simulations and an application to social capital formation.",

We reestablish conditions for existence of a Markov perfect equilibrium in the generalized model and consider identification of the model primitives with only discrete‐time data sampled at fixed intervals. Three foundational example models are considered: a single agent renewal model, a dynamic entry and exit model, and a quality ladder model. Through these examples we examine the computational and statistical properties of estimators via Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical example using data from Rust (1987). The experiments show how parameter estimates behave when moving from continuous‐time data to discrete‐time data of decreasing frequency and the computational feasibility as the number of firms grows. The empirical example highlights the impact of allowing decision rates to vary.",

This difference is the lemons penalty imposed on holders of high‐quality cars. We estimate the evolution of the lemons penalty through an equilibrium model of car ownership with private information using Danish linked registry data on car ownership, income, and wealth. We examine the aggregate implications and distributional consequences of these penalties. In the first year of ownership, we estimate that the lemons penalty is 12% of the price. The penalty declines sharply with the length of ownership. It reduces the self‐insurance value of cars and leads to a large reduction in transaction volumes and the rate of car turnover. The market does not collapse: income shocks induce households to sell their cars, even if they are of good quality, and this helps mitigate the lemons problem. The size of the lemons penalty declines when income uncertainty in the economy increases and when the supply of credit decreases.",

          "authors": "Shuaishuai Wang, Jing Meng, Yitong Li",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how TikTok Shop reproduces the e‐commerce model of Douyin Shop against a backdrop of divergent regulatory challenges and geopolitical distrust. One of the strategic changes we observe in TikTok Shop is the shift of consumer goods suppliers from local merchants to China‐based sellers. The Chinese supply chain is thereby platformized into TikTok's global e‐commerce ecosystem through partnerships with local shipping, warehousing, and international settlements providers. Building on the paradigm shift from location analysis to spatial analysis, as proposed in existing scholarship, we argue that an analytical approach centered on the national origin of platforms obscures the corporate‐led, cross‐border deployment of resources, which scopes value spatially. Although transnational platforms may appear subordinate to state power under which they operate, there is a generative interplay between border‐bound components and borderless intangible assets such as data‐based digital intelligence. This interplay extends digital platforms both geographically and spatially by incorporating territory‐bound business actors into a reconfigured transnational space in pursuit of global profit.",

This leverage varies over time and depends on status quo effects and asymmetries in legal treatment of assets. The results show how local politics and policies are linked to wealth disparities.

The main friction is private and evolving valuation of the buyer prior to the date of consumption, which follows a Poisson process. A combination of membership fees and continuously increasing prices induces a threshold response from the buyer, endogenously segmenting the market along timing of purchase. This pricing mechanism achieves the deterministic global optimum. The tools developed here are shown to be useful in thinking about global incentives in dynamic mechanisms, and mapping dynamic pricing to the classic taxonomy of consumer-producer surplus and deadweight loss.

Yet the observable interactions that reveal these networks are often sparse and noisy, making it unclear how people could infer the latent structure of their social environments from such limited evidence. We propose that humans integrate domain-general statistical learning with domain-specific models of social structures to rapidly construct causal representations that support explanation, prediction, and planning. Across three behavioral experiments, we show that participants can infer underlying social structures (Experiment 1), predict social behavior (Experiment 2), and reason about the spread of social influence (Experiment 3), based on brief, abstract videos of social interactions. These judgments were closely captured by a computational model grounded in our account and could not be explained by simpler cue-based accounts. Statistical learning and causal reasoning operate in concert to support rapid, flexible understanding of social structures.",

          "abstract": "Representing the will of voters is challenging when many opt out of indicating their preferences. Such opt-out behavior has been explained by voters lacking a preference and/or disliking their options. We provide evidence for a third account: people opt out of choosing between undesirable candidates because bad options are incongruent with their typical goal of selecting the best one. Using a voting task, we show across two lab-based studies that the tendency to opt out of choices between bad candidates is eliminated when participants are asked to reject the worst candidate. Leveraging our experimental findings, we simulate elections and show that rejection-based voting can produce election outcomes that are more representative of the preferences of the electorate. To validate this prediction, we conduct two Prolific surveys of self-reported US Independents before the 2024 US presidential election, and show that people are less likely to respond “undecided” when asked who they will vote against rather than who they will vote for. Our findings help understand when and how people vote, and how to better reveal the preferences of voters who know which candidates they like least but are unwilling to endorse the one they like most.",

To enhance our understanding of these developments, we examine subnational ( N = 450) mortality trends in Western Europe in the period 1992-2019. Between 1992 and 2005, gains in life expectancy were both substantial and widespread. Laggard regions experienced the fastest improvements, yielding rapid regional convergence. Between 2005 and 2019, however, gains in these regions decelerated, while remaining remarkably stable in vanguard regions, suggesting that it remains possible to continue extending longevity. The observed slowing of e 0 gains is strongly associated with mortality at ages 55-74, which increased in this period across large areas of Western Europe, particularly in Germany and France. In this work, we show that monitoring mortality trends at a fine geographical level is crucial for revealing both the potential for, and challenges to, sustainable progress in human longevity.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, synthetic contact matrices derived from mobility and behavioral data emerged as a scalable alternative to empirical contact surveys, yet their comparative performance remained unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate synthetic and empirical age-stratified contact matrices in France from March 2020 to May 2022, comparing contact patterns and their ability to reproduce observed epidemic dynamics. While both sources captured similar temporal trends in contacts, empirical matrices recorded 3.4 times more contacts for individuals under 19 than synthetic matrices during school-open periods. The model parameterized with synthetic matrices provided the best fit to hospital admissions and best captured hospitalization patterns for adolescents, adults, and seniors, whereas deviations remained for children across both models. Neither matrix allowed models to fully reproduce serological trends in children, highlighting the challenges both approaches face in capturing their disease-relevant contacts. The weekly update of synthetic matrices enabled smoother reconstructions of hospitalization trends during transitional phases, while empirical matrices required strong assumptions between survey waves. These findings support synthetic matrices as a reliable, flexible, cost-effective operational tool for real-time epidemic modeling, and highlight the need for routine collection of age-stratified mobility data to improve pandemic response.",

The fraction of externally originating co-benefits is greater in developing countries (0.76 in SSP1-26) than developed (0.65), indicating that developing countries are more dependent on external action. Although co-benefits are maximized in the most ambitious scenario, SSP1-19 (1.32 million deaths avoided), their transboundary exchange between countries varies. These results suggest a need for climate policies that consider how inequalities in transboundary air pollution evolve across distinct socioeconomic trends and mitigation strategies in addition to total co-benefit estimates.",

We find that people with HIV are less likely to be employed, work fewer hours, earn less income, and are more likely to receive disability benefits up to 7 years after diagnosis. These effects are more pronounced for those diagnosed with late-stage HIV disease. Those with a non-late stage diagnosis experience a deterioration of socioeconomic outcomes, despite being less likely to experience clinically relevant symptoms at diagnosis.

The cumulative effect of all climate policy portfolios over our study period amounts to 3.1 GtCO 2 fewer emissions in 2022 relative to a no-policy counterfactual - substantially less than what’s needed to stay on track for the Paris Agreement goals.",

          "abstract": "Many political science theories posit empirical relationships that are conditioned by some moderating variable, which scholars model using a multiplicative interaction term in a regression. In recent years, scholars have begun using such terms in dynamic regression models with time series data. However, the lack of guidance on adding multiplicative interactions to these workhorse models exposes problems with the consistency of the estimator, model restrictions, and interpretation. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidance to address these problems. First, we define the conditions under which scholars can ensure consistent estimates when estimating relationships conditioned by a moderating variable in dynamic models. Second, we introduce a general model that makes no theoretical assumptions about precisely how conditional relationships unfold over time. Third, we develop a flexible approach for interpreting such models. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework with simulation evidence and an empirical application.",

          "abstract": "How does femonationalism, defined as the selective invocation of gender equality to promote exclusionary anti-immigrant policies, affect citizens? While increasingly common across Western democracies, its impact on citizens’ preferences remains underexplored. This paper provides evidence from a preregistered survey experiment with 3,118 U.S. citizens, showing that femonationalist rhetoric can enhance opposition to pluralist policies in defense of progressive gender achievements. The effect is conditional on citizens’ prior immigration attitudes: anti-immigration individuals liberalize their gender views, while pro-immigration individuals demand stricter integration policies. The findings suggest that citizens are not consistent in their ideological preferences, especially when political elites frame liberal values as conflicting.",

          "abstract": "Is an autocracy’s official rhetoric a reliable proxy for forecasting military escalation? While the conventional hands-tying mechanism argues that official rhetoric binds leaders to stated positions and limits their ability to back down, recent scholarship on bluster suggests that autocracies may employ hawkish rhetoric to justify de-escalation ex-post. This study evaluates these competing perspectives by analyzing China’s official rhetoric and military behavior in the Taiwan Strait from 2016 to 2022. Employing a word-embedding approach, I construct an original Chinese-language lexicon capturing implicit threats from over two million state-media articles. I show that increases in China’s implicit threats toward Taiwan are associated with a higher likelihood of military escalation, implying that official rhetoric conveys predictive information rather than mere cheap talk.",

          "authors": "Molly Offer-Westort, Jiehan Liu, Nick Feamster, Kartik Garg, Nguyen Phong Hoang, Sudhamshu Hosamane",
          "abstract": "We test a social media conversational agent for canvassing on the topic of anti-transgender prejudice, replicating and benchmarking treatment effects. In-person deep canvassing is the gold standard for durably changing attitudes on polarizing topics. However, door-to-door canvassing is costly, and many populations may not be feasibly reached in this manner. Campaigns are already conducting outreach using digital tools, including text messages and social media. If appropriately trained agents messaging over social media can achieve a fraction of the effect of in-person canvassing, canvassing may be scaled up to achieve large overall impacts at lower costs. Scripts used in this application are based on those used by transgender allies in the original study. To personalize messaging, the conversational agent uses natural language processing to detect conversational topics, and shares relevant pre-scripted messages of information and third-person experiences, encouraging respondents to engage in perspective-taking with respect to an outgroup. This study demonstrates the potential of automated social media messaging for deep canvassing, with possible applications by governments, public health agencies, and political organizations. Estimated effects are positive and significant under covariate adjustment and reweighting; due to important differential attrition, partial-identification bounds are also reported and include zero.",

          "authors": "Oliver Mel Allen, Yi Zu, Milo Z. Trujillo, Brooke Foucault Welles",
          "abstract": "In this work, we collected and analyzed social media posts to investigate an aesthetic-based pipeline where users searching for Cottagecore content may find Tradwife content co-opted by white supremacists. Through quantitative analysis of over 200,000 Tumblr posts and qualitative coding of about 2350 Tumblr posts, we did not find evidence of an explicit radicalization. We found that problematic Tradwife posts found in the literature may be confined to Tradwife-only spaces, while content in the Cottagecore tag generally did not warrant extra moderation. However, we did find evidence of a mainstreaming effect in the overlap between the Tradwife and Cottagecore communities. In our qualitative analysis, there was more interaction between queer and Tradwife identities than expected based on the literature, and some Tradwives even explicitly included queer people and disavowed racism in the Tradwife community on Tumblr. This could be genuine, but we propose that this is an example of mainstreaming, where white supremacists re-brand their content and follow platform norms to spread ideologies that would otherwise be rejected. In addition, through temporal analysis, we observed a change in the central tags used by Tradwives in the Cottagecore tag pre- and post-2021. Initially, these posts focused on aesthetics and hobbies like baking and gardening, but post-2021, the central tags focused more on religion, traditional gender roles, and homemaking—all of which align with white supremacist rhetoric about womanhood.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how intersectional ideologies and experiences of marginalization affect the extent to which African Americans support or oppose the marginalization of LGBTQ+ communities. We posit that awareness of the race-gender positionality of African American women, as well as the unique positionalities of other marginalized African American subgroups, is critical to understanding the conditions under which Black Americans embrace LGBTQ+ rights and communities. Using the Black respondent subsample of the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Study, we test the extent to which intersectional theories explain African American cross-group consciousness with LGBTQ+ persons and support for LGBTQ+ rights and communities. In doing so, we distinguish multiple mechanisms through which identity intersections affect African American 1 political attitudes, and we find that, though intersecting marginalized identities can be critical to fomenting African Americans’ support for the rights and concerns of LGBTQ+ communities, not all intersections lead to a more inclusive Black politics.",

Using survey data from 1,096 Swedish-speaking Finns, the study uses trait-based evaluations of both ingroup and outgroup members. Results show that intergroup bias is prevalent, particularly in the form of ingroup favoritism for positive traits. Analyses reveal that strong ethnolinguistic identity and perceived intergroup threat significantly predict higher levels of bias, while language identity, Finnish language proficiency, and intergroup contact show no consistent relationships. These findings suggest that even in socially stable and egalitarian contexts, perceived threats to group identity can sustain intergroup bias.",

          "abstract": "Drawing from an interpretivist framework, this paper proposes Black Embodied Political Subjectivity (BEPS) as a conceptual framework that foregrounds the body, affect, and historical memory as critical to political subjectivity. BEPS draws on Black political thought to challenge dominant epistemologies that prioritize disembodied rationality and abstract ideological commitments over lived, felt, and corporeal political experiences. Rather than treating the body as an inert vessel or secondary site of politics, BEPS argues that the body is central to the ways Black people negotiate, contest, and reconstitute power in lived political contexts.",
