          "abstract": "Do perceived foreign policy failures shape assessments of a country’s leadership in the eyes of international observers? We explore the consequences of foreign policy failures using global reactions to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some argue that a poorly executed withdrawal heightened concerns about America’s soft power and image abroad. Others believe that the negative consequences of the withdrawal were exaggerated. To adjudicate between these claims, we compile public opinion surveys across 24 countries containing over 17,000 respondents. Analyzing perceptions of US leadership before and after the fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021, we find that the Afghanistan withdrawal had a substantive negative impact on global perceptions of US leadership. However, we observe no corresponding evidence that the attractiveness of great powers is ‘zero-sum’: decreases in favorability towards the United States were not paralleled by increases in the perceived attractiveness of alternatives to US leadership like Russia and China.",

          "abstract": "According to influential theories of modernization and individualization, social class has ceased to be relevant to citizens and their political behaviour in Western countries; class has been proclaimed ‘dead’. The argument is particularly strong at the subjective level where people are thought to no longer identify with social classes let alone relate this identification to politics. Using time-series election study data covering many decades combined with manifesto data from the US, Britain, Denmark, and Norway, we challenge this view and show that levels of class identification have been stable. The relationship between class identification, attitudes to redistribution and vote choice has, however, changed but this appears to result more from political parties’ varying polarization on economic and social issues than from the demise of class in voters’ minds.",

          "abstract": "The qualitative analysis of open-ended interviews has vast potential in economics but has found limited use. This is partly because the interpretative, nuanced human reading of text and coding that it requires is labour intensive and very time consuming. This paper presents a method to simplify and shorten the coding process by extending a small sample of interpretative human-annotated interviews to a larger, representative, sample using supervised natural language processing. We extensively assess the robustness and reliability of this approach to show when and how it adds value, including an analysis of how many human-annotated documents are optimal for a budget constrained researcher. We apply this approach to analyse 2,200 open-ended interviews on parent’s aspirations for children with Rohingya refugees and their Bangladeshi hosts. We show that studying aspirations with open-ended interviews extends the economics focus on material goals to ideas from philosophy and anthropology that emphasize aspirations for moral and religious values, and the navigational capacity to achieve these aspirations. This approach allows us to identify several novel results including a new type of migrant selection; we show that Rohingya refugees are negatively selected on education but positively selected on navigational capacity.",

          "abstract": "We analyse the resilience of community-based institutions to large shocks. Our case study is on forest user groups in Nepal in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake. We combine remote sensing data with detailed administrative data on forest user groups and exploit spatial variation in the intensity of the earthquake. Using a triple difference strategy, we show that the earthquake-induced increase in deforestation is significantly lower in locations with a higher share of forest covered by forest user groups. Thus, these institutions lead to more sustainable use of forests when they are under pressure. Regarding potential mechanisms, survey data suggest that social capital plays a role for the positive effects of forest user groups. More generally, our findings show that shifting governance of local resources to community-based institutions can be an effective policy in times of increased pressure on natural resources.",

Consumers can have different attitudes to status: conformists have a greater incentive for conspicuous consumption when they have many well-off neighbours, while snobs have a greater incentive when they have few well-off neighbours. Despite the neighbourhood income distribution affecting the incentives of snobs and conformists in starkly different ways, I show that conspicuous consumption is always higher in a more segregated society.",

          "abstract": "The study offers a systematic review of scientific literature on ‘return migration’ performing computational text mining and topic modelling. On a sample of 3000 studies indexed in Scopus and published between 1960 and 2020, we present a textual analysis and a clusters' analysis of titles, keywords, abstracts and publications' metadata. Results show a rapid growth in research since the 1970s, mirroring the evolution of migration events and the pace of theoretical advancements. The research landscape appears dominated by receiving high‐income countries' perspective. Throughout the entire period, topics related to culture, ethnicity and political identity have been prominent. A progressive shift in the economic paradigm has been identified, with labour‐related keywords leaving room for more subjective aspects of well‐being. Growing attention has been paid to different forms of migrants' capital and vulnerabilities, along with a declining interest in demographic implications of return, especially with respect to African and European internal and international migrations.",

          "authors": "Ettore Recchi, Luca Bernasconi, Alejandra Rodriguez Sanchez",
          "abstract": "Overstayers—travellers entering a country with a valid visa but staying beyond the initially authorised period—are a blind spot of migration research. Past studies claim that overstaying is indeed the main gateway to irregular migration in Europe, but few estimates exist. This paper explores three new methods to estimate the inflows of overstayers. We concentrate on the Schengen area as destination, given its relevance in global migration flows, and on non‐European countries as origins, since for travellers from these countries commercial flights are the most likely transportation mode to Europe. Our methods rely on aggregate information on incoming and departing passengers from all airports in the Schengen Area, and on Facebook users' mobility data. In the first method, we compute ‘net air travel flows’ as the difference between incoming and outgoing passengers; we then deduce net regular migration (using data from Eurostat and the QuantMig project) from ‘net air travel flows’ to obtain ‘unaccounted net flows’, which we hold to equate approximately to newly incoming overstayers with short‐stay visas for 2019. In the second method, building on the first estimate, we employ the logic of gravity models to project estimates for later years. In the third method, we build on the intuitions of the first method but use net migration figures from data on Facebook users' cross‐border movements. Substantively, the results of the different methods converge, indicating around 450,000 new overstayers who entered the whole of the Schengen Area in 2019 with short‐stay visas. Analyses for the following years obtained with the second and third method match and are in line with changes in travel policies during the COVID‐19 pandemic (2020 and 2021), suggesting a significant reduction in the number of overstayers for those years and an uptick for the years 2022–2023. By uncovering the size and scope of the overstaying population we shed light on a highly contested issue in the public debate and ultimately contribute to raise awareness on the constructed nature of the ‘regular’ versus ‘irregular’ framing of migration.",

          "abstract": "A formal model reveals how the information environment affects international races to implement a powerful, dangerous new military technology, which may cause a “disaster” affecting all states. States implementing the technology face a tradeoff between the safety of the technology and performance in the race. States face unknown, private, and public information about capabilities. More decisive races, in which small performance leads produce larger probabilities of victory, are usually more dangerous. In addition, revealing information about rivals’ capabilities has two opposing effects on risk: states discover either that they are far apart in capability and compete less or that they are close in capability and drastically reduce safety to win. Therefore, the public information scenario is less risky than the private information scenario except under high decisiveness. Finally, regardless of information, the larger the eventual loser’s impact on safety relative to the eventual winner’s, the more dangerous is the race.",

          "abstract": "Computer-assisted learning (CAL) offers an affordable way to implement a mastery learning approach in the classroom. However, while experimental research suggests CAL can enhance student outcomes, such findings often rely on experimental conditions not easily replicated in ordinary classroom settings (e.g., opt-in participation, extensive training and support, and high CAL usage targets). To assess the real-world impact of CAL, we draw on a large three-year panel of administrative data covering over 200,000 students in school districts that licensed Khan Academy’s Measures of Academic Progress accelerator, a program designed to support math learning. To identify causal effects, we exploit within-teacher and within-school changes in average classroom CAL practice time—a strategy that yields precise, policy-relevant estimates even at modest usage levels. We find that a classroom with 6.6 h of annual Khan Academy practice (about 11 min per week) experiences a + 0.031 SD gain in math test score performance compared to no practice. For classrooms with higher usage levels, we find approximately linear gains, with projected effects rising to + 0.085 SD at the recommended 30 min per week. Higher-achieving students benefit most, in part because they spend more time on CAL and progress through more skills than lower-performing peers. Teachers might reduce achievement gaps and boost overall gains by encouraging more productive use of the platform (focused on skill mastery)—especially among struggling students.",

          "abstract": "Stemming from physics and later applied to other fields such as ecology, the theory of critical transitions suggests that some regime shifts are preceded by statistical early warning signals. Reddit’s r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created “compositions”, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 min at a false positive rate of just 3.6%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.",

          "abstract": "A key aspect of healthy social functioning in both humans and nonhuman primates is the ability to extract status-related information from observing the social signals exchanged between individuals. Knowing the social status of others determines how long we look at them and how we engage with them in social interactions. While looking at faces and eyes requires a functionally intact amygdala, hippocampal memories guide the eyes toward socially relevant areas of a visual scene. We examined the local field potentials associated with socially meaningful eye movements in the amygdala and hippocampus of macaques as they watched videos of dominant–subordinate interactions among unfamiliar conspecifics. In both structures, the saccade-related potentials showed status-dependent amplitude modulation in specific frequency bands. In the amygdala, shifting gaze from lower- to higher-status individuals was associated with anticipatory power transients in the 20 to 25 Hz frequency band, whereas gaze shifts from higher- to lower-status individuals were marked by predominantly postsaccadic power transients. Following the gaze of the aggressive, dominant individual induced increased postsaccadic power in the gamma band in both the amygdala and hippocampus, with some variation in frequency depending on whether the saccade landed on the social partner or elsewhere. The timing, frequency, and status-specificity of these power transients reveal the contribution of the amygdala and hippocampus to the visual exploration of social scenes.",

Here, we investigate two key mechanisms by which social networks influence migration behavior: transmission of information and resources, and comparison of social status. These mechanisms suggest distinct sets of alters that an ego may emulate with respect to their migration behaviors, resulting in divergent mobility trajectories within and across communities. Leveraging longitudinal data from 73 Honduran villages ( N = 15 , 480 individuals) over six years, we use a Linear Network Autocorrelation Modeling framework to disentangle the effects of kinship, friendship, and economic ties on international migration decisions. Our findings reveal that incorporating social network factors as predictors significantly improves model fit. While indicators for resource-sharing processes substantially contribute to model performance, the inclusion of structural comparison mechanisms does not provide additional explanatory power. These results underscore the critical role of information and resource transmission within social networks in facilitating migration behaviors.",

Here, we examine how network structure influences the emergence and semantic content of shared narrative beliefs in experimental online social networks, using natural language processing measures and agent-based modeling. Media content with complex causal structure attenuates network structure effects by encouraging longer exploration of background knowledge. Yet network structure still shapes the narrative content communicated. An embedding-based narrative alignment measure shows that fully connected groups orient their interactions more toward communicating causes of an event, whereas locally connected networks emphasize the event’s effects. A group’s network structure also influences representational and language change in personal narratives: participants in fully connected networks showed the largest increase in causal language in personal narratives written after interaction, which also orient more around the narrative’s causal events.",

          "abstract": "Early adversity is associated with brain changes that negatively impact development, social-emotional functioning, and academic achievement. The multifaceted nature of adversity complicates efforts to isolate specific factors that affect brain development and developmental outcomes. In the present study, we leverage parent survey data and longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from infants during 4-, 9-, and 12-mo well-child visits at a large hospital-based urban primary care clinic serving predominantly low-income families (293 infants, 667 EEGs). Using a network framework, we aimed to identify specific socioeconomic and psychological factors associated with differences in infant brain development. We find that mothers who report to be income insufficient were more likely to have lower educational attainment, report low-income, experience higher levels of stress, and encounter more adverse life events. Controlling for these variables, income insufficiency was specifically associated with delayed brain development in the first year of life; infants developing in a household where parents felt their income was inadequate to support the family’s needs exhibited slower rates of change in alpha peak frequency, alpha power, and beta power. Together, these findings provide a framework of understanding and visualizing how early adversity impacts neurodevelopment and provides evidence for the potential utility of maternal income sufficiency as an additional screening tool to accelerate identification of populations most vulnerable and in need for early intervention.",

          "authors": "Christa Nater, David I. Miller, Alice H. Eagly, Sabine Sczesny",
          "abstract": "Gender stereotypes, defined as widely shared beliefs about the typical attributes of women and men, have far-reaching consequences for both stereotyped groups. This preregistered research examined cross-cultural variation in gender stereotypes based on public opinion poll data from 1995 (22 nations with 22,000 respondents) and 2023 (40 nations with 4,800 respondents). Results revealed that men were perceived as more agentic than women and women as more communal than men in all studied nations at both time points. Yet, substantial cross-cultural variation existed in the strength of these stereotypes whereby the communion stereotype in particular related to the distribution of women and men into social roles. The female advantage in communion was stronger the larger women’s share in the labor force and the greater the occupational sex segregation, both reflecting women’s employment primarily in communal domains. The male advantage in agency likely reflects that women’s considerable inroads into leader roles put them in versions of the role entailing lesser status and power and therefore conveying lesser agency. For competence, most respondents believed that women and men are equally competent in 17 of the 23 nations surveyed in 1995 and in all 40 nations surveyed in 2023. These beliefs in competence equality were stronger in nations with greater female educational attainment and labor force participation (in 2023 but not in 1995). By identifying cross-cultural patterns and socioeconomic indicators associated with variation in gender stereotyping, this research advances understanding of how the locations of women and men in nations’ social structures inform gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Culture has been a central concept in the social sciences for well over a century. Yet, a theory of culture with an associated measurement model providing the means to systematically study its effects has proven elusive. Developments in cognitive culture theory over the past several years provide a new perspective and a new set of tools. Culture can be conceptualized as a set of shared cognitive models that encode the information required for individuals to function in a given social setting. These cultural models can be elicited and examined in detail using the methods of cultural domain analysis, and the cultural consensus model (CCM) can be used to test for sharing and to describe variation in culture. Using the results of cultural consensus analysis as a foundation, cultural consonance can be measured for individuals. Cultural consonance is the degree to which individuals, in their own behaviors, approximate the prototypes for behavior encoded in cultural models. Cultural consonance thus extends cognitive culture theory to an examination of culture expressed in behavior. In this article, this theoretical and methodological orientation is presented, and some implications of its empirical examination are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the geographic spread of emerging respiratory viruses is critical for pandemic preparedness, yet the early spatiotemporal dynamics of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the United States remain unclear. While mobility and genomic data have revealed important aspects of pandemic spatial spread, several key questions remain: Did the two pandemics follow similar spatial transmission routes? How rapidly did they spread across the United States? What role did stochastic processes play in early spatial transmission? To address these questions, we integrated high-resolution disease data with a robust, data-efficient inference framework combining air travel, commuting flows, and pathogen superspreading potentials to reconstruct their spatial spread across US metropolitan areas. The two pandemics exhibited distinct transmission pathways across locations; however, both pandemics established local circulation in most metropolitan areas within weeks, driven by several shared transmission hubs. Early spatial spread was more strongly associated with air travel than with commuting, though stochastic dynamics introduced substantial uncertainty in transmission routes, creating challenges for timely detection and control. Simulations indicate that broad wastewater surveillance coverage beyond top transmission hubs coupled with effective infection control may slow initial spatial expansion. Our findings highlight the rapid, stochastic spread of pandemic respiratory pathogens and the difficulties of early outbreak containment.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive aging research has long observed that older adults’ autobiographical memories and future thoughts, as assessed in laboratory contexts, lack spatiotemporal detail compared to young adults. Does this pattern also hold in everyday contexts? Across two studies, we examined characteristics of autobiographical thinking in real-world settings using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Study 1 included an adult lifespan sample (N = 3,847). Study 2 (preregistered) included 217 young and older adults whose autobiographical memories were also assessed with a traditional lab-based interview. Contrary to lab-based findings commonly reported in the literature, older adults across both studies reported more episodic specificity in their everyday autobiographical thoughts than younger adults, as well as shifts toward positive and social focus rather than on the self. Linguistic analyses validated self-report data, revealing greater concreteness and perceptual detail with increasing age. Together, these findings highlight discrepancies between measurement approaches in autobiographical thinking in older age, emphasizing the significance of motivational and contextual factors in its study.",

          "abstract": "The exorbitant cost of prescription pharmaceuticals is a critical and long-standing concern facing the United States (US). To curb rising drug costs, international reference pricing, aligning drug prices with those in other high-income countries, has emerged as a prominent policy option. We evaluated the potential national savings from such a strategy in the United States through a comprehensive analysis of utilization patterns and global price differentials for over 8,000 drugs. We project an annual national saving of $184 billion if outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals were priced comparably to those in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid would realize savings of 51%, 62%, and 35%, respectively. Pharmaceutical expenditures for common chronic illnesses would be substantially reduced, with costs declining by over 75% for diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Our findings emphasize the substantial fiscal and equity gains achievable through international reference pricing, demonstrating its potential to mitigate financial burdens borne by both healthcare systems and individual patients.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the existence and extent of a gender gap in satisfaction with the Bank of England’s performance in controlling inflation. Descriptive data and previous research report gender gaps in attitudes towards monetary institutions and outcomes. Much of this research, however, disregards potential biases arising from women’s lower propensity to express an opinion, and to answer ‘don’t know’ instead. Using the Bank of England’s Inflation Attitudes survey (2001–2025), and modelling selection into substantive answers, I find a statistically significant – yet, substantively small and not persistent – gender gap in satisfaction with the Bank of England. This gender gap remains after controlling for inflation perception and monetary knowledge. I also find that women do not overestimate inflation, and they do not seem to ‘punish’ more harshly the Bank for high inflation or deflation. Therefore, variance in this gender gap can be attributed to a different propensity to report ‘extreme’ opinions, and to different reactions to high inflation or deflation. These findings highlight gendered dimensions for the understanding of monetary institutions and finance, contributing to the literature on satisfaction with the performance of institutions.",

          "authors": "Charlotte Boucher",
          "abstract": "How do economic crises harm political trust? And can their impact be mitigated? Using data from Eurofound’s Living, working, and COVID-19 survey conducted across the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic, I find that economic performance and social protection are strongly correlated with political trust in such contexts, however independently from each other. While deteriorating economic conditions severely harm trust, social protection can subsequently temper this negative impact. More specifically, in the case of the COVID-19 crisis, the deferral of debt and taxes, followed by support from public services and wage support mitigated the most the negative impact of the crisis on political trust. However, I find this mitigating effect to be only moderate as trust attitudes are likely to be affected by a negativity bias. In other words, the positive effect of receiving state support on political trust is systematically inferior to the negative effect of the crisis. Because of this bias, governments are more likely to be punished by citizens for what the crisis has done to them than to be rewarded for what they have done for them.",

          "abstract": "Non-institutional political participation (NiPP) is rising in Southern Europe. However, how the relationship between health and NiPP is conditioned by age and education remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study analyses data from 8944 participants in the European Social Survey (wave 10) across Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. Results showed that as subjective general health (SGH) increases, the likelihood of NiPP decreases. Both age and education moderated this relationship. For younger individuals and those with higher education, increased SGH led to reduced NiPP. Conversely, for older individuals and those with lower education, the decline in NiPP participation was less pronounced as SGH increased. Future research should examine specific forms of participation and specific health conditions, as well whether age and education continue to moderate NiPP involvement.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the origins and implications of a new cloud business model that is powering the advance of AI. We document how this model emerged within a handful of the most dominant IT firms whose reach into all corners of the economy makes them a powerful node or “choke point” in the political economy as a whole. We then elaborate how the features of the cloud business model differ from the traditional platform model out of which it grew, as it evolved from asset-light to asset-heavy, from hierarchical organization to semivertical integration, from domination over to collaboration with partner firms, and from embracing consumer- to enterprise-facing strategies. A final section considers the technological, political, and distributional impacts of the rise of this new business model—showing how the current race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) has reinforced and accelerated its underlying dynamics (above all, intensifying the drive for scale and ever-greater asset intensity), analyzing the new techno-nationalist alliance between industry leaders and the state that the model's development has inspired, and considering the new power-distributional dynamics this model has produced.",

          "abstract": "President Trump altered the U.S. federal civil service system by reducing merit‐based protections for bureaucratic expertise and expanding the scope of political appointments, shifting the balance long established under the Pendleton Act of 1883. Similar reforms have occurred at the state level with moves to at‐will employment. These shifts raise questions about what shapes public support for merit system protections. Using data from the 2023 Cooperative Election Survey, we examine how public service motivation (PSM), political knowledge, and ideology influence support for political neutrality and protection from political coercion. We find that political knowledge and PSM are positively correlated with favorable perceptions of current merit system protections. Interestingly, there is no significant association between ideology and support for merit protections. These findings suggest that informed and motivated citizens are more likely to support meritocratic principles, highlighting the need for public education on merit systems' role in sustaining democratic governance.",

          "abstract": "In the wake of significant increases in lesbian and gay (LG) immigration, do Americans view LG migrants as more deserving of entry to the United States than their straight counterparts? Using a conjoint survey experiment with 1,650 respondents, we investigate how potential immigrants’ sexual-minority status affects Americans’ perceptions of their deservingness for admission and their cultural similarity to the United States. Results show that, overall, Americans do not perceive LG immigrants as more deserving than straight ones, and LG immigrants are perceived as less culturally similar. But results also reveal heterogeneity: LG immigrants fleeing persecution are seen as more deserving of admission, and Democrats, atheists, and LG respondents consider LG migrants more deserving than straight ones. This paper helps disentangle Americans’ preferences for migrants’ presumed cultural similarity from economic potential and humanitarian merit as well as sheds light on public opinion of an understudied but politically salient group.",

          "authors": "Lauren P Olson, Nicole Huffman, Romeo A Gray",
          "abstract": "Abstract505 After US elections, news stories frequently highlight how the US Congress has a higher proportion of women and is more racially and ethnically diverse than at any point in history. While some literature suggests that this coverage may diminish legitimacy and support for democratic norms, other research suggests that as descriptive representation increases, citizens—including white people and men—have more trust in their institutions and perceive them to be more legitimate. However, little is known about the effect of this type of news coverage on citizens’ attitudes toward Congress and democracy as a whole. Given these competing expectations, we conduct a series of experiments to determine how portrayals of a diverse Congress affect its perceived legitimacy and support for democratic norms related to Congress’s power. We hypothesize that as Congress diversifies faster than the executive branch, the motivation to protect traditional hierarchies will undermine both the perceived legitimacy of Congress and the commitment to democratic restraints on presidential power among white people and men. Our results are mixed. Based on two survey experiments with nationally representative samples, we find that Democrats perceive Congress as having more institutional legitimacy when informed of its diversity, while Republicans show no difference in their legitimacy perceptions when compared to control conditions. Furthermore, we find no evidence that information about Congress’s diversity decreases support for democratic norms.",

          "authors": "Raj Chetty, Will Dobbie, Benjamin Goldman, Sonya R Porter, Crystal S Yang",
          "abstract": "We show that intergenerational mobility changed rapidly by race and class in recent decades in the U.S. and study the causal mechanisms underlying those changes. Between the 1978 and 1992 birth cohorts, earnings increased for white children from high-income families relative to white children from low-income families, increasing earnings gaps by parental income (“class”) by 30%. Earnings increased for Black children at all parental income levels, reducing white-Black earnings gaps for children from low-income families by 30%. Class gaps grew and race gaps shrank similarly for non-monetary outcomes such as educational attainment, standardized test scores, and mortality rates. Using a quasi-experimental design, we show that the divergent trends in economic mobility were caused by differential changes in childhood environments, as proxied by parental employment rates, within local communities defined by race, class, and childhood county. Outcomes improve across birth cohorts for children who grow up in communities with increasing parental employment rates, with larger effects for children who move to such communities at younger ages. Children’s outcomes are most strongly related to the parental employment rates of peers they are more likely to interact with, such as those in their own birth cohort, suggesting that the relationship between children’s outcomes and parental employment rates is mediated by social interaction.",

          "abstract": "The critique that rap causes violence (causal claim) goes back as far as the 1980s, but today drill rappers are having their freedoms restricted based on instances of a causal claim. Police in the UK regularly remove drill videos from social media and streaming platforms, and drillers are being restricted from making music and associating with people via criminal behavior orders based on the claim that drill music causes serious violence. If this causal claim is true, it provides potential grounds for such restrictions on drillers. This paper argues against censoring drill on the assumption that it causes violence for three reasons. First, even according to the most charitable rendition of the causal claim, there is insufficient evidence to support it. Second, there are less speech‐restrictive and more effective approaches to violence reduction than censorship‐oriented approaches. Third, critics should not be advancing the causal claim due to its racist public meaning.",

In particular, it tries to show that plurality, like liberty, can be and has been imagined either negatively or positively: negatively, as the absence of some form of agreement or uniformity; positively, as engagement with competing qualities or commitments. In addition, it argues that the prominence of negative conceptions of pluralism, with their emphasis on difference and diversity, has made it hard to recognize and appreciate the important role that positive conceptions play in moral and political discourse.",

This unique dynamic shapes community and membership, with urban political community defined by the proximity principle and membership grounded in indifference. Secondly, it argues that urban political communities are not mere segments of national communities, but distinct entities with different constitutive conditions. This understanding challenges traditional boundaries of citizenship both vertically, toward formal citizenship boundaries, and horizontally, toward territorial boundaries of political community. Thirdly, the paper advocates for cautious formalization of urban citizenship, recognizing the dynamic nature of cities in contesting boundaries and promoting democratic inclusion while highlighting that formalizing urban citizenship is ultimately boundary affirming: It maintains the boundaries drawn around cities by the state.",

          "abstract": "We examine the endogenous development of specialized political capital and its use, by both governing and opposition parties, within a model of policymaking and electoral competition. The opposition party can use political capital to impede the governing party's policy agenda—to throw sand in the gears—but may make itself less electorally desirable in the process. We characterize conditions that give rise to different equilibrium patterns of political capital, including, among others, entrenched parties. Our results suggest that, in the special circumstances in which they arise, entrenched parties offer the voter a silver lining: In these cases, the incumbent and opposition parties have acquired different specialized political capital, and voters benefit from the opposition's developed capacity to curb the governing party's excesses. Due to the underlying conditions, policy outcomes are still poor, but, under relevant conditions, party entrenchment mitigates them, rather than exacerbating them as conventionally supposed.",

          "abstract": "While scholars have documented feedback effects among a policy's direct winners and losers, less is known about whether such effects can occur among the indirectly affected—“the policy adjacent.” Using 458 geocoded housing developments built between two nearly identical statewide ballot propositions funding affordable housing in California, we show that policy generates feedback effects among neighboring residents in systematic ways. New, nearby affordable housing causes majority‐homeowner blocks to increase their support for the housing bond, while majority‐renter blocks decrease or do not change their support. We attribute the positive effect among majority‐homeowner blocks to the housing's replacement of blight. In contrast, the lack of a positive effect among majority‐renter blocks may be driven by the threat of gentrification. Policy implementation can win support for expansion among unexpected beneficiaries, while failing to do so even among the policy's presumed allies.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how broadband internet affects rural–urban migration in China using the Universal Broadband and Telecommunication Services pilot program launched in 2015 as a quasi‐experimental setting. Analyzing China Household Finance Survey data (2013–2021) with difference‐in‐differences estimation, we find that improved internet access significantly increased rural–urban migration by 3.2–3.4 percentage points, representing a 17.5–18.6 percent rise over the baseline migration rates of 18.3 percent. Effects were strongest in villages with fewer initial migrants, closer to county centers, and with better road infrastructure. At the individual level, impacts were largest among women, younger individuals, the more educated, and those from higher income households. The mechanism appears to be increased access to economic information. Our findings suggest broadband creates “digital routes” that facilitate out‐migration rather than “digital roots” that anchor residents to rural areas.",

          "abstract": "Public policies designed to empower historically victimized groups rely on support from members of the perpetrator group (the dominant majority), who may wrestle with two concerns: a collective angst for the future vitality (continuity, prosperity) of their national ingroup and an empathetic collective angst for the future vitality of the victim group. A two‐wave survey of non‐Indigenous Australians ( N = 797/410) pre and post the 2023 Australian referendum on constitutionally enshrining a parliamentary “Voice” for its Indigenous peoples showed that collective angst was negatively, and empathetic collective angst positively, related to intending to vote “Yes” if the “Voice” was seen to have material implications. Latent true change modeling showed that participants who voted “Yes” (relative to “No”) felt, following the failure of the referendum, increased collective and empathetic collective angst. The findings highlight the role of existential collective concerns and how these shape, and are shaped by, political processes.",

          "authors": "Jaeeun Kim, Apostolos Andrikopoulos",
          "abstract": "Crafting identity is integral to the struggle of aspiring migrants to access the territory, labor market, and citizenship of desired destinations. Such practices are at times classified as “fraud.” Migration scholars should approach this state-centered category with caution. Such framing naturalizes the state's monopolistic claim to the truth of individual identities. It obscures the complex moral terrain migrants navigate. We propose “unauthorized identity craft” (UIC) as an alternative concept. UIC shifts our attention from migrants’ deception to their agency in the absence of state authorization — their learned craft to navigate, and at times subvert, restrictive mobility regimes. Drawing on long-term, multisited ethnographic research with Korean Chinese and West African migrants, we show that UIC is sustained by a complex web of relations, connecting documents, organizations, and people — state and non-state actors alike. The effectiveness of UIC depends on migrants’ intricate and intensive labor to create, maintain, and reshape this relational matrix. Our emphasis on UIC's relationality enables us to examine how migrants and other actors involved classify their relationships and the various forms of exchange that sustain them. Mismatches in these framings give rise to contestation and negotiation — important elements of the craft migrants must perform. Our relational perspective further helps explain UIC's temporal dynamic. For some migrants, UIC remains ephemeral, a form of strategic masking; for others, it generates lasting entanglements, moral dilemmas, and enduring identity shifts. We show that UIC's long-term ramifications are shaped by the breadth, density, durability, and consequentiality of the relational matrix that sustains UIC.",

          "abstract": "Flexible workplace arrangements (FWA), particularly working from home and working without fixed workplaces, have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. However, their implications for the social integration of immigrant workers remain underexplored. This study investigates whether and how FWA relate immigrant workers’ social integration, focusing on their proficiency in the destination language, a key indicator of social integration outcomes. Using data from the 2016 and 2021 Population Census conducted by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong SAR, we compare immigrant workers under three workplace arrangements: on-site, working without a fixed workplace, and working from home. Our findings reveal a strong and positive relationship between work without a fixed workplace and immigrants’ proficiency in Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong. This relationship is consistent across immigrants with varying durations of stay and those who migrated before or after adulthood. Instrumental variable regressions, causal mediation analysis and placebo tests further suggest that this relationship is likely causal. This study represents the first work to extend the understanding of FWA beyond economic performance to social integration outcomes, opening avenues for future research on the broader societal impacts of evolving work arrangements in the post-pandemic era and offering fresh insights for migration integration and skill management policies.",

          "title": "Becoming an Informed Citizen — the Relationship Between Naturalization Regimes, Language, and Political Knowledge Among Naturalized Citizens",
          "authors": "Jessica Kuhlmann",
          "abstract": "Political knowledge is a crucial component of democratic participation. For immigrants in particular, political knowledge plays a key role in political integration. This article investigates how institutional contexts, in the form of naturalization regimes, shape differences in political knowledge among naturalized citizens. Using Germany as a case study, this analysis focuses on two major immigrant groups that were subject to different naturalization regimes, namely individuals of Turkish and Soviet origin. Drawing on data from the 2017 Immigrant German Election Study, mediation analyses reveal a knowledge gap across these groups. However, this gap does not appear to be influenced by individual proficiency in the German language. Naturalized Turkish immigrants demonstrate greater political knowledge than naturalized immigrants of Soviet origin. These results underscore that naturalization regimes do more than grant legal status but also shape the political integration of immigrant citizens.",

          "abstract": "This article improves our understanding of visibility in relation to gender equity policy in the film and TV industries and beyond, where visibility is typically imagined to be positive or beneficial. Drawing on new empirical data from an internationally comparative study of gender equity policy in film and TV in the UK, Canada and Germany, we identify three imaginaries of visibility in relation to gender equity policies: visibility is imagined as evidencing problems, as providing a solution and as demonstrating action. We show that imagining visibility in these ways limits the scope of gender inequities considered for policy intervention and creates the potential for counterproductive unintended consequences. We argue that advocating for, developing and implementing effective gender equity policy requires challenging and complicating current ideas of how visibility works in policy making. As the visibility of marginalised groups is so central to gender equity, yet rarely approached critically by policy makers, this article makes an important contribution to the literature around equity in public policy broadly.",

          "abstract": "Policy dismantling is a growing field in public policy analysis. Scholars approach this topic from different perspectives, such as exploring why it occurs and analysing the strategies used to achieve it. However, the effects of policy dismantling on the policy-making process, particularly in multilevel governance frameworks, remain unclear. This study examines how different levels of government responded to the dismantling of the Childcare Programme to Support Working Mothers in Mexico. Our findings show that local governments mitigated the adverse effects through tailored compensatory actions, leveraging existing networks, technical expertise and political dynamics, particularly opposition to the ruling federal party. Beyond these immediate responses, dismantling has reshaped the childcare policy landscape, reinforcing political divides – especially regarding childcare provision models, such as direct services versus cash transfers. As a result, the debate has shifted from whether childcare services are necessary to how they should be provided and who should have access. These findings contribute to broader discussions on the impact of dismantling policies within federal systems, particularly in shaping intergovernmental policy making and political dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Collaborative governance (CG) models show promise for addressing complex governance challenges, yet they also face obstacles and difficulties that necessitate rigorous research in this field, particularly in relation to understanding and managing conflicts and disagreements among diverse stakeholders. The research addresses three primary questions: the scales, stages and domains in which conflicts arise; the strategies utilised by CG to handle minor disagreements and fundamental conflicts; and the outputs and effects of addressing deeper-seated conflicts and disagreements. Through a systematic literature review using the PRISMA-S framework, the study reveals how conflicts in CG frequently arise in environmental and ecological management, primarily at local scales, and mainly during the initial stages of decision making. The research identifies three primary levels for addressing conflicts in CG – motives, dynamics and resolution – categorising CG strategies into six distinct types to provide a comprehensive approach for practitioners. The findings indicate that while CG can effectively manage minor disagreements through negotiation and consensus building, it struggles with fundamental conflicts rooted in differing world views. This study examines the manifestations of addressing conflicts and disagreements resolution mechanisms within CG across three distinct dimensions: output, outcome and impact. It underscores the importance of leadership and innovative dialogue frameworks in constructively managing conflicts, transforming disagreements into opportunities for creative and collective problem-solving, thereby enhancing the sustainability and effectiveness of CG.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on collaborative governance emphasises the importance of creating win–win situations as a way of generating policy innovation and effective problem-solving. However, the dynamics of collaboration are often more complicated than discovering mutual gains. An analysis of cannabis legalisation in the San Francisco Bay Area finds that ‘getting to yes’ is often a subtle mixture of finding common ground and the manufacturing of consent. This means that some participants take the role of entrepreneurs in the collaborative process and push discursive dynamics towards a dominant perspective. Exploring the importance of power and politics in collaborative governance, the case illuminates how arena design, discourse and coalition building shape the scope and character of consensus formation.",

          "authors": "Andrea Krizsán, Dorottya Fekete",
          "abstract": "In contexts of autocratisation and political polarisation, maintaining the legitimacy of policy expertise is cumbersome. Experts are clustered on two sides of the political divide: those not aligned with either side are excluded from regular policy processes, while those aligned to the regime are too close to the government to be seen as legitimate. This article analyses how policy-knowledge producers work towards achieving legitimacy for the knowledge they produce in such highly politicised contexts. It identifies three sets of legitimacy-building practices used to navigate the dominance of the political. First, knowledge producers increasingly embrace values-driven practices rather than insisting on neutrality and independence. Second, boundaries between political arenas and epistemic authority are tightened by the separation of individual and organisational identities. Third, the relevance of policy knowledge is reframed by diversifying audiences and outcomes to maintain usefulness. The practices identified are not specific to autocratising contexts, but they are exacerbated and become coerced responses to the hard constraints of an incrementally closing regime. Based on interview data with think tanks in Hungary’s polarised autocracy and highly politicised policy making, this research examines populist tendencies of questioning truth and neutrality of knowledge and expertise – all hallmarks of today’s turbulent policy environments. This makes it a valuable contribution to the broader literature on how think tanks negotiate legitimacy in contexts of de-democratisation.",

          "abstract": "Wicked problems have forced policy makers to develop new strategies for policy design that deal better with complexity. Both cross-sectoral and multi-actor collaboration are presented by collaborative governance advocates as potential solutions. Nevertheless, even if both approaches have been theoretically linked to policy innovation, there is little empirical evidence to support those relationships and none that compare the innovative potential of different collaborative approaches. Using regression analysis, we analysed 529 policy strategies promoted by Barcelona City Council as part of the Pla de Barris (‘neighbourhood plan’) strategy to identify whose participation in policy design is more meaningful in terms of innovation. Within the public sector, both collaborative government and cross-sectoral collaboration appear to be related with policy innovation. However, when non-public actors – in particular, third-sector organisations – get involved in the policy-design process (through co-creation), the innovative potential of the policy output increases significantly.",

Despite a growing literature on policy experiments, few studies define or explore what constitutes a successful experiment. This is important given the potential of experiments for policy learning and change, and also so that experiments can be evaluated and lessons learned across jurisdictions by academics and practitioners. The article develops a concept of success that is rooted in policy learning. Based on an empirical study of policy experimentation in Canadian federal cultural, heritage and sport policy, the article outlines four key ‘success criteria’: basic elements of an experiment; leadership and resources; procedural elements; and evaluation. It argues that experiments need to be evaluated not merely on outcomes, and that they should ultimately aim to encourage reflexive learning, characterised by dialogue and deliberation.",

          "authors": "Johan Christensen, Stine Hesstvedt, Kira Pronin, Cathrine Holst, Peter Munk Christiansen, Anne Maria Holli",
          "abstract": "The Nordic countries have traditionally been seen to share a distinct and successful governance model, combining high administrative capacity, extensive interest-group involvement and active channels for incorporating expert input in policy making. Starting in the 1980s, this model came under pressure. Yet, while changes to the statist and corporatist elements of this model are well documented, we know less about the changing role of expertise in Nordic governance. Focusing on one key institutional channel for incorporating expert knowledge in policy making, namely government-appointed advisory commissions, this article seeks to compare and account for changes in academic participation in Nordic commissions since the 1970s. Drawing on a cross-national data set covering more than 6,700 advisory commissions and 73,000 commission members, it finds significant cross-Nordic divergence in academic participation on advisory groups. The article offers a historical-institutionalist account for this divergence. It shows how the Nordic countries responded differently to similar political, economic and ideational pressures, leading their commission systems and the role of academic experts within these systems in different directions. In this way, the article makes an important contribution to scholarship on the politics of expertise and policy advice and debates about the Nordic governance model.",

          "abstract": "‘Design for policy’ is a prominent framing of the intersection between policy and design. Here, we ask, if design is ‘for’ policy, then what exactly is it doing? We make a critique of literature that explains the interaction of design and policy by listing practices (prototyping or visualisation, for example) but that misses the reasons why those practices are being used. We build on and advance scholarship that anchors design in relation to the demands, constraints and politics of policy making, taking account of the quite different forms a relationship between design (as a thing) and policy design (as a process) can have. Within this debate we propose that design’s relationship to policy is not always in service to (‘for’), but also sometimes ‘with’, and even sometimes ‘against’. We set out an original typology which differentiates roles of design in policy along the lines of their ultimate purpose, scope and terms on which design and policy interact. We identify an instrumental relationship, in which design is a tool to support achieving specified goals of policy making; an improvisational relationship, seeing design as a practice enabling policy making to be more open in the face of unfolding events and experiences; and a generative relationship where design facilitates the re-envisioning of policy making. Through our analysis and proposed typology, we aim to address overly specific and overly homogenising understandings of design in the policy space, enabling a more critical understanding of the different intents and implications at play within the ‘design turn’ in policy.",

Despite being heavily researched, however, WLB is surprisingly undertheorized within sociology. This article attempts to redress the situation by proposing a robust and multilayered sociological model capable of explaining its genesis, experience, and variations. I first deconstruct the commonsense notion of WLB, recasting it as a family-employment-leisure nexus, and specify its elements. Next, I flag the limits of current conceptualizations of WLB and turn to Bourdieu’s field theory for solutions. I go beyond Bourdieu, however, by modeling more precisely how multiple fields interact to shape the demands, dispositions, and desires of everyday experience. I develop a series of concepts and distinctions to that end and finish with a sketch of research possibilities.",

This creates a substantial gap between where refugees are located and where research is produced. This study investigates this bias by analyzing 12,700 publications on forced migration from 1990 to 2022. Using a methodology that combines hand-coding with generative AI text processing, we examine publication and citation patterns based on the country of analysis and author affiliation. Our findings show that (1) most research focuses on the Global North, (2) most authors are based in the Global North, (3) Global North authors dominate publications on the Global South, and (4) Global North authors receive more citations, even when studying the same country as Global South researchers. These results prove a persistent regional bias favoring the Global North in forced migration research.",

It finds that movements with extensive youth participation can be potent yet face severe repression and rarely resolve structural grievances quickly. Organizing is often decentralized and leaderless, aiding diffusion but complicating bargaining and transitions. Cases examined include Tunisia's 2010 uprising; anticorruption mobilizations in Nepal, Indonesia, Serbia, Peru, and the Philippines; and diffusion from Sri Lanka (2022) and Bangladesh (2024), with transition dynamics unfolding in Bangladesh, Nepal, Madagascar, and Peru. Durable gains hinge on disciplined mobilization during volatile transitions and converting protest energy into electoral and institutional influence.",

Yet executives today also pursue strategies that deliberately weaken the state itself. This essay brings the state back into the conversation by (re)introducing the concept of state erosion to capture processes through which elected leaders weaken the state's essential governance capacities by dismantling or politicizing bureaucracies, hollowing out regulatory agencies, centralizing coercive authority, or redirecting public resources in pursuit of partisan ends. Far from being confined to fragile democracies or partisan ideologies, we suggest that state erosion is proliferating across different global contexts. The stakes are profound: While state capacity is painstakingly built over generations, it can be quickly dismantled. The hollowing out of state capacity represents a pervasive threat to the survival of legitimate democratic governance.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: The article reassesses early-2000s optimism about \"Muslim democracy,\" arguing that Islamist participation and pragmatism have not produced stable democratization. Drawing on the cases of Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Pakistan, and others, the authors show that without a genuine normative commitment to pluralism, civil liberties, and institutional checks, Islamist parties often instrumentalize elections and slide into authoritarian or majoritarian rule. Structural legacies of secular authoritarianism, regional counterrevolution (notably Gulf monarchies), inconsistent Western \"linkage and leverage,\" and a global wave of populist authoritarianism further constrain democratization. The authors conclude that durable democracy in Muslim-majority states requires stronger institutions, engaged civil society, and sustained international support.",

It describes how security forces massacred protesters and concealed their bodies, exposing a state that rules through terror rather than consent. The essay argues that these events undermined CCM's manufactured legitimacy and catalyzed a revived, protest-oriented antiauthoritarian movement rooted in demands for democracy and justice. Deep socioeconomic grievances and constitutional questions will continue to fuel contention, ensuring that Tanzanian politics after 2025 cannot return to the previous low-protest order.",

While some subscribe to the \"anti-gender\" agenda and roll back gender equality achievements, others compete over who is the more gender equal. This essay reconciles these seemingly contradictory positions by referring to genderbashing and genderwashing as two authoritarian signalling strategies. Genderbashing occurs when authoritarian leaders strategically exploit fears and insecurities in the citizenry by cracking down on women's rights, while genderwashing involves authoritarians pushing through gender equality reforms to appear liberal and mitigate criticism about democratic deficiencies. Both strategies threaten democracy as well as the empowerment, well-being, and security of women in authoritarian contexts.",

Daniel Noboa, elected in 2023 and reelected in 2025, has responded with a militarized mano dura strategy, invoking internal armed conflict, frequent states of emergency, and expanded military roles. These measures have not reduced violence but have weakened judicial independence, constrained protest, and raised human-rights concerns. A failed 2025 referendum to reshape institutions and permit foreign bases exposed limits to Noboa's mandate.

Unlike in most countries—and in Brazil's own history—where leaders who undermine democracy typically evade post-tenure punishment, high courts constrained Bolsonaro both during and after his presidency through strategic choices. Equally important, their rulings enabled rivals to weaken Bolsonaro's grip on power while avoiding open confrontation with powerful congressional forces. This experience offers concrete lessons for democracies confronting similar threats, including those now investigating former presidents who sought to subvert democratic rule.",

First, in the information war, Kyiv should restore media pluralism, curb performative messaging, and institutionalize sourcing, corrections, and independent oversight to distinguish itself from Russian disinformation. Second, Ukraine should openly confront fraught history—including Volhynia/Eastern Galicia, the Azov Brigade, and WWII-era nationalist symbols—through transparent vetting, scholarship, and joint reckoning with allies. Third, wartime centralization must not harden into hyperpresidentialism: Anticorruption bodies require independence, \"sunset clauses\" limiting grants of emergency powers, and a rule-of-law compact. These reforms would strengthen public trust, EU prospects, and postwar consolidation across civil society, politics, law, state capacity, and the economy.",

Central to its success is Moldova's long-term Europeanization, driven by EU conditionality, and President Maia Sandu's anticorruption-centered politics, which link democracy with integrity. Legal, energy, and security reforms, plus an active civil society, diaspora, and strong support from Romania and the EU have built \"defense in depth.\" The authors distill ten lessons for vulnerable democracies on resilience in the face of hybrid warfare.",

Historical traumas—the Holodomor, the Holocaust and Jewish statelessness, and the unresolved Chinese civil war—anchor collective fears that frame current security choices and justify far-reaching measures. These states tightly align with Western powers, especially the United States, and use their democratic credentials as soft power to secure military, financial, and diplomatic support. Digital-era communication amplifies their narratives, giving them outsized influence. The authors argue that for such states, sovereignty inevitably comes before democracy, raising difficult questions about how liberal norms endure under permanent threat.",

Forcing all institutions into a majoritarian-versus-counter majoritarian dichotomy wrongly treats majority rule as democracy's core. Instead, the essay argues, democracy should be judged by widely accepted legal standards: meaningful political participation, free and fair elections that confer real power, robust rights, and the rule of law.",

This article argues that AI functions as a powerful accelerator, lowering historical barriers and making these mechanisms not only cheaper but also more frequent, by automating law-drafting, optimizing mobilization, and enabling hyper-personalized persuasion. However, this efficiency threatens the core conditions of democratic legitimacy. By eroding deliberation, weakening civil society, and corroding trust through synthetic content, AI risks converting citizen-initiated mechanisms of direct democracy from essential \"safety valves\" into engines of plebiscitarian instability. This essay contrasts a dystopian future of Automated Plebiscites with a preferable path of Augmented Deliberation. To steer toward the latter, the essay proposes a governance roadmap of digital guardrails—including AI watermarking, public-interest AI platforms, and independent algorithmic audits—aimed at ensuring AI augments rather than undermines democratic practice.",

Since 2014, students and faculty critical of the regime have been vilified, physically attacked and arrested, books and seminars banned, standard historical narratives rewritten, and foreign scholars denied visas. Three overlapping but distinct phases in this takeover are visible: the first involved suppression of existing scholarship and thought, while the second rested on the capture of administrative, faculty and student positions enabling an ideological rewiring of higher education. In the third phase, the government has introduced basic structural changes that destroy the federal structure of India's education system, and reduce faculty to government staff.",

Rising repression, ethnicized patronage, and the dominance of Western-Uganda elites intensify tensions with marginalized groups such as the Baganda. Looking beyond the 2026 elections, the essay argues that Uganda's transition will likely be shaped by the first family, the army, ethnic dynamics, and regional powers, with significant risks of instability.",

          "abstract": "Given the growing body of research documenting how AI can both positively and negatively affect labor markets, it is logical to assume that AI’s effects on jobs and employment will be a significant political issue for many nations in the coming years. However, we currently lack an understanding of how political parties perceive the potential impact AI has on employment, the role of regulations in protecting workers from AI-related job losses, and the importance of AI educational and training programs to assist workers in environments where AI is more prevalent. Therefore, this study analyzes comments and statements from party members in OECD countries from 2016 to 2025 through content analysis, examining media interviews, speeches, and debates to understand how political party ideologies shape party members’ positions on AI regarding job losses, labor markets, regulations, and AI education and training programs. The findings indicate that political ideology significantly affects party members’ concerns regarding AI-related job losses and the need for government regulations to protect workers from labor market disruptions caused by AI. These findings have important implications for understanding how political ideology may influence party members’ perspectives on AI in relation to labor markets, job losses, and regulation in OECD countries.",

While polarization often rises during campaigns and correlates with democratic backsliding, isolating the effect of winning or losing has proven difficult because of the need for a pre-election baseline and to generalize across multiple elections. In this study, we leverage pre- and post-election questions about partisan affect in the American National Election Study between 1996 and 2024. Our first analysis studies how respondents’ attitudes changed based on their party’s success in its bid for the White House. Our second analysis extends this to hundreds more races, applying a regression discontinuity design to attitudes after close subnational election results. Both analyses support the conclusion that the losing side drives the post-election gap in polarization, and that they do so by feeling less warmly toward their own party. In the United States, political loss may erode in-group attachment more than it fuels out-group hostility.",

I discuss attempts to identify what relational equality involves and why it matters. I argue that defenses of relational egalitarianism are more robust than often suggested. I review relational egalitarian approaches to specific political and policy problems, with a special focus on scholarship in democratic theory, given relational egalitarians’ long-standing concerns with inequalities of power and authority.

Through a unique integration of social media and nationally representative survey data, we examine how political parties in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom evaluate episodes of street protest and how these evaluations relate to their voters’ participation in such protests. Our analysis shows that all political parties, regardless of type or ideology, engage with the non-electoral field, showing a greater tendency to express support for protests they agree with, rather than to criticize those they oppose, in their social media posts. Moreover, our findings underscore a robust association between party support or criticism of a protest and the likelihood of its voters either participating in or shunning the same protest. These findings renew our understanding of fluid linkages between parties and civil society through a less structured and deterministic double role of voters and street protesters than in the past.",

However, empirical evidence for a gender-specific use of attacks is inconclusive. We argue that we are not yet able to fully understand the conditions under which men and women candidates go negative on their political opponents, as the costs and benefits have not yet been empirically measured. Based on candidate surveys from Germany, we use a moderated mediation model to show that i. Women report lower levels of attack behavior than men, ii. Women show a less favorable balance of benefits and costs of negative campaigning, and iii. The perceived benefit-cost balance influences the decision to go negative. However, iv. This effect is moderated by gender; men only attack more often than women when the perceived costs are low and the expected benefits are high.",

The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union led the country to search for its new global identity and place in the global economy. Addressing the uncertain future, political actors referred to Singapore as a potential model for post-Brexit UK, idealising the Southeast Asian City State’s competitive institutional arrangements. Brexit also gave momentum for aspirations of Scottish independence with Nordic countries and welfare state acting as a starkly contrasting model for independent Scotland. Our article critically analyses the cognitive and normative aspects of the Singapore on Thames and Nordic Scotland discourses. We identify two modalities for referencing numerically constructed policy models, as means of anticipation or politicisation, blurring the communicative and coordinative variants of the analysed policy discourses and contributing to their failure.",

          "abstract": "While we know the personality traits of leaders matter in politics, political analysis often struggles to capture such traits beyond qualitative and ad hoc evaluations of character, often resulting in disjuncture between assessment and behaviour. This is evident in the contrast between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s reputation as a risk-averse and detail-oriented technocrat and the record of his first year, which suggests a tougher, more decisive and more uncompromising persona. This article explains this discrepancy by presenting a comprehensive Leadership Trait Analysis of Starmer, using automated content analysis of spontaneous speech during his premiership. Our findings show Starmer exhibits higher than average positions on his belief in his ability to control events, distrust towards others, need for power, and self-confidence, a profile associated with leaders who challenge constraints, eschew compromise, and personalise decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Central banks form a global policy community with a historically high degree of convergence around the norms of central bank independence. However, in recent years, climate change has emerged as a topic of clear-cut divergence – most strikingly between the historically similar European Central Bank (ECB) and US Federal Reserve (Fed). We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore not only factors pushing towards central bank convergence, but also divergence. We show that in an initial stage of emergence, a largely autonomous process of internal deliberation led the ECB to endorse new climate-related norms, where this dynamic was absent in the United States. In a second phase of cascade, marked by the founding of the Network for Greening the Financial System and a growing body of research on climate impacts and central bank objectives, climate-related norms began to exert limited pressure towards convergence. However, the Fed’s perceptions of political risk constrained its adoption of climate-related policies, and eventually led to a retreat from climate following the re-election of President Donald Trump at the end of 2024.",

          "abstract": "In extended deterrence, a nuclear patron assumes a dual role: reassuring its clients while deterring adversaries. Policymakers and scholars widely recognise that for a patron, reassurance is more challenging than deterrence. Why? What makes reassurance harder? I argue that a patron’s deliberate introduction of ambiguity into its extended deterrence commitments – designed to reduce the risk of entrapment – makes reassurance more difficult. This ambiguity makes a patron’s security umbrella appear unreliable to clients, thereby producing uniformly negative effects on reassurance. Conversely, a patron’s ambiguous commitments have a net-neutral effect on adversaries, sustaining a consistent deterrent effect. Ultimately, this dual effect of ambiguity renders reassurance a more difficult task than deterrence. I illustrate the plausibility of this argument by examining how ambiguities in US extended deterrence have been perceived by South Korea and North Korea.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the first systematic analysis of British press coverage regarding the legitimacy of the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights over 25 years (1997–2022). It finds that coverage undermining legitimacy falls into three main areas: limiting or eroding national sovereignty, inadequate performance or effectiveness and disrupting the ‘natural order’. Coverage supporting or defending legitimacy is about providing a safety net, maintaining the international human rights system, and protecting freedoms and liberties. These are distributed unevenly across the six newspapers included in the sample. Critical coverage maps closely to legal scholarship on challenges for legitimacy associated with the identity of the United Kingdom as a political constitutionalist state. Supportive coverage, however, does not fully reflect the broad range of arguments in favour of the legitimacy of the European Convention on Human Rights as identified by human rights campaigners; it is also less abundant, narrower and more tactically defensive.",

          "abstract": "Why do leaders of weaker states employ overt impoliteness in their highest-level engagements with dominant counterparts? Despite growing interest in impoliteness in international relations, little is known about its use by weaker states against stronger ones. This article addresses this gap by conceptualising impoliteness as a pragmatic bargaining resource in asymmetric relations, focusing on encounters between US leaders and their Middle Eastern counterparts. We argue that smaller states resort to impoliteness when political gains outweigh potential costs, particularly under conditions that reduce the risks of retaliation. In such moments, impoliteness serves to consolidate domestic legitimacy, project autonomy, express dissatisfaction with unequal partnerships, and signal aspirations for higher status. Drawing on case studies of US leaders’ receptions in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, we show that overt impoliteness is not a breakdown of diplomacy but a strategic instrument through which weaker states exercise agency and reframe hierarchy.",

While existing research analysed the imposition of multilateral sanctions and the success of economic sanctions, this question has not been systematically addressed. I develop a theoretical framework based on research on cooperation and sanctions, which I test through quantitative analysis based on an original dataset of suspension episodes in regional international organisations (1990–2024), as well as two qualitative comparative case studies of suspension terminations in the Economic Community of West African States and the Council of Europe. The paper finds that suspensions end through target state compliance if the regional international organisation is united, the target state is vulnerable to the international organisation’s pressure, and the international organisation perceives the transgression as a severe violation of its community norms – and through international organisation capitulation if otherwise. If these factors point into different directions, this increases the chance for suspensions to be terminated as draws.",

Drawing on a thematic analysis of 19 in-depth interviews with US-based journalists, social media editors, and independent news creators, it integrates critical political economy of media approaches with journalism and creator studies to analyze how workers navigate unstable revenue models, platform governance, and technological disruption. The findings reveal intersecting business- and labor-oriented crises characterized by algorithmic control, low pay, unpaid work, and varying degrees of autonomy and collective protection. While newsroom workers experience structural rigidity, independent creators—akin to freelance journalists—face intensified self-exploitation and financial risk through individualized branding and visibility pressures. Neoliberal platform capitalism reconfigures journalism labor around precarity, entrepreneurialism, and self-management, underscoring the need for sustainable public interventions to safeguard journalism’s democratic role.",

The theory of Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy describes three orientations social media users may display toward far-right content: endorsement of far-right content, ambivalence toward far-right content, or rejection of far-right content. Based on this theory, we created a survey measure in which participants were asked to rate their likelihood of responding in various ways to hypothetical social media posts that included far-right dog whistles. Our sample of 14 young adults aged 18–24 consisted of 57% Black participants, 71% full-time students, and 71% people who worked at least part-time. We conducted cognitive interviews to examine how participants interpreted these scenarios and their response items. Findings revealed the measure’s overall effectiveness and identified actionable revisions. This study can inform future measure development based on Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy.",

Conceptually, the article draws on key feminist perspectives, which have, over the past decades, been vital for turning sexual misconduct into a central issue of public concern. Our analysis of Dutch public broadcasting (1984–2019) and Twitter (2011–2019) reveals that Dutch television consistently advocated feminist perspectives and framed sexual misconduct as a national problem rooted in ‘internal’ structural failures. By contrast, Twitter discourse, particularly since 2015, was dominated by far-right rhetoric, framing the issue as an ‘external’ cultural threat linked to Islam and immigration. #MeToo was not visible in the dominant Twitter discourse on sexual misconduct but did appear on public television. Nevertheless, Dutch public broadcasters’ feminist agenda remained limited, failing to debunk the hypervisible racist and Islamophobic perpetrator myths circulating on Dutch social media.",

          "abstract": "On social media, posting positive content should generate positive emotions via emotional contagion. Yet, emerging discussions regarding toxic positivity (TP) suggest that positivity can backfire, showing the limits of emotional contagion. Through the perspective of neoliberal self-help ideology, this research investigated how people understand and perceive TP. Study 1 found, via focus groups, that social media posts containing TP involve two message characteristics—overgeneralization and commanding words—and two psychological processes—ignoring negativity and perceived poster privilege. Additionally, post ephemerality mitigates the negative effects of TP. Study 2 experimentally tested these findings. It found that the effect of post positivity (low positivity / high positivity / toxic positivity message characteristics) on post liking was mediated by ignoring negativity and perceived privilege . However, ephemerality did not moderate the aforementioned mediation relationships. Therefore, the concepts associated with TP—overgeneralization, commanding words, ignoring negativity, and perceived privilege—can be understood as boundary conditions for online emotional contagion.",

However, little education research has been done on how adolescents in general – including Black adolescents – learn the skills involved in these activities. Through analyzing data from the nationally representative National Survey of Critical Digital Literacy, this 7-day daily diary study found that Black and Latinx youth reported significantly higher daily frequencies of practicing critical race digital literacy skills than their White counterparts. Enactment of these skills also varied by day of the week and was reported more on weekdays than on weekends. These findings show that Black adolescents have practices of critical digital literacy skills they can build upon, and suggest White adolescents need additional support in developing these skills.",

Analyses involve a thousand original hateful posts and the subsequent posts by the same posters ( N = 1,227,756 posts) on Gab—a platform particularly hospitable to hate messaging—and Likes, Dislikes, and written replies from other users that affirmed or negated the initial hate posts. Likes and affirming replies were commonplace, whereas Dislikes and negation replies were rare. Getting Likes and affirming replies decreased subsequent toxicity in the short term, as did getting no responses whatsoever. Getting Dislikes increased the hatefulness of users’ next original post and their posts over the next 3 months. Results challenge both the social approval theory of online hate and the need-threat approach to effects of responses to social media hate posting.",

          "abstract": "This article theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the article reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.",

To do so, we theorise ‘contextualised digital play drivers’, understood as children’s own accounts, or adults’ interpretations, of the deep interests, needs and desires their play appears to fulfil. This approach moves beyond dominant lenses focused on individual autonomy, offering a more situated reading acknowledging the individual and contextual circumstances shaping digital play.

          "abstract": "Although AI-driven fact-checking has been extensively applied on social media, it is unclear whether presenting AI rather than humans (e.g. social media platform administrators) as a fact-checker will affect people’s credibility perceptions of misinformation. Furthermore, most studies on machine heuristics have mainly focused on the positive machine heuristic and neglected the negative machine heuristic. In this study, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted to address these gaps in knowledge. The results show that presenting AI rather than platform administrators as fact-checkers indirectly led participants to perceive false short-form health videos as more credible via the mediation of the negative machine heuristic rather than the positive machine heuristic. In addition, among participants who initially held a stronger belief in misinformation, the fact-checking provided by AI (vs administrator) generated even more negative machine heuristic, which further led them to perceive the false videos as more credible.",

Using critical discourse analysis, we examined how Flemish newspaper media (March 2020–March 2023) represented digital exclusion as a social problem, the proposed solutions of digital inclusion, and the actors portrayed as responsible for implementing these solutions. Our findings reveal that newspaper coverage predominantly frames digital inclusion through a neoliberal and techno-solutionist lens, emphasizing a “strong digital society” and attributing responsibility to “digitally unskilled” individuals to adapt. However, we also identified a counter-discourse which focuses on structural inequalities, digital access barriers, and the notion of responsible and sustainable digitalization. We argue that the prevailing neoliberal framing risks reinforcing exclusion rather than fostering inclusivity. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.",

Users’ assumption of these influences raises for them critical concerns about privacy, transparency, information insularity, targeted data manipulation, and the reproduction of societal biases in Autocomplete’s outputs. My analysis also shows that users view explanations as a promising mechanism to enhance accountability in Autocomplete systems.

To investigate this, we conducted a four-condition (user location: Beijing vs. Guizhou vs. the United States vs. no location) between-subjects online experiment ( N = 240) that examined how the displayed location of a social media user influenced viewers’ psychological responses to online self-disclosure messages. We also tested for two psychological mediators: perceived homophily and perceived spatial distance. We found that the displayed location of the poster (i.e., the individual who makes the social media post) affected readers’ perceived homophily and in turn their responses (empathy, source liking, perceived social distance) to support-seeking self-disclosure messages on social media.

Analyzing more than 20 million block log entries from 2004 to 2024, the study identifies shifts in block frequency, duration, and stated rationales. A significant increase in preemptive, automated blocking of open proxies since 2020 accounts for most block activity, but excluding these reveals a broader trend toward longer blocks and vaguer rationales such as “disruption.” These patterns suggest that volunteers are scaling labor through automation and normative adjustment, trading openness for efficiency and stability. Wikipedia’s blocking trends help to contextualize governance pressures on volunteer-run knowledge platforms.",

However, this need not be the path forward. We argue that now is an opportune time for greater policy emphasis on collaborative robots, or “cobots,” which are designed to complement rather than replace manual labor while raising productivity. To realize this potential, policies must properly align incentives, support training, and address often overlooked issues such as monitoring and privacy. Through an interdisciplinary lens, we examine the current state of cobot deployment and describe how well‐designed job tasks, paired with carefully integrated cobots, can preserve employment opportunities while improving ergonomics and enhancing productivity. Strategic policy measures aimed at redirecting investments can balance manufacturers' needs while ensuring stable employment, higher wages, and safer workplaces. With informed and deliberate policy, the adoption of cobots can mark a new phase of technological progress while averting the costly dislocations that accompanied past automation and offshoring.",

          "abstract": "The United States spends more than $4 trillion per year on health care, largely conducted by private providers and reimbursed by insurers. A major concern in this system is overbilling and fraud by hospitals, who face incentives to misreport their claims to receive higher payments. In this work, we develop novel machine learning tools to identify hospitals that overbill insurers, which can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious hospitals for both public and private health insurance systems. Using large‐scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, we identify patterns consistent with fraud among inpatient hospitalizations. Our proposed approach for fraud detection is fully unsupervised, not relying on any labeled training data, and is explainable to end users, providing interpretations for which diagnosis, procedure, and billing codes lead to hospitals being labeled suspicious. Using newly collected data from the Department of Justice on hospitals facing anti‐fraud lawsuits, and case studies of suspicious hospitals, we validate our approach and findings. Our method provides a nearly fivefold lift over random targeting of hospitals. We also perform a postanalysis to understand which hospital characteristics, not used for detection, are associated with suspiciousness.",

          "authors": "Larry L. Orr",
          "abstract": "Policymakers are often urged to rely on “evidence‐based policy” (EBP)—adopting only interventions proven effective (i.e., positive and statistically significant in multisite impact evaluations). EBP clearinghouses chronicle and rate tests of social policy interventions. But EBP clearinghouse standards are based almost entirely on internal validity. They largely ignore whether research findings from multisite trials apply to individual localities, where much of social policy is formulated. We develop a Bayesian model of the probability that the EBP rule is sound advice to local policymakers. The model allows a direct test of the probability of a correct policy decision under the EBP rule, its positive predictive value (PPV), and its negative predictive value (NPV)—the probabilities that an intervention deemed effective by that rule will in fact be effective in a particular site (PPV), and that an intervention deemed ineffective will not be effective in a particular site (NPV), given the true impact of the intervention. These intuitive, easily calculated probabilities are major contributions of this paper. In our illustrative analysis of six multisite randomized trials, we find that under the EBP clearinghouse rule the probability of a correct policy decision, PPV, and NPV are all unacceptably low unless the cross‐site impact heterogeneity is quite low.",

We combine novel administrative data from “The Integrity Profile” (USDA administrative data on stores participating in WIC and their WIC reimbursements) with new nationwide policy data on WIC EBT implementation. Using a staggered adoption difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that the transition had heterogeneous and occasionally unanticipated effects across states. The number of WIC‐authorized independent vendors declined 10% following WIC EBT implementation. We find no significant effect of WIC EBT implementation on WIC redemptions in a subset of ZIP codes with sufficient vendors for data sharing. Vendors in states that were early adopters of WIC EBT have more negative effects on the probability of WIC authorization, which may be due to learning effects or improvements in technology over time. Past experience with EBT implementation by financial services providers hired by states to help them implement WIC EBT processing (processors) reduces the magnitude of these negative effects of EBT implementation on store participation in WIC.",

This study addresses this gap by examining elite interviewing practices and transparency using an original dataset of articles published in 13 leading political science journals between 2000 and 2023. Drawing on article content and supplementary materials, I analyze trends in the use and quality of elite interviews, highlighting an increasing reliance on this method, particularly in comparative politics. Findings show promising improvements in reporting practices over time. Systematic reporting and the inclusion of online appendices significantly enhance transparency, offering detailed insights into ethical considerations, confidentiality, and data-sharing practices.

          "abstract": "International organizations (IOs) are considered ideal scapegoats for opportunistic member state governments. Yet we know surprisingly little about whether and when governments indeed shift blame onto IOs. We argue that IO scapegoating is not as pervasive as commonly assumed because blaming IOs is costly. Blaming IOs undermines governments’ credibility and threatens their cooperation gains. To reap cooperation gains, governments can instead defend the IO and bear public discontent. We theorize a Cooperation-Contestation Trade-Off that explains when governments blame or defend IOs: governments that rely heavily on international cooperation are more likely to defend IOs while governments that expect costly domestic contestation are more likely to blame them. We assess our theory by examining governments’ communication about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – an IO commonly assumed to be a perfect scapegoat. With an originally collected dataset of more than 800 statements referring to the IMF made by heads of governments in major IMF borrower countries, we find supportive evidence for our expectations. Crucially, we observe that whilst governments do frequently blame the IMF, they in fact defend the Fund more than they blame it. Our findings yield important implications for international cooperation in times of heightened politicization of IOs.",

Sometimes, potential participants may be “hard to reach”—for example, they are physically located in remote areas where the lack of infrastructure necessitates extensive travel and/or difficult logistics. Alternatively, they may be “vulnerable” due to disenfranchisement (incarcerated populations), stigma (those living with HIV/AIDS), or at risk if they share their experiences (people living in authoritarian states). Or participants may be “hidden”—that is, no record of their experiences exists, which, in turn, makes it difficult to find and recruit them (Ellard-Gray et al. 2015). 1",

          "abstract": "This article examines how Latina Republican Congressional candidates frame themselves as both embodying and representing the “real Latino electorate,” who they claim has been ignored in the U.S. political arena. In this article, I engage in an in-depth analysis of these candidates — including content analyses of their public interviews, speeches, advertisements, websites, newspaper coverage, and social media presences — in four border districts in Texas. I find that the ways in which these candidates strategically reframe Latinidad and the immigrant experience to align with Republican ideology allow these candidates to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform while simultaneously engaging in the Latino threat narrative that dehumanizes the very community they claim to represent. More specifically, these candidates articulate an alternate, intersectional vision of Latinidad which presents Latino immigrant women and children as victims, Latino immigrant men as criminals, and themselves as unique authorities on immigration given their status as border patrol wives. These candidates’ race-gender consciousness also allows these candidates to express political anger, which has generally been denied to women of color in the Republican Party. In so doing, they offer a pointed critique claiming that Latinos are a captured group in American political parties.",

          "abstract": "Transnational private institutions (TPIs) operate at the intersection of technocratic efficiency and democratic accountability, raising important questions about when and why they adopt particular legitimation strategies. This study theorizes and empirically examines the role of regulatory issue area as an explanatory variable by analyzing the legitimation strategies of a prominent TPI: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which presents a unique case due to its expansion from technical to societal standard‐setting. Drawing on a two‐dimensional conceptual framework from the literature on international organizations and a novel dataset covering ISO's full standard portfolio, the study shows that ISO's legitimation strategies vary systematically depending on whether a standard addresses societal or physical issue areas. These findings reinforce the argument that issue area shapes the use of democratic and technocratic legitimation strategies among TPIs. The insights are especially relevant as TPIs increasingly engage in the governance of societal concerns, a development that, as this study suggests, significantly shapes how they seek legitimacy and merits further scholarly attention.",

          "abstract": "We approach public communication of bureaucratic organizations as a means of reputation management and argue that social media communication that abstains from making reference to other agencies is in line with a turf‐protective strategy, whereas communication that seeks to establish a link to other agencies is in line with a strategy to embrace new issues and expand policy competencies. Using climate policy communication by EU agencies on the social media platform Twitter (currently X), we show that agencies operating in policy fields traditionally linked to climate policy and holding a policy mandate refer less to their counterparts in their social media communication than agencies without such a climate mandate and operating in policy fields more recently linked to the issue. We find that agencies opt for either turf protective and risk‐averse or expansive and reputation‐building strategies, depending on what fits their interest best.",

          "authors": "Wout Jan‐Willem Sommerauer, Bregje van der Bolt, Saskia Werners, Wouter Julius Smolenaars, Fulco Ludwig",
          "abstract": "We examine how co‐creation and collaborative learning have been operationalized in climate adaptation pathway development over the past decade using a systematic review of 36 case study papers. While co‐creation and collaborative learning are increasingly recognized as important for effective adaptation planning, it remains unclear how different approaches can support adaptation goals. Our co‐creation analysis identifies three participation clusters: (i) information‐focused participation involving primarily one‐way knowledge extraction through interviews; (ii) researcher‐mediated participation featuring two‐way engagement through workshops, while researchers maintain process control; and (iii) co‐organized participation where stakeholders serve as co‐designers with defined leadership roles throughout the process. For collaborative learning, defined as structured knowledge exchange and capacity building among stakeholders, we distinguish between instrumental learning that emerges incidentally from stakeholder interaction versus process‐integrated learning that is explicitly designed and monitored throughout pathway development. Cases with co‐organized participation consistently aligned with process‐integrated learning, suggesting these approaches can be mutually beneficial. Analysis of reported impacts (including policy implementation, follow‐up research, and capacity building outcomes) reveals that more extensive participation combined with organized learning correlates with a greater likelihood of impacts. This review contributes to the growing body of knowledge on stakeholder engagement in adaptation pathways planning, and while the identified participation clusters and learning approaches offer systematic guidance for methodology selection, they should be viewed as flexible frameworks rather than prescriptive categories, adaptable to specific contexts and planning objectives.

In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of fecal microbiome metagenomic data, paired with granular dietary assessments and phenotypic profiles, across a cohort of 818 children (462 with ASD, 356 without ASD; mean age = 8.4 years; 27.3% female). By integrating dietary indices, nutrient intake, and food additive exposures, we uncovered ASD-specific linkages to the microbiome. Poor dietary quality correlated with aggregated core autistic symptoms, gastrointestinal complications, and atypical eating behaviors. Notably, children with ASD exhibited a more pronounced diet-microbiome interaction network compared to neurotypical peers, suggesting heightened microbial sensitivity to nutritional inputs. Furthermore, synthetic emulsifiers—specifically polysorbate-80 and carrageenan—were associated with disrupted microbial connectivity in ASD, a phenomenon attenuated in neurotypical children. Our findings elucidate the mechanistic links between dietary factors—particularly synthetic food additives—and microbiome dysregulation in ASD, urging a re-evaluation of dietary guidelines for ASD populations and laying the groundwork for personalized nutritional strategies.",

Better description of risk factors for new infections would improve prioritisation of interventions. Using data from population-based cohorts in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe we described the prevalence of risk factors for men and women aged 15-24 and 25-49 and estimated the association between individual and community-level risk factors and HIV acquisition between 2005 and 2016. Among 43,434 men and 55,919 women aged 15 to 49 there were 4,612 seroconversions. Education, marital status, male circumcision, new sexual partners, types of partner, prevalence of untreated HIV infection in the community and community partner acquisition rates were associated with HIV incidence. Only the prevalence of untreated HIV was a risk for both sexes and apparent at all ages. The prevalence of risk factors varied by age, sex and study. HIV incidence was higher in people aged 25-49 living in communities where men had high partner acquisition rates. Our results show potential for improved prevention through changed timing of prevention interventions relative to behaviour and the utility of using community characteristics to target prevention.",

However, United States migration data have serious drawbacks: public data lack spatial granularity, and higher-resolution proprietary data suffer from multiple biases. To address this, we develop a method that fuses high-resolution proprietary data with coarse Census data to create MIGRATE: annual migration matrices capturing flows between 47.4 billion US Census Block Group pairs—approximately four thousand times the spatial resolution of current public data. Our estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets and improve accuracy relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document demographic and temporal variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance—for example, rising moves into top-income-quartile block groups and racial disparities in upward mobility. Locally, MIGRATE reveals patterns such as wildfire-driven out-migration that are invisible in coarser previous data. We release MIGRATE as a resource for migration researchers.",

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a silent pandemic that presents a global challenge, urging researchers to develop innovative and transdisciplinary solutions. Our initiative aims to promote collaboration across science, engineering, economics, social sciences, and the arts to address the complex dimensions of AMR. We highlight the unique role of early-career researchers (ECRs) in advancing such cross-cutting approaches and conclude that empowering ECRs through equitable support and recognition is essential to sustaining innovation and mobilising communities against AMR.",

          "authors": "Di Tong, Lingfei Wu, James A. Evans",
          "abstract": "Substantial scholarship has estimated the susceptibility of jobs to automation, but little has examined how job contents evolve in the information age as new technologies substitute for tasks, shifting required skills rather than eliminating entire jobs. Here we explore patterns of occupational skill change and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest re-skilling requirements in the United States. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are greatest for STEM occupations in the 2010s. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million online job posts covering 721 occupations, we find that when accounting for distance between skills, skill change is greater for lower-skilled occupations: those with fewer skills, lower wages, and less educational requirements. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer and market size, as well as social demographic groups. We find that jobs from small employers and markets experienced larger skill upgrades to catch up with the skill demands of their large employers and markets. While these varied skill changes could create uneven reskilling pressures across workers, they may also lead to a narrowing of gaps in job quality and prospects. We conclude by showcasing our model’s potential to chart job evolution directions using skill embedding spaces.",

          "abstract": "Do voters punish local politicians for raising taxes? In California, proposed tax increases must be approved via local ballot measures. Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits the narrow passage of local tax initiatives, we find that incumbents do not generally suffer a penalty when cities raise taxes, with the notable exception of business taxes. We explore several mechanisms behind this result and uncover suggestive evidence that business interests may be particularly likely to mobilize following a tax increase. These results suggest that interest groups likely play an important role in determining whether new taxes generate voter backlash.",

We model two news outlets that report on a hidden state of the world, motivated by the ex-post beliefs of the audience about the state of the world. News outlets face a tradeoff when making egregiously false statements. On the one hand, such statements are easily verifiable as false. On the other hand, a demonstrably false report reduces the credibility of the report made by the competing outlet. This is especially true for audiences in autocracies that are characterized by high media cynicism and are prone to making sweeping generalizations about the self-serving nature of all media.",

          "abstract": "This article advances the literature on media effects by examining how contrasting partisan narratives influence support for regulation after a real-world corporate scandal. Using both multi-wave observational and randomized experimental data, we show that self-selected media exposure and experimentally assigned information shape public opinion in distinct ways. While scandals are narratives of regulatory failure, partisan media environments differently attribute blame for that failure. In two separate observational waves, only Democrats exposed to news about the FTX bankruptcy increased their support for crypto regulation. In the experiment, only Republicans shifted in favor of regulation. Research on media effects needs to take into account not only media content, but also the partisan information environments that expose citizens to that content.",

While inattentiveness has been well documented in lower quality sample sources, there is less understanding of how common the phenomenon is in high-quality surveys. We document the presence of a small percentage of respondents in Cooperative Election Study surveys who pass quality control measures but still exhibit inattentive behavior. We show that these respondents may affect public opinion estimates for small subgroups. Finally, we present the results from an experiment testing whether inattentive respondents can be encouraged to pay more attention, but we find that such an intervention fails.",

At the same time, the demand for rigorously constructed and extensively normed experimental materials increased as well. Here, we present the Figurative Archive , an open database of 996 metaphors in Italian enriched with ratings and corpus-based measures (from familiarity to semantic distance and preferred interpretations), derived by collecting stimuli used across 11 studies. It includes both everyday and literary metaphors, varying in structure and semantic domains, and is validated based on correlations between familiarity and other measures. The Archive has several aspects of novelty: it is increased in size compared to previous resources; it offers a measure of metaphor inclusiveness, to comply with recommendations for non-discriminatory language use; it is displayed in a web-based interface, with features for a customized consultation. We provide guidelines for using the Archive to source materials for studies investigating metaphor processing and the relationships between metaphor features in humans and computational models.",

          "abstract": "Empirical research and public knowledge on Malaysia’s elections have long been constrained by a lack of high-quality open data, particularly in the absence of a Freedom of Information framework. This paper introduces the Malaysian Election Corpus (MECo), an open-access panel database covering all federal and state general elections since 1955, as well as by-elections since 2008. MECo includes candidate- and constituency-level data for 9,704 electoral contests across seven decades, standardised with unique identifiers for candidates, parties, and coalitions. The database also provides summary statistics for each contest (electorate size, voter turnout, majority size, rejected ballots, unreturned ballots), key demographic data for candidates (age, gender, ethnicity), and lineage data for political parties. MECo is the most well-curated open database on Malaysian elections to date, and will unlock new opportunities for research, data journalism, and civic engagement.",

          "authors": "Skyler Wang, Marco Dehnert",
          "abstract": "As a burgeoning industry, artificial intelligence (AI) companion platforms capitalize on shifting societal attitudes toward tech-mediated relationships to introduce novel ways of connecting with nonhuman entities. But how are these platforms constituted, and how do they “sell” consumers the idea of human-AI relationships? By analyzing four prominent multimodal companions (AvatarOne, Digi, Paradot, and Replika), we argue that despite differences in architecture and style, state-of-the-art platforms converge on the following sociotechnical qualities: human-likeness, accessibility, customizability, and relationship progression. By creating technical affordances to augment these qualities, companion platforms ultimately project what we call a future of on-demand intimacy – intimacy that can be acquired in a truly frictionless manner. Beyond examining how commercial entities mobilize the grammar of human intimacy in tandem with on-demand culture to create new markets, this study offers a conceptual framework for future research into how platform dynamics shape not only the availability but also the meaning of intimacy in human–AI interactions.",

          "abstract": "Ambiguous loss, a profound sense of grief unrelated to death, is often overlooked in the context of incarceration, particularly among marginalized communities. Families of incarcerated individuals experience profound loss while also feeling disconnected due to systemic barriers and social stigma. This qualitative study explores how Black gang-affiliated youth in Chicago use multimodal posts, combined text, images, and emojis posts, to navigate incarceration-related ambiguous loss. Using Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) and a Strength-based Approach, we analyzed 65 multimodal posts to examine digital memorialization and advocacy. Findings reveal two key themes: Collective Advocacy and Ambiguous Loss and Commemorating Absence , highlighting social solidarity in coping and exploring digital memorialization. Results suggest that social media serves as a critical space for expressing grief, maintaining relationships, advocating for systemic change, and fostering community support. This study contributes to digital mourning and ambiguous loss research, emphasizing how youth use online spaces to process grief and build resilience.",

          "abstract": "Improving population well-being is increasingly recognized as a global priority, yet evidence on the comparative effectiveness of well-being-focused interventions in adults is fragmented. Here we conduct a preregistered systematic review and network meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42023403480) of randomized controlled trials evaluating well-being interventions in adults without diagnosed conditions. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and Scopus (to March 2023) identified 183 trials ( n = 22,811). Interventions included mindfulness-based, compassion-based, acceptance and commitment therapy and positive psychology interventions, as well as exercise, yoga, educational, nature-based programmes and combined exercise-psychological approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2, and data were synthesized using random-effects network meta-analysis. Most interventions improved well-being compared with inactive controls. Combined exercise-psychological interventions produced the largest effect (standardized mean difference of 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 1.20). Mindfulness, compassion, single positive psychology, yoga and exercise interventions demonstrated moderate, consistent effects (standardized mean difference of 0.41–0.49), with no significant differences between interventions. Nature-based interventions were not significantly more effective than controls, but evidence was limited by conceptual and methodological heterogeneity. Risk of bias was frequently moderate to high, and funnel plot asymmetry suggested potential publication bias. However, multiple sensitivity analyses (including grey literature, excluding studies with high risk of bias and small studies) supported the robustness of overall conclusions. Most comparisons (71%) were rated as moderate in certainty of evidence using CINEMA. These findings provide an integrated synthesis of the well-being intervention literature and highlight priority areas for future interdisciplinary, methodologically robust research. No external funding was received.",

          "abstract": "As electric vehicle adoption accelerates globally, fuel tax revenues decline, exposing government budgets without a proposed replacement tax on electric vehicles. We estimate fuel tax transition exposure across 168 countries, demonstrating that relative exposure, in percentage of total government revenues, varies substantially by income level. Our analysis finds that global public revenues from fuel taxes totalled approximately US$900 billion in 2023. Crucially, we show that lower-income countries face disproportionately high exposure, experience frequent debt crises and possess limited institutional capacity to respond, potentially necessitating international support.",

          "abstract": "In mitigating and adapting to climate change-related risks, unbiased risk assessments are essential. Yet individuals systematically rate their personal risks as lower than those of others, believing themselves to be less at risk than others (that is, a self–other discrepancy). In a preregistered multi-level meta-analysis, we estimate the overall effect and boundary conditions for a self–other discrepancy in climate change-related risk perceptions. The synthesis incorporated 60 datasets, comprising 83 effect sizes from 70,337 participants across 17 countries. Results revealed that in 81 of 83 datasets, participants perceived their personal climate change-related risks as lower than others ( d = −0.54, 95% CI [−0.68, −0.39]). This skewness was robust across specific extreme weather-related hazards and general climate change-related risks. Notably, the self–other discrepancy was less pronounced when comparisons involved specific others (for example, neighbours) or high-risk regions (for example, Asia), and more pronounced when the referents were compatriots or humanity as a whole or when the context was low-risk regions (for example, Europe). These results highlight a critical implication for the general public and a challenge for risk communicators: a widespread misperception, where people perceive personal climate change-related risks as lower than others, may hinder public engagement in mitigation and adaptation efforts.",

          "abstract": "The EU Nature Restoration Regulation suggests the implementation of green space as nature-based solutions to enhance urban resilience toward increasing climate risks such as extreme precipitation events and floods in Europe. Scenario based approaches enable the evaluation of the potential of specific nature-based solutions to mitigate flood risk in high flood hazard and vulnerable areas. In this study, we explore the flood risks from heavy rainfall and the potential of nature-based solutions implementations in the city of Hannover, Germany. Using the InVEST urban flood risk mitigation model, we modelled the surface runoff from heavy rainfall and assessed the social vulnerability using population and infrastructure data resulting in a flood risk evaluation. To test flood mitigation under nature-based solutions implementations including grass grid pavers and green roofs, we estimated the runoff improvement under three nature-based solutions scenarios following recommendations from the EU Nature Restoration Regulation. Our analysis revealed that Hannover’s inner-city area is particularly flood-prone and socially vulnerable, while peripheral districts are less affected. The combined risk and vulnerability arise from the surface sealing in built-up areas and their higher population density and associated infrastructure. The scenario results demonstrate flood risk reduction potential when combining different nature-based solutions, though on a limited level calling for more explicit and ambitious regulations at EU, regional and local levels.",

          "abstract": "Urban livability is shaped by dominant values, often economic or aesthetic, and power dynamics that often overlook the lived experiences of deprived urban area (DUA) residents. As a result, conventional livability indicators risk reinforcing existing inequalities unless these are grounded in inclusive and participatory approaches. To address this issue, we developed lightweight deep learning models – ‘AI-voters’ – trained on livability preferences from both DUA residents and city planners, using open-source satellite imagery. Applied in Ghana’s Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, our approach reduced data requirements to map urban livability by 90% through a two-step urban form sampling strategy that enabled scalable participatory mapping. Training separate ‘AI-voters’ for planners and DUA residents revealed systematic differences: planners not only disagree among themselves but also consistently assign higher livability scores and overlook the preferences of DUA residents, such as avoiding coastal area exposure. The AI-voters mirrored human-voter behavior based on physical urban features such as greenery and building density, especially when trained on the preferences of DUA residents, demonstrating their potential as scalable proxies for local insights. These results highlight the importance of integrating community perspectives into AI models trained to map urban livability to expose hidden spatial inequities and promote more inclusive urban development.",

          "abstract": "Urban resilience and vulnerability are often paired conceptually, but the dynamics of their relationships are rarely tested with space-time-based data. We tracked the 2019 European heatwave across Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, combining hour-by-hour ambulance calls with district profiles identified from demographic, socioeconomic, health, and built environment attributes. We find significant differences in the factors driving vulnerability. The familiar rule of ‘more vulnerable, less resilient’ only partially holds: some vulnerable districts showed high resilience at particular times of the day, while seemingly less vulnerable districts showed low resilience. These swings point to the importance of local adaptive behaviours and urban social fabric in shaping dynamic vulnerability-resilience relationships. Our findings call for dynamic, district-specific planning: vulnerability assessments must look beyond averages, and resilience measures should flex with daily rhythms. Effective heatwave policy demands context-aware tools that treat resilience and vulnerability as intertwined, shifting properties of the urban social fabric.",
