          "authors": "Farjana Nipa, André Feliciano Lino, Thankom Arun",
          "abstract": "Addressing “wicked” problems like climate change requires collaborative efforts from public, private, and third‐sector organizations (TSOs), making a co‐productive approach especially promising. However, traditional co‐production research often overlooks the contributions of TSOs and the voices of marginalized populations. This study addresses these gaps by exploring the role of TSOs as intermediaries in co‐producing climate actions by empowering vulnerable communities. Through a case study of a project led by BRAC, a prominent hybrid TSO in Bangladesh, we find that creating a relational space for co‐production—in this case, Climate Action Groups—is the key strategy used to foster active engagement and build long‐term climate resilience. These spaces reach their full potential when intentionally supported by mechanisms such as awareness raising and shared goals, the incorporation of local knowledge, and inclusive engagement strategies. Our research contributes to the literature by demonstrating how TSOs facilitate meaningful co‐production with vulnerable groups, thereby broadening our understanding of their role in climate governance and providing a comprehensive, practice‐based model of sustainable, community‐led adaptation. These findings offer valuable insights and emphasize the vital role of TSOs in developing practical and sustainable strategies for climate change adaptation.",

          "title": "Debunking the Digital Myth: Can Digital Governance Embedding Enhance Local Governments' Environmental Governance Efficiency? The Role of Implementation Burden",
          "authors": "Bin Guan, Yaoen Yu",
          "abstract": "Digital governance has received fervent attention from both theoretical and practical domains in recent years, and has gradually been touted as a “panacea” for addressing various issues. Especially on the issue of environmental protection, governments worldwide have sought to enhance their environmental governance efficiency by embedding the concepts, technologies, and methods of digital governance. However, while the potential benefits of digital governance embedding have garnered considerable academic attention, the associated implementation burdens it imposes on the public sector have received relatively little scrutiny or discussion. Based on panel data from 225 prefecture‐level cities in China from 2014 to 2022, this study empirically analyzes the impact of digital governance embedding on local government's environmental governance efficiency and unveils its mechanism from the perspective of implementation burden. The study found that: (1) Digital governance embedding has a “U‐shaped” impact on the environmental governance efficiency of local governments; (2) The implementation burdens arising from digital governance embedding constitute the core mechanism explaining this “U‐shaped” relationship; (3) Local governments' transformative public value preferences can mitigate the negative effects of implementation burdens on environmental governance efficiency. By incorporating the theoretical perspectives of implementation burden and public value preferences, the results can help scholars and practitioners rationally understand the impact of digital governance embedding on public sector's organizational operation and governance performance.",

          "authors": "Thomas Bolognesi, Manuel Fischer",
          "abstract": "International Organizations formulate and disseminate principles of good governance for issues such as urban water governance. These principles are formulated in universal and general terms, for example, more transparency or participation, and are intended to enhance governance effectiveness. Yet, the relationship between such principles and governance effectiveness is not linear. Different combinations of principles affect governance effectiveness differently, depending on the context. It raises the general question of the influence of policy instruments interactions on policy outcomes. We investigate two types of non‐linearities. The first, direct non‐linearities, are instrument‐specific and characterized by two thresholds: a minimum level required to ensure effectiveness, and a second level beyond which positive effects begin to decrease marginally. The second type, compositional non‐linearities, refers to the idea that policy instruments are most effective when combined in specific ways (joint effect) or by being an enabling condition for others. We study the case of urban water governance in 35 megacities worldwide, based on empirical data from OECD reports and a fuzzy‐set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. The present study assesses the impact of assesses how combinations of economic, participatory, and regulatory policy instruments affect urban water loss, as a policy outcome. We found that price and wealth are important enabling conditions within the policy design. Regulation and participation have important joint effects and follow the logic of direct non‐linearities. Their absence or excessive presence can be detrimental, but they are critical for effectiveness when combined with other policy instruments.",

          "authors": "James E Wright, Andrea M Headley, Youghyun Cho",
          "abstract": "This study investigates leadership representation and the perceptions of public employees, specifically focusing on a fire department led by a Black fire chief. Drawing from literature on representative bureaucracy and relational demography, we explore how leadership representation influences street-level bureaucrats’ views on diversity and representation within the organization. Through in-depth interviews with both Black and White firefighters, we find distinctions in their perceptions regarding racial diversity and representation. Firstly, Black firefighters viewed the presence of a Black leader as empowering, leading to opportunities for professional advancement and a commitment to community representation. In contrast, White firefighters perceived race-based diversity efforts as undermining meritocracy. Secondly, White firefighters preferred to avoid having discussions about race and diversity within the workplace, often referring to their familial bond and collective firefighter identity that minimized racial differences among their colleagues. Moreover, White firefighters are colorblind until race poses a material threat to them. Black firefighters reported selectively engaging in discussions depending on the context or cultural environment, or avoiding conversations, especially when they perceived potential consequences. Our findings suggest that leadership representation serves as a context to further interrogate these divergences. This research expands our understanding of leadership representation within public agencies and practically highlights the importance of managing diversity issues to foster inclusivity and mitigate tensions.",

          "authors": "Malcolm Fairbrother, Ingemar Johansson Sevä, Joakim Kulin",
          "abstract": "Most people are concerned about climate change and want policymakers to address it. But how? To investigate which policy options are more versus less popular, with whom, and why, we collected data in four European countries on attitudes toward 16 policies: taxes, bans, regulations, and subsidies/spending. We argue that support for different policies should reflect perceptions of policies’ net costs, and that such perceptions are likely influenced by people’s political trust. We tested this expectation by randomly assigning survey respondents to read different versions of given policies and confirmed that individuals with low political trust, who are less supportive overall of most policies, are most sensitive to variation in implied costs. We argue this interaction effect is a previously untested implication of the influential theory that political trust operates as a heuristic, and it helps explain policies’ varying popularity, including the puzzle of why carbon taxes are highly unpopular.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing number of minority elected officials, extant research has yet to understand if minority political representation improves social equity of budget allocation. This study tests whether having more minority representatives on county legislative bodies is associated with higher government redistributive spending, a key indicator of equitable resource distribution. Drawing on Peterson's (1981) classification of government programs into developmental, redistributive, and allocational, we investigate the impact of minority political representation on budget allocation in the context of the U.S. local government. Data from Florida's 67 counties from 2005 to 2018 demonstrate that enhancing minority political representation in county commissions is associated with a larger redistributive budget share relative to developmental and allocational shares. Moreover, we find that having a home rule charter amplifies the effect of minority representation on redistributive spending, further enhancing the distributive equity of public resource allocation.",

          "abstract": "Strategic improvisation often occurs in fast‐paced decision‐making environments. Yet, improvisation has received little scholarly attention in public administration and management. This knowledge gap leads to the study's research question: what drives strategic improvisation in the emergency services of a developing country? To answer this research question, the article examines the socio‐structural pathways to strategic improvisation by drawing on survey questionnaire data collected from serving police officers in the Royal Malaysia Police. Data is analyzed using fuzzy‐set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) and this configurational approach reveals key socio‐structural recipes for strategic improvisation to materialize. Specifically, the analysis reveals a core set of socio‐structural conditions—top management support and knowledge collecting and donating—that can be further augmented in two different ways, either by (i) the presence of self‐efficacy among decision‐makers or (ii) through an information communication technologies capability and management status as a peripheral condition for strategic improvisation.",

          "authors": "Anouk van Twist",
          "abstract": "Governments employ public deliberation in response to citizen discontent, intending to achieve consensus, mutual understanding, and clarification. However, some studies suggest that deliberation can devolve into a “dialogue of the deaf,” where parties talk past each other, counterproductively leading to conflict, distrust, and confusion. Remarkably, there is limited theoretical and empirical research on how deliberation leads to such adverse outcomes. To explore this, the study examines a Dutch city's 5G rollout that unexpectedly sparked discontent. Using documents and visual materials, the mutual communication between the local government and discontented citizens is analyzed through the theoretical lens of deliberative standards as perceived by both parties. The findings reveal that a dialogue of the deaf arises from differing perceptions of whether their interactions meet the standards of good deliberation: respect, inclusion, reason, common good orientation, reciprocity, and accountability. This research highlights the need for meta‐deliberation to address undiscussed perceptions on good deliberation.",

This research utilizes bibliometric metadata from 64 articles published between 2009 and 2024 to identify the intellectual structure and origins of the concept. The findings indicate that discussions on the deep state are fragmented across disciplines such as political science, public administration, law, international relations, and history, intersecting with themes like democratization, civilian‐military relations, and informal networks, yet the concept has not formed into a standalone idea. Interpretations of the concept differ regionally and temporally: in the Middle East, it is associated with civilian‐military dynamics; in Thailand, with interactions among the monarchy, judiciary, and officials; in the United States, historically, the focus has been the military‐industrial complex, which shifted to the administrative state post‐Trump. These variations highlight the need for a comprehensive theoretical framework, for which public administration could provide essential theoretical and methodological support.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how administrative burden in college admissions affects individuals with criminal records, with attention to racial disparities. Grounded in administrative burden theory and the role of street‐level bureaucrats, it examines how admissions representatives respond to applicants with disclosed criminal histories. Through a correspondence audit experiment, fictitious applicants—Tyrone (presumed Black) and Christopher (presumed White)—sent inquiries to institutions of higher education (IHE) about how a criminal record might affect admissions. While most responses did not differ significantly in tone, warmth, or encouragement, Tyrone faced greater administrative burden in two key areas: Tyrone was more likely to receive a list of formal procedural requirements and to experience longer response times. These differences reflect psychological and compliance costs that disproportionately affect minoritized applicants. Findings underscore the need for targeted policy reforms that reduce discretionary barriers and promote more equitable pathways into IHEs for individuals with criminal justice involvement.",

          "abstract": "Data manipulation plagues principals for providing noisy performance data. Yet, it also has pitfalls for agents, which receive relatively little attention in the literature. Due to the performance data manipulated by previous agents, incumbent agents fall into the dilemma regarding whether to continue or curb data manipulation. We argue that to navigate the dilemma, political agents leverage the anti‐corruption opportunity window to curb data manipulation. Using panel data from China's local governments spanning 2001–2018, we find evidence supporting this claim. Local government leaders reduce data manipulation when their predecessors are expelled. Furthermore, leaders reduce data manipulation to a greater extent in response to the negative performance feedback. It is also more likely for leaders promoted from outside of the jurisdiction to reduce data manipulation during the opportunity window. These results advance the literature on data manipulation and have implications for performance management.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how public organizations can lower employee burnout is important because burnout negatively affects both employee well‐being and service effectiveness. This study explores whether public service motivation (PSM) can help alleviate burnout among frontline public sector workers, who frequently encounter high job demands and conflicting roles that heighten burnout risks. Analyzing two‐wave matched survey data from police officers collected in 2019 and 2021, this study examines whether PSM reduces burnout by strengthening perceptions of work prosocial impact. Results show that PSM's impact on burnout varies by burnout type, with a stronger effect on work depersonalization than on emotional exhaustion. By focusing on work prosocial impact as a mediating factor, this study helps to explain past conflicting findings. It enhances understanding of the PSM‐burnout link and suggests that fostering a sense of positive impact could be an effective strategy for public organizations to reduce frontline worker burnout, especially during crisis periods.",

          "abstract": "Implementation programs, such as demonstration programs (DPs), have garnered significant attention in both research and practice. Existing literature on DPs predominantly focuses on their impact on participant performance, overlooking the mechanisms through which DPs shape policy implementation processes. This study investigates how DPs are systematically constructed to facilitate broader implementation by disentangling their core design requirements. Through a mixed‐methods analysis of China's National Food Safety Demonstration City program, the research identifies that DPs ensure the demonstration function and program scalability through recognizing performance‐relevant demonstrations and dynamically adjusting participant selection criteria from effectiveness to relevance. They provide participants with reputational incentives and incorporate quality measures that safeguard and enhance demonstration quality with evolving priorities. These adaptive strategies strengthen participants' implementation efforts, stimulate program enrollment, and garner support from local authorities. This research advances understanding of policy implementation and offers practical insights for optimizing the deployment of demonstration‐based instruments.",

This study fills this gap by examining the impact of informal networks on policy tourism, an important channel for policy learning and intergovernmental collaboration. Using China as a case, we indicate that local leaders' informal networks facilitate the initiation of policy tourism. Stronger informal networks are more likely to motivate local leaders to initiate a policy visit. However, informal networks are fluid and vulnerable to disruption. Adverse shocks to a local leader's career may undermine their effectiveness. In particular, the downfall of local leaders in destination cities evidently reduces the likelihood of policy tourism. Local leaders are less likely to visit cities where leaders are under corruption investigation, especially when they share career ties with them.",

          "abstract": "When algorithmic decision‐making systems fail to function as intended, they become conduits for administrative error and risk producing arbitrary determinations through the very technologies meant to prevent them. Analysis of 71 federal and state court dockets contesting algorithm‐based determinations in disability, unemployment, and nutrition assistance programs shows how this risk manifests in practice. Findings show that deviations from legally prescribed outcomes occur when the translation of statutory requirements into computational logic is compromised by flawed data, problematic design choices, or inherent system limitations. These algorithmic administrative errors are neither isolated glitches nor purely technical problems; they constitute a systemic governance problem that cuts across legal, organizational, and technical domains. Addressing them requires coordinated oversight across all three areas, rather than reliance on post hoc troubleshooting.",

          "title": "The Regulation of Third‐Party Verification Entities in Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Schemes: Lessons From China",
          "authors": "Ying Xie, Michael Faure",
          "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes worldwide broadly adopt third‐party verification, introducing private actors into public climate governance. However, the involvement of third‐party verifiers can create the risk that no accurate and reliable data concerning emissions is acquired, and this potentially harms the proper implementation of emissions trading schemes. This paper explores why the intervention of third‐party verifiers in emissions trading schemes requires regulation and addresses the regulatory tools for controlling verifiers. To illustrate the need to regulate verifiers, China's emissions trading schemes are discussed. It is argued that the regulation of third‐party verification in China's emissions trading schemes is justified by potential concerns about the independence of verifiers. Moreover, adverse selection and moral hazard may arise. This paper also analyzes the extent to which China's emissions trading scheme regulations for third‐party verifiers conform to the economic theories of regulation.",

          "title": "The Comparative Political Economy of the Green Transition: Economic Specializations and Skills Regimes in Europe",
          "authors": "Luca Cigna, Donato Di Carlo, Niccolò Durazzi",
          "abstract": "The green transition is fundamentally transforming contemporary economies and societies. This article investigates how European models of capitalism perform and specialize across the green value chain—conceptualized as innovation, manufacturing, services, and deployment—and how national skill formation systems underpin these specializations. Integrating insights from comparative capitalism literatures with descriptive statistics and principal component analysis (PCA), we develop and test expectations about growth regime‐specific patterns of green specialization and skill profiles. Our findings reveal marked cross‐national variation between green leaders and laggards: Nordic economies characterized by dynamic services and continental manufacturing‐based models are frontrunners in the green transition, while Eastern Europe's FDI‐led regimes and Southern Europe's demand‐led regimes emerge as laggards. Furthermore, PCA results uncover two distinct decarbonization pathways among European green leaders: one group of countries (Austria, Finland, Germany) specializes in green manufacturing, supported by high shares of STEM graduates; another (Denmark, Switzerland, and to a lesser extent Norway and Sweden) focuses on green innovation and dynamic services, sustained by a strong supply of STEM doctorates. This article contributes to political economy debates on the green transition by identifying distinct green specializations and decarbonization pathways across European models of capitalism and by underscoring the growing centrality of high‐level STEM skills in the green transition.",

          "title": "State Intervention in Vocational Education: Training for the Digital and Green Transitions",
          "authors": "Milan Thies",
          "abstract": "Governments across the European Union (EU) have pledged a stronger commitment to vocational education and training (VET) in response to economic structural change. But have states actually become more central to skill formation? Using mixed methods, this paper examines whether state involvement in European skill formation systems has increased over the past two decades. Applying seeded Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to 291 standardized descriptions of VET systems, the study finds that language associated with state involvement grew notably in most EU member states compared to private governance between 2005 and 2022. An in‐depth case study of Germany, a least likely case for increased state intervention, confirms these findings qualitatively and explores why governments intervene in VET systems. Drawing on 32 elite interviews, the study highlights how digitalization and climate change imperatives have created a window of opportunity for redefining the role of the state in VET.",

          "title": "The Expanding Digital Reach of the Chinese State: Digital Governance in China",
          "authors": "Genia Kostka, Anton Bogs",
          "abstract": "Drawing on recent cases of digital technology adoption in China, this paper investigates changes in the digital reach of the Chinese state. We focus first on state capacity, a key dimension of state reach, and show that the adoption of digital technologies by central and local governments has increased coercive, administrative, and extractive capacity. We also examine the state's intrusiveness and show that digitalizing governance and regulatory processes has enabled new forms of power abuse, leading to resource waste and resistance among citizens. We contend that broader societal debate on the practices and outcomes of digital governance is essential to addressing these challenges. While digitalization poses unique challenges to regulators and societies worldwide, China's advanced experience offers important lessons.",

          "title": "How the Butler Did It: Investigating Individual City Influence on National Policy",
          "authors": "Anders Leth Nielsen",
          "abstract": "In most political systems, cities are not formally part of national policymaking. However, since they are often responsible for the implementation of national policies, they are likely to seek influence on these policies. Existing literature deals mostly with institutionalized policy cooperation and collective municipal organizations. As such, we know very little about how individual cities try to pursue their interests in national policymaking, let alone the conditions for their success. Documenting early policy influence is difficult as processes are tightly closed. Based on unique access to deep archival material (30,000+ pages) combined with 17 elite interviews, this study shows how Danish cities influenced upcoming regulation of vulnerable social housing areas. Using process‐tracing logic, the study systematically shows how multiple attempts were made by cities to alter new policy targeting “ghettoes.” Not all attempts were successful, but in crucial cornerstones, city influence on policy formulation can be documented. The study contributes to our understanding of intergovernmental relations on national regulation and shows that the exchange of city resources—especially technical knowledge and implementation capacity—is a key condition for successful influence on national policymaking.",
