          "title": "Boosting Public Confidence in U.S. Agency Policymaking",
          "authors": "Natalie L. Smith, Susan Webb Yackee",
          "abstract": "Scholars have documented a steep decline in Americans' trust in the bureaucracy. This trend is problematic because it threatens the legitimacy of democratic policymaking by public sector agencies. We hypothesize that the participation of the bureaucracy's elected political principals in agency policy decision‐making increases public confidence in the regulatory process. To test this argument, we implement a vignette‐based survey experiment with roughly 1350 people in a politically divided U.S. state. The experimental evidence demonstrates that, even when controlling for partisanship, public confidence in state agency policymaking increases when legislators and the governor are actively engaged in the process. To some, these results may be surprising: how could the participation of elected government actors—who, themselves, are often held in such low esteem—boost public confidence? Others may view the findings as a normative rationale for further structural design reforms that encourage the involvement of elected representatives in agency rulemaking.",

          "title": "The Power of Ideational Reach: A New Approach to State Capacity",
          "authors": "Anna Persson, Frida Boräng, Ruth Carlitz",
          "abstract": "State capacity is widely recognized as a prerequisite for the successful fostering of economic and political development and is considered key to understanding change and enduring differences in development across countries. Yet, despite its influence, there are several aspects of the exercise of state power that are still in need of explanation. Such aspects typically relate to unexpected variation in outcomes within and/or across polities and policies. To better understand these outcomes, this paper argues that we must recognize the ways in which the modern state is not only a physical and organizational entity but also a politically constructed—and highly contested— idea  of how political order should be organized. Against this backdrop, the paper introduces a new dimension of state capacity: ideational reach —defined as the ability to engender loyalty to the idea of the state as the primary source of authority among the population.",

          "title": "Informal Taxation, Co‐Production and Political Gender Bias: A Theory of Voter Bias Against Women Village Leaders",
          "authors": "Paul Schuler, Xiao Ding",
          "abstract": "Are voters particularly biased against women holding village leadership positions? We initially theorize that traditional ceremonial roles drive anti‐woman bias for rural village leadership positions. Our results partially align with expectations. While we find that voters in rural areas are more biased against women as village leaders than for other positions, our results and follow‐up interviews suggest a different mechanism. We find that women face heightened voter bias because village leadership positions require personal authority, stereotypically seen as a male trait necessary to mobilize co‐production. Support for this explanation comes from three waves of a massive, nationally representative survey in Vietnam. The findings demonstrate that women face high levels of bias against becoming village leaders in rural areas, where personal authority is important. This suggests that bias against women village leaders is rooted in the need for informal taxation, distinguishing it from biases against women in other positions.",

          "authors": "David Coen, Matia Vannoni",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how companies respond to global economic shocks by seeking political connections. Using company‐level data, the study explores how exposure to increased trade competition—specifically, rising Chinese imports—affects U.S. firms' lobbying strategies. The findings reveal that companies facing greater economic pressures are more likely to hire politically connected lobbyists, particularly in industries more exposed to trade. These findings indicate that, during periods of economic instability, firms actively pursue political influence as a strategy to manage uncertainty and safeguard their interests.",

          "authors": "Fabiola Perales-Fernandez",
          "abstract": "This research explores administrative capacities to explain the variation in the public’s experience of administrative burdens. Through a qualitative exploratory case study based on semi-structured interviews in Mexico, the paper argues that administrative capacities can structure or shape administrative burdens. The effect can be either positive, where burdens are alleviated or transferred to the state, or negative, where burdens are amplified or newly created. This study identified six administrative capacities that influence administrative burdens: the design of interaction rules, government communication strategies, government resources, organizational structures that provide personalized assistance to citizens, coordination schemes among government offices, and professionalization of street-level bureaucrats. This paper contributes to the growing literature on the governance of administrative burdens and strategies for burden reduction.",

          "title": "Patterns of bureaucracy: Conceptualizing administrative traditions",
          "authors": "Marlene Jugl",
          "abstract": "Administrative traditions (AT) are a prominent approach to classify and compare administrative systems across countries, yet there is a lack of agreement on the definition and conceptual dimensions of AT. This article addresses this gap by synthesizing existing knowledge on AT and refining its conceptualization in three steps. First, a systematic review of 505 publications since 1998 elucidates the diverse understandings of AT and the study contexts in which the concept is used. Secondly, ten AT attributes that emerged from the review are operationalized with secondary data for 49 administrative systems from across the world. Using exploratory factor analysis, the study identifies two underlying dimensions of the AT concept: Citizen orientation and Structural concentration. In a third step, I propose two indices to measure AT along these two dimensions and apply it to map contemporary administrative systems from 49 diverse countries. The analysis uncovers important variation within assumed country families such as the Anglo-American or post-communist groups. The article’s core contributions are the empirically grounded and parsimonious conceptualization of AT as the degree of Citizen orientation and Structural concentration in a country’s public administration as well as the validated two-dimensional AT measure.",

          "title": "Governance in layers: how female street-level bureaucrats reshape state power through emotional labor",
          "authors": "Yujie Zhang",
          "abstract": "This article draws on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork conducted from 2021 to 2024 across six Chinese cities, encompassing 28 semi-structured interviews, 16 roundtable discussions with 75 participants, and over 300 hours of direct observations and covert site visits. Building on street-level bureaucracy theory, the study recasts emotional labor as a latent engine of governance rather than a mere coping mechanism. Specifically focusing on female street-level bureaucrats (SLBs), it examines how they navigate state directives, absorb community tensions, and deploy institutionally mandated empathy. Findings illustrate that female SLBs’ emotional labor defuses conflicts, nurtures short-term stability, and projects a caring image of the state, albeit often at the expense of their own professional advancement and well-being. Moreover, by highlighting the gendered expectations embedded in frontline governance, the study reveals a paradoxical reliance on “invisible” emotional labor, which can reinforce structural inequities and an overdependence on personal agency. The analysis suggests that recognizing emotional labor’s integral role—and its corresponding vulnerabilities—is vital to improving public service design. The article concludes by calling for institutional reforms to provide formal recognition of emotional labor, ensuring it is not perpetually relegated to an uncredited or feminized domain of governance.",

          "abstract": "Citizens' participation and direct initiatives are on the rise, including in assessing public service performance. Performance measurement and government‐citizen interactions have been traditionally studied separately in public administration scholarship. To bridge this gap, this article integrates these two bodies of literature, proposing a typology of approaches to government‐citizen interactions in public service performance assessment and highlighting their features. It also discusses the possible synergies and trade‐offs emerging at the intersection between “interaction” and “assessment.” In particular, the article focuses on how relevance, reliability, and understandability shape and are shaped by the interaction between governments and citizens in both government‐led and citizen‐led initiatives of performance assessment. Finally, the paper puts forward a research agenda for the study of interactive forms of public service performance measurement.",

          "abstract": "Governing arrangements involving public, private, and third‐sector actors are increasingly initiated to tackle sustainability challenges. Their value creation relies on the collective efforts of diverse stakeholders, but actors adhering to different institutional logics have divergent opinions on what collaborative value creation should encompass and how it should be measured and managed. This integrative literature review explores the performance measurement and management (PMM) of collaborative governance initiatives for sustainable development, focusing on how multiple institutional logics are integrated into PMM. By reviewing 104 research articles and book chapters from various disciplines and policy domains, the review highlights the omission of hybridity in PMM of collaborations and proposes multi‐logic PMM approaches to enhance the integration of multiple logics into PMM research and practice. The review concludes with propositions for further theorization and development of performance governance that enhances understanding of institutional hybridity and diversity in collaborative governance.",

          "authors": "Katie Attwell, Hang Duong, Amy Morris, Leah Roberts, Mark Navin",
          "abstract": "COVID‐19 amplified the issue of public resistance to government vaccination programs. Little attention has focused on people's moral reasons for noncompliance, which differ from—but often build upon—the epistemic claims they make about vaccine safety and efficacy, disease severity, and the trustworthiness of government. This study explores the drivers of noncompliance with the COVID‐19 vaccination program in Western Australia, using in‐depth interviews with refusers. Distrust in the government and concerns about safety, efficacy, and necessity (rationality) drive noncompliance when vaccination is voluntary. When governments mandate vaccines, rationales expand to include cost–benefit analyses of consequences, consideration of available alternatives, and moral justifications, with policytakers expressing “morality policy reactance” toward mandates as morality (rather than regulatory) policies. Our theoretical framework of vaccine noncompliance drivers shows distrust, rationality, and morality as interrelated and supported by social motivation. We consider policy implications and suggest holistic measures.",
