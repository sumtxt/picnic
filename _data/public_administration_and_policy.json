          "title": "How Ensembling AI and Public Managers Improves Decision-Making",
          "authors": "Florian Keppeler, Jana Borchert, Mogens Jin Pedersen, Vibeke Lehmann Nielsen",
          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence applications (AI) transform public sector decision-making. However, most research conceptualizes AI as a form of specialized decision support tool. In contrast, this study presents a different form of human-AI collaboration, the concept of human-AI ensembles, where public managers and AI tackle the same decision tasks, rather than specializing in certain subtasks. This is particularly relevant for many public sector decisions, where neither human nor AI predictions have a clear advantage over the other. We illustrate this within the context of public hiring, focusing on two key areas: (a) the potential of ensembling human and AI to reduce biases and (b) the willingness of public managers to implement ensembling. Study 1 uses data from the assessment of profiles of real-life job candidates (n = 695) at the intersection of gender and ethnicity by public managers compared to AI. The exploratory OLS regression results illustrate how ensembled decision-making may alleviate ethnic biases. The OLS regression results of study 2, a pre-registered survey experiment, show that public managers (n = 538 with 4 observations each) put equal weight on AI advice and human advice, and, when reminded of the unlawfulness of hiring discrimination, may even prioritize AI over human advice.",

          "authors": "Tom Moerenhout, Nicolas Orgeira Pillai, Joonseok Yang",
          "abstract": "To improve health coverage and revenue collection, several African countries consider tax-for-health-services programs where informal workers pay income tax for health insurance. We examine these programs in Nigeria, investigating whether informal workers support such initiatives, what parameters improve program perception, and what drives preferences about these parameters. Using a conjoint survey experiment with 12,000 informal workers across 12 Nigerian states, we find citizens more likely to support earmarked tax allocation programs, with tax level being most important. Informal workers with less healthcare experience and need, and those feeling distant from government, prioritize tax level and starting date more than others. Our study shows that informal workers in Nigeria generally support earmarked tax-for-health-services programs, but specific design parameters matter. Preferences vary based on healthcare experience and government trust. These findings inform the design of earmarked tax programs to improve healthcare coverage and revenue collection.",

          "authors": "Laurence Ferry, Henry Midgley, Thomas Ahrens",
          "abstract": "Many promises have been made about digitalization in the public sector, from its potential to revolutionize government to its emancipating properties as a new conduit for democracy. In this paper, the case of a leading Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), the UK National Audit Office, is examined. SAIs are essential to the ways in which government is managed and held to account. The paper examines the paradox that despite the promises made about digitalization, the digitalization of audit has progressed but has not been as revolutionary as its evangelists would expect. The paper breaks down the reasons for this by examining the regulatory space in which SAIs sit: Looking at their mandate, capacity, and reporting, and it shows that in all these, there are reasons why it is harder to digitalize than it looks from the outside. This has lessons for the broader public sector and beyond regarding change and technology.",

          "title": "Chasing Digitalization: Understanding Control and Dispersion of Digitalization in Public Sector Organizations",
          "authors": "Gustaf Kastberg Weichselberger",
          "abstract": "The study aims to contribute knowledge about how we can understand control of digitalization and why digitalization becomes a dispersed practice. The study offers two main contributions. First, we introduce the metaphor chasing digitalization to describe the observed mode of control of digitalization. Control involved chasing after digital solutions—getting hold of things—and chasing in , which entails facilitating activities to ensure organizational adoption. The second contribution deepens our understanding of why digitalization frequently results in a dispersed practice. Chasing in often triggers chasing after and vice versa. For example, when many actors are chasing after, a need arises to coordinate more. Against the backdrop of recurring reports of failed digitalization projects in the public sector, the study contributes by conceptualizing control challenges. The contribution is the result of an empirically grounded analysis based on the actor‐network concepts of framing and overflowing. The empirical case focuses on the Swedish school sector.",

          "title": "“A Practice of Fairness”: Social Equity Budgeting in Freedom City",
          "authors": "Laurence Ferry, Thomas Ahrens",
          "abstract": "Social justice is often theorized as fairness and expressed in equity as part of public administration and associated budgeting practices. Whereas much literature contrasted deontological positions, emphasizing a procedural justice with fairness based on rules, with consequentialist theory that emphasizes a distributional justice based on outcomes, this paper addresses lack of social justice research into practices. As politics of the budget process is fundamental to who gets what, calling upon practice theory, this paper's theorization of “a practice of fairness” is anchored and operationalized in Social Equity Budgeting (SEB) in context of austerity‐localism in English local government from 2010 to 2024 under Conservative led coalition and Conservative Governments, with specific examples from a longitudinal case study of Newcastle City Council (NCC). The paper suggests social justice needs a practice focus embracing interactions for practical intelligibility and understanding, alongside procedural and distributional aspects found in deontological and consequentialist approaches to justice.",

          "abstract": "Recent literature calls for scholars to bridge the divide that has emerged between criminology and regulation and governance. In the current work, we propose that criminological opportunity theories provide one fruitful pathway to that end. Specifically, we introduce the notion of regulatory guardianship based on the concepts of guardians, guardian capability, and guardian willingness to intervene, and connect them to the regulation and governance literature. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective as the building blocks for improving theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of a broad range of parties engaged in compliance work in specific regulatory environments. Considering new empirical insights into regulatory guardianship in the design of future legislation and systems of oversight and accountability may also improve governance implementation and effectiveness.",
