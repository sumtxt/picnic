          "title": "Environmental Governance in Malta: A Trajectory and Reflections on Shaping Institutions for Policy Learning",
          "authors": "Marguerite Camilleri",
          "abstract": "This paper begins by charting the trajectory of Malta's political, policy and institutional innovation in relation to environmental issues since the Islands gained independence in 1964. It examines the growth of the Maltese environmental movement post‐independence and the creation of governing institutions in response to public concern and international momentum. It then provides an analysis of the current situation in terms of issues, attitudes and narratives, particularly in relation to the construction and transport sectors. The paper reviews international practices and challenges in terms of environmental policy integration and democratic innovations, as well as positive experiences from the Maltese context. It concludes with some reflections, drawing on the roles of knowledge, public reason and social trust in environmental governance. This paper may be especially relevant to the study of governing institutions operating under conditions of intense pressure and the clientelist politics typical of small, densely‐populated jurisdictions.",

          "authors": "Simon Calmar Andersen, Ulrik Hvidman, Sarah Yde Junge, Beatrice Schindler Rangvid",
          "abstract": "Public organizations have widely adopted performance measurement practices that carry significant consequences for both organizations and their employees. This paper proposes that the design of these performance-based accountability systems plays a crucial role in shaping organizational performance. First, we develop a typology of performance-based accountability systems, proposing that strong incentives aimed at the organization, rather than the individual employee, may help mitigate the risk of dysfunctional behaviors. Second, we study an educational program that unlike prevalent systems offers substantial economic rewards exclusively at the school level, rather than individual teacher rewards or school-wide sanctions. Using nationwide data on all students and their parents, we employ both a difference-in-differences approach and a regression discontinuity design to identify the impact of the program. Despite the substantial economic incentives, our results indicate only modest effects on the targeted students and no evidence of unintended negative consequences. These findings contribute to the broader literature by offering insights into how the design of performance-based accountability systems influences organizational performance, both in terms of intended results and unintended effects.",

          "authors": "Federico Toth",
          "abstract": "The aim of the article is to interpret the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023 in light of crisis management theories, seeking to draw from this event some general lessons about the nature of crises, their determinants, and how they are managed. More specifically, the article addresses three questions: (1) Why did Israel underestimate the warning signs and fail to prevent the attack? (2) What decision‐making logic did the Israeli government adopt in responding to the attack? (3) What kind of crisis is the one being analyzed? In the article, it is proposed to adopt the category of “antagonistic crises,” that is of crises that are caused by human beings, who act intentionally with the stated goal of getting the other party into trouble. The logic of appropriateness is used to interpret the response to the attack by the Netanyahu government.",

          "title": "How to Govern the Confidence Machine?",
          "authors": "Primavera de Filippi, Morshed Mannan, Wessel Reijers",
          "abstract": "Emerging technologies pose many new challenges for regulation and governance on a global scale. With the advent of distributed communication networks like the Internet and decentralized ledger technologies like blockchain, new platforms emerged, disrupting existing power dynamics and bringing about new claims of sovereignty from the private sector. This special issue addresses a gap in the literature by focusing the discourse on the issue of trust and confidence in the digital realm. In particular, looking at the evolution of the web (from Web 1.0, to Web 2.0, and then Web 3), this article analyses how every iteration reflects a different way of dealing with the problem of trust online, resulting in a different regulation and governance landscape. Technology is often regarded as a new lever of regulation, attempting to resolve the problem of “trust” online, either through the introduction of a new trusted authority (Web 2.0) or through the introduction of technological guarantees that provide more assurance—or “confidence”—in the way interactions can be operationalized (Web 3). Yet, each of these technologies also introduce new risks and governance costs, ultimately shifting the problem of trust in a new direction rather than resolving it or removing the need for trust altogether. The main contribution of the articles in this special issue is providing a better understanding of the trust challenges faced and posed by emerging technologies and demonstrating how they affect institutional governance—in both theory and practice—with a view to help policymakers find appropriate answers to these challenges.",

          "authors": "Michael Giesen, Thomas Gehring, Simon Linder, Thomas Rixen",
          "abstract": "Assigning the preparation of decisions to specialized committees composed of member state representatives is a widespread response to the ‘governor's dilemma’, that is, the tension between competence and control, in international organizations (IOs). We theorize a causal mechanism referring to self‐selection and agenda‐setting effects and show how the resulting division of labor among IO bodies produces organizational influence beyond current accounts of committee governance. We demonstrate why specialized committees develop a distinct rationale of accommodating expertise with member state preferences, even if composed of member state representatives, and why agreed committee proposals are difficult to overcome by final decision‐making bodies. We argue that the organization of IO decision processes constitutes an important source of IO autonomy beyond the activities of IO administrations and independent from socialization or predispositions of individual committee members. Empirically, we show that IO committees meet the theoretically derived prerequisites for activating the causal mechanism and trace how committee influence according to the mechanism has shaped an important IO decision.",

          "title": "Polarization and Voluntary Compliance: The Impact of Ideological Extremity on the Effectiveness of Self‐Regulation",
          "authors": "Libby Maman, Yuval Feldman, Tom Tyler",
          "abstract": "New governance models increasingly employ self‐regulation tools like pledges and nudges to achieve regulatory compliance. These approaches premise that voluntary compliance emerges from intrinsic motivation to cooperate rather than coercive measures. Central to their success is trust—both in government institutions and among citizens. However, rising societal polarization raises critical questions about the continued effectiveness of self‐regulatory approaches. This paper examines how ideological extremity, a key dimension of polarization, affects cooperation in self‐regulatory contexts. We theorize that ideological extremity erodes trust in government and interpersonal trust, thereby diminishing cooperative behavior and threatening self‐regulation's viability. Furthermore, we propose that extremity transforms authority dynamics, with ideological orientation and partisan alignment increasingly determining cooperation levels. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and World Value Survey (WVS), we find robust evidence that ideological extremity undermines cooperation through distinct mechanisms across the ideological spectrum. While our data has limitations, our findings have important implications for policymakers implementing self‐regulation tools in polarized societies. The results suggest the need to carefully consider how ideological dynamics shape the effectiveness of voluntary compliance mechanisms.",

          "title": "Green Transitions: Rethinking Political Economy in the Context of Climate Change",
          "authors": "Basak Kus, Gregory Jackson",
          "abstract": "Although political economy (PE) has long engaged with environmental issues, climate change has remained at the margins of the field until very recently. This article argues that fully addressing the transformative challenges brought up by climate change requires a fundamental rethinking of core PE concepts related to the state, distributional struggles, economic growth, varieties of capitalism, and markets. Rather than treating the state as a neutral regulator or market facilitator, we conceptualize the green state as actively structuring transitions through mitigation policies, adaptation strategies, and the governance of just transition conflicts. Green transitions generate new distributional conflicts—within and across countries, between incumbent and emerging industries, and among social groups with unequal exposure to climate risks and transition costs. Climate policy also challenges growth‐centered economic models, raising questions about the viability of green growth versus degrowth strategies. Different varieties of capitalism are evolving in response, with distinct institutional pathways shaping the speed and character of transition efforts. Finally, we critique market‐based approaches that assume price mechanisms alone can drive decarbonization, highlighting the role of non‐economic values, institutional constraints, and distributional struggles in shaping green markets. By linking climate change to core debates in comparative and international political economy, we identify new research agendas for understanding the uneven and contested pathways of green transitions across economic systems. This article, along with the others in this special issue on Greening the Economy: Toward a New Political Economy , aims to bridge some of these critical gaps.",
