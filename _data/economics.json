          "title": "Transitory Income Windfalls and Charitable Giving: Evidence from Norwegian Register Data, 1993-2021",
          "authors": "Benny Geys, Rune J Sørensen",
          "abstract": "This paper studies the impact of unearned, transitory income shocks on charitable giving using Norwegian administrative data. We exploit the random timing and size of lottery wins and our long time-period (1993-2021) to estimate both short- and longer-term impacts. We find no meaningful effect of small windfalls. Yet, windfalls exceeding $10,000 induce a long-lasting increase in the likelihood to donate, the absolute level of donations, and the share of annual income donated (conditional on donating). We show that this is consistent with individuals thinking of large transitory income shocks as a long-term addition to their annual income.",

          "authors": "Lu Dong, Lingbo Huang, Jaimie W Lien",
          "abstract": "A meritocratic fairness ideal typically asserts that income inequality is justifiable if it arises from differences in performance rather than mere luck. In this study, we present experimental evidence that reveals how merit judgments are influenced by the sources of performance differentials, while holding fixed the underlying impact on incentives to perform. Drawing inspiration from real-world factors that create inequality, we investigate unequal opportunities in education and employment that impact performance. Contrary to some earlier findings suggesting that merit judgments are unaffected by unequal circumstances, our study demonstrates that individuals’ redistributive behaviour is responsive to both the nature and extent of these unequal opportunities. This research thus provides fresh insights into the nuanced factors that motivate people to endorse income redistribution.",

          "title": "Atlantic Trade and Conflict in Europe",
          "authors": "Reshad N Ahsan, Laura Panza, Yong Song",
          "abstract": "We use over 200 years of conflict and wheat price data to provide the first quantitative evidence that Atlantic trade reduced conflict in Europe. While other determinants of intra-European conflict during the Early to Late Modern period have been proposed, the role of Atlantic trade has not been previously explored due to a lack of historical trade data. We overcome this constraint by using wheat prices to calculate time-varying measures of price pass-through between Europe and the New World, which we use as a proxy for Atlantic trade. To identify the causal effects of Atlantic trade, we exploit exogenous changes in wind patterns and tropical cyclone activity over the Atlantic Ocean to instrument trade. Our results suggest that a one standard deviation increase in Atlantic trade resulted in a 0.157 standard deviation decrease in intra-European conflict onset. We also find empirical support for Atlantic trade increasing real wages and reducing military sizes in Europe, which is consistent with the idea that the possibility of forgone Atlantic trade acted as a deterrent to conflict.",

          "abstract": "The canonical hot hand fallacy result was recently reversed, based largely on a single statistic, and a data set that was underpowered for individual-level testing. Here we perform a more robust analysis, testing whether hot hand performance exists across (i) data sets: four different controlled shooting experiments, (ii) time: multiple sessions per individual spread across a six month gap, and (iii) various (improved) approaches to statistical testing. We find strong evidence of hot hand performance, both across data sets and within individuals across time. Moreover, in a study of beliefs, we find that expert observers can successfully predict which shooters get the hottest.",

          "authors": "William C Boning, Nathaniel Hendren, Ben Sprung-Keyser, Ellen Stuart",
          "abstract": "We estimate the returns to IRS audits of taxpayers across the income distribution. We find an additional ${\\$}$1 spent auditing taxpayers above the 90th income percentile yields more than ${\\$}$12 in revenue, while audits of below-median income taxpayers yield ${\\$}$5. We construct our estimates by drawing from comprehensive internal accounting information and audit-level enforcement logs. We begin by estimating the average initial return to all audits of US taxpayers filing in tax years 2010–2014. On average, ${\\$}$1 in audit spending initially raises ${\\$}$2.17 in revenue. Audits of high-income taxpayers are more costly, but the additional revenue raised more than offsets the costs. Audits of the 99–99.9th percentile have a 3.2:1 initial return; audits of the top 0.1% return 6.3:1. We then exploit the 40% audit reduction between tax years 2010 and 2014 to examine the returns to marginal audits. We find they exceed the returns to average audits. Revenues remain relatively unchanged but marginal costs fall below average costs due to economies of scale. Next, we use randomly selected audits to examine the impact of an initial audit on future revenue. This individual deterrence effect produces at least three times more revenue than the initial audit. Deterrence effects are relatively consistent across the income distribution. This results in the 12:1 return above the 90th percentile. We conclude by estimating the welfare consequences of audits using the MVPF framework and comparing audits to other revenue-raising policies. We find that audits raise revenue at lower welfare cost.",

          "abstract": "We study robustly optimal mechanisms for selling multiple items. The seller maximizes revenue against a worst-case distribution of a buyer’s valuations within a set of distributions, called an “ambiguity” set. We identify the exact forms of robustly optimal selling mechanisms and the worst-case distributions when the ambiguity set satisfies various moment conditions on the values of subsets of goods. The analysis reveals general properties of the ambiguity set that justifies categorical bundling, which includes separate sales and pure bundling as special cases.",

          "abstract": "In most national elections, voters face a key choice between continuity and change. Electoral turnovers occur when the incumbent candidate or party fails to win reelection. To understand how turnovers affect national outcomes, we study all presidential and parliamentary elections held globally between 1946 and 2018. We document the prevalence of turnovers over time and estimate their effects on economic performance, human development, and the quality of democracy. Using a close-elections regression discontinuity design across countries, we show that turnovers improve several measures of country performance. To explain these positive effects, we explore how electoral turnovers affect leader characteristics, shape policy decisions, reduce perceived corruption, and foster accountability.",

          "abstract": "Authoritarian regimes often use targeted social control - unequal application of the law to limit expressive freedom and enforce social conformity. At the same time, their methods appear less draconian than in the past. In this model, an authority structures punishments and rewards to compel adherence to its preferred norm. The authority’s commitment is time-limited and depends on imperfectly informative signals of a citizen’ s behavior. Given two citizens with the same observed behavior, the authority imposes harsher punishments on the poorer and/or ex ante dissident individual. Lighter punishments are imposed on the wealthier citizen to prevent “overcompliance.” Wealth inequality increases over time. Some citizens become prosperous “lackeys” while others become destitute from confiscation. In stable regimes with high state capacity, the authority reduces punishments and/or increases rewards to allow citizens to accumulate wealth, leading to social conformity and balanced growth in the long run. In unstable regimes with low capacity, the citizenry splits into groups of wealthy lackeys and destitute proles.",
