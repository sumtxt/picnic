          "authors": "Yann Algan, Elise Huillery",
          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, economic research has shown that socio-emotional skills, such as self-esteem, growth mindset, self-control, trust, and cooperation, generate a triple dividend for individuals and society. First, socio-emotional interventions demonstrate that these skills greatly enhance academic achievement and success at school. Second, those skills have a large impact on the professional integration and success of individuals on the job market. Third, they enhance the lifelong well-being of individuals in terms of better health, lower anxiety, lower depression, and reduced crime. There is also suggestive evidence that socio-emotional skills translate into higher economic and social performance at the country level. Given the very high cost-benefit ratio of such interventions, the evidence strongly suggest that redesigning the future of educational systems by integrating socio-emotional skills in the core curriculum of teacher training and in everyday pedagogical methods could be highly beneficial to realize individual potentialities and build resilient economies, societies, and democracies.",

          "abstract": "We review the literature on geoeconomics, defined as the field of study that links economics and geopolitics (in particular, in terms of power rivalry). We describe what geoeconomics is and which questions it addresses, focusing on five main subfields: ( a ) the use of geoeconomic policy tools such as sanctions and embargoes; ( b ) the geopolitics of international trade, especially work on coercion and fragmentation; ( c ) the geopolitics of international finance, which focuses on currency dominance and state-directed capital flows; ( d ) the literature on geopolitical risk and its spillovers to the domestic economy, for example, on investments, credit, and inflation; and ( e ) the economics of war, in particular research on trade and war and on military production. As geopolitical tensions grow, we expect the field to grow substantially in the coming years.",

          "title": "Using Machine Learning to Target Treatment: The Case of Household Energy Use",
          "authors": "Christopher R Knittel, Samuel Stolper",
          "abstract": "We test the ability of causal forests to improve, through selective targeting, the effectiveness of a randomized program providing repeated behavioral nudges towards household energy conservation. The average treatment effect of the program is a monthly electricity reduction of 9 kilowatt-hours (kWh), but the full distribution of predicted reductions ranges from roughly 1 to 33 kWh. Pre-treatment electricity consumption and home value are the strongest predictors of differential treatment effects. In a pair of targeting exercises, use of the causal forest increases social net benefits of the nudge program by a factor of 3-5 relative to the status quo. Using earlier program waves to target in later ones, we estimate that the forest produces more benefits than five other alternative predictive models. Bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals, we find the forest’s advantage to be statistically significant relative to some but not all of these alternatives.",

          "authors": "Viola Corradini, Lorenzo Lagos, Garima Sharma",
          "abstract": "We study the role of unions in improving workplaces for women. Starting in 2015, Brazil’s largest trade union federation made women central to its agenda. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially comprised a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and instead benefited both workers and employers. They illustrate the potential for unions to improve workplace quality by focusing on the needs of less represented workers.",

We study the asset-pricing consequences of diagnostic expectations, a model of belief formation based on the representativeness heuristic, in a setting where news events are drawn from categories with extreme distributions of fundamentals. Our model predicts greater over-reaction to news belonging to categories with more extreme outliers, or tail events. We test our theory on a comprehensive database of corporate news that includes news from 24 different categories, including earnings announcements, product launches, M&amp;A, business expansions, and client-related news. We find theory-consistent heterogeneity in investor reaction to news, with more overreaction in the form of greater post-announcement return reversals and trading volume for news categories with more extreme distributions of fundamentals.",
