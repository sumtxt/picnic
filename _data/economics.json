          "authors": "Jan Eeckhout",
          "abstract": "The real growth of the stock market value of firms has increased from close to 0% on average per year between 1958 and 1980, to 5.2% between 1980 and today. This change coincides with the rise of market power and profits, starting in 1980. This paper proposes to decompose the value of firms based on profits (earnings) rather than dividends. Because firms on average pay out only half of profits in dividends, dividends poorly measure firm performance. I decompose the sources of the rise of the value of all publicly traded firms into: 1. The subjective and risk-free discount factor; 2. Expected future profits; and 3. Shareholder equity (retained earnings). I find that 20% of the rise is due to the discount factor, and 80% is due to profits (half of which is retained earnings). I build a general equilibrium model of the economy where firms have market power; I perform counterfactuals and evaluate the welfare implications. The objective is to study the impact of competition policy. If market power today dropped to the level of 1980, average stock market values would be 40% lower. If market power had never increased in 1980, the average stock values would be 80% lower.",

          "authors": "Kevin Dano, Francesco Ferlenga, Vincenzo Galasso, Caroline Le Pennec, Vincent Ponsy",
          "abstract": "Free and fair elections should incentivize elected officials to exert effort and enable citizens to select representative politicians and occasionally replace incumbents. However, incumbency advantage and coordination failures possible in multi-party systems may jeopardize this process. We ask whether these two forces compound each other. Using an RDD in French two-round local and parliamentary elections, we find that close winners are more likely to run again and to win the next election by 33 and 25 percentage points, respectively. Incumbents who run again personalize their campaign communication more and face fewer ideologically close competitors, revealing that parties from the incumbent’s orientation coordinate more effectively than parties on the losing side. A complementary RDD shows that candidates who marginally qualify for the runoff also rally new voters. We conclude that party coordination on the incumbent and voter coordination on candidates who won or gained visibility in a previous election both contribute to incumbents future success.",

          "authors": "Joshua D Gottlieb, Maria Polyakova, Kevin Rinz, Hugh Shiplett, Victoria Udalova",
          "abstract": "Is government guiding the invisible hand at the top of the labor market? We use new administrative data to measure physicians’ earnings and estimate the influence of healthcare policies on these earnings, physicians’ labor supply, and allocation of talent. Combining the administrative registry of U.S. physicians with tax data, Medicare billing records, and survey responses, we find that physicians’ annual earnings average $350,000 and comprise 8.6% of national healthcare spending. Business income comprises one-quarter of earnings and is systematically underreported in survey data. Earnings increase steeply early in the career, and there are major differences across specialties, regions, and firm sizes. The geographic pattern of earnings is unusual compared with other workers. We argue that these patterns reflect policy choices to subsidize demand for physician care, amplified by restrictions on physician entry, especially in certain specialties. Health policy has a major impact on the margin:  25% of physician fee revenue driven by Medicare reimbursements accrues to physicians personally. Physicians earn 8% of public money spent on insurance expansion. These policies in turn affect the type and quantity of medical care physicians supply, retirement timing, and the allocation of talent across specialties.",

          "abstract": "People's value of their own time is a key input in public policy evaluations—these evaluations should account for time taken away from work or leisure as a result of policy. Measuring this value for the self-employed is challenging, as, by definition, it is not priced by the market. Using rich choice data collected from farming households in western Kenya, we show that households exhibit non-transitive preferences. As a result, neither market wages nor standard valuation techniques correctly measure participants’ value of time. Using a structural model, we identify the behavioral wedges in participants’ choices, and find that distortions appear when households exchange cash either for time or for goods. Our model estimates suggest that valuing the time of the self-employed at 60% of the market wage is a reasonable rule of thumb.",
