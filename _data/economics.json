          "title": "Does Third-Party Policing Increase Crime? Evidence from Nuisance Ordinances",
          "authors": "Stefano Falcone",
          "abstract": "Although third-party policies adoption (i.e. policies targeting non-offending parties to address misconduct by individuals within their control) is growing worldwide, its effect on crime remains unclear. Using Ohio data from 2000 to 2014, this study examines the impact of nuisance ordinances, a policy that penalises landlords for disturbances on their properties. The findings indicate a 18% increase in burglaries and a 28% rise in vehicle thefts. Indirect evidence suggests these effects are driven by an increase in homelessness, prompting more individuals to seek shelter in buildings and vehicles. These findings highlight that third-party policing may backfire.",

          "title": "The Complementarity Between Trust and Contract Enforcement",
          "authors": "Björn Bartling, Ernst Fehr, David Huffman, Nick Netzer",
          "abstract": "Agreements are rarely fully enforceable, exposing trading parties to the risk of exploitation. In such cases, trust—defined as the belief in the trustworthiness of others—may be key to realizing gains from trade. This paper asks whether trust substitutes for or complements contract enforcement. While intuition may suggest trust matters more when enforcement is weak, our experiment, which exogenously varies both trust and enforcement, shows it can matter more when enforcement is strong. The mechanism is equilibrium selection: stronger enforcement allows more equilibria, and trust helps select efficient ones. This complementarity between trust and enforcement has important policy implications.",

          "authors": "Sevrin Waights",
          "abstract": "I use the universe of tax returns in Germany and a regression kink design to estimate the impacts of mothers’ parental leave benefit amounts on couple earnings inequality. I make use of a benefits cap to estimate the causal impacts for high-earning women; a group for which earnings inequality is particularly large. A lower mothers’ benefit amount results in a reduced gender gap in earnings that persists beyond the benefit period for at least nine years after the birth. The longer-term impacts are driven by couples where the mother earned more than her partner pre-birth. Simulations suggest that a 10% reduction in the benefit amount could reduce long-run child penalties in sample couples from 63 to 46%.",

          "abstract": "Politicising policies designed to address market failures can diminish their effectiveness. We document a pattern of ‘political adverse selection’ in the health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act (colloquially, ‘Obamacare’): Republicans enrolled at lower rates than Democrats and independents, a gap driven by healthier Republicans. This selection raised public subsidy spending by approximately $155 per enrollee annually (3.2% of average cost). We fielded a survey to show that this selection does not exist for other insurance products. Lower enrolment and higher costs are concentrated in more Republican areas, potentially contributing to polarised views of the policy.",

          "authors": "Oliver Vanden Eynde, Juan Vargas",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how climate change and natural resource dynamics contribute to conflict, with a focus on the implications of the green transition. It reviews empirical evidence showing that extreme weather events—such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves—are linked to increased violence, particularly through economic disruptions, reduced agricultural productivity, and displacement. The analysis also explores the mechanisms through which climate shocks influence conflict, including opportunity costs, resource competition, and behavioral responses to environmental stress. The discussion then turns to the role of natural resource exploitation, especially in the context of rising demand for minerals essential to low-carbon technologies. The paper highlights how resource price and availability shocks can trigger conflict, often depending on the type of resource, extraction method, and local governance. It also addresses the overlap between climate- and resource-driven conflict risks, emphasizing that their interaction may amplify instability. Throughout, the paper identifies open research questions related to prediction, the effects of long-run environmental changes, and the design of policy responses. These include insurance schemes, climate adaptation strategies, infrastructure investment, and regulatory frameworks for resource governance. The findings point to the need for research that integrates climate and conflict dynamics, with the goal of informing policies that can mitigate the risks associated with environmental change and resource pressures.",

          "abstract": "This paper synthesizes the quantitative literature on the relationship between gender and armed conflict, focusing on two key perspectives: women as victims and women as agents. It first reviews research on the consequences of conflict for women and girls, highlighting both direct effects — such as gender-based violence and forced displacement — and indirect effects in post-conflict settings, including declines in personal security, education, economic outcomes, and health. The paper then shifts to examine women’s political roles in conflict, whether as participants in resistance movements or as peace-builders and agents of post-conflict reconstruction. While there is a growing body of innovative research on these critical issues, significant opportunities remain for further empirical and experimental work, particularly studies that seek to establish causal mechanisms and expand our understanding of gendered dynamics in settings damaged by conflict.",

The second is the “memberships” inequality associated with neighborhoods, namely, households’ location in a geographic and social context. We elaborate on these two angles of inequality and focus on three distinctive features of housing: consumption, capital, and location. For owner-occupants, capital and consumption are bundled together in a single good. For both renters and owner-occupants, housing consumption inequality, access to good neighborhoods, and housing wealth follow from unequal endowments. Housing can propagate inequality by enabling owner-occupants to use it as collateral for other investments or to secure higher returns to human capital investments through the better schools in better neighborhoods. We use this approach to analyze key aspects of housing and inequality, paying special attention to the impacts of racial discrimination and segregation. (JEL D63, J15, J24, R21, R23, R31)",

This article reviews this literature, using Brazil as a privileged case study to understand the broader phenomenon of inequality decline in many parts of the developing world. We present stylized facts about inequality during this period, focusing on the results of decomposition methods. We then examine research that employs quasi-experiments and structural models to assess mechanisms related to labor supply and demand, trade, technological changes, and institutional factors such as the minimum wage and race and gender discrimination.

This article critically assesses that claim by integrating theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence to explain how the Nordic model functions and why these countries experience low inequality. Our analysis suggests that income equality in the Nordics is largely driven by a significant compression of hourly wages, reducing returns to labor market skills and education. This appears to result from a wage bargaining system characterized by strong coordination within and across industries. This finding challenges other commonly cited explanations for Nordic income equality, such as redistribution through the tax transfer system, public spending on goods that complement employment, and public policies promoting equal skills and human capital. We consider broader lessons for economies aiming to reduce inequality and conclude by highlighting several under-explored or unresolved questions. (JEL D31, E23, H23, J24, J31, J52)",

          "abstract": "Residential segregation is a central factor in explaining socioeconomic gaps across race and ethnicity in the United States. Place of residence directly impacts access to schools, jobs, and health care. There is an ever-evolving literature across the social sciences disciplines documenting the general patterns in residential segregation as well as the causes and consequences of those patterns. This article reviews key parts of that literature. We provide an overview of the measurement of segregation and the general evolution of segregation patterns over time and at different scales. We then review the literatures on both segregation’s determinants and its impact on a range of socioeconomic outcomes. We highlight the potential for new insights to be gained from new approaches to quantifying segregation and new frameworks such as stratification for understanding its complex roots.

          "abstract": "This paper studies whether a country can benefit from not defaulting on its debts during times of widespread sovereign defaults. We focus on Colombia which is the only large Latin American country that did not default in the 1980s. Using archival research and formal econometric estimates of Colombia’s probability of default, we show that in the early 1980s Colombia’s fundamentals were not significantly different from those of the Latin American countries that defaulted on their debts. We then document that the different choice made by Colombia was due to the authorities’ belief that maintaining a good reputation in the international capital market would have substantial payoffs. We discuss how high-level political support from the US allowed Colombia to be particularly creditor-friendly and avoid an IMF program. Our counterfactual analysis shows that in the short to medium run, Colombia benefited from avoiding an explicit default. We also test whether Colombia’s behavior in the 1980s led to long-lasting reputational benefits. Using an event study based on a large sudden stop, we find no evidence for such gains.",

Using firm-level data, we examine the impact of cloud adoption on firm performance and organizational geography with an IV approach that exploits cross-section and time-series variation in fiber broadband speeds as instruments. Cloud leads younger firms to increase revenue, employment, and productivity, whereas incumbent firms experience no scale effects and weaker productivity gains. Incumbents, however, undergo restructuring through establishment deaths and fewer births, while both types of firms experience geographic reorganization shifting farther from the headquarters.",

We build a measure of pressure strongly associated with adverse health outcomes and show that pressure comes with a sizable earnings premium, reflecting workers’ willingness-to-pay to avoid pressure. As expected, we do not find a premium among civil servants who face strong labor market frictions. Our experimental evidence is consistent with workers sorting into high-pressure jobs and with a sizable market-level compensating differential. Differences in the prevalence and valuation of work pressure explain substantial shares of wage inequality.",

We combine novel electronic point-of-sale data with longitudinal nutritional information and a variety of event-study specifications. All but a few global soft drink brands reduced sugar content and hence avoided the tiered levy. For brands that maintained their recipes, the levy was on average overshifted, resulting in substantial retail price increases and reductions in consumption, particularly for colas. The levy is responsible for a reduction in intake of about 6,600 calories per year per UK resident, 80% of which is attributable to reformulation by manufacturers.",

We also document an important nonlinearity: an additional woman accelerates the expansion of child care only in councils with few women. Council meeting minutes reveal that women can be effective in councils despite being a nonpivotal minority because they change “the conversation.”",

The primary setting considered here is with spatially indexed data in which the dependence structure of observed random variables is characterized by a known, observed dissimilarity measure over spatial indices. Observations are partitioned into clusters with the use of an unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to the dissimilarity measure. Once the partition into clusters is learned, a cluster-based inference procedure is applied to a statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The procedure proposed in the article allows the number of clusters to depend on the data, which gives researchers a principled method for choosing an appropriate clustering level. The article gives conditions under which the proposed procedure asymptotically attains correct size. A simulation study shows that the proposed procedure attains near nominal size in finite samples in a variety of statistical testing problems with dependent data.",

We use administrative employer-employee matched data on U.S. startups and utilize premature death as a natural experiment that exogenously separates talent from startups. We find that losing an early joiner has large negative effects on employment and revenues that persist for at least ten years. In contrast, losing a later joiner yields only a small and temporary decline in firm performance. Our results imply that organization capital, an important driver of startup success, is embodied in early joiners.",

We map the neighborhood movement of nearly 10,000 officers across 21 of America’s largest cities using anonymized smartphone data. Police spend 0.36% more time in neighborhoods for each percentage point increase in Black residents. This neighborhood-level disparity persists after controlling for density, socioeconomic status, and crime-driven demand for policing, and may be lower in cities with more Black police supervisors (but not officers). Patterns of police presence statistically explain 57% of the higher arrest rate in more Black neighborhoods.",

The lack of integration of local transport networks at regional borders—leading to a 4.5 km travel distance penalty when crossing borders—explains the observed border effects. Using a spatial quantifiable equilibrium framework and accounting for construction costs, a policy simulation exercise shows that integrating local transport networks leads to a 6.36% average growth in real per capita residential income.",

Using manually digitized aggregate income and balance sheet data for the universe of US manufacturing firms, I show that this increase is driven by the types of firms which are least likely to be financially constrained. A two-sector New Keynesian model with financial frictions can match these facts; unconstrained firms take advantage of the decline in the user cost of capital caused by the monetary contraction, while constrained firms are forced to cut back. Removing firm financial constraints in the model dampens the response of manufacturing output to monetary shocks by about 25%.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the authorship of postpublication criticisms in the scientific literature, with a focus on gender differences. Bibliometrics from journals in the natural and social sciences show that comments that criticize or correct a published study are 20% to 40% less likely than regular papers to have a female author. In preprints in the life sciences, prior to peer review, women are missing by 20% to 40% in failed replications compared to regular papers, but they are not missing in successful replications. In an experiment, I then find large gender differences in willingness to point out and penalize a mistake in someone's work.",

          "abstract": "We study the effect of raising the level and transparency of financial incentives offered to local agents for acquiring clients of a new banking product on take-up. We find that paying agents higher incentives increases take-up and usage, but only when the incentives are unknown to prospective clients. When disclosed, higher incentives have no effect on take-up and usage, despite greater agent effort. This is due to the financial incentives sending a negative signal to potential clients about the reliability and trustworthiness of the product. Hence, when designing incentives, organizations should consider both their level and transparency.",

I show that the protocol increased science and innovation on alternatives to ozone-depleting substances and argue that agreements can indeed be useful in solving global public goods problems. This contrasts with game-theoretical predictions that agreements occur only when costs to the players are low and with the often-heard narrative that substitutes were readily available. I reconcile theory and empirics by discussing the role of induced innovation in models of environmental agreements.",

Our statistical test uses a permutation method to operationalize the principle of random consumption behavior. We show that our test (i) is valid for any sample size under the null and (ii) has an asymptotic power of one. We also provide simulated power results and two empirical applications.",

We find that the estimated positive effect of a decrease in neighborhood poverty on SWB is sensitive to the specification of the first-stage auxiliary equation for endogenous neighborhood poverty.

Combining survey data, random center visits, and hospital registers, we find that patients at biometric-equipped centers are 25% less likely to interrupt treatment, reflecting increased efforts by health workers and greater daily adherence by patients. The technology also improves the quality of public data by reducing overreported patient numbers and underreported treatment interruptions. Overall, our results suggest that real-time monitoring of service delivery can strengthen the state’s capacity to serve poor and marginalized populations.",

Combining temporal variation in international drug prices with spatial variation in the suitability to produce opium, we show that higher prices increase household living standards and reduce conflict in Afghanistan. Analyzing shifts in conflict tactics and using georeferenced data on drug production networks and territorial control highlight the importance of opportunity costs, and reveal heterogeneous effects consistent with our theory.",

We introduce a procedural choice model that accounts for these patterns and show that the behavior of most of our participants is inconsistent with prominent theories of decision under risk.",

We find strong discontinuities in students’ admission outcomes at ten-point thresholds. Students with scores just below multiples of 10 make more conservative college application choices that place them into less selective colleges and majors. In contrast, students who score at or just above multiples of 10 aim at and achieve higher but are at greater risk of overshooting. The discontinuity reveals that despite the educational and labor market consequences, students’ self-evaluation based on exam scores is subject to information-processing heuristics.",

We investigate how prevalent this behavior is in an experiment using a novel and simple method. Subjects face a list of questions in which one of the alternatives is fixed and the other varies, like a Multiple Price List, but in each row they can randomize between the options. We find that the majority of subjects chose to randomize in the majority of questions, and notably, they did so for ranges of values that were “very large.”",

We show that it is optimal for the seller to choose a constant high price punctuated by occasional episodes of sequential discounts that occur at random times. This optimal price path has the property that the price a buyer ends up paying is independent of his arrival and purchase times, and only depends on his valuation. Our theory accommodates empirical findings on the timing of discounts.",

          "abstract": "An important class of structural models studies the determinants of skill formation and the optimal timing of interventions. In this paper, I provide new identification results for these models and investigate the effects of seemingly innocuous scale and location restrictions on parameters of interest. To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without these additional restrictions and show that important policy-relevant parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact the interpretation of parameters and may affect counterfactuals. Importantly, with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions fix identified parameters and lead to misspecification. Consequently, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables might yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I show how existing estimators can easily be adapted to solve these issues. As a byproduct, this paper also presents a general and formal definition of when restrictions are truly normalizations.",

          "authors": "Raul Duarte, Frederico Finan, Horacio Larreguy, Laura Schechter",
          "abstract": "Politicians rely on political brokers to buy votes throughout much of the developing world. We investigate how social networks facilitate these vote-buying exchanges. Our conceptual framework suggests brokers should be particularly well-placed within the network to learn about non-copartisans’ reciprocity in order to target transfers effectively. As a result, parties should recruit brokers who are central among non-copartisans. We combine village network data from brokers and citizens with broker reports of vote buying, allowing us to use broker and citizen fixed effects. We show that networks diffuse information about citizens to brokers who leverage it to target transfers. In particular, among those citizens who are not registered to their party, brokers target reciprocal citizens about whom they can learn more through their network, and these citizens are more likely to support the brokers’ party. Moreover, recruited brokers are significantly more central than other citizens among non-copartisans, but not among copartisans. These results highlight the importance of information diffusion through social networks for vote buying, broker recruitment, and ultimately for political outcomes.",

          "abstract": "We study the relationship between international trade and development in a model where countries differ in their capability, goods differ in their complexity, and capability growth is a function of a country's pattern of specialization. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for international trade to increase capability growth in all countries and, in turn, to push all countries up the development ladder. This occurs if (i) shifting employment towards more complex sectors raises capability growth and if (ii) foreign competition is tougher in less complex sectors for all countries. Empirically, we provide causal evidence consistent with (i) using the entry of countries into the World Trade Organization as an instrumental variable for other countries' patterns of specialization. The opposite of (ii), however, holds in the data. Through the lens of our model, these two empirical observations imply dynamic welfare losses from trade that are pervasive, albeit small for the median country. The same economic forces also suggest that the emergence of China has held back capability growth for a number of African countries who are pushed away from their most-complex sectors, which China exports, and into their least-complex sectors, which China imports.",

          "abstract": "We formulate a tractable model of pricing under directed search with heterogeneous firm demands. Demand characteristics drive bids in a position auction and enable us to bridge insights from the ordered search literature to those in the position auction literature. Equilibrium pricing implies that the marginal consumer’s surplus decreases down the search order, so consumers optimally follow the firms’ position ordering. A firm suffers from “business stealing” by firms that precede it and “search appeal” from subsequent firms. We find rankings that achieve the maximal joint profit or consumer surplus by constructing firm-specific scores. A generalized second price auction for positions endogenizes equilibrium orders and bids are driven by position externalities that impact incremental profit from switching positions. The joint profit maximization order is upheld when firm heterogeneity concerns mostly their mark-up potentials. But the consumer welfare order is robust when firms differ mostly over their potential market sizes.",
