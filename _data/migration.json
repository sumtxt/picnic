          "title": "Brain drain in Bhutan: its impacts and countermeasures",
          "authors": "Rinchen Dorji, Nobuhiro Hosoe",
          "abstract": "This study examines the potential effects of skilled labor emigration on Bhutan’s economy using an extended computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Numerical simulation analysis is undertaken to examine the impacts of an ongoing increase in skilled emigrants on the economy and welfare of Bhutan. The simulation results paint a somewhat pessimistic picture, showing that a rise in foreign wages would lead to a significant outflow of skilled labor, causing a substantial supply shortage in the domestic skilled labor market and a decline in all sectors - particularly in the manufacturing, services, and public sectors. Moreover, the increased inflow of remittances would exacerbate the negative impacts through the Dutch disease. The overall outcome is a decline in GDP by 0.2% from the base. To counter this adverse economic impact, this study proposes policy interventions by improving total factor productivity (TFP) or labor productivity in the domestic industries. Specifically, it is unveiled that reform initiatives that can enhance productivity gains beyond 0.3% in TFP or 0.4% in labor productivity across the sectors would contribute positively to GDP growth and curtail the brain drain from the country.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Musfequs Salehin, Md. Aslam Hossain",
          "abstract": "The forced migration of the long‐persecuted Rohingya minority group from the Rakhine State of Myanmar has created a chronic refugee crisis in neighbouring Bangladesh. This paper examines the potential for, and challenges to, local integration of the Rohingya into Bangladesh. Based on interview data, this paper analyses the factors that facilitated the de facto local integration of Rohingya into Bangladeshi society prior to the huge influx of Rohingya in 2017. It argues that cultural proximity factors (language, culture and religious beliefs), similarities in physical appearance, and intermarriage facilitated the establishment of robust social bonds and the subsequent acquisition of identity documents among those Rohingya who arrived earlier. Furthermore, the paper elucidates the formidable challenges to the de facto local integration process experienced by Rohingya who arrived during or after August 2017. These challenges go beyond heightened governmental restrictions, extending to an escalation of criminal activities within refugee camps, heightened levels of insecurity with the host community and a pervasive undercurrent of mistrust. The predicament is further exacerbated by economic constraints and mounting demographic pressures, which complicate the potential pathways to local integration for this specific cohort of Rohingya.",

          "abstract": "COVID‐19 resulted in global restrictions on migration, with pronounced consequences in Australia, where the resettlement of refugees was significantly curtailed from March 2020. This research, comprising a third phase in an ongoing study on refugee settlement and integration, seeks to understand the broader implications of these restrictions on family separation and reunion among resettled refugees in Australia. Employing a mixed‐method approach of surveys and family interviews conducted in late 2021, we explored various themes that emerged from the pandemic's effects on family reunion, such as concerns about living difficulties, maintaining contact with family overseas, financial hardship, and reunion challenges specific to the pandemic. The findings reveal the negative impact of COVID‐19 on refugees' ability to reunite with families, with evidence pointing to differences between gender, visa category, and language group/ethnicity. The research underscores the need for innovative approaches in resettlement to address the negative impacts of family separation and for governments to expedite family reunion pathways to alleviate isolation and uncertainty among resettled refugees.",

          "authors": "Manish K Jha, Anindita Chakrabarty",
          "abstract": "The article takes cognizance of a citizenship register called the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and comprehends it within the larger framework of a digital citizenship discourse. The NRC is a register that documents ‘authentic citizens’, based on documentary evidence, termed as the ‘legacy data’ (lineage of forefathers), and proof of residence of persons before a cut‐off date of 24 March 1971. In the regional context of Assam, the NRC co‐opts to the global sway of digitization of identities. The article examines how the digitization of citizenship defines eligibility for availing public services and thereby investigates the need to be included in a datafied citizenship repository that sorts and segregates citizens from non‐citizens. The digital infrastructure, thus created, is presented as a panacea for the unresolved and complex issue of illegal migration, doubtful voters and citizenship. The article explains that the NRC works within a digital systems and technologies surveillance framework to track, control and manage populations, segregating the ‘legitimate from the “illegitimate” or doubtful residents’. In so doing, it engages with the documentation exercise that records the lineage and identity of people to make welfare accessible to the digitized kins of the legitimate forefather citizen. It engages with the concept of residence and explores how a digital citizenship regime shapes the relationship between the state and its inhabitants.",

          "authors": "Gaetano Giancaspro",
          "abstract": "Most migration‐information campaigns (MICs) funded by European countries or the European Union (EU) itself, with the collaboration of international and transnational organisations, have been targeting central and western Africa as origin areas for several undocumented migrants. In 2019, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) launched WAKA Well , an innovative campaign in the form of a website designed to provide young people from several African countries with information about risks associated with irregular migration and local opportunities. Using a multimodal discourse analysis (MMDA) methodology, the study identifies and discusses discourses and communicative strategies involved in the design of the WAKA Well campaign, by analysing the construction of meaning across its web pages and the logico‐semantic relations between elements on the website. As such, the work enriches the state of the art on MICs by providing it with the first in‐depth website analysis that accounts for the intrinsic multimodal nature of this type of campaign. The paper confirms previous findings from the existing literature revolving around the overgeneralisation of the campaign's target and the quantitative and qualitative prevalence of immobility over mobility in its contents, but also shows that such preference occurs regardless of the (ir)regularity of the journey. Unlike other campaigns, WAKA Well also displays an unexpected visual silence over human trafficking and a greater focus on local opportunities, often conveyed through images evoking patriotic feelings.",

          "authors": "Yuchen Li, Michael Haan",
          "abstract": "This paper uses a unique, linked administrative data file to examine the impact of language training and employment‐related services on the employment income of the first wave of Syrian refugees admitted to Canada between 2015 and 2016. The analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between refugees' access to employment‐related services and higher employment income. However, this positive effect is not observed for participants in language training programs. The economic benefits of employment‐related services are more pronounced for Privately Sponsored Refugees and Blended Visa Office‐Referred Refugees than for Government Assisted Refugees. This disparity may be attributed to refugees' greater reliance on bridging social capital rather than on support from government agencies. Additionally, employment‐related services are more effective in larger urban centres than in mid‐sized or smaller communities. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing settlement service delivery in smaller and mid‐sized communities to improve refugee labour market outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The concept of migration governance has captured scholarly attention in recent decades. In this paper, we present the results of a bibliometric analysis and a scoping review of this concept and explore how it is defined by authors across the social sciences. Based on our sample of literature, we find that a majority of definitions assume a state‐sovereignty perspective of migration governance, leading to discussions that can fail to account for the role of migrant rights and autonomy. Our review reflects upon this result and discusses other findings on the conflation of migration governance with migration management and on the significance of externalized, multi‐level and transnational migration governance in the literature. We conclude that migration governance is a complex concept that must pay closer attention to migrant rights and autonomy.",

          "authors": "Paul Trauttmansdorff, Chiara Loschi",
          "abstract": "Drawing on qualitative interview data and document analysis, this article traces the making of interoperability between databases as a policy response to Europe's crisis‐laden management of migration. It argues that, rather than adhering to a singular logic, the policy enacts several modes of ordering through which actors employ distinct meanings and rationales, deal with challenges and complexities, and evoke continuity and/or disruption in the digital bordering of migration. Specifically, four ordering patterns are identified: interoperability as a technological project, as database (re‐)administration, as legal configuration and as political vision. Each mode assembles and performs the interoperability policy differently, uses modes of expression, proposes certain problems and interventions and also engenders forms of othering. Therefore, this article examines interoperability in the border regime as an example of how the digitization of borders and migration is driven by multiple—and partially conflicting—rationales and ordering intentions.",

          "authors": "Qiujie Shi, Tao Liu",
          "abstract": "This study sheds light on the importance of considering the diversity of older migrants when addressing the question of return in later life. Taking advantage of the China‐City General Household Survey (China‐CGHS) data set, which offers unique information on migration history, this study reveals that different types of older migrants hold different attitudes toward return. People who migrated in later life due to family reasons, namely family‐oriented retirement (FOR) migrants, expressed the highest intentions to return permanently, followed by amenity‐seeking retirement (ASR) migrants and former migrants who have aged in place (AIP). This disparity can be attributed to significant differences in their sociodemographic characteristics, levels of place attachment, places of origin and destination, and the location of family members. However, even after accounting for these differences, variations in intentions to return persist. Furthermore, compared with FOR migrants, AIP migrants are significantly more likely to express an intention to return if they have completed a secondary education. These results suggest that the type of older migrants not only directly affects intentions to return but also shapes how educational attainment affects these intentions. They highlight the role of migratory pathways and migration motivations in the decision‐making process of return in later life.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how African and Haitian migrants and asylum seekers in transit through Mexico utilise the concept of vulnerability, as defined by current migration management systems, to secure protection and legal status. Through ethnographic fieldwork conducted with 30 migrants in Mexico from 2021 to 2023, the research employs semi‐structured interviews and longitudinal follow‐ups to understand these dynamics. The findings reveal that migrants strategically leverage perceived vulnerabilities, particularly those related to gender and ethnicity, to navigate asylum processes. This strategic use of vulnerability might help in accessing protection but also redistributes vulnerability within migrant communities, leading to new forms of exclusion and hierarchy. The study raises critical questions about the ethics and effectiveness of vulnerability‐based protection regimes, highlighting the need for more nuanced and contextual approaches in contemporary migration policies to avoid unintended consequences.",

          "authors": "Tamara Megaw",
          "abstract": "This article considers whether the refugee governance system and humanitarian programs in Indonesia accommodate people with diverse sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression (SOGIE). It contributes to an area of migration research which has been under-researched, on structural processes shaping the lives of sexual and gender minorities as they seek asylum in receiving countries in the Global South. The article utilizes social integration and social inclusion concepts with intersectional analysis. The article offers rich empirical findings on social inclusion, based on Focus Group Discussions and interviews with humanitarian organizations, service providers, and refugee-led organizations. The research shows that refugees with diverse SOGIE face discrimination and threats linked to social stigma toward the LGBTIQ+ community combined with xenophobic attitudes in Indonesia. These challenges are amplified by a weak national refugee governance framework and lack of enforcement of antidiscrimination laws. The author has synthesized these findings in a system map illustrating key enablers and barriers of social inclusion to provide insights on potential levers of change. The map illuminates areas for further research and advocacy, revealing what more can be done to prioritize the agency, safety and dignity of refugees with diverse SOGIE.",

          "authors": "Kenicia Wright, Güneş Murat Tezcür, Maren Mainx, Jordin Tafoya",
          "abstract": "What factors explain Latino support for conspiracy theories? Contemporary scholarship offers valuable insights on how psychological, social, and political factors shape support for conspiracy theories. At the same time, scholarly understanding of the dynamics that foster conspiracy beliefs among racial and ethnic minorities is much more limited. Utilizing survey responses from more than 1,000 Latinos, we theorize explicitly about the factors that explain their support for conspiracies. Consistent with the scholarship highlighting in-group diversity among Latinos, we reveal significant differences among Latinos in their propensity to harbor conspiracy beliefs. Some of the factors that influence their support for conspiratorial statements align with the broader literature, other results appear unique to Latino Americans. Religiosity, lack of trust in institutions, and conservative political ideology are associated with higher levels of conspiracy beliefs among Latinos. We also find that Latinos from later generations, those who consume Spanish media, and who disagree that Latinos face discrimination and White privilege exists are more likely to believe in certain conspiracy theories.",

          "authors": "Zana Vathi, Henry Holborn, Daniel A Gordon",
          "abstract": "In a knowledge exchange (KE) event that focused on migration in the North West of England, mutual aid between stakeholders appeared as a powerful aspect of KE, as the substance that can hold different migration infrastructures together. The proceedings demonstrated that KE events act as a catalyst for the collaboration of actors who have varying stakes in authority, provision, and resolve, which are essential elements of migration infrastructures. KE is thus crucial for the de-politicization and rehumanization of the discourse on migration, by drilling down right to the core of implementation, resource management, multi-agency cooperation, and the fast changing migration ‘industry’. While the university appears as a key actor in articulating the discursive, KE helps to collaboratively review knowledge production and de-systematize it, moving away from what matters to politicians to what matters to those living and working on the ground.",

          "authors": "Hanbei Cheng",
          "abstract": "While economic drivers of return migration are well‐studied, the associated social mechanisms and generational nuances remain underexplored. This study investigates how migrants' economic resources in their hometowns influence return intentions through place attachment, with a specific focus on generational differences. Using first‐hand nationwide survey data and multigroup structural equation modeling (MG‐SEM), we find significant intergenerational disparities. Older migrants exhibit stronger return intentions. Although both generations maintain similarly high homeownership rates (approximately 75%), homeownership significantly influences return intentions only for the older generation. For younger migrants, hometown income is a strong predictor of return, suggesting a focus on financial security. Surprisingly, landholdings are insignificant for both groups, implying a shift away from traditional agricultural livelihoods. Although direct economic effects vary generationally, the indirect influence of place attachment remains consistent across generations. Our multidimensional conceptualization of place attachment reveals its positive, progressively moderating role. Favorable economic conditions facilitate stronger hometown‐oriented behaviors, such as longer visits, which in turn strengthen place identity and promote return migration. This progressive place mechanism is particularly pronounced among older homeowners, emphasizing the enduring influence of place‐based identity. These findings provide a nuanced understanding of return migration, moving beyond purely economic explanations to incorporate the complex interplay of proximity‐seeking behavior and psychosocial factors. Our results have implications for targeted rural revitalization strategies in China, particularly for addressing population imbalances and leveraging return migration for regional development.",

          "abstract": "People's exposure to various social and spatial contexts over time leads to patterns of spatial integration and segregation. While the study of spatial integration has predominantly focused on the location and context of residential neighbourhoods, the emerging activity space approach to segregation argues that it is important to consider people's actual activity locations and mobility. This study builds on both approaches, to provide insights into residential communities' spatial integration over their daily use of urban space. By focussing on the Nordic welfare state context, with its low socioeconomic disparities and deep‐rooted antisegregation policies in Finland, we paid specific attention to the extent to which residents of affluent, mixed, and disadvantaged neighbourhoods exhibit spatial integration over their activity spaces. By combining mobile phone and population register data from the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, we were able to show residential communities' use of urban space hour‐by‐hour on a workday and a weekend day, and its time‐sensitive associations with their neighbourhood‐level socioeconomic characteristics. We found that residents of disadvantaged neighbourhoods are spatially more isolated than residents of affluent and mixed neighbourhoods. Specifically, they spend more time in their own neighbourhood, have more concentrated use of urban space outside their home neighbourhood, and are less exposed to the socially diverse city centre. However, the intergroup differences are more significant at weekends, which highlights the importance of time‐sensitive segregation analysis. Finally, we argue for the need for neighbourhood‐centred integration policies to consider residents' use of urban space both within and beyond their home neighbourhood.",

          "authors": "Céline Teney",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates the educational strategies of displaced Ukrainian parents regarding their school‐age children who fled to Poland and Germany after the 2022 full‐scale Russian invasion. The study is based on an abductive analysis of a unique longitudinal qualitative panel data set of 82 semi‐structured interviews with displaced Ukrainians with school‐age children in Berlin and Warsaw in summer 2022, as well as 60 and 44 follow‐up interviews in spring 2023 and spring 2024, respectively. Three distinct educational strategies are identified: (1) online enrolment in the Ukrainian school system while living in the destination country; (2) exclusive incorporation into the education system of the destination country; (3) return to Ukraine and continuing the Ukrainian school curriculum on site. The extent to which interviewees endorse one strategy over the others varies between Warsaw and Berlin and between the three interview waves. The paper highlights the relevance of “transnational opportunity structure” to better understand migrant's agency and strategies of action. This is conceptualised as the set of opportunities and constraints provided by the contexts in which migrants navigate.",
