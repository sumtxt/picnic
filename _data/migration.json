          "title": "The role of geographical distance in transnational institutional engagement of the Czech diaspora: a comparative study",
          "authors": "Eva Janská, Dušan Drbohlav, Jiří Hasman, Zdeněk Čermák",
          "abstract": "Engagement with institutions from migrants’ country of origin, both in the destination country and in the country of origin, is distinct transnational behaviour. This study investigates the impact of geographical distance on the institutional engagement of migrants from Czechia in five global regions. We examine how geographic (physical) proximity to Czechia shapes institutional engagement with the country of origin and identify factors beyond distance influencing institutional engagement. We analyzed survey data from Czech emigrants ( N = 940) in neighbouring countries, Western and Northern Europe, Southern and Eastern Europe, overseas Anglo-Saxon countries, and other countries. We found that respondents from all more distant regions have higher levels of institutional engagement in the destination country than those from neighbouring countries. Length of stay and education were relevant factors for all selected regions, while place of residence (living in a metropolis) and the level of transnational behavior had varying impacts across regions. Concerning institutional engagement in origin country, the level of transnationalism was consistently the strongest predictor across. Transnational studies should incorporate geographic variables, such as physical distance into their conceptual frameworks. We expect our findings to be generalizable to other countries similar to Czechia, i.e. high-income countries whose citizens benefit from liberal visa regimes.",

          "title": "Escaping uncertainty: overlapping methods of knowledge production and exchange in the naturalization journey",
          "authors": "Liam Haller, Zeynep Yanaşmayan",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how forced migrants integrate individual perception, interpersonal exchange, and extended networks to navigate the naturalization process. By bringing together these three methods of knowledge creation and exchange, we aim to clarify how these strategies interact and overlap to manage uncertainties stemming from naturalization bureaucracy, a complex and often opaque process. Drawing on personal accounts of 30 Syrians in Berlin and analysis of approximately 100 social media posts, our findings illustrate that these methods could be employed concurrently or interchangeably and on the whole in a symbiotic manner, offering migrants multiple pathways to acquire and (in)validate crucial information. Although this synthesis of knowledge production methods is not necessarily conducive to accessing the right in question, in our case naturalization, it becomes necessary to arrive at “informed” decision-making in uncertain environments characterized by low level of trust and asymmetrical power relations. The paper therefore contributes to broader discussions on migrants’ navigation of legal systems and coping mechanisms in the face of bureaucratic hurdles.",

          "title": "Migration and Education in the Global South: A Study of South American Origin Children in the Argentinean Educational System",
          "authors": "Carolina V. Zuccotti",
          "abstract": "The question of how the children of migrants compare to natives in destination countries has long occupied the research agenda of migration and integration scholars. But, while there are many studies that have explored this issue in the Global North, with special attention to South–North migrants, little is known about integration patterns of South–South migrants, that is, Southern migrants and their children residing in the Global South. This article addresses this concern by studying one of the key indicators of migrant integration—the educational achievement of the children of migrants—in one of the most popular migration corridors in the Global South—that of South Americans who emigrated to Argentina. Using census microdata from 2010, the article explores the educational attainment and educational reproduction of Bolivian-, Paraguayan-, Peruvian-, and Chilean-origin children in comparison with that of their native Argentine counterparts. The analysis distinguishes between 1.5 and second-generation children and focuses on young people between 6 and 21 years old who live with at least one parent. Two dimensions of educational attainment are explored: school attendance and educational level. The results show that the role of parental education tends to be weaker among migrant-origin groups. This has implications for the educational gap. In general, migrant-origin groups are advantaged over native Argentines among those with low-educated parents. Conversely, they present no differences or are disadvantaged among those with middle–high educated parents. This is observed for both 1.5 and second generations, with variations based on the outcome and national origin. Possible explanations are offered.",

          "title": "International Migration Review at 60: Evolving and Emerging Models of International Migration Research",
          "authors": "Ellen Percy Kraly, Cecilia Menjívar, Holly E. Reed",
          "abstract": "This contribution introduces the special issue commemorating the 60th anniversary of International Migration Review. We first review the scholarly themes of articles published in the journal during the last 10 years, since the 50th-anniversary issue. We identify seven broad trends and aspects of international population movements, migration, and the migrant experience, including mixed migration, access to asylum, climate migration, South-South models of integration and assistance, studies of legal and liminal status, and attitudes and national political response to immigrants, as key themes represented in the last decade of IMR articles. We then discuss the process of creating the special issue and introduce the scholars and their contributions to the issue around the analytical and conceptual themes of (i) knowledge, expertise, and policy; (ii) migration theory; (iii) methods and analysis; (iv) assimilation and transnationalism; (v) borders and bordering; (vi) legal statuses and in-between experiences; and (vii) migrant well-being and health. Finally, we reflect on what we have accomplished so far, but also challenges IMR as a journal and the broader community of international migration scholars, practitioners, and advocates to continue to work toward further diversity, interdisciplinarity, innovation, and collaboration in our work.",
