Despite strong evidence that ODA actually results in increased levels of emigration, a new approach to ‘migration management aid’ is driving widespread policy experimentation, particularly in Europe. In the case of ‘in‐donor refugee costs’, an earlier attempt to use ODA to pursue migration management goals, accounting methods of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) provided valuable tools to monitor changes in expenditure. The creation of a new DAC code means that this is now possible for migration management aid.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how social ties are actively constructed, recalibrated or severed by migrants navigating a reality of double war, defined as the simultaneous exposure to war in both their countries of origin and destination. The study draws on thirty‐seven in‐depth interviews with migrants from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus who immigrated to Israel between 2022 and 2024 following Russia's full‐scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and later experienced renewed insecurity during the Israel–Hamas War. Engaging three main bodies of literature, transnationalism, social network theory and migration in contexts of war and displacement, this study explores how migrants manage ties across a geo‐social triangle: the origin country, the host country and third countries. The analysis identifies two relational phases: an initial overload and triage of social ties, followed by a phase of relational calibration, in which migrants make strategic and emotionally and morally charged decisions about with whom to connect, support or withdraw from. These findings offer a conceptual understanding of social ties as dynamic and ethically negotiated responses to instability. By positioning migrants' agency under conditions of insecurity, the study contributes new analytic tools for examining how war reshapes relational life across transnational space.",

          "authors": "Cristina Bratu, Matz Dahlberg, Sebastian Kohl, Madhinee Valeyatheepillay",
          "abstract": "Studies of urban segregation have paid little attention to when immigrants arrive, whereas research on age at arrival has rarely considered segregation as an outcome. This study bridges these two literatures. Exploiting variation in age at arrival between siblings, we causally show that immigrants who arrive at younger ages are more likely to live in less segregated neighborhoods as adults, with the effect being particularly pronounced among refugees. A descriptive decomposition suggests that economic factors account for a larger share of the relationship among non-refugees, whereas for refugees, intermarriage and economic factors contribute roughly equally to explaining the variation in the effect of age at immigration.",

          "abstract": "The nonreligious—atheists, agnostics, and nones—are on track to become America’s largest religious group between 2030 and 2040. The group’s rapid growth is largely attributed to widespread disaffiliation from Christian traditions across racial and ethnic identities. However, a significant portion of the population is now 2nd generation nonreligious, meaning that they not only never identified with a faith tradition but were raised in a nonreligious household by nonreligious parents. A significant body of work in psychology shows differences between those who convert away from religious identification and lifelong nonbelievers across intersecting identities. Yet, no work exists examining how this distinction impacts ideology or political beliefs that affect how voters’ identities interact with political outcomes. This study investigates the ideological and political differences between ex-Christian members of the nonreligious community and lifelong nonbelievers across multiple facets of identity, using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS).",

          "authors": "Karun Kishor Karki",
          "abstract": "In an era of globalization, increasingly interconnected labor markets have intensified competition for skilled talent, particularly among countries in the Global North such as Canada. While Canada’s immigration policy prioritizes education and professional experience, these same credentials are often devalued upon arrival, as systemic barriers limit access to commensurate employment. This study examines the employment experiences of skilled, racialized immigrants in British Columbia, exploring how institutional narratives of meritocracy conceal exclusion, credential systems reinforce epistemic hierarchies, and settlement services pathologize migrant experiences. Using a qualitative design with four focus group discussions ( n = 18), the study integrates critical migration theory, intersectionality, and decolonial social work to analyze the structural marginalization of skilled, racialized immigrants. Findings reveal a central paradox: the very system that celebrates global talent simultaneously erodes its value through credential gatekeeping, discriminatory hiring practices, and labor market practices that privilege local over global expertise. By situating these barriers within broader colonial and epistemic hierarchies, the study argues that integration must be understood not as individual adaptation but as institutional transformation. It contributes to critical debates on skilled migration, equity, and the reproduction of colonial logics within Canada’s labor market.",

          "abstract": "Felon disenfranchisement, while ostensibly race neutral, bars more Black Americans from voting than White Americans. This has promulgated claims that felon disenfranchisement is used to limit Black political influence. However, we lack systematic evidence tying perceptions of racial political power to support for disenfranchising felons. Utilizing the racial threat framework, we argue that White Americans who perceive Black Americans as too politically powerful will be more supportive of disenfranchising felons, particularly right-leaning White Americans. Using data from the 2020 and 2024 ANES, we find perceptions of political threat are associated with greater support for felon disenfranchisement. In further support for the political racial threat hypothesis, we find perceptions of Black political power increase support among those on the political right while decreasing support among the political left. Importantly, these results hold after controlling for economic and symbolic threat, general Black affect, crime spending preferences, and Black population size. These results suggest political racial threat significantly influences support for felon disenfranchisement among White Americans, and conditionally on political leanings, underscoring the role of political racial threat in whether White Americans think felons should be allowed to vote.",

We also anticipate that age will be a major cleavage in support for the CBC among Black people. We test our hypotheses using the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS). We find that Black people, and older Black people in particular, are the most supportive of the CBC. Moreover, we find that disparities in support among the youngest and oldest Black respondents are greater than the differences between Black and White people in our analysis. We empirically explore the causes of this intergenerational rift and show that younger Black Americans’ lower levels of support for the organization are in part tied to their lower levels of linked fate and their perception that elected officials do not work to advance their interest in government.",

          "abstract": "This project investigates how skin tone and gender of Black political candidates work together to influence White Americans’ evaluations. Drawing on the colorism literature and group position theory, I develop a theoretical framework anticipating how the skin tone of Black candidates may influence White voters’ perceptions. Two survey experiments were conducted on nationally representative samples. Both studies highlight that skin tone is meaningful to White voters’ evaluations, but in nuanced ways based on gender. Specifically, the darker-skinned Black female candidate is evaluated more positively than her lighter-skinned female and darker-skinned male counterpart across multiple domains, including vote choice and expected job performance. These findings suggest that gender can attenuate the negative stereotypes typically associated with darker skin tone in some contexts. These findings underscore the importance of theorizing about race as a multidimensional construct, with implications for understanding hierarchy, intergroup relations, and electoral politics in a diversifying American racial landscape.",

Recent research has highlighted concerns both with how asylum seekers are heard and how their accounts are assessed. Recently, we developed a novel training program in investigative interviewing and legal psychology for asylum officials in Finland. During the training, the officials reported several organizational constraints and everyday challenges that they face in their daily work of interviewing asylum seekers. These concerns can have a considerable negative effect on interview quality and the work-related stress experienced by officials, with potential negative effects on their work. This aspect has largely been unexplored in research until now. In this field reflection, we aim to describe the key challenges that we observed, and which were formulated by the practitioners, discuss them in relation to empirical research, and propose recommendations for future research and practice.",

          "authors": "Tatjana Neuhuber, Antonia E. Schneider, Selim Banabak, Justin Kadi",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates how residential mobility among high‐income households shapes income segregation. Drawing on a unique data set covering all household relocations in Vienna between 2011 and 2018, we examine whether the movements of the top income quintile (Q5) reflect a broader ‘retreat of the rich’ to affluent clusters and, if so, how these mobility patterns influence both citywide and localized segregation. Using a combination of global and local dissimilarity indices, as well as a novel scenario‐based approach, we isolate the effects of intra‐urban mobility, income status change and in‐migration. The results show that Q5 households are consistently the most segregated group, and while they mostly tend to move between affluent areas, their mobility alone does not fully explain segregation trends. Instead, we find that the selective out‐migration of lower‐income groups from the same areas plays a critical role in reinforcing segregation. Local scenario analyses reveal that Q5 mobility can either increase or reduce segregation, depending on the spatial context, challenging simple narratives of a retreat of the rich. These findings underscore the importance of analysing segregation as a dynamic, multi‐scalar process shaped by the intersecting mobility patterns of all income groups, even in cities with inclusive housing regimes like Vienna.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on camps is extensive yet highly fragmented, structured around disciplinary, geographical, and theoretical silos that rarely enter into sustained dialogue. While numerous studies and literature reviews have examined camps through specific lenses (humanitarian governance, sovereignty, biopolitics, architecture) no comprehensive synthesis has yet mapped the full terrain of camp‐related research across forms, periods, and locations. This article addresses that gap by sketching a broad, cross‐disciplinary overview of Camp Studies, identifying key clusters and points of convergence within the literature. Beyond synthesis, the article advances a second, more programmatic intervention: it proposes Critical Camp Studies as a distinct field of inquiry. Drawing inspiration from the emergence of Carceral Geography and Critical Border Studies, the article argues that the proliferation and normalisation of encampment as policy (particularly in relation to migration) demands a sustained, systematic, and explicitly critical framework. Rather than analysing camps solely as sites of management or humanitarian ‘best practice’ Critical Camp Studies foregrounds urgent social questions of injustice, inequality, and power in relation to camps and encampment.",

          "abstract": "High‐income countries shape their migration policies to attract highly qualified immigrants (HQI), aiming to boost human capital and economic growth. HQI often settle in large cities, raising two challenges for urban social sustainability. First, immigrants frequently face residential segregation, hindering social integration. Second, local communities in cities receiving wealthier migrants may experience displacement due to lifestyle migration and transnational gentrification. However, in countries with recent migration history, the residential distribution of HQI in urban areas remains largely unknown. This study analyses the residential distribution of HQI in Spain's largest urban areas, where HQI have rapidly increased from nearly 170,000 in 2001 to over 925,000 in 2021. Using 2021 Census data, we apply Multilevel Latent Class Analysis to categorize immigrants by migration status, labour performance and household characteristics. We identify seven distinct groups and demonstrate the existence of a socioeconomic stratification regarding their residential distribution. Unemployed or overqualified HQIs from low‐ and middle‐income regions cluster in lower‐income peripheral areas, while those employed in high‐skilled jobs originating in Europe concentrate in central cities.",

It investigates the loneliness reports of older African adults in the South African context, where out‐migrants are reported as retaining membership in their household of origin. An analysis of household survey data collected in the National Income Dynamics Study shows that between 2008 and 2017, almost 30% of older ( ≥ 60 years) African adults in South Africa lived in a household that was “stretched” (it included at least one household member not physically resident in the household). At the unconditional mean, older adults in these households are significantly less likely than other older African adults to report feeling lonely. This relationship exists independently of whether the older person's household receives private transfers (including remittance income). A series of ordered probit regressions shows that lower loneliness reports derive from sizeable differences in household characteristics. In comparison to older African adults in other households, those in stretched households are far more likely to live with children and working‐age adults. These characteristics are significant protectors of the loneliness of older adults, and once they are accounted for, there is no further association between living in a stretched household and the loneliness of older adults.",

While previous research has predominantly focused on deskilling, this research focuses on the upskilling of Filipino migrant nurses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The morphogenetic cycle has been adopted to explore how structural factors interplay with agencies of Filipino migrant nurses related to the upskilling process. Findings demonstrate that Filipino migrant nurses who majored in nursing due to external factors, such as parental pressure or social trends, tend to improve their professional and soft skills after migrating to the UAE, which offers abundant resources, thereby demonstrating their agency. Furthermore, migrant nurses developed a positive perception of themselves, actively recommending migration to those around them, while also voicing their criticisms of the Filipino medical system. This research demonstrates how agents and structures interact in relation to the upskilling of migrant nurses, providing clues as to how the phenomenon of labor migration perpetuates.",

While return migration in China is often attributed to structural barriers, this research highlights the agency of migrant women in actively shaping their migration trajectories. Using Constructivist Grounded Theory methods, the study draws on in‐depth interviews with twelve young migrant mothers (seven participated in follow‐up interviews one year later), revealing that aspirations for return migration emerge early but become more concrete after childbirth. Our findings suggest that return migration is not merely a response to exclusion but a strategic decision influenced by multi‐local capabilities, familial responsibilities, and aspirations for a better life. Migrant mothers exercise adaptive agency by strategically navigating settlement choices across both rural and urban locations. Rather than viewing return as a failure, this study conceptualises it as an evolving and relational process of place‐making, shaped by gendered expectations and ongoing mobility. By reframing return migration as a dynamic and strategic decision, this research expands existing understandings of internal migration and place in China.",

The disadvantage faced by, and systematic societal failure to support, disabled and neurodiverse children has become increasingly visible within political and media debates, yet is largely overlooked within geography and broader social sciences. We present original findings demonstrating that increasing proportions of children are being educated in segregated special schools, and that these geographies are uneven at the local (Local Authority) scale, despite a stated presumption of mainstream education, dating back to 1989 and within existing legislation (Children and Families Act, 2014). Time and spatial trends in the school provision of children with SEND are analysed using multilevel longitudinal models and panel data at Local Authority scale. Critically, location is pivotal to whether children attend segregated special schools. The spatial difference is tied to: the proportions of children with statutory support, Local Authorities with higher levels of income deprivation affecting children, and the types of labels/experiences of ‘need’—particularly the increasing number of children on the autism spectrum. In light of the stated government priority to continue a presumption towards inclusion in mainstream schools, our analysis begs questions of the ability of mainstream schools to include children with common and growing ‘differences’, particularly in locations of high deprivation.",

          "abstract": "Legal precarity has been used to describe the relations between ‘space, law and persons’ that produce illegality and shape the sociolegal exclusion of forced migrants. Precarious legal status is demarcated by hierarchies of legal and social membership and degrees of exclusion. Within the context of legal precarity, we explore the coping strategies used by forced migrants preceding and during the COVID‐19 period in Italy. Our analysis focuses on interviews with 31 asylum claimants. We find that forced migrants experienced protracted legal liminality and precarity characterised by extended time spent in migration camps, unpredictable legal status determination, and, more broadly, imperfect knowledge. In particular, their legal precarity was formed or shaped by a fluctuating legal and bureaucratic system, the suspension of asylum determination processes, and the closure of institutions due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The cumulative impact affected their well‐being and limited their full participation in society. This paper's key contribution is in identifying strategies employed in response. Individuals employed social network support, physical exercises, faith, and cognitive reframing of the legal difficulties to cope with prolonged precarious legal precarity. These findings have implications for migration scholarship and for professionals working with forced migrants, and can help inform policy and future research.",

          "abstract": "In this article we examine how rural‐to‐urban migrant factory workers in two of Vietnam's industrial zones actively construct livelihood stability and pursue future aspirations while dealing with structurally precarious work environments. We develop a multi‐scalar conceptual framework combining key ideas regarding livelihood trajectories, feminist social reproduction theory, and social networks and social capital, and draw on worker interviews in Bình Dương and Bắc Ninh Provinces as well as focus groups with officials and other key stakeholders. While workers' trajectories are shaped by shifting production demands, low wages, housing insecurity, and limited social protection, as well as familial obligations and life events, we find that they actively recalibrate their livelihood strategies and focus on gaining stability through informal income activities, support networks, and future‐oriented planning. Rather than viewing workers as passive subjects of exploitation, our study contributes to scholarship on precarious labour and migration by showing how economic survival, emotional well‐being, and aspirational agency are dynamically interwoven and negotiated over time. We also challenge dominant policy narratives within Vietnam that frame industrial employment as a straightforward path to improved livelihoods, while calling for more integrated policy approaches that recognize the entanglement of labour, housing, and care in sustaining Vietnam's industrial development.",

This paper shifts the focus to the benefits of staying by examining how location‐specific capital shapes labour market outcomes for middle‐skilled vocational education graduates. Using longitudinal register data from Statistics Netherlands, we analyse whether residential history, professional networks, and personal networks are associated with higher employment rates and more stable employment contracts among young vocational graduates. The results show that stayers experience more favourable labour market outcomes than newcomers (i.e. migrants) and that locally embedded professional and personal networks are positively related to employment and contract stability. These patterns do not depend on geographical contexts, but are found in both rural and urban regions. Together, the findings suggest that, through the accumulation of location‐specific capital, staying, rather than moving, can be an effective labour market strategy for vocational education graduates.",

          "abstract": "Neighbourhood cohesion is suggested to improve residents' subjective well‐being, especially for disadvantaged individuals who are more likely to live in resource‐deprived neighbourhoods. However, existing studies face a challenge in establishing a causal relationship between neighbourhood cohesion and subjective well‐being due to endogeneity issues from residential selection. To address this methodological challenge, we use the random allocation of public housing in Hong Kong as a natural experiment. We analyse data from the Hong Kong Panel Study of Social Dynamics (HKPSSD) and focus on public housing residents. We find that individuals' pre‐determined socioeconomic and demographic characteristics are uncorrelated with the social cohesion of the neighbourhoods where residents are placed, which confirms the validity of our research design. Based on the design, we find that neighbourhood cohesion is positively associated with residents' life satisfaction and happiness, while it is also negatively associated with mental distress. Moreover, neighbourhood satisfaction is a significant mediator between neighbourhood cohesion and subjective well‐being. Our findings contribute to establishing a causal relationship in studies on neighbourhood effects and provide policy implications for improving well‐being among disadvantaged residents.",
