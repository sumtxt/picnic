          "authors": "Alexandra David, Judith Terstriep, Jörg Freiling",
          "abstract": "This article explores the importance of belongingness in migrant entrepreneurs' (MEs) engagement within entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), focusing on emotional and social dimensions often overlooked in favour of structural factors. Through two case studies in Germany's Ruhr area, the article demonstrates how a strong sense of belonging enhances resilience, trust and social capital, essential for business success. The experiences of two MEs, Ilyas and Elif, illustrate belongingness as a catalyst for connectedness and embeddedness, enabling access to networks and resources while countering discrimination. The study suggests that policy frameworks should acknowledge and support the emotional and relational aspects of MEs' integration in EEs. Emphasising informal support systems, community engagement and tailored interventions could help overcome structural barriers and foster more inclusive ecosystems. Future research should further examine these dynamics across diverse cultural and geographical contexts to offer a more comprehensive understanding of MEs' entrepreneurial trajectories.",

          "authors": "Senyo Dotsey",
          "abstract": "While some (progressive) cities have been proactive in forced migrants' reception and integration policy formulation, the central state is ultimately the chief architect of migration policy and the legal framework. Legal status considerably shapes all facets of forced migrants' lifeworlds and thus has significant implications for policy and integration. The Italian government has recently made significant changes to its migration system, affecting asylum‐seekers and refugees' legal status and subsequent city‐level integration efforts. This article thus investigates the interplay between asylum‐seekers' legal status, national migration policy framework and local integration programme. Employing the concept of legal uncertainty and qualitative exploration of a local integration project in Bergamo, it problematises the state's institutional production of uncertain and precarious migration status and how this shapes the prospects of asylum‐seekers' integration processes. It is shown that the city's efforts to integrate asylum‐seekers, starting from their arrival, are stifled by the national migration legal framework.",

          "title": "Education Expansion and Attitudes Toward Immigrants Across Generations in the United Kingdom",
          "authors": "Victoria Donnaloja",
          "abstract": "University graduates hold more positive attitudes toward immigrants (ATI) than non-graduates. However, whether individual gains in higher education create a more inclusive society depends on why higher education is associated with more positive attitudes. Education may shape attitudes directly, by fostering inclusive values, or indirectly, by shielding the highly educated from competition with immigrants. Over time, if the effect is direct, the expansion of education leads younger cohorts to hold increasingly positive views. In contrast, if the effect is indirect, the advantage conferred by higher education may erode as it becomes more widespread, potentially weakening its liberalizing influence on the population. Using multivariate regression analysis, I test these competing hypotheses for the UK by examining whether the gap in attitudes between high and low educated has narrowed as the British and immigrant populations have become more educated. I use the British Election Study and the British Social Attitudes Survey, which cover ATI between 1961 and 2021 for cohorts born throughout the twentieth century. In line with a direct effect of higher education, I find that graduates have consistently had more positive attitudes than non-graduates across generations, even relative to the expansion of education. However, I find that all younger cohorts, including the high educated, are increasingly more likely to believe that immigrants take jobs from the British-born and increase crime. This suggests that while higher education is a key determinant of ATI, it is not sufficient to offset other generational factors that may lead to rising hostility.",

          "authors": "Lejla Sunagic",
          "abstract": "Clandestine migration is not only a response to precarious living conditions but also driven by aspirations and desires for change that migrants carry into their journeys. Yet, far less is known about what becomes of these subjective driving forces once people reach their destinations and settle down. To address this gap, this study explores how Syrian parents who risked crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe interpret their migration from the standpoint of their settled lives. This perspective allows for tracing how the reasoning behind the risky decision evolved—from its origins in Syria (or the first country of asylum) to reflections rooted in the host countries of Sweden and Denmark. Across these spatial and temporal shifts, parents' narratives reveal the contradictory values they attach to migration, shaped by the complex dynamics of parent–child relationships. These contradictions are examined through the lens of the moral theory of risk. From this perspective, the notion of virtuous risking for the sake of one's children—initially central to parents' justification of their decision—gradually loses significance within the context of their new lives in Europe. This dynamic lies at the core of the evolving meanings parents attach to both risk and migration.",

          "abstract": "This paper focuses on diplomatic families, a special group of privileged migrants who move regularly every 2−4 years, shaping family life through cyclical mobility patterns. Drawing on ethnography with four active‐duty diplomatic service families, which include diplomats, their accompanying partners, and children, it examines the families' temporal experiences under a regularly mobile work regime. By conceptualising migrant temporality, this paper argues that institutionalised mobility not only gives rise to temporal uncertainties and discontinuities, but also reinforces familial bonds and agency through structured rhythms. Besides, this paper points out that diplomatic infrastructures provide familiar living environments and a sense of temporal continuity. However, their high level of homogeneity also blurs families' perceptions of temporal and spatial transitions, often generating a sense of ‘unreal’ regarding time. This paper contributes to the literature on regular mobile work regimes, privileged migrants, and skilled migrants by emphasising the complex intersections of mobility's temporal experiences and family life, underscoring the importance of examining the interplay between temporality, family relations, and institutional arrangements in migration studies.",

          "authors": "María E. Cervantes‐Macías",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how Mexico's upper‐middle classes construct credentialized aspirations —intergenerational, place‐based strategies of class reproduction centered on the pursuit of globally recognized educational and professional credentials. Drawing on 45 life‐history interviews with Mexican professionals in Vancouver and Seattle and their parents in Monterrey, the study situates these strategies within the broader context of North American economic integration since NAFTA. Rather than engaging in family migration projects, upper‐middle‐class families invest in elite international education to cultivate cosmopolitan dispositions and transnational networks from an early age, enabling their children to navigate ‘highly skilled’ migration regimes in the United States and Canada. I develop the concept of credentialized aspirations to describe how the iterative accumulation of credentials—degrees, language proficiency, and professional experience—functions as a mechanism for sustaining social mobility under conditions of neoliberal uncertainty. This analysis reveals how regional integration, private education infrastructures, and meritocratic migration policies intersect to shape the geographies of privilege and mobility in North America. By foregrounding the Mexican case, the paper advances population geography scholarship on aspirations and mobility, demonstrating how elite reproduction operates through localized practices that are deeply entwined with transnational imaginaries of success.",
