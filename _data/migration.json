          "title": "Circular and return migration of Egyptian migrant workers in Libya",
          "authors": "Mohamed Elsayeh",
          "abstract": "The return of Egyptian migrants to Egypt following the onset of crisis in Libya in 2011 raises important questions about their classification as “returnees.” This article demonstrates the impact of the crisis on Egyptians' livelihoods. Field research conducted in Egypt in 2016 reveals that, at least in part, from 2011 onwards Egyptians were engaged in circular migration to and from Libya as a livelihood strategy because of failed reintegration in Egypt. The Egyptian government, intergovernmental and non‐governmental organisations provided varied levels of protection and assistance in evacuating migrants; however, they lacked awareness about returnees' socio‐economic needs. Egyptians were largely unsupported by state and non‐state institutions upon their return and therefore remained reliant on families and social networks. Initiatives aimed at providing aid to returnees, such as those introduced in Ghana and Niger, were generally absent in the Egyptian context. The absence of support had other unintended consequences, including increased levels of domestic violence and reduced educational opportunities for children in households hosting returnees.",

          "title": "Externalization Beyond “Immigration Risk”? UK Borderwork Creep in Africa and its Cumulative Rippling Effects",
          "authors": "Nicole Ostrand",
          "abstract": "This article examines UK “borderwork creep” into ever more sites in states across Africa and considers how it is transformed and produced by practitioners on the ground. The aim is to go beyond research focusing on the EU and Northern and Western Africa to show the more expansive and, in some cases, unexpected reach of UK borderwork. Drawing on interviews, documentary research, and freedom of information requests, I find UK-funded “training” and “capacity building” in 17 African states. This creep, in many cases, is driven less by the UK perceptions of “immigration risk” and more by opportunism based on African counterparts’ interests and the ability of UK immigration liaison officers to establish relationships on the ground. This complicates conventional narratives, and government claims, where externalization is largely seen as a response to perceived “migration crises” and increases in “unwanted” and illegalized mobility. The paper adds to the rich and growing body of research on externalization in Africa by attuning specifically to the productive role of relationships and cumulative dimensions, which have received limited attention to-date. It does so by proposing the metaphor of rippling to better highlight how previous actions and interactions build on each other and spread outward, generating new actions. The result is UK borderwork diffused and distanced from the original goals of externalized migration control.",

          "title": "Subjectivity in Welfare Mobilities: Rethinking Welfare as a Structure, a Process, and an Experience",
          "authors": "Dominique Jolivet",
          "abstract": "This article reflects on what migration studies have accomplished when researching the role of welfare in migration. It highlights that conventional migration theories do not sufficiently account for how people understand welfare and how they interpret and react to welfare perceptions. The article calls for more attention to the interplay of welfare's subjectivity and migration processes to better understand (im)mobility aspirations and decisions. This dynamic interplay can be captured through the concept of welfare mobilities and studied by combining old and new migration theories within a more integrated analytical framework. The article provides an empirical example of the insights that this approach can bring and shows the need to conceptualize welfare as a structure, a process, and an experience to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of its role in migration decision making.",

          "title": "Does Information Improve the Experience of Pursuing Labor Migration? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Pakistan",
          "authors": "Daniel Karell, Rabia Malik, Syed Kasim Najam Shah",
          "abstract": "A large literature on international labor migration explores how to improve low-skilled migrants’ experience of pursuing and obtaining overseas employment. Much of this scholarship focuses on describing and mitigating difficult, and sometimes exploitative, conditions in the host country. Scholars have paid less attention to factors in home countries that may affect aspiring migrants’ experience of looking for overseas work. We help address this gap by conducting a field experiment in the high out-migration country of Pakistan to examine whether receiving new information about employment brokers and overseas opportunities improves aspiring migrants’ subjective and objective experience of the job-seeking process. After analyzing the effects of information on those who lack alternative sources of information, we report mixed findings. These highlight the need to think carefully about ways to improve aspiring migrants’ job-seeking experiences, especially with regard to the common assumption that if low-skilled migrants simply “knew more” — that is, had more relevant and accurate information — they would not allow themselves to have negative migration experiences; our findings suggest this is not necessarily always the case.",

          "authors": "Ebru Sanliturk, Francesco C. Billari",
          "abstract": "Following the assumption that trends of online queries may indicate intentions and help to predict human behavior, this study addresses the general issue of analyzing, nowcasting, and predicting migrant decisions through an analysis of Google search patterns in the case of Syrians in Turkey. Aiming to contribute to the literature on predicting migration patterns, we examine the relationship between Google search queries for province names in Turkey and the number of Syrians under temporary protection across provinces from January 2016 to December 2019 and demonstrate a positive and significant association. Then, we explore the predictive power of Google searches in predicting the stock of Syrians under temporary protection in Turkey across provinces. We exploit the alphabetical difference between Turkish and Arabic as the method of differentiation between host and migrant populations. Our findings indicate that Google searches can be good predictors for estimating refugee stocks, especially when traditional data are not available. They can also be helpful in forecasting the changing pattern of migrant stocks at frequent intervals, to which conventional socioeconomic indicators are less sensitive due to their less frequent reporting periods.",
