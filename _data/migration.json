          "title": "How Do Immigration Policies Affect Voter Support for Low-Skilled Immigrants? Evidence from a Survey Experiment",
          "authors": "Vincent Hopkins, Andrea Lawlor, Mireille Paquet",
          "abstract": "Countries depend on both high- and low-skilled immigration to meet economic needs. But most voters prefer high-skilled immigrants, despite the fact that multiple economic sectors structurally depend on low-skilled immigrants. In this paper, we examine voter preferences toward low-skilled immigrants as one barrier to effective immigration policy, even in political regimes where immigration is the consequence of highly coordinated or “planned” policies. Specifically, we consider whether government communication around the benefits of low-skilled immigration can increase favorability of such policies. We are particularly interested in the ways in which government communicates immigration messages and whether the scope or concentration of the proposed benefits will move individual preferences. In an online survey experiment, we present Canadians ( N=2,023) with a policy brief that manipulates immigrant skill level (high vs. low), economic outcomes of migration (positive vs. mixed), and the geographic scope of benefits (concentrated vs. sociotropic). Employing two measures of policy support, we find some evidence that positive framing can increase overall support for low-skill migrants. We also find that manipulating framing around high-skilled workers has little effect on support for low-skill workers, even when that framing presents countervailing evidence as to the benefit of high-skilled labor. In sum, our findings suggest that elite level communication around the benefits of low-skill labor may have the ability to disrupt longstanding antipathy for low-skilled labor, even in regimes with longstanding support for high-skilled labor.",

          "authors": "Mariam Rashid",
          "abstract": "Critical approaches to forced displacement and migration studies gesture towards methodologies and theoretical orientations that are contextualized within the complex socialities of refuge lifeworlds and ways of being. This article offers methodological approaches that account for the forces of displacement as well as the layered and textured experiences of forcibly displaced people. Turning to black studies and black feminist thought, the article examines how forcibly displaced people navigate and contest resettlement processes in the USA. Thinking with empirical material from a research study engaging with forcibly displaced interlocutors from East and Central Africa and refugee resettlement personnel, the article illuminates critical methods of interpreting the experiences of refugees and forms of resettlement through the lenses of black studies and black feminist thought.",

          "title": "Villagers' Resistance to Gentrification‐Led Displacement in the Guanxi Society: Lessons From Rural Guangzhou, China",
          "authors": "Shizhen Huang, Yuting Liu, Qingyi Chen, Yuanlin Zhang",
          "abstract": "The antigentrification campaign has gained global attention because it is crucial for realising social justice, particularly against displacement. Numerous literature has focused on government management, however, there is a dearth of research on the resistance undertaken by the potential displacees. Therefore, this paper explores villagers' survivability when facing displacement threats within China's guanxi society. The guanxi provides a fresh lens on Chinese social development, distiling intergroup relationships into four states that reveal power dynamics within gentrification and enable a nuanced analysis of displacement and resistance. The case of Xiaozhou Village is examined, tracing villagers' living dynamics over the past three decades. The study reveals that villagers have effectively resisted sociocultural displacement pressure and exclusionary displacement by maintaining or preserving their fields. Guanxi provides a perspective for examining how villagers legally possess capital, engage in habitus‐driven competition against gentrifiers, and ultimately support their community cohesion. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the uneven micro‐geopolitics of gentrification and offers insights into the effective mitigation of displacement.",
