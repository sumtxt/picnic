          "abstract": "Border policing and enforcement produce “spectacles” foregrounding the “illegality” of migrants of all ages. These practices reinforce policies that racialize meanings of citizenship. The United States government’s detention of unaccompanied migrant children qualifies as one such “spectacle,” yet little research has examined the disparate treatment children receive based on their region of origin. We use a complete census of all unaccompanied migrant children admitted into Office of Refugee Resettlement custody between October 1, 2014, and March 1, 2023, to compare the experiences of 794 African unaccompanied children with those of their non-African peers. Our results suggest that US government detention of unaccompanied migrant children reflects racialized notions of citizenship and belonging. Children from African countries experienced greater suspicion, surveillance, and punishment compared to non-African children. They spent far longer in ORR custody, in more restrictive settings, and were more likely to lose the protections afforded children as they aged out or underwent an age redetermination. At the same time, African children experienced the positive outcome of immigration relief while in ORR custody at a rate far exceeding other children. These comparative findings make visible for the first time the unique experiences of unaccompanied African children in US immigration detention, experiences that enable further racialization of citizenship inequalities.",

          "authors": "Katharine Charsley, Nicole Hoellerer",
          "abstract": "Migrantisation has become a key concept among scholars attempting to de-naturalise and de-centre the migrant/citizen binary. It has, however, been used in a variety of ways that have not always been clearly delineated. In this paper we tease out the strands of development of the concept, distinguishing different usages of migrantisation, and propose a new terminology to clarify the ways in which the term can serve a variety of purposes at different analytical levels. In particular, we identify two separate strands in the literature: ‘demographic migrantisation’ and ‘categorical migrantisation’. The latter is most consequential for Migration Studies, and so forms the main focus of this article, along with two further contributions developing from the categorical migrantisation approach: ‘migrantisation as an analytical perspective’, and the recently introduced concept of ‘experiential migrantisation’. Our discussion foregrounds the multi-dimensional nature of categorical migrantisation, which takes place across multiple domains, and is intersectional and contextual in character. In creating a more systematic understanding of the concept of migrantisation, we hope to lay clearer foundations for future research.",

          "authors": "Shapoor Hamid",
          "abstract": "This study examines how migration aspirations among Afghan returnees are formed, realised and repressed within a context of prolonged instability and authoritarian governance. Drawing on 32 life history interviews conducted in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar and Balkh, and using Jørgen Carling's theoretical framework, the analysis shows that migration aspirations are not fleeting responses to crisis but enduring life strategies shaped by systemic exclusion, structural inequality and evolving socio‐political constraints. Aspirations persist and often intensify in the face of return, repression and limited legal pathways—prompting strategic recalibrations through educational migration, humanitarian routes and transnational networks. The study highlights the gendered dimensions of aspiration, particularly the growing role of migration as a means of resisting institutionalised restrictions on women. The findings call for a shift in migration governance—from containment toward rights‐based legal pathways that respond to the realities of Afghan mobility and contribute to regional stability.",

          "abstract": "The study aimed to spatially analyse returnee support sources, stigmatisation and reintegration in Nigeria. Data were collected between March 2022 and May 2023 using a mixed‐method approach, including surveys with 444 returnees from two towns in each of Nigeria's six geopolitical zones as well as in‐depth interviews with 18 returnees and 13 stakeholders. Findings show that about two‐thirds planned to re‐migrate, primarily due to stigma. Discrimination and negative stereotypes hinder reintegration, while support from family and friends helps reduce stigmatisation. Regional disparities reveal the North‐West and South‐South have the most effective AVR implementation, while the South‐West faces greater challenges. The South‐East reports the highest stigmatisation level, followed distantly by the South‐West, while the North‐Central and South‐West have the lowest reintegration rates. The study recommends targeted, culturally sensitive policies to reduce stigma and promote acceptance, stressing the need for long‐term integration strategies in host countries over continued investment in ineffective Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes.",

          "authors": "Kiril Sharapov, Heather Komenda",
          "abstract": "This article examines the vulnerability of Ukrainian refugees to trafficking, abuse and exploitation in Poland and Romania following the full‐scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Drawing on survey data from the International Organization for Migration's Displacement Tracking Matrix and qualitative interviews with key informants, the study applies a multi‐level, intersectional framework to assess personal, situational and contextual dimensions of vulnerability. It introduces a ‘continuum of vulnerability’ model, recognising that risks are dynamic, relational and shaped by structural inequalities. Quantitative analysis identifies financial insecurity, age and discrimination as key predictors of harm, whereas qualitative findings highlight the impact of conditional protection regimes, housing insecurity and healthcare barriers. Although few trafficking cases were officially identified, the findings suggest that a well‐funded and coordinated rights‐based response helped mitigate risks. The article argues that such protection frameworks must remain in place for as long as necessary and that vulnerability should be continuously monitored across all three dimensions.",

          "authors": "Rosa Maryon",
          "abstract": "In this article, I argue racialized EU externalization interacts with and reinforces the anti-Black racism within Tunisia’s border regime. I analyze EU–Tunisia relations through the lens of racial capitalism, arguing that Tunisia’s cooperation with external actors, including on migration matters, is connected to maintaining models of capitalist accumulation and punishing dissent. The aim of this contemporary cooperation is not to prevent the mobility of migrants entirely, but to limit, control, and exploit it. Both the EU and Tunisia suspend different racialized migrant groups in a situation of irregularity and precarity to create and maintain exploitable labor, while avoiding the political unpopularity of “regularizing” migrants. We are seeing the violent and deadly consequences of intensified racialized border regimes both within Europe, in the context of a contemporary crisis of neoliberalism, and in post-transition Tunisia, faced with its own overlapping social, political, and economic crises. Thus, by exploring the entanglements of racialized bordering practices that operate across the Mediterranean, I go beyond reductive state-by-state analysis, revealing EU externalization as part of a broader project of racialized bordering essential to global racial capitalism.",

          "authors": "Kristen Sarah Biehl, Didem Danis",
          "abstract": "This article examines how legal status shapes the post-disaster mobility of Syrian refugees in Turkey following the February 2023 earthquakes. While it is well established that disasters often exacerbate the vulnerabilities of displaced populations, less attention has been paid to how legal and bureaucratic regimes structure not only who can move, but also where they are permitted to go. Drawing on a review of literature on immigrants and refugees in disaster contexts and post-disaster mobility, as well as fieldwork based on in-depth interviews, we argue that legal status operates as a form of governance that constrains both mobility and its directionality. Although Syrians under Temporary Protection in Turkey possess legal status, their rights to relocate or access services are highly conditional and spatially circumscribed. The earthquake momentarily disrupted—but did not dismantle—these restrictions. The state selectively managed refugee movement, granting temporary permissions while blocking durable relocation to cities like Istanbul. Often seen as a space of refuge, Istanbul has increasingly become a site of exclusion. As such, the paper contributes to debates on legal status and mobility governance in disaster contexts.",

          "abstract": "Urban refugees increasingly resort to sit-ins outside United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) offices because they lack avenues for accountability. Our fieldwork reveals their experiences of neglect, mistreatment, and violence and the ways that these are compounded by UNHCR’s responses to protests, generating deep mistrust. Drawing on interviews with refugees in three protest sites and a workshop with legal practitioners, we document disturbing accusations, implicating UNHCR in human rights violations. We reflect on these findings and explore the possibility of transforming the agency’s accountability relations in the context of declining budgets and influence. We argue that the agency must abandon its securitized response to refugee-led protests and adopt a ‘networked accountability’ approach, engaging with the plural authorities that hold legitimacy in refugee protection. Although UNHCR is currently structurally dependent upon major donors and host states, it must embed accountability relations with refugee-led organizations (RLOs), NGOs, and legal practitioners to fulfil its mandate and protect refugees.",

          "abstract": "Several studies have analyzed the relationship between educational attainment and fertility across countries, identifying significant differences. However, these works often overlook intra‐country variation, which may play an important role in moderating that relationship. This study examines the heterogeneity in the educational gradient of fertility across Spain, a context characterized by lowest‐low and latest‐late fertility. Using data from the 2011 Spanish census, we reconstruct the reproductive history of 656,248 women aged 25–50, of whom 403,140 had become mothers. This large sample allows to analyze the educational gradient in first motherhood across Spanish provinces. To do so, we apply mixture cure models, which enable us to differentiate between the occurrence and the timing of the transition. The results reveal substantial regional variability in the educational gradient for both dimensions, although the association between the gradients in occurrence and timing is weak across space. We further find that cross‐province variation in the educational gradient in the timing of the transition is largely driven by the heterogeneous behavior of non‐university educated women, a pattern not observed for occurrence. Finally, we identify a negative association between the educational gradient and the province's GDP per capita, particularly strong for the timing of the transition.",
