          "title": "Navigating (im)mobility in an urban space: migrant’s lived experience in Kyiv/Ukraine before 2022",
          "authors": "Dobrosława Wiktor-Mach, Konrad Pędziwiatr, Olena Sobolieva",
          "abstract": "Before the full-scale war, Ukraine was one of the key origin countries for migrants seeking to move to the European Union. While considerable research has covered international migration, the understanding of how internal and international migration in Ukraine are interconnected is under-researched. The paper aims to situate the urban dimension at the core of the analysis to discuss the patterns of internal and external mobilities and their interrelatedness in pre- 2022 Ukraine. Drawing upon a recent turn in migration studies towards agency, aspirations, capabilities and decision-making, our research explores the perspectives of individuals who moved to Kyiv from other parts of the country and their future migration scenarios. Based on the fieldwork conducted in Kyiv and in its suburbs, we reveal the fluidity and complexity of migration experience and decision-making as well as the influence of interlinked factors—economic, political, social, and cultural—on mobility strategies. We demonstrate that the city plays a crucial role for migrants aspirations, capabilities and agency in decision making about further (im)mobility although in a nondeterministic way. The paper identifies four main patterns of decision-making processes among the Ukrainian internal migrants who moved to Kyiv: (1) planning to return to their places of origin, (2) considering migration within the country or abroad, (3) deciding to stay in the city and the country, (4) remaining ‘undecided.’ Furthermore, we argue that the strong emphasis on intentions to stay in Ukraine, evident during our fieldwork, has significant implications for migration patterns. This is crucial for comprehending the significant return migration of forced migrants to Ukraine during the war.",

          "title": "Renegotiating hope when stuck in Limboland: aspirations of Sub-Saharan African migrants in the urban context of Morocco",
          "authors": "Vince Yalçin",
          "abstract": "Earlier approaches to migration have largely focused on structural causes to explain why migrants move while overlooking the significance of their ability to enact agency. Yet, notions of (im)mobility, circularity and urbanity as fluid, dynamic processes of individual and collective experience, prompt an analysis of migration decision-making which emphasises migrants’ ability to actively negotiate their experienced inequalities and constraints. This paper explores how urban context impacts migrants’ decision-making processes through an analysis of their aspirations and capabilities while integrating perspectives on their ability to choose from a range of possibly (un)acceptable and/or (un)attainable alternatives, offering a more meaningful understanding of the agentic roles of migrants. Drawing from fieldwork with Sub-Saharan African migrants in urban centres in Morocco – Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Fes, and Nador – the findings suggest an inherent interlinkage between the aspirations-capabilities framework and the presence of alternatives within specific socio-urban contexts. The evidence shows the multiple alternatives at stake. Their examination suggests that (un)attainable and/or (un)acceptable alternatives deriving from one’s context may impact migrants’ aspirations and capabilities through various mediums, thus affecting their migration decision-making and (im)mobility patterns. When the urban context offered sufficient conditions to meet aspirations, the effects of alternatives were reduced, while precariousness accentuated the alternatives, making them integral to one’s decisions. Herein, the tangible aspirations-capabilities and alternatives nexus offers a window into the mediums of agency that impact migration decision-making processes.",

          "authors": "Ludger Pries",
          "abstract": "Forced migrants live and act under extremely restricted conditions, nevertheless they make their own living. To understand and explain their agency, there are inductive, usually qualitative, approaches like symbolic interactionism or biographical case reconstruction and deductive, often quantitative, methodologies like rational choice and (cap)abilities-aspirations concepts. Integrating elements of biographical and life course research, critical realism, relational constructivist and social practice approaches and based on mixed-methods data gathering and analysis we propose a model of six interrelated areas of forced migrants’ muddling through their everyday life and making choices: social entanglements/vernacularization, experiences, socialization, preferences, expectations and resources (VESPER). We first shed light on the state of related literature and discuss some concepts for understanding and explaining migrants’ agency, then explain our conceptual frame of the VESPER model and the methodology of gathering and analyzing data via biographical narrations. We illustrate how the six areas of the VESPER model interrelate in the life course of a Syrian refugee in Turkey and draw some conclusions.",

          "abstract": "What explains why people choose to stay or emigrate in the face of slow-onset climate change? We leverage an original survey of prospective migrants who are exceptionally vulnerable to threats from climate change, but who possess the freedom to legally migrate to another country with relative protection from environmental degradation. Using a conjoint experiment, we assess subjects’ latent preferences before they depart by asking them the circumstances under which they would be more likely to move, given a set of randomly varying conditions representing migration push and pull factors. Our findings show that direct climate risks play a minimal role in prospective migrant decisions, with family- and health-related considerations being much stronger drivers. Our results ground climate mobility more firmly in the context of other migration and mobility decisions, and question widespread concern about the potential for slow-onset environmental degradation to directly produce massive flows, a significant consideration for future climate refugee programs.",

          "title": "Do Birds of a Nest Flock Together? A Study of Home Provinces and Migration Paths among Filipina Domestic Workers in Hong Kong",
          "authors": "Tim F. Liao, Yasmin T. Ortiga",
          "abstract": "There is strong evidence that migration is networked. However, it is unclear whether having the same province of origin can also lead to similar migratory paths. This study investigates the question of whether a shared home province among Filipina migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong is associated with shared or linked migration paths to Hong Kong. Using a unique data source, the 2017 Survey of Migrant Domestic Workers in Hong Kong, we employed sequence analysis to identify which specific provinces exhibit stronger linkages between migratory trajectories among migrants from the same provinces and if so, whether certain provincial characteristics matter. The study found that provinces with a lower population density and a greater number of cities tend to have a higher degree of shared migration paths among women from the same provinces. More importantly, the analysis provides convincing evidence that the presence of a hometown/home province association makes it more likely for migrant domestic workers to share similar migration pathways to Hong Kong. Furthermore, provinces with direct, one-step migration paths show a higher degree of linkage compared to those with multinational migration paths with multiple intermediate destinations. These findings provide insights into the provincial factors influencing linked migratory life courses among Filipina migrant domestic workers. The research contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of migration and the interconnectedness of domestic workers’ migration paths.",

The research aims to shed light on the tribal law enforcement factors that influence the actions of USAOs in IC cases. The study utilizes the “National Caseload Data” to identify crimes that occurred in IC and whether the USAO declined to prosecute a case. The findings suggest tribes with larger law enforcement forces and external funding to improve their criminal justice system have significantly lower rates of declination. The study also examines the effects of the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) on the rates of declination of IC cases. The findings suggest there are clear differences in these effects as a function of the passage of TLOA. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the challenges and opportunities in the criminal justice system in IC.",

          "abstract": "Some theorists and practitioners argue that public schools in liberal democracies should teach students to be engaged, participatory citizens. Others argue that schools function as disciplinary training grounds, producing docile workers and obedient members of society. How can we reconcile these normatively different views? In exploring this question, we analyze school documents from a national random sample of U.S. public charter schools, examining the terms schools use most frequently and how schools discuss normative conceptions of citizenship. Using text-as-data methods and qualitative analysis, we suggest that both models appear in U.S. schools, but are implemented largely along racialized lines, with majority White schools tending to emphasize democratic values and majority non-White schools emphasizing obedience.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between internal and international migration has traditionally been overlooked in migration research. Seeking to bridge this divide, we examine the cumulative, socioeconomically selective and functionally differentiated nature of youth spatial mobility. Using harmonized microdata from two nationally representative surveys of bachelor's graduates and advanced vocational trainees from the 2013/2014 cohort, we examine the role of pre‐graduation mobility, social origin and field of study in shaping postgraduation migration outcomes. Our findings show that any form of educational mobility is a strong predictor of subsequent migration. Migration trajectories are also stratified by parental education, with graduates from more privileged backgrounds more likely to engage in international or complex mobility paths. Additionally, migration motives and patterns vary by migration type and field of study, supporting a functional differentiation between internal and international mobility. These results highlight how different forms of mobility are embedded in cumulative life‐course processes and socially structured opportunity regimes, underscoring the need for more integrated theoretical and policy approaches to youth migration.",
