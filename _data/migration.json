          "title": "Navigating migration challenges in Uganda’s West Nile borderlands: policy, practice, and governance",
          "authors": "Jussi P. Laine",
          "abstract": "Refugee integration in Uganda’s West Nile borderlands reveals how progressive national policy frameworks encounter systematic implementation constraints when deployed in complex territorial contexts. This study examines the gap between Uganda’s acclaimed refugee policies and localized realities in Yumbe and Nebbi districts along borders with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, investigating how three intersecting dynamics complicate integration: hybrid governance arrangements combining state and customary authority, infrastructural fragmentation in resource-constrained contexts, and refugee agency operating alongside formal policy structures. Through qualitative fieldwork incorporating stakeholder interviews, ethnographic observation, and secondary data analysis, the research reveals significant disjunctures between policy aspirations and implementation capacities. Findings demonstrate how initial hospitality dynamics transform into resource competition as local infrastructure becomes strained, while formal state institutions coexist with customary governance structures where traditional authorities wield substantial influence over land allocation and conflict mediation. These hybrid arrangements both facilitate and complicate integration as documented refugees, undocumented migrants, and cross-border communities compete for water, healthcare, education, and housing. The study highlights gendered displacement vulnerabilities, with women migrants facing heightened exploitation risks. This analysis contributes to forced migration scholarship by demonstrating the limitations of state-centric governance approaches in borderland contexts, where spatial specificities and institutional layering fundamentally reshape policy implementation. Policy implications emphasize strengthening coordination between governmental and traditional institutions, formalizing land tenure rights, and transitioning toward sustainable development investments that recognize refugees’ economic contributions to borderland economies.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the challenges and barriers of forced migrants at the nexus of housing and social integration, presenting the outcomes of an international and interdisciplinary collaboration funded by the JPI Urban Europe programme. Research includes the case study cities Leipzig, Lund, Riga, and Vienna, utilizing primary and secondary data in a transdisciplinary process involving theoretical discussions and urban living labs with researchers, practitioners, and civic society actors. While empirical contexts vary between cities, the persona method with vignettes adds new knowledge for a nuanced understanding. The project builds on existing expertise and broader migration studies, ensuring context-sensitivity in understanding place-based barriers to integration. It highlights cross-case similarities and significant differences affecting individual integration in European cities.",

          "authors": "Floriane Bolazzi, Ivana Fellini",
          "abstract": "The home‐country self‐employment hypothesis, widely accepted in migration research, posits that immigrants from countries with high self‐employment rates are more likely to become self‐employed. However, supporting evidence remains limited. Recent studies highlight the importance of individual pre‐migration experience, but such evidence is scarce due to data constraints and the predominance of single‐country analyses. Using unique survey data with retrospective pre‐migration employment information, this paper examines the link between pre‐and post‐migration self‐employment in Italy and Spain, two countries where self‐employment is historically widespread. We analyse both home‐country self‐employment rates and individual pre‐migration experience as determinants of immigrants' self‐employment, and we extend the analysis to overall employment outcomes. Pre‐migration self‐employment significantly increases the likelihood of self‐employment after migration but does not improve general employment prospects. By contrast, home‐country self‐employment rates show no explanatory power, while regional variations have only a minor one, underscoring the primacy of individual experience over cultural or contextual factors.",

          "authors": "Cornelius Wright Cappelen, Hakan G. Sicakkan, Pierre Georges Van Wolleghem",
          "abstract": "Asylum policies present decision-makers with a difficult trade-off between falsely rejecting deserving applicants (false negatives) and falsely accepting undeserving ones (false positives). How does the public view this dilemma? Using original survey data from 26 countries ( n = 27,429), this study provides novel evidence on public attitudes regarding these two types of errors. Our analysis reveals a complex landscape of public opinion: the largest single group of respondents (nearly 40%) considers both mistakes to be equally serious, declining to prioritize one over the other. Among those who do choose, there is a significant preference for avoiding false negatives. We find that these distinct positions are not random. Attitudes on this issue are strongly associated with overall asylum policy preferences, and key predictors such as welfare chauvinism, nativism, and political ideology systematically distinguish those who prioritize false negatives, those who prioritize false positives, and those who view both errors as equally grave. These findings highlight that public support for the international refugee regime is shaped by at least three distinct viewpoints on administrative fairness, providing crucial insights for policymaking on asylum and immigration.",

          "abstract": "Do appeals to Black voters necessarily detract white voters from supporting the left? Extant studies have yielded mixed answers to this question by examining voter turnout data. We use two survey experiments to test how framing politicians as either supportive of or hostile to the #BlackLivesMatter (BLM) and #SayHerName (SHN) movements affected the willingness of voters to support them during the 2020 Senate runoff elections in Georgia. We find that Democratic-leaning respondents in both a national sample of Black respondents and a sample of White respondents in Georgia were more likely to support politicians whom we framed as supportive of the BLM and SHN movements. These findings illustrate the potential potency of messaging strategies grounded in racial justice themes for mobilizing Democratic-leaning voters in American elections.",

          "abstract": "In Adjumani District, all 19 refugee settlements are located on land offered by local kin groups for an undetermined period of use. The concepts of sharing and exchange illuminate host community explanations about their provision of land. To the extent they were sharing, they originally availed land in solidarity with refugees. To the extent they were exchanging, they provided land as a move in a transaction with the national and local government in return for ‘development’. Increasingly, hosts are entering exchange relations with refugees who want access to more land for farming. Sharing and exchange may overlap, but the analytical distinction sheds light on moral assumptions about obligation and the changing value of land. We argue that refugee settlements contribute to the growing commodification of land. The study is based on interviews with hosts of seven different refugee settlements and selected government officials undertaken between 2018 and 2022.",

While scholars have been cautious about employing such metaphors as part of popular discourse, the role that crisis narratives play within ageing scholarship itself has received comparatively less attention. Drawing on an analysis of academic articles published in Chinese on the topic of population ageing , this article examines the scholarly use of crisis narratives, particularly in relation to labour shortages, delayed agricultural development, inadequate care facilities, pension challenges, and similar concerns. I argue that crisis narratives foster particular geographic imaginations in China, which often run counter to otherwise nuanced theorisations of ageing and care. In response, I call for writing practices that contextualise ageing within the intertwined frameworks of political economy, biopolitics, and care.",

Yet, the growing trend of students seeking degrees abroad could exacerbate these inequalities, especially if the selection for international programmes is influenced by students' academic achievements, cultural and economic capital. In this study, we utilized multilevel logistic regression on extensive administrative data to analyse the characteristics of Slovak graduates in 2018 who pursued tertiary education abroad, compared to their peers who studied at home. Our findings indicate that students with high scores from final upper secondary school examinations are more likely to study abroad. Furthermore, culturally and economically advantaged students, especially those who also excel academically, are significantly more likely to opt for international studies. These insights contribute to the global discourse by highlighting that the effect of academic performance, along with cultural and economic capital, varies. The results also show that the field of study in upper secondary education influences the likelihood of studying abroad beyond these factors. Consequently, our study suggests that policies aimed at fostering international degree mobility should account for the academic, cultural and economic backgrounds of students.",

          "authors": "S. O. Kwankye, Spencer G, E. Dankyi, J. Thompson",
          "abstract": "Young people are increasingly migrating within their own countries and across different countries to enhance their livelihoods. These migrations are often driven by economic factors, with young people seeking to take advantage of opportunities that are less available at their places of origin. At the centre of these migrations are the range of decisions young people go through, which are often not entirely taken by themselves alone. In this context, we explore via a qualitative investigation of young migrants in Accra, Ghana, the decision‐making processes these young migrants engaged in to understand the complex system of interactions involved. Data collection employed in‐depth interviews and focus group discussions among migrants of 15–24 years from within Ghana, and other neighbouring West African countries, bound together by the ECOWAS Protocol on free movement; namely, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Niger. Our findings reveal that for young migrants, ‘independent’ pre‐migration decision means less dependent on household parents but often linked to supportive roles including funds provision by their peers, parents and other close relatives abroad that concretize their final decisions to migrate. Considering the complex decision‐making processes young people traverse, our paper broadens the scope of researching young people's migration decision‐making architecture in Western Africa to be understood within the context of the New Economics of Migration Theory where migration decisions are more collectively taken to maximize income and employment opportunities while minimizing risks.",
