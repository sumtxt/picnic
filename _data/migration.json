          "title": "Governing migration in midsize cities: permanent temporariness, rigid policies and role of business",
          "authors": "Asya Pisarevskaya, Marthe Hesselmans",
          "abstract": "This paper looks at the framing of migration in low-scale, midsize cities and its implications for local governance. It seeks to deepen understanding of migration governance in these understudied contexts facing rapid ageing, labour shortages and increased migration inflows. Through this in-depth inductive study of three Dutch localities, we build upon academic literature on governance of migration in small and medium sized cities. Taking a qualitative approach based on field visits and interviews, we came across two overlooked aspects of local governance: temporality and the role of business. We found a hyper-fixation of local governance actors on migrant categories– especially labour migrants and refugees– and unrealistic assumptions about their length of stay in municipalities, as newcomers moved around more than they anticipated. The cities exhibited largely fragmented and uncoordinated policy responses to different migrant categories with only limited engagement of business actors. While companies strongly influenced the rising number of EU-labour migrants in the cities, there was little attention to these migrants’ social needs. At the same time, the labour potential of refugees remained overlooked. This paper recommends municipalities to develop a holistic vision on migration beyond rigid migrant categories, invest in robust regulation and in alliances with companies to foster newcomers’ incorporation in the local community so as to turn migration into an asset, rather than another challenge for low-scale midsize cities.",

          "authors": "Stefan Millar",
          "abstract": "Anthropological literature on future-making has highlighted the diversity of practices migrants’ can enact to realise their possible future or future-orientated projects. While such an approach has been instrumental in thinking about how futures can be collectively enacted, less interest has been given to how they might correspond to containment logics. This paper examines the collectivist forms of future-making practices and how they correspond to or resist containment logics. By tracing the life history of Lam a South Sudanese refugee, the paper explores the different practices of future-making they employ prior to and during the coronavirus pandemic. Based on twelve months of ethnographic research in Kakuma Refugee Camp Kenya and utilizing online ethnographic methods during the coronavirus pandemic, I demonstrate how combining research methods helped expose the multiple coexisting logics of containment active in Kakuma Refugee Camp. Doing so, this paper contributes to debates on future-making by illustrating its collectivist formations practiced with networks of kin and friends or used to imagine wider national futures of a state. Moreover, the paper outlines how humanitarian and state actors who enforced containment draw upon different power-inflected logics to guide their practices and relations with people on the move.",

          "authors": "Mariana Alvarado, Paula Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik, Sandra Lavenex, Philipp Lutz",
          "abstract": "Largely unnoticed by the migration literature, business migration has established itself as a form of labour migration that is substantial in terms of numbers and receives preferential treatment in international and national migration law. Intra-corporate transferees, contractual service suppliers and business visitors all fall within this category and benefit from facilitated admission procedures agreed under trade agreements and corresponding provisions in national legislation. Assigned for temporary stays and retaining their work contract in the home country, these business migrants represent a “market model” of migration policy exploiting the economic benefits of human movement while avoiding migrants’ integration into the host countries’ labour market and society. This article conceptualizes business migration at the nexus of trade law, international labour markets and migration research and uses a mix of legal analysis, population register and other statistical data as well as survey data from Switzerland to demonstrate the scale and importance of this under-investigated yet significant type of economic migration. Amounting to nearly half of the regulated labour immigration into Switzerland, business migration is strongly associated with trade and investment ties as well as the presence of multinational companies. In contrast, trade agreements facilitating this type of labour mobility have no systematic effect.",

          "authors": "Lindokuhle Denis Sibiya, Inocent Moyo",
          "abstract": "Despite the Sustainable Development Goal target 10.7.2, which aims to facilitate orderly, safe, regular, and responsible migration through implementing planned and well-managed migration policies at various government levels, this remains understudied at the local level. Using an institutional liberalism lens, this paper analyses migrant integration into municipal development planning in the city of uMhlathuze, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Following a qualitative case study approach, 20 municipal officials were interviewed, and municipal documents were reviewed to collect data analysed using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that despite the increasing number of migrants in the municipality, migration is not integrated into municipal development planning. The exclusion of international migrants from municipal planning aggravates the service delivery backlog and underscores inefficiencies in municipal planning. This study enhances knowledge and informs policy for South African policymakers and development stakeholders while elucidating how municipalities address international migration issues.",

          "authors": "Sezgi Basak Kavakli, Didar Akar",
          "abstract": "This study proposes a diachronic approach to dissecting media representations of displaced peoples in Türkiye, revealing the dynamic interplay between media discourse, public sentiment, and policies over time. Focusing on four different migration episodes—the Bulgarian Turks and Romani (1950–1951), Iraqi Kurds and Turkmens (1991), and Syrians (2014–2017; 2022–2023)—and presenting findings from a corpus of news texts from two mainstream Turkish newspapers printed over 66 years, it unravels the temporal evolution of narratives surrounding forcibly displaced people and their implications for societal attitudes and legislative actions. In addition to reporting the historical trajectories of reference terms, their frequencies and collocates, we also present extracts illustrating the narratives and themes surrounding the displaced peoples. The diachronic lens we develop as an extension to the discourse historical approach offers insights into the genesis and progression of discourse, allowing us to compare the framing of displaced people from different groups over decades. Our findings reveal that preferential treatment of displaced people is reflected in the naming of displaced people in the news media, fostering environments of societal inclusion or exclusion of migrants. In light of our findings, we argue that a new news‐media policy is needed; one that oversees the equitable representation of migrants in the news.",

          "authors": "Luc Leboeuf",
          "abstract": "The article addresses the consequences of the externalisation of EU border policies on the legal and institutional dynamics that govern those policies. Drawing on the analysis of legal and policy documents and interviews, which were conducted with expert public servants among EU institutions and in one EU member state (Belgium), the article argues that EU border policies are increasingly governed by ‘regimes of invisibility’—which mainly involve expert public servants who cooperate with their counterparts in informal settings and through informal agreements. The article shows how the emergence of those ‘regimes of invisibility’ is deeply connected with the mainstreaming of migration through all components of the EU foreign policy. This leads to broader use of the tools from the foreign policy toolbox, which often rely on informal forms of cooperation, as well as to greater involvement of institutional actors beyond officials within interior ministries, such as diplomats. The article further makes an initial attempt to unpack these ‘regimes of invisibility’ by showing their underlying institutional tensions and dynamics. Therefore, it discusses how public servants, with different institutional background and knowledge, conflict and cooperate in shaping EU relations with third countries in the field.",

          "abstract": "Previous literature on Latinx immigrants in the US mostly focuses on the negative effects of fear of deportation on this population. However, limited studies highlight coping resources that can mitigate the fear of deportation. This quantitative study, through logistic regression and conservation of resource theory, explored how resilience and social support may influence fear of deportation among 130 rural Latina immigrant mothers in a Midwestern state. Findings revealed that resilience, receiving emotional support from family members, and earned income were associated with lower fear of deportation among Latina mothers in the study. Additionally, other types of social support, such as providing instrumental support to people outside of their household and receiving emotional support from friends, were associated with higher levels of fear of deportation among the mothers.",

          "authors": "Shugang Fan, Miao Xia, Pengyue Jia",
          "abstract": "China's population development faces low birth rates, prompting the introduction of a three‐child policy that impacts the fertility intentions of the childbearing‐age population. However, research on fertility intention is predominantly concentrated in the developed eastern regions, with limited studies focusing on the socioeconomic dynamics in the less‐represented northwest, such as Gansu Province. This region, with its unique socioeconomic challenges, presents a critical case for understanding fertility intentions in China's current policy context. Based on cross‐sectional data from the 2022 fertility intention survey of 79270 childbearing‐age individuals in Gansu Province, the fertility intention and influencing factors of the childbearing‐age population are analyzed. The study found that the fertility intention of people of childbearing‐age is influenced by a combination of economic, social and demographic factors, among which economic factors are the most critical. Middle‐income groups exhibit stronger fertility intentions, while both high‐ and low‐income groups show reduced procreative preferences due to career priorities and economic constraints, respectively. Improved education levels and enhanced social security lead childbearing‐age populations to prioritize personal development; however, women's fertility intentions are constrained by unemployment risks. Contrary to previous studies, this study reveals that fertility intentions increase with age, suggesting that middle‐aged individuals with stable careers and incomes may represent a key target for policy interventions. Additionally, factors such as gender, education level, workplace, and marital status significantly influence fertility intentions.",

          "authors": "Alfredo Miceli, Başak Bilecen",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of family ties on mobility and immobility decisions within the Reventino‐Savuto area of Calabria, Italy. Recognizing the significant impact of family connections on migration dynamics, the research explores how these ties act as both motivators for relocation and deterrents against moving. By providing emotional, financial and practical support, family networks shape individual decisions to either migrate or remain in place. The Reventino‐Savuto area, characterized by ageing populations, declining residency rates and deteriorating infrastructure, exemplifies the challenges faced by marginalized regions targeted by Italy's National Strategy for Inner Areas. Through qualitative interviews with residents, this research uncovers the role of familial ties in shaping mobility patterns. The theoretical framework highlights the dual role of family ties as both ‘anchors’ rooting individuals to a place and ‘beacons’ attracting them to migrate closer to family members, particularly during critical life events. The study reveals how family obligations, such as caregiving for elderly parents, often outweigh economic opportunities, influencing internal migration decisions. Furthermore, the interplay between informal family support and formal social services underscores the importance of family networks in providing essential care and bridging gaps in formal healthcare systems. The findings demonstrate that the decision to migrate or remain is a complex interplay of personal aspirations, available resources and family obligations. Family ties emerge as a crucial determinant of geographical proximity among relatives, influencing both mobility and immobility.",

          "authors": "Margherita Odasso, Agnese Vitali, Giuseppe Sciortino, Martina Cvajner",
          "abstract": "This article studies the association between transnational parenthood, that is, mothers and fathers who have migrated, leaving at least one child in the country of origin, and well‐being among first‐generation immigrants in Italy. Transnational households have been researched mostly through qualitative interviews and ethnographies. This paper uses nationally representative data for Italy from the Survey on Social Condition and Integration of Foreign Citizens (2011–2012), therefore enabling to generalise findings from the sample to the national population of (regular) migrants. Results show that transnational parents are more likely to have poorer life satisfaction and mental health compared to migrants whose children are in Italy. The association remains significant even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, time since migration, and area of origin. The well‐being gap further increases if the children abroad are under 12 years old. Migrants with poor contact with their children are particularly at risk for poor mental health and low life satisfaction. The result underlines the relevance of reaffirming parental social presence to contrast the negative implications of physical distance on well‐being. Importantly, the negative association between distance parenting and well‐being holds not only for women, as found by previous literature, but also for men. This finding challenges the image of fathers as uncaring, supporting recent contributions that emphasise the complexity of the phenomenon of transnational fatherhood.",

          "abstract": "Condominium purchases are a major financial expenditure for returned migrant workers, and condominium location selection is the most important spatial process of farmers' residential behavior. Based on first‐hand field survey data, this study focuses on the locations of condominiums purchased by returned migrant workers and the factors affecting their location selection using statistical analysis and multilevel, multivalue logistic regression analysis. The study shows that, first, the condominiums purchased by returned migrant workers are mainly in county towns, followed by market towns and regional central cities. Second, the distance thresholds of purchased condominiums are distributed hierarchically, the thresholds of market towns, county towns and central cities are 5, 30, and 60 km, respectively, and most condominiums purchased at the same level are concentrated at these distances. Third, the main factors affecting condominium location selection are personal factors, such as marriage, educational background, working years and gender; family factors, such as economic status, household size, and labor force; and community factors, such as return ratio, terrain, and urban distance. In the equilibrium determined by capital and distance, prospective purchasers make a bounded rational choice of condominium location. The study results provide implications for China's local urbanization and real estate sales and planning.",
