          "title": "Thinking alike, acting alike? An assessment of organizational homophily and paradigmatic pragmatism in networks for local integration policies",
          "authors": "Diels Elien, Oosterlynck Stijn",
          "abstract": "As migrant integration policies touch upon almost all spheres of citizens’ life, collaboration across policy levels as well as across policy domains is needed. Over time, a series of both policy and analytical paradigms on the integration of migrants emerged, going from the traditional ideas of differentialism and assimilation, over multiculturalism, interculturalism, integrationism, liberal egalitarianism and mainstreaming, up to superdiversity and intersectionality. While networks for integration policies are likely to be at least partly driven by these paradigms, recent studies seem to nuance this assumption based on so called paradigmatic pragmatism, meaning that cities draw on a variety of ideas and pragmatically combine them under the header of diversity policies. The need for multi-level and multi-actor governance on migrant integration, the theoretical knowledge about homophily in organizational networks, and the recent findings on paradigmatic pragmatism, raise the question to what extent collaboration between public and non-profit organizations active around migrant integration is based on a shared policy paradigm on the integration of migrants. This question is answered based on a multiple case study of four central cities in Flanders (Belgium), covering 1.403 organizations. In the quantitative and qualitative (social network) analyses, comparisons along both the axes of cities and policy domains are made. Findings contribute to literature on organizational homophily, showing that clustering of organizations is likely to be at least partly driven by policy paradigm on integration. This is however nuanced by the observation that policy paradigms appear to be ambiguous, which in turn reveals opportunities for more flexible collaborations between actors and for avoiding deadlocks in policy making.",

          "title": "Democracy, visa-waivers, and international mobility",
          "authors": "Ugur Altundal, Omer Zarpli",
          "abstract": "In examining visa-waiver agreements, previous studies have primarily focused on economic motivations and effects. In this article, we explore the potential political motivations and consequences. Particularly, we propose that there is a positive relationship between visa-waivers and democracy. We test this using a global dataset that records bilateral travel visa requirements for all countries between 1973 and 2013. We find support for our main hypothesis. We also examine the relationship between democracy, visa waivers and economic development. Contrary to our expectations, we find that democracy continues to exert influence on visa waivers even at high levels of income. Non-democracies fail to attain visa waivers even when they are wealthy. Finally, we explore whether visa waivers could have an impact on individuals’ attitudes towards democracy. Using survey data from 18 Latin American countries, we find suggestive evidence that that visa-waivers can have a positive impact on individuals’ democratic attitudes. Taken together, the findings suggest that democracy and visa-waivers might have a mutually reinforcing relationship.",

          "title": "Venezuelans in Peru: Adaptation attitudes, optimism and relations with host society",
          "authors": "Marcin Stonawski",
          "abstract": "By August 2023, the global population of Venezuelan migrants and refugees had reached 7.7 million. This constitutes one of the world largest migration movements in the recent decades and is arguably the most significant one in the context of South–South migration. This paper investigates adaptation attitudes of Venezuelan migrants as well as the attitudes towards their adaptation among Peruvian neighbours living in Peru. Furthermore, we explore the importance of optimism and intergroup relations for the adaptation attitudes. For this purpose, we designed and conducted a survey among Venezuelan migrants and their Peruvian neighbours in Peru between April and May 2023. Significant differences in adaptation attitudes were identified between migrants and their native neighbours. Venezuelans exhibited a greater proclivity towards positive adaptation whereas their neighbours demonstrated a tendency to marginalize or separate migrants. This can potentially lead to give rise to heightened conflict between two populations, thereby becoming a significant factor driving further migration of Venezuelans to other countries. However, optimism emerged as significant factor in shaping adaptation attitudes across both populations.",

          "abstract": "Turkey has received a large influx of Syrian refugees since the start of Syrian civil war in 2011. Integration and social cohesion have become important issues for public policy in Turkey. We study social cohesion among young Turkish nationals and Syrian refugees. Our study sample comprises of adolescents and young adults (12–30 years), and children (6–11 years) who participated in events of the “Education Program for Syrian Refugees and Host Communities” (BILSY) program conducted by the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ). Social cohesion among adolescents and young adults is measured along three dimensions: sense of belonging, trust, and relational capacity. For children, we use behavioural games to measure two dimensions of social cohesion – altruism and trust. Our results show high social cohesion for both age groups, though lack of trust among Turkish nationals towards Syrian nationals is an area of concern. We also evaluate the impact of participation in BILSY program events using a randomised design and find that it had no impact on social cohesion. Our article adds to the limited literature on social cohesion among children and youths in countries affected by forced displacement.",

          "title": "A geographic and social profile of Italy's great migration (1876–1913)",
          "authors": "Francesca Fauri, Giancarlo Gasperoni",
          "abstract": "This article sheds light on Italian emigration flows with a focus on their geographical origins in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that is, during the so‐called Great Migration. Annual province‐level data on Italian emigration are analysed in order to reconstruct the regional origins of emigrants, the factors motivating their decisions, their gender, and their literacy levels. The regions generating the largest population outflows were located in the North of the country. Despite the literature's focus on the Italian south diaspora to the US, the main destinations of Italian emigration in this period were other European countries. Explanations focusing on economic factors as emigration drivers prove weak. The provinces generating the greatest outflows do not appear to share any characteristics nor obey any underlying pattern: some tentative explanations concerning provinces of origin will be offered. Data relating to the emigration of women and children point to the central role of nuclear families, displaying a higher rate of growth compared to overall emigration, with peaks during the migration booms to Latin America (1890s) and the United States (1905–1907). No obvious connection emerges between emigrant outflow size and literacy levels: people migrated from the literate North as well as from the more impoverished regions featuring much lower literacy levels.",

          "authors": "Justin Gest, Michael John Gigante, Neslihan Kaptanoğlu, Ian M Kysel, Lucas Núñez",
          "abstract": "To what extent do national governments protect the human rights of migrants, and what are the political and economic circumstances associated with more robust protection? To address these questions, we leverage a rigorous, novel database of migrant rights derived from international laws and standards. We evaluate the extent to which 64 indicators—divided into 17 different categories of migrant rights—appear in national statute and case law in 45 of the world's principal destination states. We find that 61% of the indicators of migrant rights in the Migrant Rights Database, derived from the international human rights baseline, are reflected in the letter of national law—nearly two out of every three. However, we also find that national authorities implement these de jure protections 71% of the time. Taken together, about 44% of migrant rights are both protected and implemented in the countries examined. In a correlational analysis, we find that governments tend to protect more rights when their countries are more democratic, maintain more independent judiciaries, protect more rights in their constitutions, ratify more human rights treaties, permit stronger civil society, and are characterized by more political stability. There is also a weak trade-off between de jure migrant rights protections and the number of migrants a country admits.",

          "title": "Externally Driven Border Control in West Africa: Local Impact and Broader Ramifications",
          "authors": "Cathrine Talleraas",
          "abstract": "Over the last two decades and with notable increase since 2015, millions of euros have been invested in territorial border governance in West Africa. Targeting migration policy frameworks, capacity building, and the provision of material, the EU and individual European states have sought to improve control mechanisms along these vast and porous borders. This article explores the local impact and broader ramifications of primarily externally funded policy efforts as they are implemented along Ghana's three international borders with Burkina Faso, Côte D’Ivoire, and Togo. Drawing on observations at official checkpoints and interviews with border control officers and border crossers, the article finds that recent initiatives have facilitated the modernization, expansion, and professionalization of border control. Yet, these enhancements have concurrently led to increased reliance on external support, altered local social relations in border checkpoint areas, and triggered the criminalization of legal emigration. The article situates these developments within its geopolitical landscape, illustrating how externally driven migration governance, when detached from local realities, yields both immediate and far-reaching ramifications. Drawing on and extending critical migration governance analysis and border theory, this study underscores the importance of scrutinizing not only explicit, but also the more subtle and rippling effects of European externalization policies in Africa, as they extend beyond local contexts to influence wider societal structures.",
