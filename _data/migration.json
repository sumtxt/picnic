          "authors": "Alice Massari",
          "abstract": "As images of international mobility circulate quickly and widely through digital and social media, they form a fundamental part of the discursive formations around border policies and material migration practices. Through a multi-modal visual analysis of the Twitter images accompanying the post of the four major migration institutions in the EU and Canada, this article explores in a comparative perspective how their visual narratives interact with the broader migration narrative across the two contexts. The study findings show that EUAA, FRONTEX, CBSA, and IRCC participate in the border spectacle as leading actors, and their visual communication while allows them to reinforce some of their respective migration governance key messages and display their multiple organizational identities at the same time enables the concealment of some of the critical themes of the EU and Canada migration governance.",

          "title": "Assessing the impact of migration on the happiness of household women left behind: evidence from Punjab, Pakistan",
          "authors": "Noshaba Aziz, Ali Raza, Shaoxiong Yang, Jin Zhou",
          "abstract": "The concept of happiness is becoming an increasingly significant area of focus in the evaluation of overall quality of life. This research examines the impact of migration on the well-being of women who remain in their place of residence following the migration of their family members. The study employs data from the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (2017–2018) in Punjab, Pakistan, and addresses sample selection bias through Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Moreover, as the dependent variable is ordinal, the study employed ordered logistic regression to examine the correlation between migration and happiness, taking into account migration status and other variables. The findings indicate that women from migrant backgrounds tend to benefit from migrating, primarily in terms of enhanced financial resources. In order to gain insight into the varying effects of migration on women’s happiness, the study employed heterogeneity analysis, which revealed that the influence of migration on women’s happiness differs across various areas. In conclusion, the combination of propensity score matching (PSM) with ordered logistic regression and heterogeneity analysis represents a robust methodology for evaluating the impact of migration on women’s perceptions of happiness. The study demonstrates that migration has the potential to improve the quality of life of women who remain in their home countries, particularly those residing in financially disadvantaged households.",

          "authors": "Exequiel Cabanda, Brenda S. A. Yeoh, Kristel A. F. Acedera, Margaret Walton‐Roberts",
          "abstract": "Many scholars have used neoliberalism as an analytical framework to examine the Philippines' labour export policy. While neoliberalism entails a retreat of the state in favour of market reforms, evidence shows that state intervention of the market becomes larger and stronger over time. This paper utilises liberal neo‐statism as an alternative framework to understand the Philippines' nurse labour export by explaining that the state's role is larger than and goes beyond labour brokerage. Following the historical institutionalism approach, we show the significant timing, sequence, and path dependence that affect the emergence of institutions that govern the Philippines' nurse labour export. Our paper reveals how specific policies and regulations in labour export are tucked within the disguise of market reforms, but which are manifest within a larger state's control. These policies serve as the state's apparatus for remittance generation and protection of migrant labour rights and welfare.",

          "title": "Revealing the power of informal social support: Impact on rural migrants' entrepreneurial income",
          "authors": "Guanghao Wu, Jiajia Li, Yuan Tian, Jingting Yu",
          "abstract": "Entrepreneurship is a typical socially embedded activity and informal social support reflects the functional manifestation of unique social relationships among rural migrants. Given the limited attention in existing research, we employed data from the nationally representative China Labor‐force Dynamics Survey to investigate the impact and mechanism of informal social support on rural migrants' entrepreneurial income. We found that informal social support and its sub‐dimensions (instrumental and emotional support) significantly positively affect rural migrants' entrepreneurial income. A series of endogeneity and robustness tests substantiate this conclusion. Mechanism analysis suggests that these effects occur through the enhancement of entrepreneurial passion and mental health. Furthermore, using a cutting‐edge machine learning method (generalised random forests) to determine the basis for variable selection in heterogeneity testing, the results reveal that industry and age have the highest importance. Subsequent analysis shows that the above effects were more significant among rural migrant entrepreneurs in labour‐intensive industries and the younger generation. Finally, the theoretical and practical significance of this study has been discussed.",

          "title": "Public attitudes towards immigrants: A curious case of Croatia",
          "authors": "Zan Strabac, Marko Valenta, David Andreas Bell",
          "abstract": "The Croatian population has been subjected to violent ethnic conflicts during the war in the 1990s and has more recently experienced large‐scale irregular and refugee migrations, as well as a notable increase in regular labour migration. Using data from the most recent wave of the European Social Survey, we have conducted an analysis of Croatian attitudes towards immigrants. Our study found that, despite Croatia's history of ethnic conflict and ongoing changes in its migration system, the Croatian population still exhibits relatively low levels of negative attitudes towards immigrants compared to other Eastern European countries. With regards to individual determinants of attitudes, one of the biggest surprizes is that political party preferences play a minor role in explaining attitudes towards immigrants. We discuss our findings and conclude that there is an urgent need for better theoretical and empirical framework for understanding illiberal tendencies in Eastern European societies, particularly within the current context of rapidly worsening security situation in Europe.",
