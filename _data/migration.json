          "abstract": "This paper qualitatively probed the risk framing, mitigation and resilience strategies of irregular migrants in a bid to unravel the paradox of how such actors, perceived to be poor and as such may lack ideational and financial agency, with no guarantees of success, can (persistently) operationalize and undertake costly, illegal and dangerous international journeys. Drawing on responses from Europe‐based, deported and prospective first‐time irregular migrants either hailing from or domiciled in the Bono East, Bono and Ahafo Regions of Ghana, the findings of this study demonstrate that all three categories of respondents were risk‐neutral, had risk mitigation and resilient strategies enabled by, among others, involvement in informal/illegal solidaristic economic ventures, the utilization of extended family associational norms, trust in the efficacy of irregular migration service providers as against that of foreign missions and faith in providence.",

It combines quantitative analysis of demographic and economic variables with qualitative interviews to explore the factors that drive migration considerations. The findings show that economically disadvantaged individuals are less likely to migrate due to concerns about social costs, while wealthier individuals are more inclined to move. Contrary to expectations, social capital, remittances, and overseas networks play a limited role in encouraging migration, often reinforcing the decision to stay. These results challenge existing migration theories and highlight the need to consider Moldova's unique socio‐economic context when analyzing migration aspirations.",

          "authors": "Katerina Glyniadaki, Nora Ratzmann, Julia Stier",
          "abstract": "International organizations and foreign‐funded NGOs run campaigns in Senegal to raise awareness of the perils of irregular migration. To increase their effectiveness, these organizations often enlist local migrant returnees to share their personal migration experiences and transmit an anti‐irregular migration message to their compatriots. This article examines whether policymakers' assumptions regarding the representativeness of migrant returnees operating as (anti‐)migration messengers in terms of shared identities corresponds to reality at the street level. It draws from theories of street‐level bureaucracy and representative bureaucracy and is based on 31 qualitative interviews with migrant returnees and experts. The study shows that migrant returnees engaged in migration information campaigns are not as representative of the local population as envisaged by policymakers, potentially impacting policy outcomes. They stand out from their compatriots in terms of skillsets and social status – partly because of the selection mechanism employed by organizations and partly because of the training and capacity‐building efforts directed at migrant returnees.",

          "authors": "Lilach Lev Ari, Arie Herscovici",
          "abstract": "This research focuses on various social integration patterns, as perceived by both Eritrean asylum seekers and professionals from NGOs and the Tel Aviv municipality who assist them. The study explores various theoretical concepts such as social exclusion, adaptation, incorporation, and integration in the context of migrants' interaction with the host society. These concepts traditionally suggest a linear progression; however, our findings indicate a more complex and dynamic social process. This is exemplified by the “differential exclusion model”: Namely, a situation where immigrants are incorporated into specific sectors of society but are excluded from others. Employing a qualitative research approach, the study involved semi‐structured interviews with 10 Eritrean asylum seekers and 11 Israeli professionals. The main findings indicate that due to help from professionals who work with them and other Israeli friends or employers, the Eritreans' sense of belonging‐feeling “at home,” is rather strong. However, Eritrean social networks appear to be quite loose and weak, and the strength of their community seems to have lost its leaders to other host countries, according to both Eritrean and professional perceptions. Although Tel Aviv serves as a partial resettlement “world city,” maintaining the differential exclusion model policy, as perceived by both groups of interviewees, the broader Israeli government policy offers even fewer opportunities for social integration. Given the prolonged state of uncertainty faced by this forced migrant community, the study concludes that it is imperative for they will be granted formal legal status, which might facilitate better social integration and inclusion for Eritrean asylum seekers and their children in Tel Aviv or Israel.",

          "title": "Digital Nomadism and the Emergence of Digital Nomad Visas: What Policy Objectives Do States Aim to Achieve?",
          "authors": "Hari KC, Anna Triandafyllidou",
          "abstract": "Digital nomads who travel internationally while working remotely with digital technologies constitute a small but increasing migrant population that has attracted significant research attention lately. Since 2020, there is also a corresponding rise of “digital nomad” visas adopted by several countries around the world to cater for this type of global mobility and even to attract digital nomads. This paper reviews the resurgence of digital nomadism and a concomitant emergence of digital nomad visas to analyze how and why they emerged. The findings allow for categorizations of such policies in terms of their heterogeneity of designs, objectives, and implications. Our findings reveal that the states offering digital nomad visas have designed their visas either through creating a brand new or an adaptive policy approach — the choice of the policy design approach explains the states’ policy priorities. Our analysis shows that digital nomad visas are motivated by three broader socioeconomic interests of the visa issuing countries which include the promotion of tourism, attraction of foreign investments and entrepreneurship, and talent acquisition through a migration policy model. Furthermore, the digital nomad visas invoke the notion of “hypermobility” and permeability of state borders in light of widespread adoptions of digital technologies in work and employment; however, there are paradoxes and contradictions embedded within these policies which manifest through restrictive and exclusionary criteria based on wealth, skills, and nationality. The paper concludes with some critical observations on the novelty of digital nomad visas as a novel migration regime.",

          "authors": "Zack Zimbalist",
          "abstract": "Contrary to narratives in the media, most African migrants move across borders within the continent, and most often to other countries in their immediate region. Drawing on a sample of roughly 43,000 people from 36 African countries, this article uses multilevel models to investigate the factors influencing support for either free cross-border movement or government restrictions on immigration. In contrast to previous studies, this article illuminates the substantial importance of regional economic communities within Africa and associated policies around mobility and labor market integration. Empirically, the quantitative results demonstrate that individual support for open borders is significantly higher in regional blocs with well-established free movement protocols and supportive policies, compared to those residing in blocs with more restrictive mobility and labor market integration policies. To better understand the country-level variation within these blocs, I draw on secondary literature to highlight the importance of certain economic, demographic, and security considerations, which likely both shape and reflect citizens’ attitudes toward open borders. This is a novel contribution to the public attitudes toward immigration policy literature, which has neglected the importance of regional frameworks even though they are a crucial instrument in determining national-level migration and integration policy within Africa and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Dual citizenship provides access to secure legal status and rights in more than one country for an unprecedented number of migrants and their descendants worldwide. While this double allegiance requires matching legal regulations between two states, existing studies of dual citizenship typically focus on migrant origin or destination perspectives. To explore this phenomenon's dyadic nature, we introduce a procedure that leverages existing monadic data on two distinct types of dual citizenship restrictions: origin country restrictions on the loss of citizenship by citizens naturalizing abroad and destination country restrictions requiring foreigners acquiring citizenship in a country to renounce any other citizenship. We add novel data on dyad-specific regulations in place in nearly 13 thousand country-country-year combinations. This results in a global panel dataset of the regulation of dual citizenship in 1.8 million directed dyad-year observations in place between 201 states back to 1960. An open access replication script allows reproducing and updating the dyadic dataset with new available data. We identify regulatory trends and present estimates of the number and proportion of global migrants affected by changing policy constellations and variation in acceptance across political regimes. We show that migrants are more likely to acquire destination country citizenship and thus achieve democratic representation in constellations where they can maintain a legal link with their origin country.",

          "authors": "Michael Sinnige, Laura Cleton, Arjen Leerkes",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, scholars documented the rise of enforced return in the Global North and scrutinised the vast infrastructure, international diplomacy and in‐country measures that set out to boost these. One such way is by promoting so‐called ‘Assisted Voluntary Returns’: programs in which rejected asylum seekers allegedly have ample opportunity to decide on and effectuate return themselves. This article builds upon scholarly critiques of such programs and aims to destabilise the purported binary between ‘voluntary’ and ‘forced’ return. By comparing predictors for ‘voluntary’ return and forced removal outcomes, we provide empirical evidence for the existence of a ‘spectrum of (in)voluntariness’. Centring our empirical analysis on the Netherlands, we use a unique multilevel dataset with data from various governmental agencies and other sources. Our findings indicate a significant overlap in the policy and non‐policy determinants for both ‘voluntary’ return and forced removal outcomes. Intergovernmental policy determinants only partially explain forced removal outcomes, whereas age, family composition and the situation in migrants' countries of citizenship are of major importance. These findings, therefore, have significant implications for both academic research into enforced return outcomes and for public policy.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically engages with the spatial assumptions that underpin migration studies, highlighting a shift from an absolute view of space to a relational spatial perspective, influenced by transnational and translocal migration studies. While the latter emphasises the interconnectedness of migrants across borders and the fleeting translocal links involved in the production of places, this paper argues that a timeplace perspective, which sees places as products of temporally entangled, partially inertial and plastic connectivities, material objects, and discursive practices, can contribute to overcome dichotomies between process and product in migration studies. Using the case of Åsele municipality in northern Sweden, the paper illustrates how a timeplace perspective can enrich the understanding of migration dynamics, and potentially reconcile tensions between essentialist and fluid worldviews in migration scholarship. Ultimately, it suggests that a plastic and contextual understanding of space might be the next logical step for migration studies.",

This paper investigates an aspect less explored by previous research, namely how labour mobility patterns are passed on across immigrant generations. Using Euro Area household‐level data, we compare mobility patterns of first‐ and 1.5‐generation immigrants and natives. We observe that 1.5‐generation immigrants have a significantly lower interregional and international mobility compared to first‐generation immigrants but are more mobile than natives. Our results suggest that not only first‐generation immigrants but also their descendants contribute to labour market flexibility.",
