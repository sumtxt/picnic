          "title": "Strangers in paradise? The wellbeing of migrant professionals across professional and personal environments",
          "authors": "Gregor Schäfer, Miguel Morillas",
          "abstract": "Highly skilled migration is increasing both in absolute terms and as a relative share of international migration. The increasing number of migrant professionals (MPs) raises questions about the consequences of their migration - for themselves, for society and for the employing companies. While the wellbeing of different occupational groups is well researched, the wellbeing of migrant professionals remains understudied. In particular, migration studies have not yet captured the implications of migrant professionals’ wellbeing. We theorise an understanding of wellbeing that integrates both professional (workplace) and personal (family and non-work socialisation) dimensions. Following Allardt’s conceptualisation of wellbeing as ‘Having, Loving, Being’, we answer the question of how and what affects migrants’ subjective wellbeing in their professional and personal spaces. We show how the professional-personal interface is defined in the context of transnational labour mobility. To do so, we draw on our unique sample of 42 two-stage interviews with 21 MPs recruited from abroad to high-level positions in Danish companies. We identify four key factors that affect migrants’ wellbeing at the intersection of their professional and personal lives: 1) social alienation at work, 2) professional autonomy, 3) work-leisure balance, and 4) perceptions of equality and meritocracy. Our work is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that shape migrant professionals’ wellbeing in the context of their personal and professional lives.",

          "title": "Pluralist diversity governance: deepening the multiculturalism-interculturalism nexus",
          "authors": "F. Mansouri, A. Elias",
          "abstract": "As super-diversity becomes a normalized socio-demographic fact in contemporary societies, the issue of managing its complex manifestations has become a salient feature of academic and policy debates around the world. Recently, these debates have particularly centred on what would constitute an optimal approach to managing group diversity and intercultural relations, in a context of global migration challenges, pandemic-related inequalities, rising levels of racism, and international conflicts. While much of the recent literature has focused on whether the two dominant approaches, multiculturalism and interculturalism, offered distinct alternatives, there has been little agreement so far, both at the theoretical and policy levels, on the specific direction future diversity governance should take. This article critically examines this contested discourse by reframing diversity as a multi-layered state of being and knowing, that can be understood beyond mere factual differences among ethno-cultural groups. This reframing is pursued by laying out an interactive framework between the hardware and software of pluralism, centred around key normative articulations in relation to cultural recognition, social justice, intergroup solidarity, and political representation. Such a multi-level approach envisages intercultural understanding being realized not against but within a broader of multicultural context and policy setting.",

          "title": "Parenting from Abroad: Transnational Separation from a Child and Mental Health Among Immigrants in France",
          "authors": "Claudia Brunori",
          "abstract": "Restrictive immigration policies, financial concerns and/or cultural preferences often lead families to separate across borders in the migration process. This transnational family separation, which often lasts years, can potentially have long lasting negative consequences on migrant parents’ mental health. Qualitative research has documented that transnational parents often report feelings of guilt, sadness and loneliness due to the separation, and that financial or legal precarity can exacerbate these feelings. On the other hand, quantitative research on this topic is scarce, mostly based on relatively small samples and on cases studies of single origin groups in single destination countries, has measured transnational parents’ mental health disadvantage using less than ideal control groups, and has not investigated potential long-lasting consequences of separation after reunification. In this article, I contribute to this literature using data from the French survey Trajectoires et Origines 2 to investigate differences in propensity to have experienced depression symptoms between transnational immigrant parents, parents who migrated with their children, and immigrant parents who reunited with their children after a period of transnational separation. I additionally look at heterogeneities by gender, age of the children, legal status, employment, and partnership dissolution. I find that transnational parents have significantly worse mental health than immigrants who migrated with their children, especially when the separation involves young children. The mental health of formerly transnational parents does not differ significantly from that of parents who migrated with their children, suggesting the absence of lasting effects of separation after reunification.",

          "title": "Mothering from the Margins: Ethnographic Reflections on the Gendered Politics of Rohingya Mothers in India",
          "authors": "Raksha Gopal",
          "abstract": "This article analyses the everyday experiences of stateless Rohingya refugee women mothering and raising families within refugee settlements in Delhi. Centering the narratives of refugee women, I argue that motherhood is a site for the governance of migration, where insecurities are felt and agency may be expressed. First, I illustrate the tensions between the gendered expectations on Rohingya mothers — rooted in intersecting social, cultural and familial norms — and the insecurities they face as a result of their displacement in India. These gendered expectations increase women's caregiving and social reproduction responsibilities while simultaneously limiting their mobility, access to employment, resources, and social support. Secondly, I demonstrate how Rohingya mothers continuously negotiate a sense of security for themselves and their children against the insecurities engendered by formal governance systems of the Indian State. Finally, I explore how non-state humanitarian organizations and NGOs play a crucial role in the governance of refugee women, shaping not only their access to resources and aid but also women's identities and roles as mothers. As a result, Rohingya women become key actors linking state and non-state governance to the everyday practices of motherhood.",

          "authors": "Xin Zhang, William A. V. Clark, Dongxue Wu",
          "abstract": "China's fertility continues to decline. Identifying the underlying explanations for that decline involves multiple and interwoven threads which we explore with data from the China household finance survey (CHFS). We examine the declining fertility in China through the lens of urban‐rural transformations, and synthesize the roles of women's education, women's labor market participation and child‐raising costs, and suggest that China is a distinctive variant of the second demographic transition. The analysis shows that urbanization and the convergence of rural and urban fertility levels have been key drivers of the overall decline in fertility rates. And it confirms what we have long known that women's education and labor market participation both negatively impact the likelihood of having children. The study also suggests that intergenerational support can serve as a basis for effective policy interventions to address China's declining fertility rate.",

          "title": "Spatial Inequalities in the Completeness of Under Five Deaths: Assessing Vital Registration Data in Türkiye",
          "authors": "Şahin Bingöl, Andrea Verhulst, Alanur Çavlin, Michel Guillot",
          "abstract": "The neonatal, infant and under‐5 mortality rates are important indicators of child health used by countries to monitor their health policies and for international comparisons. Coverage and completeness of registration systems are critical for the quality of these indicators. However, under registration of deaths is still a major problem today, especially where registration systems are still in the process of being established, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. In the last two decades, Türkiye stands out with its rapidly declining child and infant mortality, as well as its developing VR system. However, the completeness of under‐5 deaths in the VR system in Türkiye has not been fully evaluated yet. The fact that the regions in Türkiye that are disadvantaged in terms of early‐age mortality are less populated poses the risk of neglecting areas that need more investment and improvement in child mortality and data quality. In this study, we assess the completeness of under‐5 deaths at the national and regional levels by using a recently developed model for estimating under‐5 mortality by detailed age. We apply this model at both the national and regional levels to assess the completeness of under‐5 deaths in the VR system of Türkiye from 2009 to 2022. The results confirm the presence of early death omission in the eastern regions at the beginning of the studied period, for which we propose a correction. The prediction of the model also indicates a strong improvement over time in the completeness of death registration in these regions. This study stresses the importance of revealing regional disadvantages rather than relying on national progress in the completeness of under five deaths, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries where registration systems are still in the process of being established.",
