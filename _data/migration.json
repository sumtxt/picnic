          "title": "Women on the move? Mainstreaming gender in policies and legal frameworks addressing climate-induced migration",
          "authors": "Diogo Andreolla Serraglio, Fanny Thornton",
          "abstract": "Climate change impacts are gendered. This is also true for climate-induced migration, which affects men and women differently. On account of this difference, legal instruments and policies seeking to address and support climate-induced migration need to be gender-focused to address differentiated needs and outcomes. This paper looks at existing policies and legal instruments for the inclusion of gender aspects of climate-related migration. We focus on Ethiopia, India, and Peru, all of them with developed instruments to address the human mobility-climate change nexus. We investigate the scope of provisions concerning gender in relevant instruments in the three country contexts, their likely impact to tackle gender-specific vulnerabilities arising with climate-induced migration and suggest strategies and priorities for enhancing gender-inclusion in policy development and application broadly.",

          "title": "Contested future-making in containment: temporalities, infrastructures and agency",
          "authors": "Tabea Scharrer, Laura Lambert, Stefan Millar, Mert Pekşen, Ville Laakkonen",
          "abstract": "Containment, as a way of restricting mobilities, ranges from physical infrastructures to diffused control practices in everyday life. Alongside their physical, social, and political dimensions, such restrictions also engender various temporal borders and experiences of time particular to situations of containment. A prolific field of research has identified waiting and hope as strategies for both enforcing and surpassing containment. In response, anthropological research on future-making has highlighted a more diverse set of contextual and emergent practices that derive from imagining and realising migrants’ futures. Yet, in contrast to waiting, migrants’ future-making practices have seldom been related to containment. Besides containment informing future-making, migrants and control actors also manipulate time as they plan or experiment with futures to overcome or reinforce containment. Carrying elusive promises of a better future, containment infrastructures can also motivate migrants to stay put and accommodate restrictions to their mobility. This paper addresses how such different relational, often conflicting, practices of envisioning and realising migrant futures contribute to or subvert different types of containment. Building on empirical studies from Turkey, Niger and Kenya we suggest future-making as a relational, practice-oriented and contextual approach suited to trace the negotiation of migrant futures between migrants, control actors, and infrastructures in situations of spatiotemporal containment. We give special attention to resettlement as a form of containment due to its ability to limit mobility through promises of future mobility and its role in negotiating migrant futures. This article serves as a theoretical introduction into the emerging research field of contested future-making in containment and to the corresponding paper cluster.",

          "authors": "Yang Vincent Liu, Sanja Kutnjak Ivković, Valentina Pavlović Vinogradac",
          "abstract": "Why are some migrants more willing to move back to their homeland than others? Using a mixed methods approach, this article sheds light on the factors contributing to the desire for return migration among first‐generation Croatian migrants ( N = 499). In particular, the current study focuses on the role that migrants' trust in state institutions in both their homeland and current countries of residence plays in their desire to return to the homeland. Quantitative analyses reveal that factors of institutional trust strongly correlate with migrants' willingness to return to Croatia, as do short‐term visits and (dis)satisfaction with their current lives, particularly for those who left Croatia for personal reasons instead of institutional ones. The qualitative results suggest that the pull factors of return migration tend to be personal, while the push factors are largely institutional. In addition, the idea of a “future” for both the returnees (e.g. financial stability) and the country (e.g. political conditions) is the key to migrants' decision‐making about returning.",

          "authors": "Ana Isabel López García",
          "abstract": "How does receiving remittances from abroad influence support for protest participation in origin democracies? Drawing on survey data from Latin America and the Caribbean, a region where social discontent quickly escalates and takes disruptive forms, it is found that remittance recipients do not vary from non‐recipients in their support for peaceful and legal modes of protest. However, compared to non‐recipients, those receiving remittances are more approving of citizens collectively acting outside of formal mechanisms or institutions, thus justifying unlawful and disruptive protest behaviour. Statistical analysis additionally reveals that support for violent protests among recipients is linked to their dissatisfaction with political parties and politicians, especially when these actors rely on patronage and clientelist exchanges to sway voter turnout. The article adds to our understanding of how migrants and the resources they send back home influence the character of political participation in developing democracies.",

          "abstract": "In over 50 states, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) conducts refugee status determination (RSD) but engages in various ‘capacity building’ initiatives to ultimately transfer or ‘hand over’ authority over RSD to states. In this article, we examine the recently concluded RSD-handover process in Turkey as a case study to analyse the power dynamics between UNHCR and states. Drawing on constructionist theories of international organizations and practice theory, we examine handovers as the interplay between UNHCR promoting RSD norms and practices and states’ interpretation and adaptation of the latter. Based on desk-based research and interviews with UNHCR officials, we outline the RSD-handover in Turkey in three stages and show that both parties engage in ongoing negotiations within an evolving community of practice. Using a multifaceted theorization of authority, we argue that even if formally delegated authority over RSD is transferred, the broader authority and power relations operate in a co-constituted way between the two parties.",
