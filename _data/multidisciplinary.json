          "abstract": "The assessment of research performance is widely seen as a vital tool in upholding the highest standards of quality, with selection and competition believed to drive progress. Academic institutions need to take critical decisions on hiring and promotion, while facing external pressure by also being subject to research assessment 1–4 . Here we present an outlook on research assessment for career progression with specific focus on promotion to full professorship, based on 314 policies from 190 academic institutions and 218 policies from 58 government agencies, covering 32 countries in the Global North and 89 countries in the Global South. We investigated how frequently various promotion criteria are mentioned and carried out a statistical analysis to infer commonalities and differences across policies. Although quantitative methods of assessment remain popular, in agreement with what is found in more geographically restricted studies 5–9 , they are not omnipresent. We find differences between the Global North and the Global South as well as between institutional and national policies, but less so between disciplines. A preference for bibliometric indicators is more marked in upper-middle-income countries. Although we see some variation, many promotion policies are based on the assumption of specific career paths that become normative rather than embracing diversity. In turn, this restricts opportunities for researchers. These results challenge current practice and have strategic implications for researchers, research managers and national governments.",

          "abstract": "Personalized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have achieved positive results in the treatment of rare genetic disease 1 . As clinical sequencing technologies continue to advance, the ability to identify patients with rare disease harbouring pathogenic genetic variants amenable to this therapeutic strategy will probably improve. Here we describe a scalable platform for generating patient-derived cellular models and demonstrate that these personalized models can be used for preclinical evaluation of patient-specific ASOs. We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin ( DMD ) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes. The approach outlined here provides the foundation for an expedited path towards the design and preclinical evaluation of personalized ASO therapeutics for a broad range of rare diseases.",

          "abstract": "Tissue-resident memory CD8 T (T RM ) cells provide protection from infection at barrier sites. In the small intestine, T RM cells are found in at least two distinct subpopulations: one with higher expression of effector molecules and another with greater memory potential 1 . However, the origins of this diversity remain unknown. Here we proposed that distinct tissue niches drive the phenotypic heterogeneity of T RM cells. To test this, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics of human samples, a mouse model of acute systemic viral infection and a newly established strategy for pooled optically encoded gene perturbations to profile the locations, interactions and transcriptomes of pathogen-specific T RM cell differentiation at single-transcript resolution. We developed computational approaches to capture cellular locations along three anatomical axes of the small intestine and to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of cell types and gene expression. Our study reveals that the regionalized signalling of the intestinal architecture supports two distinct T RM cell states: differentiated T RM cells and progenitor-like T RM cells, located in the upper villus and lower villus, respectively. This diversity is mediated by distinct ligand–receptor activities, cytokine gradients and specialized cellular contacts. Blocking TGFβ or CXCL9 and CXCL10 sensing by antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed a model consistent with anatomically delineated, early fate specification. Ultimately, our framework for the study of tissue immune networks reveals that T cell location and functional state are fundamentally intertwined.",

However, methods for measuring the organization of effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of DNA–protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing.",

The roles of evolution and chemical mechanism in constraining its biochemical function remain debated 3,4 . Engineering efforts aimed at adjusting the biochemical parameters of rubisco have largely failed 5 , although recent results indicate that the functional potential of rubisco has a wider scope than previously known 6 . Here we developed a massively parallel assay, using an engineered Escherichia coli 7 in which enzyme activity is coupled to growth, to systematically map the sequence–function landscape of rubisco. Composite assay of more than 99% of single-amino acid mutants versus CO 2 concentration enabled inference of enzyme velocity and apparent CO 2 affinity parameters for thousands of substitutions. This approach identified many highly conserved positions that tolerate mutation and rare mutations that improve CO 2 affinity. These data indicate that non-trivial biochemical changes are readily accessible and that the functional distance between rubiscos from diverse organisms can be traversed, laying the groundwork for further enzyme engineering efforts.",

          "abstract": "Female mammalian cells have two X chromosomes, one of maternal origin and one of paternal origin. During development, one X chromosome randomly becomes inactivated 1–4 . This renders either the maternal X (X m ) chromosome or the paternal X (X p ) chromosome inactive, causing X mosaicism that varies between female individuals, with some showing considerable or complete skew of the X chromosome that remains active 5–7 . Parent-of-X origin can modify epigenetics through DNA methylation 8,9 and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in ageing and disease. However, whether X skew or its mosaicism alters functions in female individuals is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew towards an active X m chromosome influences the brain and body—and then delineated unique features of X m neurons and X p neurons. An active X m chromosome impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan and led to worsened cognition with age. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by X m -mediated acceleration of biological or epigenetic ageing of the hippocampus, a key centre for learning and memory, in female mice. Several genes were imprinted on the X m chromosome of hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. CRISPR-mediated activation of X m -imprinted genes improved cognition in ageing female mice. Thus, the X m chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain ageing and silenced genes that contribute to cognition in ageing. Understanding how X m impairs brain function could lead to an improved understanding of heterogeneity in cognitive health in female individuals and to X-chromosome-derived pathways that protect against cognitive deficits and brain ageing.",

          "abstract": "Single-cell genomic technologies enable the multimodal profiling of millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions. However, experimental limitations hinder the comprehensive measurement of cells under native temporal dynamics and in their native spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport has emerged as a powerful tool to address these constraints and has facilitated the recovery of the original cellular context 1–4 . Yet, most optimal transport applications are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Here we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a scalable framework for optimal transport in single-cell genomics that supports multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate the capability of moscot to efficiently reconstruct developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells from mouse embryos across 20 time points. To illustrate the capability of moscot in space, we enrich spatial transcriptomic datasets by mapping multimodal information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We present moscot.spatiotemporal, an approach that leverages gene-expression data across both spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. We also resolve endocrine-lineage relationships of delta and epsilon cells in a previously unpublished mouse, time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our findings are confirmed through experimental validation of NEUROD2 as a regulator of epsilon progenitor cells in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell islet cell differentiation. Moscot is available as open-source software, accompanied by extensive documentation.",

          "abstract": "Science is crucial for evidence-based decision-making. Public trust in scientists can help decision makers act on the basis of the best available evidence, especially during crises. However, in recent years the epistemic authority of science has been challenged, causing concerns about low public trust in scientists. We interrogated these concerns with a preregistered 68-country survey of 71,922 respondents and found that in most countries, most people trust scientists and agree that scientists should engage more in society and policymaking. We found variations between and within countries, which we explain with individual- and country-level variables, including political orientation. While there is no widespread lack of trust in scientists, we cannot discount the concern that lack of trust in scientists by even a small minority may affect considerations of scientific evidence in policymaking. These findings have implications for scientists and policymakers seeking to maintain and increase trust in scientists.",

          "authors": "Christopher Muller, Alexander F. Roehrkasse",
          "abstract": "Using administrative and survey data, we show that there has been a sea change in the contours of American imprisonment. At the end of the twentieth century, inequality in the prison admission rates of Black and White Americans was comparable to inequality in the prison admission rates of people with and without a college education. However, educational inequality is now much greater than racial inequality in prison admissions for all major crime types. Violent offenses have replaced drug offenses as the primary driver of Black prison admissions and Black–White inequality in the prison admission rate. The prison admission rate of Black Americans has fallen, but the prison admission rate of White Americans with no college education has dramatically increased for all offense categories. These findings, which are robust to adjustments for changing selection into college attendance, contribute to a growing body of evidence documenting narrowing racial inequality and widening educational inequality in Americans’ life chances.",

          "abstract": "Despite increased attempts to express equality in speech, biases often leak out through subtle linguistic cues. For example, the subject–complement statement (SCS, “Girls are as good as boys at math”) is used to advocate for equality but often reinforces gender stereotypes (boys are the standard against which girls are judged). We ask whether stereotypes conveyed by SCS can be counteracted by gesture. Two preregistered studies with 8- to 11-y-old children ( N = 320 total) investigate whether an equal gesture—two palms placed at the same height—mitigates the gender stereotype induced by SCS. Children who saw the equal gesture along with SCS were more likely to express egalitarian beliefs than children who saw no gesture or an unequal gesture. Children can extract meaning from gesture when making stereotypical inferences, suggesting that the equal gesture may prove to be an innovative, and simple, intervention to counteract stereotypes introduced by subtle language.",

We use a unique dataset of academic publishing and careers to chart the more or less successful postdoctoral paths. We build a measure of academic success on the citation patterns two to five years into a faculty career. Then, we monitor how students’ postdoc positions—in terms of relocation, change of topic, and early well-cited papers—relate to their early-career success. One key finding is that the postdoc period seems more important than the doctoral training to achieve this form of success. This is especially interesting in light of the many studies of academic faculty hiring that link Ph.D. granting institutions and hires, omitting the postdoc stage. Another group of findings can be summarized as a Goldilocks principle: It seems beneficial to change one’s direction, but not too much.",

          "authors": "Philip J. Cook, Marc Jeuland, Jens Ludwig",
          "abstract": "Justifying a proposed government regulation intended to reduce firearm violence requires a conceptually sound estimate of the monetized value of that impact and how that value is distributed across the population. Some previous estimates do not serve as a valid basis for policy evaluation or are out of date. A nationally representative survey was conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in August 2022 (n = 660). The authors designed and added a series of contingent-valuation items to the questionnaire. Double-bounded estimates of willingness-to-pay (WTP) were derived from a regression analysis of responses regarding voting on a hypothetical referendum on a state-wide package of measures designed to reduce gun violence at specified cost to taxpayers. Average WTP for a reduction of 20% in the state rate of gun violence was $744 per household (IQR:$668–$928), implying a national total of $97.6 billion. Household WTP was positively associated with household income, the respondent’s assessment of the seriousness of gun violence in their community and the subjective likelihood that they would become a victim of gun violence. A variety of tests support the claim that this application of the contingent-valuation method provided valid results. WTP is the recognized basis for assessing the value of proposed federal regulations. The estimated WTP for reducing gun violence is about twice as high as a recent cost-of-injury estimate and provides a much different picture of the incidence of costs by income and demographic characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Models of conformity and anticonformity have typically focused on cultural traits with unordered variants, such as baby names, strategies (cooperate/defect), or the presence/absence of an innovation. There have been fewer studies of conformity to cultural traits with ordered variants, such as level of cooperation (low, medium, high) or proportion of time spent on a task (0% to 100%). In these studies of ordered cultural traits, conformity is defined as a preference for the mean trait value in a population even if no members of the population have variants near this mean; e.g., 50% of the population has variant 0 and 50% has variant 1, producing a mean of 0.5. Here, we introduce models of conformity to ordered traits, which can be either discrete or continuous. In these models, conformists prefer to adopt more popular cultural variants even if these variants are far from the population mean. To measure a variant’s “popularity” in cases where no two individuals share precisely the same variant on a continuum, we introduce a metric called k -dispersal; this takes into account a variant’s distance to its k closest neighbors, with more “popular” variants having lower distances to their neighbors. We demonstrate through simulations that conformity to ordered traits need not produce a homogeneous population, as has previously been claimed. Under some combinations of parameter values, conformity sustains substantial trait variation over many generations. Furthermore, anticonformity may produce a high level of polarization.",

Despite their pervasive use, self-report measures such as Likert scales have a profound problem: Standard analytic approaches do not control for the confounding effects of idiosyncratic response biases. Here, we present a model-based solution to this problem. Our model disentangles response bias from latent constructs of interest to obtain less biased scores of the latent states of respondents. Inspired by Thurstonian approaches in the psychophysics literature, the model requires nothing further than standard Likert scale design assumptions. The model uses a data-driven approach to control for response biases, without the need to prespecify bias types or response strategies. We demonstrate the model’s ability to uncover more precise estimates of latent state associations, outperforming bias-affected standard scoring techniques, and garner insights into previously undetected codependencies between certain latent states and particular forms of response bias. The model is thus a tool which outperforms standard scoring methods and generates insights into, and controls for, the potentially confounding effects of response bias on self-report Likert scale data.",

          "abstract": "Urban vegetation provides essential ecosystem services and benefits to support biodiversity and human well-being in urban areas. However, the dynamic trends, driving factors, and their implications to urban heat mitigation at the global scale remain largely unclear. Here, we used a high-resolution enhanced vegetation index (EVI) dataset to examine the vegetation dynamics in 11,235 urban areas worldwide, identify the driving factors behind its changes, and estimate the potential urban heat mitigation benefits of these changes. We found that 40.75% urban areas (1.51 Mha) evidenced a greening trend (showing increasing EVI), in contrast to 49.60% urban areas showing browning (decreasing EVI). Notably, urban centers in both developed and developing countries contribute to this greening trend. We, nevertheless, found significant spatial disparities in this greening trend, with cities in the Global North showing higher greening ratios than those in the Global South. The driving factors of urban vegetation change trend lead to significant differentiation in and around urban areas. The rapid increase in urbanization intensity and the negative effects of nitrogen deposition are the dominant factors leading to vegetation browning in urban peripheries. However, nitrogen deposition and urbanization intensity have shown positive effects on vegetation greening within urban centers. Crucially, compared to areas with vegetation browning or no significant change, vegetation greening areas have a more significant cooling effect, potentially mitigating the urban heat island effect, especially during summer daytime. Our findings highlight the importance of enhancing urban vegetation greening to promote equitable urban development and ensure effective climate change mitigation.",

          "abstract": "Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) are among the most abundant microorganisms on earth and are known to be a major source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, although biochemical origins of this N 2 O remain unknown. Enzymological details of AOA nitrogen metabolism are broadly unavailable. We report the recombinant expression, purification, and characterization of a multicopper oxidase, Nmar_1354, from the AOA Nitrosopumilus maritimus . We show that Nmar_1354 selectively produces nitroxyl (HNO) by coupling the oxidation of the obligate nitrification intermediate hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) to dioxygen (O 2 ) reduction. This HNO undergoes several downstream reactions, although the major fates are production of N 2 via reaction with NH 2 OH and dimerization with itself to yield N 2 O. These results afford one plausible enzymatic origin for N 2 O release by AOA. Moreover, these results reveal a physiologically relevant enzymatic reaction for producing HNO, an enigmatic nitrogen oxide speculated to be operative in cellular signaling and in energy transduction.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial cell wall assembly and remodeling require activities of peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases as well as PG synthases. In particular, the activity of DD-endopeptidases, which cleave the 4-3 peptide crosslinks in PG, is essential for PG expansion in gram-negative bacteria. Maintaining optimal levels of DD-endopeptidases is critical for expanding PG without compromising its integrity. In Escherichia coli , the levels of major DD-endopeptidases, MepS and MepH, along with the lytic transglycosylase MltD, are controlled by the periplasmic protease Prc and its outer membrane adaptor NlpI. However, the mechanisms regulating the turnover of these PG hydrolases have remained unclear. In this study, we identified a periplasmic protein, BipP (formerly YhjJ), that negatively controls the NlpI-Prc system. Further analyses indicate that BipP exerts this control by interacting with NlpI and inhibiting its substrate recognition in response to low DD-endopeptidase activity, providing insight into the homeostatic control of PG hydrolysis and cell wall expansion.",

However, detecting and tracking these vibrations within a biological context at the single particle level has remained elusive. In this study, we track the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under ambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an 80 to 100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19 to 21 GHz range sensitive to virus morphology and 2 to 10 GHz modes with nanosecond dephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking virus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by the local environment. Single particle tracking allows the capture of viral disassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity, high resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into biological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism level.",

          "abstract": "Viral infections are characterized by dispersal from an initial site to secondary locations within the host. How the resultant spatial heterogeneity shapes within-host genetic diversity and viral evolutionary pathways is poorly understood. Here, we show that virus dispersal within and between the nasal cavity and trachea maintains diversity and is therefore conducive to adaptive evolution, whereas dispersal to the lungs gives rise to population heterogeneity. We infected ferrets either intranasally or by aerosol with a barcoded influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus. At 1, 2, or 4 days postinfection, dispersal was assessed by collecting 52 samples from throughout the respiratory tract of each animal. Irrespective of inoculation route, barcode compositions across the nasal turbinates and trachea were similar and highly diverse, revealing little constraint on the establishment of infection in the nasal cavity and descent through the trachea. Conversely, infection of the lungs produced genetically distinct viral populations. Lung populations were pauci-clonal, suggesting that each seeded location received relatively few viral genotypes. While aerosol inoculation gave distinct populations at every lung site sampled, within-host dispersal after intranasal inoculation produced larger patches, indicative of local expansion following seeding of the lungs. Throughout the respiratory tract, barcode diversity declined over time, but new diversity was generated through mutation. De novo variants were often unique to a given location, indicating that localized replication following dispersal resulted in population divergence. In summary, dispersal within the respiratory tract operates differently between regions and contributes to the potential for viral evolution to proceed independently in multiple within-host subpopulations.",

Intravitreal administration of ADP expanded the neovascular area in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization. Single-cell transcriptomics from human choroidal datasets show the expression of P2RY1, but not other ADP receptors, in EC with a pattern similar to VEGFR2.

To address this, we developed a contrastive-based RI TC forecasting (RITCF-contrastive) model, utilizing satellite infrared imagery alongside atmospheric and oceanic data. The RITCF-contrastive model was tested on 1,149 TC periods in the Northwest Pacific from 2020 to 2021, achieving a POD of 92.3% and a FARate of 8.9%. RITCF-contrastive improves on previous models by addressing sample imbalance and incorporating TC structural features, leading to a 11.7% improvement in POD and a 3 times reduction in FARate compared to existing deep learning methods. The RITCF-contrastive model not only enhances RI TC forecasting but also offers a unique approach to forecasting these dangerous weather events.",

Previous studies have reported that overexpression of ASCL1 or combinations of proneural factors in Müller glia (MG) induce regeneration of functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. Recently, we applied the same strategy in dissociated cultures of fetal human MG and although we stimulated neurogenesis from MG, our effect in 2D cultures was modest and our analysis of newborn neurons was limited. In this study, we aimed to improve our MG reprogramming strategy in a more intact retinal environment. For this purpose, we used an in vitro culture system of human fetal retinal tissue and adult human postmortem retina. To stimulate reprogramming, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver constructs with a glial-specific promoter (HES1) driving ASCL1 alone or in combination with additional developmental transcription factors (TFs) such as ATOH1 and NEUROD1 . Combining IHC, scRNA-seq, and electrophysiology, we show that human MG can generate new neurons even in adults. This work constitutes a key step toward a future clinical application of this regenerative medicine approach for retinal degenerative disorders.",

Here, we determined how transections of the dorsal columns done within a few days after birth affect the developing somatosensory cortex. Dorsal columns were transected between the 3rd and 12th postnatal day (PND), and the somatosensory cortex was mapped when the macaques were over 3 y old. There were two distinct outcomes depending on the age at the time of the lesion. In monkeys lesioned between the 3rd and 5th PND, neurons in the entire hand region of area 3b and the adjacent somatosensory cortex responded to touch on the hand. An alternate spinal pathway must have replaced the lost pathway. In monkeys lesioned between the 9th and 12th PND, neurons in the deafferented hand region did not respond to touch on the hand. There was medialward expansion of the face representation into the deafferented cortex and a lateral expansion of the arm representation as in lesioned adults. Thus, different mechanisms underlie the reorganization of area 3b and the adjacent somatosensory cortex following identical spinal cord injuries sustained as early or late newborns. The results suggest that alternate spinal cord pathways can develop within a critical period before the 9th PND, but not later.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal processing of external sensory input is shaped by internally generated top–down information. In the neocortex, top–down projections primarily target layer 1, which contains NDNF (neuron-derived neurotrophic factor)-expressing interneurons and the dendrites of pyramidal cells. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that NDNF interneurons shape cortical computations in an unconventional, layer-specific way, by exerting presynaptic inhibition on synapses in layer 1 while leaving synapses in deeper layers unaffected. We first confirm experimentally that in the auditory cortex, synapses from somatostatin-expressing (SOM) onto NDNF neurons are indeed modulated by ambient Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Shifting to a computational model, we then show that this mechanism introduces a distinct mutual inhibition motif between NDNF interneurons and the synaptic outputs of SOM interneurons. This motif can control inhibition in a layer-specific way and introduces competition between NDNF and SOM interneurons for dendritic inhibition onto pyramidal cells on different timescales. NDNF interneurons can thereby control cortical information flow by redistributing dendritic inhibition from fast to slow timescales and by gating different sources of dendritic inhibition.",

The elevated AP-evoked neurotransmission in the primary sensory neurons plays crucial roles in hyperalgesia. However, whether and how the AP-independent continuous neurotransmission contributes to hyperalgesia remains largely unknown. Here, we show that primary sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons exhibit frequent spontaneous microdomain Ca 2+ (smCa) activities independent of APs across the cell bodies and axons, which are mediated by the spontaneous opening of TRPA1 channels and trigger continuous neurotransmission via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A signaling pathway. More importantly, the frequency of smCa activity and its triggered continuous neurotransmission in DRG neurons increased dramatically in mice experiencing inflammatory pain, inhibition of which alleviates hyperalgesia. Collectively, this work revealed the AP-independent continuous neurotransmission triggered by smCa activities in DRG neurons, which may serve as a unique mechanism underlying the nociceptive sensitization in hyperalgesia and offer a potential target for the treatment of chronic pain.",

Here, we show that the aquatic ecosystems in historically arid west Greenland have undergone an ecological transformation after a series of atmospheric rivers that simultaneously produced record heat and rainfall hit the region in autumn 2022. We analyzed a unique, long-term lake dataset and found that compound climate extremes pushed Arctic lakes across a tipping point. As terrestrial–aquatic linkages were strengthened, lakes synchronously transformed from “blue” lakes with high transparency and low pelagic primary production to “brown” in less than a year, owing to a large influx of dissolved organic material and metals, with iron concentrations increasing by more than two orders of magnitude. The browning of lake waters reduced light penetration by 50% across lakes. The resulting light limitation altered plankton distributions and community structure, including a major reduction in prokaryotic diversity and an increase in algal groups capable of metabolizing organic carbon sources. As a result, lakes shifted from being summer carbon sinks to sources, with a &gt;350% increase in carbon dioxide flux from lakes to the atmosphere. The remarkably rapid, coherent transformation of these Arctic ecosystems underscores the synergistic and unpredictable impacts of compound extreme events and the importance of their seasonal timing, especially in regions with negative moisture balance.",

The search for safe and nonaddictive pain treatments has led to a focus on key mediators of nociceptor excitability. Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the peripheral nervous system—Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9—play crucial roles in pain signaling. Among these, Nav1.8 has shown promise due to its rapid recovery from inactivation and role in repetitive firing, with recent clinical studies providing proof-of-principal that block of Nav1.8 can reduce pain in humans. We report here that three nonpsychotomimetic cannabinoids—cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN)—effectively inhibit Nav1.8, suggesting their potential as analgesic compounds. In particular, CBG shows significant promise due to its ability to effectively inhibit excitability of peripheral sensory neurons. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly CBG, as agents that may attenuate pain via block of Nav1.8, warranting further in vivo studies.",

Here, we examine two-phase equilibration studies showing that the G-phase melts to form the L-phase above ~1,000 K, which then transforms to form the crystal (X) phase; however, below the melting point of the G-Phase (~990 K), the X- and G-phases do not transform into each other. We suggest the presence of a G-phase is likely responsible for embrittlement often observed in metallic glasses. We also consider how mechanical milling or irradiation-induced defect accumulation in the crystalline metallic alloy triggers a crystal-to-glass transition. We use the Cu 2 Zr system as a model to investigate random interchange of Zr and Cu atoms at room temperature leading to a transition from a crystalline Laves-phase to an L-glass through formation and growth of amorphous regions and destabilization of the crystal. During relaxation of the nonequilibrium structures by annealing, the configurations either reverted to the crystalline phase or evolve to a heterogeneous G-phase equivalent to the G-phase formed during thermal quenching and aging of the melt. Athermal defect accumulation in the G-phase at low temperature led to a transition back to the L-phase. Our findings show how athermal disordering drives transitions among the X-, L-, and G-phases.",

In the context of muscle, growth hormone (GH) coordinates growth with nutritional status; however, the detailed mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) maintains muscle mass by sustaining GH action. Muscle-specific genetic deletion of BCL6 at either perinatal or adult stages profoundly reduces muscle mass and compromises muscle strength. Conversely, muscle-directed viral overexpression of BCL6 significantly reverses the loss of muscle mass and strength. Mechanistically, we show that BCL6 transcriptionally represses the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 to sustain the anabolic actions of GH in muscle. Additionally, we find that GH itself transcriptionally inhibits BCL6 through the Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (JAK/STAT5) pathway. Supporting the physiologic relevance of this feedback regulation, we show the coordinated suppression of muscle Bcl6 expression with the induction of GH in the fasted state. These findings reveal the complexity of the feedback controls modulating GH signaling and identify BCL6 as a key homeostatic regulator coordinating muscle mass with nutrient availability. Moreover, these studies open avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies to combat muscle-wasting conditions.",

          "abstract": "Ependymoma (EPN) is a common form of brain tumor in children, often resistant to available cytotoxic therapies. Molecular profiling studies have led to a better understanding of EPN subtypes and revealed a critical role of oncogenes ZFTA–RELA fusion and EPHB2 in supratentorial ependymoma (ST-EPN). However, the immune system’s role in tumor progression and response to therapy remains poorly understood. New treatments for various molecular subtypes of EPN are desperately needed. Using ST-EPN-ZFTA subtype-specific syngeneic mouse models, we found an increased frequency of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which proportionally increased with tumor size during tumor progression. Transcriptomic profiling of ST-EPN-ZFTA and analysis of a human EPN dataset revealed multiple protein kinases as potential druggable targets. By matching transcriptomic signatures with the target spectrum of FDA-approved drugs, we found that the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib potently inhibited the growth of EPN both in vitro and in vivo, mainly through blocking EPHB2 and ABL1. Treatment with dasatinib reprogrammed the EPN immune microenvironment by polarizing TAMs toward an M1-like phenotype and increasing CD8 T cell activation. Furthermore, dasatinib treatment induced complete regression of established EPN tumors in 78% of the animals and protected survivors against tumor recurrence. Depletion of CD8 cells compromised the durability of EPN responses and reduced overall survival. These data indicate that dasatinib has the potential to be an effective therapy for ST-EPN-ZFTA molecular subgroup of EPN and support further investigation of dasatinib in clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "Itaconate, an abundant metabolite produced by macrophages upon interferon-γ stimulation, possesses both antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. Despite its crucial role in immunity and antimicrobial control, its mechanism of action and dissimilation are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that infection of mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis increases itaconate levels in lung tissues. We also show that exposure to itaconate inhibits M. tuberculosis growth in vitro, in macrophages, and mice. We report that exposure to sodium itaconate (ITA) interferes with the central carbon metabolism of M. tuberculosis . In addition to the inhibition of isocitrate lyase (ICL), we demonstrate that itaconate inhibits aldolase and inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase in a concentration-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that Rv2498c from M. tuberculosis is the bona fide (S)-citramalyl-CoA lyase, but the remaining components of the pathway remain elusive. Here, we report that Rv2503c and Rv3272 possess itaconate:succinyl-CoA transferase activity, and Rv2499c and Rv3389c possess itaconyl-CoA hydratase activity. Relative to the parental and complemented strains, the ΔRv3389c strain of M. tuberculosis was attenuated for growth in itaconate-containing medium, in macrophages, mice, and guinea pigs. The attenuated phenotype of ΔRv3389c strain of M. tuberculosis is associated with a defect in the itaconate dissimilation and propionyl-CoA detoxification pathway. This study thus reveals that multiple metabolic enzymes are targeted by itaconate in M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, we have assigned the two remaining enzymes responsible for the degradation of itaconic acid into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Finally, we also demonstrate the importance of enzymes involved in the itaconate dissimilation pathway for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Multicellularity spans a wide gamut in terms of complexity, from simple clonal clusters of cells to large-scale organisms composed of differentiated cells and tissues. While recent experiments have demonstrated that simple forms of multicellularity can readily evolve in response to different selective pressures, it is unknown if continued exposure to those same selective pressures will result in the evolution of increased multicellular complexity. We use mathematical models to consider the adaptive trajectories of unicellular organisms exposed to periodic bouts of abiotic stress, such as drought or antibiotics. Populations can improve survival in response to the stress by evolving multicellularity or cell differentiation—or both; however, these responses have associated costs when the stress is absent. We define a parameter space of fitness-relevant traits and identify where multicellularity, differentiation, or their combination is fittest. We then study the effects of adaptation by allowing populations to fix mutations that improve their fitness. We find that while the same mutation can be beneficial to populations of different complexity, e.g., strict unicellularity or life cycles with stages of differentiated multicellularity, the magnitudes of their effects can differ and alter which is fittest. As a result, we observe adaptive trajectories that gain and lose complexity. We also show that the order of mutations, historical contingency, can cause some transitions to be permanent in the absence of neutral evolution. Ultimately, we find that continued exposure to a selective driver for multicellularity can either lead to increasing complexity or a return to unicellularity.",

          "abstract": "Experiments have shown that when one plant is attacked by a pathogen or herbivore, this can lead to other plants connected to the same mycorrhizal network up-regulating their defense mechanisms. It has been hypothesized that this represents signaling, with attacked plants producing a signal to warn other plants of impending harm. We examined the evolutionary plausibility of this and other hypotheses theoretically. We found that the evolution of plant signaling about an attack requires restrictive conditions, and so will rarely be evolutionarily stable. The problem is that signaling about an attack provides a benefit to competing neighbors, even if they are kin, and so reduces the relative fitness of signaling plants. Indeed, selection is often more likely to push plant behavior in the opposite direction—with plants signaling dishonestly about an attack that has not occurred, or suppressing a cue that they have been attacked. Instead, we show that there are two viable alternatives that could explain the empirical data: 1) the process of being attacked leads to a cue (information about the attack) which is too costly for the attacked plant to fully suppress; 2) mycorrhizal fungi monitor their host plants, detect when they are attacked, and then the fungi signal this information to warn other plants in their network. Our results suggest the empirical work that would be required to distinguish between these possibilities.",

Here, we uncover an intercellular mRNA transfer phenomenon that allows for the adaptation and reprogramming of human primed pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). This process is induced by the direct cell contact-mediated coculture with mouse embryonic stem cells under the condition impermissible for primed hPSC culture. Mouse-derived mRNA contents are transmitted into adapted hPSCs only in the coculture. Transfer-specific mRNA analysis shows the enrichment for divergent biological pathways involving transcription/translational machinery and stress-coping mechanisms, wherein such transfer is diminished when direct cell contacts are lost. After 5 d of coculture with mouse embryonic stem cells, surface marker analysis and global gene profiling confirmed that mRNA transfer-prone hPSC efficiently gains a naïve-like state. Furthermore, transfer-specific knockdown experiments targeting mouse-specific transcription factor-coding mRNAs in hPSC show that mouse-derived Tfcp2l1 , Tfap2c, and Klf4 are indispensable for human naïve-like conversion. Thus, interspecies mRNA transfer triggers cellular reprogramming in mammalian cells. Our results support that episodic mRNA transfer can occur in cell cooperative and competitive processes, which provides a fresh perspective on understanding the roles of mRNA mobility for intra- and interspecies cellular communications.",

Further, cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we use a combinatory in silico approach to identify human gene targets that will have an especially high likelihood of individually and directly impacting cognition. This broad and unbiased screen led to the specific identification of ARHGEF11 , which encodes PDZ-RhoGEF. PDZ-RhoGEF is a largely RhoA-specific activator that is highly enriched in dendritic spines, and recent work identified hyperexpression of PDZ-RhoGEF in the prefrontal cortex of bipolar disorder subjects, a disease characterized by an early emergence and persistence of broad scope cognitive dysfunction. Here, we characterize the effects of PDZ-RhoGEF on synaptic and behavioral phenotypes, and we identify molecular and biochemical mechanisms that control PDZ-RhoGEF’s expression, synaptic spatial localization, and enzymatic activity. Importantly, our identified direct regulators of PDZ-RhoGEF (miR-132 and DISC1) have themselves been repeatedly implicated in controlling cognitive phenotypes in humans, including those caused by several neuropsychiatric disorders.

          "abstract": "In ephaptic coupling, physically adjacent neurons influence one another’s activity via the electric fields they generate. To date, the molecular mechanisms that mediate and modulate ephaptic coupling’s effects remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channel lateralizes the potentially mutual ephaptic inhibition between Drosophila gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). While sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs) engage in ephaptic suppression of the adjacent bitter-sensing GRNs (bGRNs), HCN expression in sGRNs enables them to resist ephaptic suppression from the bGRNs. This one-sided ephaptic inhibition confers sweetness dominance, facilitating ingestion of bitter-laced sweets. The role of fly HCN in this process can be replaced by human HCN2. Furthermore, unlike the mechanism in olfaction, gustatory ephaptic inhibition is independent of sensillum potential changes, suggesting that the compartmentalized arrangement of neighboring GRNs is dispensable for gustatory ephaptic inhibition. These findings indicate a role for the gating of ephaptic coding to ensure the intake of the essential nutrient despite bitter contaminants present in the feeding niche of Drosophila , and propose that studies in Drosophila gustation could reveal ephaptic principles conserved across diverse animals.",

          "abstract": "The SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SWI/SNF) complexes are evolutionarily conserved, ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers crucial for multiple nuclear functions in eukaryotes. Recently, plant BCL-DOMAIN HOMOLOG (BDH) proteins were identified as shared subunits of all plant SWI/SNF complexes, significantly impacting chromatin accessibility and various developmental processes in Arabidopsis. In this study, we performed a comprehensive characterization of bdh mutants, revealing the role of BDH in hypocotyl cell elongation. Through detailed analysis of BDH domains, we identified a plant-specific N-terminal domain that facilitates the interaction between BDH and the rest of the complex. Additionally, we uncovered the critical role of the BDH β-hairpin domain, which is phylogenetically related to mammalian BCL7 SWI/SNF subunits. While phylogenetic analyses did not identify BDH/BCL7 orthologs in fungi, structure prediction modeling demonstrated strong similarities between the SWI/SNF catalytic modules of plants, animals, and fungi and revealed the yeast Rtt102 protein as a structural homolog of BDH and BCL7. This finding is supported by the ability of Rtt102 to interact with the Arabidopsis catalytic module subunit ARP7 and partially rescue the bdh mutant phenotypes. Further experiments revealed that BDH promotes the stability of the ARP4-ARP7 heterodimer, leading to the partial destabilization of ARP4 in the SWI/SNF complexes. In summary, our study unveils the molecular function of BDH proteins in plant SWI/SNF complexes and suggests that β-hairpin-containing proteins are evolutionarily conserved subunits crucial for ARP heterodimer stability and SWI/SNF activity across eukaryotes.",

          "abstract": "In ecology, Alan Turing’s proposed activation–inhibition mechanism has been abstracted as corresponding to several ecological interaction types to explain pattern formation in ecosystems. Consumer–resource interactions have strong theoretical arguments linking them to both the Turing mechanism and pattern formation, but there is little empirical support to demonstrate these claims. Here, we connect several lines of evidence to support the proposition that consumer–resource interactions can create empirically observed spatial patterns through a mechanism similar to Turing’s theory. We propose the existence of a fine-scale demographic spatial pattern (DSP), in which the youngest resources are located at the periphery and oldest in the center of clusters. We find evidence of a DSP in the spatially clustered distribution of arboreal ant nests, whose large-scale spatial patterning has previously been hypothesized to be driven by ant parasitoids. Through a combination of field surveys and analysis of demographic trends, we demonstrate how the DSP structures the interactions between the ant and its parasitoid. To explore the implications of DSP for consumer–resource pattern forming systems generally, we use a spatially explicit consumer–resource model to show how relative diffusion rates of the system shape multiscale spatial patterns that structure the demographic trends of the resource population in predictable ways. This work provides both empirical support for consumer–resource spatial patterns as well as a multiscale approach to understand their spatially explicit population dynamics.",

While the development trajectories for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been measured, it is less established how human subtype-specific antibodies develop from their precursors. In this work, we evaluated the retrospective development trajectories for eight anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike human antibodies (Abs). To mimic the immunological process of BCR selection during affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs), we performed deep mutational scanning on anti-S1 molecular Fabs using yeast display coupled to fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Focusing only on changes in affinity upon mutation, we found that human Ab development pathways have few mutations which impart changes in monovalent binding dissociation constants and that these mutations can occur in nearly any order. Maturation pathways of two bnAbs showed that while they are only slightly less permissible than subtype-specific Abs, more development steps on average are needed to reach the same level of affinity. Many of the subtype-specific Abs had inherent affinity for antigen, and these results were robust against different potential inferred precursor sequences. To evaluate the effect of differential affinity for precursors on GC outcomes, we adapted a coarse-grained affinity maturation model. This model showed that antibody precursors with minimal affinity advantages rapidly outcompete competitors to become the dominant clonotype.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic control of signaling events requires swift regulation of receptors at an active state. By focusing on the Arabidopsis ERECTA (ER) receptor kinase, which perceives peptide ligands to control multiple developmental processes, we report a mechanism preventing inappropriate receptor activity. The ER C-terminal tail (ER_CT) functions as an autoinhibitory domain: Its removal confers higher kinase activity and hyperactivity during inflorescence and stomatal development. ER_CT is required for the binding of a receptor kinase inhibitor, BKI1, and two U-box E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, that trigger activated ER to degradation through ubiquitination. We further identify ER_CT as a phosphodomain transphosphorylated by the coreceptor BAK1. The phosphorylation impacts the tail structure, likely releasing ER from autoinhibition. The phosphonull version enhances BKI1 association, whereas the phosphomimetic version promotes PUB30/31 association. Thus, ER_CT acts as an off–on–off toggle switch, facilitating the release of BKI1 inhibition, enabling signal activation, and swiftly turning over the receptors afterward. Our results elucidate a mechanism that fine-tunes receptor signaling via a phosphoswitch module, maintaining the receptor at a low basal state while ensuring robust yet transient activation upon ligand perception.",

As yet, no primate study has empirically identified how the stress response adaptively affects evolutionary fitness. Here, we take advantage of a natural experiment—an El Niño drought—that produced unprecedented mortality for wild white-faced capuchins. Using a reaction norm approach, we provide evidence from primates that a more robust stress response to a challenge, measured using fecal glucocorticoids, predicts a greater likelihood of survival. We show that individuals with greater stress responsiveness to previous droughts later had higher survival across a severe El Niño drought. Evolutionary models need empirical data on how stress responsivity varies in adaptive ways. While we cannot buffer subjects from catastrophic events, we can use them to understand which aspects of the stress response help animals to “weather the storm.”",

Definitions of resilience differ between disciplines, however, and the term remains inadequately operationalized. Resilience is the outcome of variable behavioral decisions, yet the process itself and the strategies behind it have rarely been addressed quantitatively. We present an agent-based model integrating four common risk management strategies, observed in past and present societies. Model outcomes under different environmental regimes, and in relation to key case studies, provide a mapping between the efficacy (success in harm prevention) and efficiency (cost of harm prevention) of different behavioral strategies. This formalization unravels the historical contingency of dynamic socio-natural processes in the context of crises. In discriminating between successful and failed risk management strategies deployed in the past—the emergent outcome of which is resilience—we are better placed to understand and to some degree predict their utility in the contemporary world.",

Emerging studies have revealed that the endogenous multienzymatic antioxidant defense system (MEAODS) plays a central role in preventing oxidative stress and other toxicological compounds produced by alcohol. However, few available drugs could quickly regulate MEAODS. Herein, we report a nanosized iron sulfide (nFeS) that can rapidly release polysulfide species in gastric juice. The released hydrogen polysulfide activates the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway via S-persulfidation of cysteine residues in Keap1, which promotes the expression of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione synthesis–related enzymes, thus potentiating MEAODS. Results indicate that the activated MEAODS not only alleviates oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain and liver but also mitigates movement dysfunction after only 2.5 hours of oral nFeS treatment. Collectively, this study provides a MEAODS-regulated strategy with nFeS and may aid the prevention of acute alcoholic injury.",

To explore this, we constructed RL-based theoretical models and used multiregional two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse dorsal cortex. We identified a population of neurons whose activity was modulated by varying degrees of RPE accumulation. Consequently, RPE-encoding neurons were sequentially activated within each trial, forming a distributed assembly. RPE representations in mice aligned with theoretical predictions of RL, emerging during learning and being subject to manipulations of the reward function. Interareal comparisons revealed a region-specific code, with higher-order cortical regions exhibiting long-term encoding of RPE accumulation.

However, the functional packing and precise role of VirB8 in T4SSs biology remain undefined. Our findings elucidate the nature of VirB8 proteins as cell wall components, where they multimerize and exhibit a conserved assembly pattern, distinct from VirB8 in Gram-negative bacteria. We also demonstrate that VirB8 proteins interact with other T4SS subunits and DNA, indicating their pivotal role in the building of the DNA translocation channel across the cell wall.

We found that a direct circuit from the tongue → glutamatergic neurons in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTN Glu ) → noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC NE ) drives rapid arousal in the anesthetized mice that receive the rescue-like behavior from bystanders. Artificial inhibition of this circuit abolishes the rapid arousal effect induced by the rescue-like behavior. Further, we revealed that glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT Glu ) that project to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) mediate the rescue-like behavior.

However, most state-of-the-art demonstrations face fundamental limits of rank deficiency in the photoresponse matrix. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized spectral sensing system using an electrically tunable compact optoelectronic interface, which generates distinguishable photoresponses from various input spectra, enabling accurate spectral identification with a device footprint of 5 micrometers by 5 micrometers. We report narrow-band spectral sensing with peak accuracies of ∼0.19 nanometers in free space and ∼2.45 nanometers on-chip. In addition, we implement broadband complex spectral sensing for material identification, applicable to organic dyes, metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics. This work advances high-performance, miniaturized optical spectroscopy for both free-space and on-chip applications, offering cost-effective solutions, broad applicability, and scalable manufacturing.",

Miniaturizing the quantum devices to meet the requirement in limited space applications drives the search for ultracompact entangled photon-pair sources. The rise of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors has been demonstrated as ultracompact entangled photon-pair sources. However, the photon-pair generation rate and purity are relatively low, and the strong photoluminescence in 2D semiconductors also makes the operational wavelength range limited. Here, we use the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) as a polarization entangled photon-pair source. We have achieved a generation rate of more than 120 hertz (a record-high SPDC coincidence rate with 2D materials) and a high-purity photon-pair generation with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of above 200. Tunable Bell state generation is also demonstrated by simply rotating the pump polarization, with a fidelity up to 0.93. Our results suggest rBN as an ideal candidate for on-chip integrated quantum devices.",

The helical recoil model of P2XR desensitization proposes stability of the cytoplasmic cap sets the rate of desensitization, but timing of its formation is unclear for slow-desensitizing P2XRs. We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of full-length wild-type human P2X4 receptor in apo closed, antagonist-bound inhibited, and ATP-bound desensitized states. Because the apo closed and antagonist-bound inhibited state structures of this slow-desensitizing P2XR include an intact cytoplasmic cap while the ATP-bound desensitized state structure does not, the cytoplasmic cap is formed before agonist binding. Furthermore, structural and functional data suggest the cytoplasmic cap is stabilized by lipids to modulate desensitization, and P2X4 is modified by glycosylation and palmitoylation. Last, our antagonist-bound inhibited state structure reveals features specific to the allosteric ligand-binding pocket in human receptors that facilitates development of small-molecule modulators.",

Despite the advances in responsive polymer-based actuating fibers, the available actuation modes are limited by the exclusive reliance of current technologies on thermotropic contraction along the fiber axis. To address this gap, the present study describes a reversible and spontaneous thermotropic elongation (~30%) in liquid crystal elastomer fibers produced via ultraviolet-assisted melt spinning. This elongation arises from the orthogonal alignment of smectogenic mesogens relative to the fiber axis, which contrasts the parallel alignment typically observed in nematic liquid crystal elastomer fibers and is achieved through mesophase control during extrusion. The fibers exhibiting thermotropic elongation enable active textiles increase pore size in response to temperature increase. The integration of contracting and elongating fibers within a single textile enables spatially distinct actuation, paving the way for innovations in smart clothing and fiber/textile actuators.",

Viruses that lack the ability to induce this signaling show diminished viral shedding and attenuated disease in a mouse model of rotavirus diarrhea. This implicates nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) as a virulence factor and provides mechanistic insight into its mode of action. Critically, this signaling induces a transcriptional signature characteristic of interferon-independent innate immune activation, which is not observed in response to a mutant NSP4 that does not conduct calcium.

Repolarizing GAMs from tumor-supporting to tumor-inhibiting phenotype may troubleshoot. However, sufficient accumulation of drugs at the GBM site is restricted by blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, we designed peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) by conjugating camptothecin or resiquimod to a tandem peptide composed of matrix metalloproteinase 2–responsive peptide and angiopep-2 via disulfonyl-ethyl carbonate/carbamate ( MA PDCs). The mixed self-assembly MA PDCs could recognize low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1) to facilitate BBB transport. Once reaching the GBM site, the responsive peptide would be cleaved to shed the angiopep-2, blocking abluminal LRP1-mediated brain-to-blood efflux and enhancing drug retention. Sequentially, drugs are released under the high level of intracellular glutathione. In vivo studies demonstrated that MA PDCs repolarized GAMs, boosted immune response, and resensitized chemotherapeutic toxicity, offering a much-improved anti-GBM effect. The effectiveness of MA PDCs validates GAMs as therapeutic target and PDCs as versatile brain delivery system with high design flexibility.",

To address this, we implemented machine learning algorithms to establish quantitative structure-property relationship models, predicting key optoelectronic characteristics, such as full width at half maximum (FWHM) and main peak wavelength, for deep-blue MR candidates. Using these methodologies, we crafted ν-DABNA-O-xy and developed deep-blue organic light-emitting diodes featuring a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage y of 0.07 and an FWHM of 19 nm. The maximum external quantum efficiency reached ca. 27.5% with a binary emission layer, which increased to 41.3% with the hyperfluorescent architecture, effectively mitigating efficiency roll-off.

We find that there is a time lag in viral transmission among different host populations and that movements from wild birds to unvaccinated poultry were more frequent than those from wild birds to vaccinated poultry. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the HA (hemagglutinin) gene of the AIV lineage that circulated predominately in Chinese poultry experienced greater nonsynonymous divergence and adaptive fixation than other lineages. Our results indicate that the epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary consequences of widespread AIV vaccination in poultry may be linked in complex ways and that much work is needed to better understand how such interventions may affect AIV transmission to, within, and from wild birds.",

Mice with Nf2 deletion develop schwannomas slowly with low penetrance, hence inconvenient for preclinical studies. Here, we show that NF2, by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases β-TrCP1/2, promotes WWC1-3 ubiquitination and degradation. In NF2 mutated cells, WWC1-3 accumulation is a compensatory mechanism to prevent YAP/TAZ hyperactivation and rapid tumorigenesis. Accordingly, we generate a synthetic mouse model with complete penetrance and short latency by concurrently deleting Nf2 and Wwc1/2 in Schwann cells. This model closely resembles NF2-related schwannomatosis in patients, as confirmed by histological and single-cell transcriptome analysis. Moreover, a cell line from mouse schwannomas and a syngeneic tumor model in immune-competent mice are established. Furthermore, a screen using established models has identified candidate drugs that effectively suppress schwannoma progression.

In the area of deoxygenative functionalization of amides, intermediates such as iminium ions and enamines were often generated in situ to result in the formation of α-functionalized amines. In contrast, the direct deoxygenation of amides to β-functionalized amines is highly appealing yet remains scarcely investigated. Here, a deoxygenative arylation of amides with aryl halides was developed via multicatalysis of iridium/photoredox/nickel/iridium, affording β-aryl amines in high efficiency. The key to the success of this reaction is the SOMO activation of enamine in synergy with a Ni-catalyzed arylation, which is in conjunction with two compatible Ir-catalyzed reduction processes.",

While observed in vivo, control over these processes in vitro to understand both tissue development and guide tissue formation has remained challenging. Here, we use combinations of mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids and hydrogel microparticles (microgels) with varied hydrolytic stability to fabricate programmable and dynamic granular composites that control compaction and tissue formation over time. Mixed microgel populations of varying stability provide a further handle to alter compaction, and the level of compaction guides the uniformity and level of ECM deposition within tissues.

Their true nature remains unknown; possibilities include magnetic white dwarfs, binary systems, or long-period magnetars; the latter class is predicted to produce fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, we conducted follow-up observations of the long-period radio transient GPM J1839-10. Here we report that the source exhibits a wide range of unusual emission properties, including polarization characteristics indicative of magnetospheric origin, linear-to-circular polarization conversion, and drifting substructures closely resembling those observed in repeating FRBs. These radio characteristics provide evidence in support of the long-period magnetar model and suggest a possible connection between long-period radio transients, magnetars, and FRBs.",

In regions dominated by tectonic quiescence and climate stability, the role of rock strength related to lithology, and its role in landscape evolution, can be most clearly perceived. We leverage these qualities in a unique field site by integrating topographic data, erosion rates, and a large suite of rock strength measurements to quantify the relationship between bedrock strength and erosion rates along a 200-km section of the southeast coast of Brazil where climatic and tectonic variability are minimal. Our findings reveal a 20-fold erosion rate variation best explained by differences in rock strength. We also demonstrate that incorporating lithological strength variability into the analysis of landscape incision substantially improves accuracy, with outcomes that better reproduce natural settings. Our results underscore the crucial role of rock strength in landscape evolution and emphasize the need for field studies to account for lithological variability and thus accurately interpret landscape dynamics.",

Disruption of proteostasis results in accumulation of protein aggregates causing cardiac pathologies such as hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and heart failure. Here, we identify ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5 (USP5) as a critical determinant of protein quality control (PQC) in CM. CM-specific loss of mUsp5 leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains and protein aggregates, cardiac remodeling, and eventually DCM. USP5 interacts with key components of the proteostasis machinery, including PSMD14, and the absence of USP5 increases activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagic flux in CMs. Cardiac-specific hUSP5 overexpression reduces pathological remodeling in pressure-overloaded mouse hearts and attenuates protein aggregate formation in titinopathy and desminopathy models. Since CMs from humans with end-stage DCM show lower USP5 levels and display accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, we hypothesize that therapeutically increased USP5 activity may reduce protein aggregates during DCM. Our findings demonstrate that USP5 is essential for ubiquitin turnover and proteostasis in mature CMs.",

We isolated an unusual mutation in Caenorhabditis elegans that disrupts crossover interference but not SC assembly. This mutation alters the unique C terminal domain of an essential SC protein, SYP-4, a likely ortholog of the vertebrate SC protein SIX6OS1. We use three-dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (3D-STORM) to interrogate the molecular architecture of the SC from wild-type and mutant C. elegans animals. Using a probabilistic mapping approach to analyze super-resolution image data, we detect changes in the organization of the synaptonemal complex in wild-type animals that coincide with crossover designation. We also found that our syp-4 mutant perturbs SC architecture.

Measured thermal conductivities of ~1.38 ± 0.22 W m −1 K −1 in PVA/defective filler composites is higher than those of ~0.86 ± 0.21 W m −1 K −1 in PVA/perfect filler composites, while measured thermal conductivities in defective fillers are lower than those of perfect fillers. We identify how thermal transport occurs across heterogeneous interfaces. Thermal transport measurements, neutron scattering, quantum mechanical modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that vibrational coupling between PVA and defective fillers at PVA/filler interfaces enhances thermal conductivity, suggesting that defects in polymer composites improve thermal transport by promoting this vibrational coupling.",

Although the rate-limiting step of this reaction is catalyzed by 5α-reductase (5αR), the role of its two primary isoenzymes, 5αR1 and 5αR2, in stress reactivity remains unclear. Here, we found that acute stress led to increased levels of 5αR2, but not 5αR1, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male, but not female, rats. Down-regulation of 5αR2 in the mPFC significantly reduced stress response in males, and similar sexual dimorphic effects were observed in a novel line of 5αR2 knockout rats. Notably, 5αR1 regulated baseline AP synthesis, whereas 5αR2 enabled AP production under stress. Acute AP administration restored stress response in 5αR2 knockdown rats. Single-nucleus transcriptomics showed that 5αR2 enabled stress-induced protein translation in neurons and glia. These results highlight the crucial role of 5αR2 in mediating sex-specific differences in acute stress reactivity.",

We have found that Suppressor of site III Qo Electron Leak 1.2 (S3QEL 1.2), a specific inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondrial complex III, and myxothiazol, a complex III inhibitor, decrease IL-10 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–activated macrophages. IL-10 down-regulation is likely to be mediated by suppression of c-Fos, which is a subunit of activator protein 1 (AP1), a transcription factor required for IL-10 gene expression. S3QEL 1.2 impairs IL-10 production in vivo after LPS challenge and promotes the survival of mice bearing B16F10 melanoma by lowering tumor growth.

By integrating these generative and discriminative steps, we create a Peptide Prioritization via CLIP (PepPrCLIP) pipeline and validate highly ranked, target-specific peptides experimentally, both as inhibitory peptides and as fusions to E3 ubiquitin ligase domains.

We demonstrate that ZSWIM6 localizes to the nucleus where it associates with repressive chromatin regulators. Disruption of Zswim6 in ventral telencephalic progenitors leads to increased chromatin accessibility and transcriptional dysregulation. Ablating Zswim6 in either striatal direct or indirect pathway spiny projection neurons resulted in similar cell-autonomous changes in excitatory but not inhibitory synaptic transmission. Specifically, Zswim6 disruption altered the desensitization properties of AMPA receptors, leading to enhanced synaptic recruitment of SPNs, explaining SPN-subtype specific effects on activity and behavioral sub-structure.

Metabolic reconstruction of 639 metagenome-assembled genomes revealed widespread potential for carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and vitamin metabolism. Although the R 2 value for salinity explained 70% of taxonomic variation, it accounted only for 17% of functional variation. The limited variation was attributed to typical high-salinity bacteria exhibiting enrichment in genes for thiamine, pyridoxal, and betaine biosynthesis, which likely contribute to stress mitigation and osmotic homeostasis in response to salinity variations.

To investigate this, we generated mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1, distal FAO enzyme) knockout macrophages. 13 C-carbon tracing confirmed reduced FA-derived carbon incorporation into histone H3, and RNA sequencing identified diminished interferon-stimulated gene expression in the absence of ACAT1. Chromatin accessibility at the Stat1 locus was diminished in ACAT1 −/− cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated reduced acetyl-H3 binding to Stat1 promoter/enhancer regions, and increasing histone acetylation rescued Stat1 expression. Interferon-β release was blunted in ACAT1 −/− and recovered by ACAT1 reconstitution. Furthermore, ACAT1-dependent histone acetylation required an intact acetylcarnitine shuttle. Last, obese subjects’ monocytes exhibited increased ACAT1 and histone acetylation levels. Thus, our study identifies an intriguing link between FAO-mediated epigenetic control of type I interferon signaling and uncovers a potential mechanistic nexus between obesity and type I interferon signaling.",

          "abstract": "A major limiting factor in the success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumors is targeting tumor antigens also found on normal tissues. CAR T cells against GD2 induced rapid, fatal neurotoxicity because of CAR recognition of GD2 + normal mouse brain tissue. To improve the selectivity of the CAR T cell, we engineered a synthetic Notch receptor that selectively expresses the CAR upon binding to P-selectin, a cell adhesion protein overexpressed in tumor neovasculature. These tumor microenvironment actuated T (MEAT) cells ameliorated T cell infiltration in the brain, preventing fatal neurotoxicity while maintaining antitumor efficacy. We found that conditional CAR expression improved the persistence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes because of enhanced metabolic fitness of MEAT cells and the infusion of a less differentiated product. This approach increases the repertoire of targetable solid tumor antigens by restricting CAR expression and subsequent killing to cancer cells only and provides a proof-of-concept model for other targets.",

In this study, however, we found that TAZ, but not YAP, is associated with the Golgi apparatus in macrophages activated via Toll-like receptor ligands during the resolution phase of inflammation. Golgi-associated TAZ enhanced vesicle trafficking and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in M1 macrophage independent of the Hippo pathway. Depletion of TAZ in tumor-associated macrophages promoted tumor growth by suppressing the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Moreover, in a diet-induced metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis model, macrophage-specific deletion of TAZ ameliorated liver inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Thus, targeted therapies being developed against YAP/TAZ-TEAD are ineffective in macrophages. Together, our results introduce Golgi-associated TAZ as a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention to treat tumor progression and chronic inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Hydra regenerates one head when cut, but how forces shaping the head are coordinated remains unclear. Soft compression of Hydra ’s head-regenerating tissues induces the formation of viable, two-headed animals. Compression creates new topological defects in the supracellular orientational order of muscular actin fibers, associated with additional heads. Theory supports that these defects organize muscle stresses required to shape the head. By compressing head-regenerating tissues along their body axis, we formed toroidal tissues, whose unique topology allows for the absence of defects. Toroids with no actin defects did not regenerate. Toroids with actin defects regenerated into viable toroidal animals with a bifurcated body. Topological defects in the actin orientational order are thus necessary for complete regeneration of Hydra , defining actin topological defects as mechanical organizers of morphogenesis.",

Here, we show that optogenetic activation of locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons immediately increased sleep propensity following a transient wakefulness, contrasting with many other arousal-promoting neurons whose activation induces sustained wakefulness. Fiber photometry showed that repeated optogenetic or sensory stimulation caused a rapid reduction of calcium activity in LC neurons and steep declines in noradrenaline/norepinephrine (NE) release in both the LC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Knockdown of α 2 A adrenergic receptors in LC neurons mitigated the decline of NE release induced by repetitive stimulation and extended wakefulness, demonstrating an important role of α 2 A receptor–mediated auto-suppression of NE release. Together, these results suggest that functional fatigue of LC noradrenergic neurons, which reduces their wake-promoting capacity, contributes to sleep pressure.",

          "abstract": "Many bacteria live in polymeric fluids, such as mucus, environmental polysaccharides, and extracellular polymers in biofilms. However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in polymer-free fluids. Here, we show that interactions with polymers shape a fundamental feature of bacterial life—how they proliferate in space in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that when polymer is sufficiently concentrated, cells generically and reversibly form large serpentine “cables” as they proliferate. By combining experiments with biophysical theory and simulations, we demonstrate that this distinctive form of colony morphogenesis arises from an interplay between polymer-induced entropic attraction between neighboring cells and their hindered ability to diffusely separate from each other in a viscous polymer solution. Our work thus reveals a pivotal role of polymers in sculpting proliferating bacterial colonies, with implications for how they interact with hosts and with the natural environment, and uncovers quantitative principles governing colony morphogenesis in such complex environments.",

We compared the microbial communities of thermal bleaching–resistant (TBR) and thermal bleaching–sensitive (TBS) corals using metabarcoding and metagenomics. Our multidomain approach revealed stable distinct microbial compositions between thermal phenotypes. Notably, TBR corals were inherently enriched with microbial eukaryotes, particularly Symbiodiniaceae, linked to photosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of antibiotic and antitumor compounds and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor proteins, crucial for cell wall regulation and metabolite exchange. In contrast, TBS corals were dominated by bacterial metabolic genes related to nitrogen, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. The inherent microbiome differences between TBR and TBS corals, already observed before thermal stress, point to distinct holobiont phenotypes associated to thermal bleaching resistance, offering insights into mechanisms underlying coral response to climate-induced stress.",

In a high-content image-based screen of the human ubiquitome, we here identify the E3 ligase Pellino 3 (PELI3) as a crucial regulator of starvation-induced autophagy. Mechanistically, PELI3 localizes to autophagic membranes, where it interacts with the ATG8 proteins through an LC3-interacting region (LIR). This facilitates PELI3-mediated ubiquitination of ULK1, driving ULK1’s subsequent proteasomal degradation. PELI3 depletion leads to an aberrant accumulation and mislocalization of ULK1 and disrupts the early steps of autophagosome formation. Genetic deletion of Peli3 in mice impairs fasting-induced autophagy in the liver and enhances starvation-induced hepatic steatosis by reducing autophagy-mediated clearance of lipid droplets. Notably, PELI3 expression is decreased in the livers of patients with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), suggesting its role in hepatic steatosis development in humans. The findings suggest that PELI3-mediated control of autophagy plays a protective role in liver health.",

We generated a site-specific ADC offering high-affinity, cross-species reactivity, and efficient internalization of the anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody, FL1, carrying a potent anthracycline derivative (PNU-158692). In vitro, FL1-PNU exhibited potent and specific cytotoxicity against uPAR-expressing PDAC cell lines, stromal and immune cells, and bystander killing of uPAR-negative cells. In vivo, the ADC induced remission or sustained tumor regression and extended survival in xenograft models. In syngeneic orthotopic models, the antitumor effect promoted immunomodulation by enhancing infiltrating immune effectors and decreasing immunosuppressive cells.

The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has long been held to act as a passive relay for visual information, but recent findings suggest a largely underestimated functional plasticity in the dLGN. However, the cellular mechanisms supporting this plasticity have not yet been explored. We show here that monocular deprivation (MD), an experimental model of amblyopia, reduces the intrinsic excitability of dLGN cells. Furthermore, dLGN neurons exhibit long-term potentiation of their intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) when suprathreshold afferent retinal inputs are stimulated at 40 hertz or when spikes are induced with current injection. LTP-IE is observed after eye opening, requires calcium influx, is expressed through the down-regulation of Kv1 channels, and is altered following MD.

Cultured bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from these mitochondria CIII–deficient mice released less IL-10 than controls following TLR3 or TLR4 stimulation. Unexpectedly, restoring mitochondrial respiration without generating superoxide using alternative oxidase (AOX) was not sufficient to reverse LPS-induced endotoxic shock susceptibility or restore IL-10 release. However, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) rescued IL-10 release in mitochondria CIII-deficient BMDMs following LPS stimulation.
