          "abstract": "The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood 1 . Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement 2,3 . We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels 4 . Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla) 5,6 , chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions 7,8 . Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes 9,10 , without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence 11,12 , our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan.",

          "abstract": "Honeybees are important crop pollinators, but they increasingly face pollen starvation as a result of agricultural intensification and climate change 1 . Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, which often leads to their demise 2 . Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds do not sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen 3,4 . Here we describe a technological advance in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols present in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated this yeast strain into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies exclusively fed with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. The use of this method to incorporate sterol supplements into pollen substitutes will enable honeybee colonies to produce brood in the absence of floral pollen. Optimized diets created using this yeast strain could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources and stem the decline in wild bee populations.",

          "abstract": "Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy 1 . They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration, and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels 2 . Polyamines have been linked to pain, showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models 3 . However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. Here, undertaking a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK Biobank (UKB), we found a significant association between pain intensity and variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system, Slc45a4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron subtypes within the dorsal root ganglion, including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat- and algogen-induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of C-polymodal nociceptors. Our findings therefore establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.",

          "abstract": "The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10 8 and 10 6 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively 1–10 . Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower 11–17 . Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10 7 cm −2 and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 10 7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record 9,10 . This quality enables Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaux below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron–electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3–5 compared with unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.",

          "abstract": "Tight control of intracellular Ca 2+ levels is fundamental as they are used to control numerous signal transduction pathways 1 . Plasma membrane Ca 2+ -ATPases (PMCAs) have a crucial role in this process by extruding Ca 2+ against a steep concentration gradient from the cytosol to the extracellular space 2 . Although new details of PMCA biology are constantly being uncovered, the structural basis of the most distinguishing features of these pumps, namely, transport rates in the kilohertz range and regulation of activity by the plasma membrane phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , has so far remained elusive. Here we present the structures of mouse PMCA2 in the presence and absence of its accessory subunit neuroplastin in eight different stages of its transport cycle. Combined with whole-cell recordings that accurately track PMCA-mediated Ca 2+ extrusion in intact cells, these structures enable us to establish the first comprehensive transport model for a PMCA, reveal the role of disease-causing mutations and uncover the structural underpinnings of regulatory PMCA–phospholipid interaction. The transport cycle-dependent dynamics of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 are fundamental for its role as a ‘latch’ promoting the fast release of Ca 2+ and opening a passageway for counter-ions. These actions are required for maintaining the ultra-fast transport cycle. Moreover, we identify the PtdIns(4,5)P 2 -binding site as an unanticipated target for drug-mediated manipulation of intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Our work provides detailed structural insights into the uniquely fast operation of native PMCA-type Ca 2+ pumps and its control by membrane lipids and drugs.",

          "abstract": "Atomic partial charges, integral to understanding molecular structure, interactions and reactivity, remain an ambiguous concept lacking a precise quantum-mechanical definition 1,2 . The accurate determination of atomic particle charges has far-reaching implications in fields such as chemical synthesis, applied materials science and theoretical chemistry, to name a few 3 . They play essential parts in molecular dynamics simulations, which can act as a computational microscope for chemical processes 4 . Until now, no general experimental method has quantified the partial charges of individual atoms in a chemical compound. Here we introduce an experimental method that assigns partial charges based on crystal structure determination through electron diffraction, applicable to any crystalline compound. Seamlessly integrated into standard electron crystallography workflows, this approach requires no specialized software or advanced expertise. Furthermore, it is not limited to specific classes of compounds. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by its application to a wide array of compounds, including the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the amino acids histidine and tyrosine, and the inorganic zeolite ZSM-5. We refer to this new concept as ionic scattering factors modelling. It fosters a more comprehensive and precise understanding of molecular structures, providing opportunities for applications across numerous fields in the chemical and materials sciences.",

          "abstract": "Living cells depend on an intricate network of chemical reactions catalysed by enzymes, which sometimes make mistakes that lead to their inactivation. Here we report a metabolite-based mechanism for preserving enzyme function in an unfavourable environment. We found that the enzyme TGDS produces UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, a mimic of the reaction intermediate of the enzyme UXS1, which regenerates the essential cofactor NAD + within the catalytic pocket of UXS1 by completing its catalytic cycle. Thus, the production of an ‘enzyme-rescue metabolite’ by TGDS represents a mechanism for maintaining the activity of an enzyme in a subcellular compartment where NAD + is scarce. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that the inability to produce sufficient amounts of this enzyme-rescue metabolite leads to the inactivation of UXS1, impairing the synthesis of specific glycans that are crucial for skeletal development. This provides an explanation for the development of the hereditary skeletal disorder Catel–Manzke syndrome in individuals with TGDS deficiency. Defects in similar protective layers might contribute to metabolic changes in other diseases that cannot be explained with common concepts in metabolic biochemistry.",

          "abstract": "While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines 1,2 . Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population 3–8 . However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs 5,7,9–11 . Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users ( N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits 1 . Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area.",

          "abstract": "B-1 cells are innate-like immune cells abundant in serosal cavities with antibodies enriched in bacterial recognition, yet their existence in humans has been controversial 1–3 . The CD5 + B-1a subset expresses anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and CTLA4 and can be immunoregulatory 4–6 . Unlike conventional B cells that are continuously replenished, B-1a cells are produced early in life and maintained through self-renewal 7 . Here we show that the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 are critical regulators of B-1a cells. LEF1 expression is highest in fetal and bone marrow B-1 progenitors, whereas the levels of TCF1 are higher in splenic and peritoneal B-1 cells than in B-1 progenitors. TCF1–LEF1 double deficient mice have reduced B-1a cells and defective B-1a cell maintenance. These transcription factors promote MYC-dependent metabolic pathways and induce a stem-like population upon activation, partly via IL-10 production. In the absence of TCF1 and LEF1, B-1 cells proliferate excessively and acquire an exhausted phenotype with reduced IL-10 and PDL1 expression. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of B-1 cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 fails to suppress brain inflammation. These transcription factors are also expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells and in a B-1-like population that is abundant in pleural fluid and circulation of some patients with pleural infection. Our findings define a TCF1–LEF1-driven transcriptional program that integrates stemness and regulatory function in B-1a cells.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells produce over 1,000 different lipid species that tune organelle membrane properties, control signalling and store energy 1,2 . How lipid species are selectively sorted between organelles to maintain specific membrane identities is largely unclear, owing to the difficulty of imaging lipid transport in cells 3 . Here we measured the retrograde transport and metabolism of individual lipid species in mammalian cells using time-resolved fluorescence imaging of bifunctional lipid probes in combination with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry and mathematical modelling. Quantification of lipid flux between organelles revealed that directional, non-vesicular lipid transport is responsible for fast, species-selective lipid sorting, in contrast to the slow, unspecific vesicular membrane trafficking. Using genetic perturbations, we found that coupling between energy-dependent lipid flipping and non-vesicular transport is a mechanism for directional lipid transport. Comparison of metabolic conversion and transport rates showed that non-vesicular transport dominates the organelle distribution of lipids, while species-specific phospholipid metabolism controls neutral lipid accumulation. Our results provide the first quantitative map of retrograde lipid flux in cells 4 . We anticipate that our pipeline for mapping of lipid flux through physical and chemical space in cells will boost our understanding of lipids in cell biology and disease.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and highly therapy-resistant brain tumour 1,2 . Although advanced disease has been intensely investigated, the mechanisms that underpin the earlier, likely more tractable, stages of GBM development remain poorly understood. Here we identify axonal injury as a key driver of GBM progression, which we find is induced in white matter by early tumour cells preferentially expanding in this region. Mechanistically, axonal injury promotes gliomagenesis by triggering Wallerian degeneration, a targetable active programme of axonal death 3 , which we show increases neuroinflammation and tumour proliferation. Inactivation of SARM1, the key enzyme activated in response to injury that mediates Wallerian degeneration 4 , was sufficient to break this tumour-promoting feedforward loop, leading to the development of less advanced terminal tumours and prolonged survival in mice. Thus, targeting the tumour-induced injury microenvironment may supress progression from latent to advanced disease, thereby providing a potential strategy for GBM interception and control.",

          "abstract": "Third-party punishment is theorized by some scholars to be essential to the evolution of large-scale cooperation, but empirically, it often fails to bring about its desired effects. Here, we suggest that third-party punishment destabilizes cooperation when third parties have profit motives to punish. Across nine economic games and judgment experiments (including four preregistered studies), we find that when third-party punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately and remain lower even when punishment outcomes are optimized to support cooperative behavior. Profitable third-party punishment causes targets of punishment to anticipate antisocial punishment and perceive social norms in terms of self-interest, suggesting that the introduction of payment degrades the communicative signals that punishment is meant to convey about punishers’ intentions and social norms. Critically, participants who would benefit from increased cooperation inadvertently reduce their own monetary compensation by opting in to experimental conditions that pay punishers, suggesting that they intuitively fail to consider the signaling consequences of profit motives to punish. Implications for systems of punishment and cooperation in real-world contexts are discussed.",

For these systems, Indigenous Knowledge offers unique insights that reflect millennia of intimate engagement with local landscapes, while Western Science can offer additional understanding of the emergence of climates and ecological conditions that are novel at evolutionary timescales. Here, we weave Indigenous Knowledge together with a multicentury history of fire, landuse, and forest development derived from tree rings to retell a more complete history of human engagement with the places commonly referred to as Wisconsin and Minnesota Points at the head of Lake Superior in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Our aim in this work is to create mutual reciprocal benefits for those involved in this work to disrupt a long history of extractive research and to honor the knowledge shared with us by reducing barriers to the revitalization of traditional cultural and landuse practices. This intensely local study, contextualized by substantial bodies of Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science, illustrates the importance of place-based and community-based research for understanding the role of Indigenous fire stewardship in shaping pine barrens sites and demonstrates how these fine-scale relationships are linked to regional landscape diversity yet may be invisible to other proxy-based studies. These results help (re)center Indigenous Knowledge and traditional fire-use practices in the process of ecocultural fire restoration for the creation of diverse, resilient, and just socioecological systems that continue to transition toward a warmer future.",

          "abstract": "In mammalian genomes, cytosine modifications form a layer of regulatory information alongside the genetic code. Decoding this information is crucial to our understanding of biology and disease. Established sequencing methods cannot simultaneously resolve cytosine’s three most common forms—cytosine (C), 5-methylcytosine (mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC)—across both strands of the DNA double helix. Thus, how epigenetic information is distributed in DNA remains unclear. Here, we present S trand- Co upled T andem C ytosine H ydroxymethylation and methylation sequencing (SCoTCH-seq): an accurate and quantitative, base-resolution approach to sequence genomes, together with mC and hmC, in both strands of the same DNA fragment. We show that different forms of cytosine combine across the double helix at CpG sites to form discrete information states in the mouse epigenome. These CpG states have distinct genomic distributions—including at promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies—and have different relationships with transcription. We show that while all possible forms of hydroxymethylation occur, hmC is predominantly asymmetric and that different forms of asymmetric hmC are not equivalent. Our findings demonstrate that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine combines with different cytosine variants across the DNA double helix to form distinct states of regulatory information.",

          "abstract": "The KRAS oncogene has been associated with many types of cancer, including pancreatic, lung, and colorectal. For decades, its gene products were thought to be undruggable. However, during the last decade, a large battery of KRAS inhibitors selective against specific mutations (KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D ), panKRAS inhibitors active against all KRAS isoforms, or even panRAS inhibitors, capable of inhibiting the three members of the RAS family, have been developed. In mice, the Kras locus is essential for embryonic development and can sustain adult homeostasis in the absence of Hras and Nras expression. Thus, we considered of interest to interrogate the role of the Kras locus in an experimental system to generate potentially relevant information regarding the use of panKRAS or panRAS inhibitors in the clinic. Here, we report that systemic ablation of Kras expression in adult mice does not induce significant changes in overall survival, body weight, glucose levels, metabolic profile, or heart function. In contrast, flow cytometry and histopathological analyses of organs such as blood, bone marrow, and spleen showed a significant increase of the myeloid lineage leading to myelomonocytic metaplasia. In this context, replacement of the KRAS isoforms by HRAS is sufficient to maintain adult homeostasis, suggesting that the unique properties of the Kras locus are primarily due to its pattern of expression rather than to the activity of its gene products.",

Still, the frequency of sympatric speciation and its relationship to morphological divergence in plants remains poorly understood, especially in plants. Here, we analyze the geographic distributions, traits, and divergence times of palm and conifer sister species (740 species from 108 genera) to determine the dominant geographic mode and role of morphological divergence in plant speciation. We show that allopatric speciation is dominant, and while frequent sympatric speciation cannot be discounted, the most likely scenario is that zero (conifers) or 10% (palms) of speciation events occur in sympatry. Our models show that the incidence of sympatry among sister pairs rises rapidly within the first million years after speciation and then declines, suggesting that species failing to attain sympatry early tend to remain allopatric. Finally, we find no evidence for morphological divergence in allopatric or sympatric palms. Our findings question the link between speciation and morphological divergence and suggest that while plants and animals share similar modes of speciation, plants exhibit a complex spatiotemporal dynamic, challenging the typical vertebrate pattern of steadily increasing sympatry.",

Here, we study these circuits with a focus on undulatory locomotion as produced by elongated fish such as eels and lampreys. We address three questions: i) How do proprioception (stretch feedback) and exteroception (pressure on skin) interact with local oscillators to generate stable swimming patterns? ii) Can these feedback loops also contribute to dry ground locomotion? iii) Can they explain the remarkable robustness of eels against spinal cord transections? To address these questions, we developed abstract models of the locomotion circuits based on coupled phase oscillators, local stretch and pressure feedback loops, and simulated muscle models that were tested both in simulation and with a real undulatory robot. We also performed swimming experiments with eels before and after spinal cord transections. We found that stretch and pressure feedback work well together in swimming, as they contribute to rapid pattern generation and can, in principle, both replace direct couplings between oscillators. Interestingly, the swimming controllers could generate good ground locomotion when placed in an arena with pegs. For ground locomotion, the stretch feedback is more beneficial than pressure feedback. Finally, our models could replicate the remarkable ability of eels to keep swimming shortly after a full spinal cord transection. We found that stretch feedback and the ability of oscillators to spontaneously oscillate are likely explanations for keeping the neural oscillators active and coordinated below the transection.",

          "abstract": "Rates of phenotypic evolution vary across traits, and these evolutionary patterns themselves evolve. Understanding how development contributes to such patterns remains a challenge because it requires large-scale measurement of phenotypic variation resulting from random mutations across multiple species. Using the experimentally tractable system of nematode vulval development, we quantified the evolution and mutational sensitivity of six cell fates across two clades. First, we find that the cell whose fate evolves fastest is distinct for each clade: P3.p in Caenorhabditis and P4.p in Oscheius . Second, we show that this evolutionary pattern matches the pattern of variation within species of each clade. Third, we find that within each clade, the differential effect on each cell of random mutation, quantified as their mutational phenotypic variance, is sufficient to explain the observed phenotypic evolution. Finally, we propose that the difference between clades is explained by a simple spatial shift across cells of the sensitive region in a Wnt dose–response curve. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the evolving structure of the genotype–phenotype map and measures of developmental sensitivity into the understanding of phenotypic change at both micro- and macroevolutionary scales.",

ZNF93 depletion impairs DNA synthesis, activates replication and DNA damage checkpoints, and triggers proinflammatory phenotypes. Conversely, its overexpression enhances resistance to exogenous genotoxic stress, mirroring the effects observed with APOBEC3B depletion. ZNF93 expression correlates with cell proliferation rates and is overexpressed in many cancer types. These findings suggest that ZNF93 serves as a critical guardian of genome integrity, co-opted by cancer cells to counterbalance APOBEC3B-induced and L1-derived genomic instability and inflammation.",

This sequestration process is mediated by the parasite’s P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesins, which bind select endothelial cell receptors. A subset of PfEMP1 binding human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their cysteine-rich interdomain region alpha 1 (CIDRα1) domains drives the pathogenesis to severe malaria. Despite high sequence diversity among CIDRα1 domains, individuals living in malaria-endemic regions become immune to severe disease in part through acquisition of antibodies inhibiting the PfEMP1–EPCR interaction. Here, we demonstrate an approach to identify pathogen-specific human monoclonal antibodies from plasma, combining mass spectrometry analysis of antigen-purified polyclonal plasma IgG and Ig transcript sequencing. We identified a clonal family of broadly reactive and EPCR binding-inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies against CIDRα1. The antibodies, isolated from a 9-y-old child, exhibited potent inhibition of EPCR binding broadly across CIDRα1 domains as well as binding of infected erythrocytes to EPCR. Structural analysis of one antibody variant complexed with CIDRα1 revealed a shared epitope of the clonal antibody family overlapping the EPCR binding site and the epitopes of two previously identified monoclonal antibodies, C7 and C74, with similar functional patterns. However, although C7, C74, and 110-3 antibodies all depend on the same few residues conserved in CIDRα1 to retain EPCR binding, the 110-3 antibodies contact additional variable residues, reducing their breadth of reactivity across the CIDRα1 family. These data bolster the hypothesis that broadly inhibitory antibodies against severe malaria-associated PfEMP1 target similar epitopes and are commonly developed in malaria-exposed individuals.",

          "abstract": "A record-breaking melt season affected the Arctic glaciers of Svalbard in summer 2024 by a substantial margin. Across the entire archipelago, glacier melting corresponded to an anomaly of up to four SD and exceeded any previous observation. The pan-Svalbard mass loss in summer 2024 amounts to ~61.7 ± 11.1 Gt and corresponds to 1% of the total ice volume on Svalbard and is comparable to that of the Greenland ice sheet (55 ± 35 Gt), which occupies an area about 50 times larger. Altogether, Svalbard and other glacier regions surrounding the Barents Sea lost 102.1 ± 22.9 Gt of ice in a single year and contributed 0.27 ± 0.06 mm (of which 0.16 mm alone is due to Svalbard) to global sea-level, putting the circum-Barents region among the strongest contributors to global sea-level rise in 2024. Most of the 2024 glacier melt occurred during a 6-wk period of persistent atmospheric circulation pattern causing record-high air temperatures, an event with an extremely low recurrence interval under current climate conditions. However, future climate projections suggest that such temperature levels will become increasingly commonplace by the end of the 21st century, potentially even surpassing those of 2024. Svalbard’s summer of 2024 serves as a forecast for future glacier meltdown in the Arctic, offering a glimpse into conditions 70 y ahead.",

          "abstract": "Hybridization is a double-edged sword: While it can erode distinct evolutionary lineages, it can also introduce genetic diversity and adaptive potential into dwindling populations. In the Critically Endangered Balearic shearwater ( Puffinus mauretanicus ), this dilemma is exacerbated by a limited understanding of the extent and consequences of hybridization with the Yelkouan shearwater ( Puffinus yelkouan ). This knowledge gap has limited the scope of science-based conservation strategies to avoid the Balearic shearwater’s imminent extinction. Here, we investigate shearwater hybridization dynamics and their effect on genome-wide diversity in the Balearic shearwater. Divergence dating, demographic modeling, and admixture analyses suggest that these two poorly differentiated shearwater lineages have experienced recurrent episodes of divergence and widespread hybridization during glacial cycles. Selection scans reveal a 500 kb region hosting an adaptive haplotype that potentially underpins interspecific differences in migratory behavior and which has been repeatedly introgressed between the two taxa. Moreover, we show that interspecific gene flow has prevented increases in homozygosity and genetic load, and through forward simulations, we illustrate how it can buffer the negative effects of future population bottlenecks in the Balearic shearwater. Our findings illustrate how introgression can be crucial for maintaining genetic diversity in threatened taxa and highlight the need for considering the protection of hybridization in conservation plans.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is generally expected to stimulate plant carbon (C) sequestration and promote tree growth, thereby mitigating atmospheric CO 2 accumulation. Yet, the magnitude of N deposition contribution to forest productivity remains contentious. While correlative studies suggest substantial plant growth enhancement, controlled fertilization experiments typically demonstrate a limited impact. This discrepancy may arise from whether or not to consider canopy N uptake processes. Here, we conducted a 10-y field experiment comparing canopy addition of N (CAN) with understory addition of N (UAN) at the rate of 0, 25, and 50 kg N ha –1 y –1 in a temperate deciduous forest in central China. We show that CAN significantly enhanced net primary productivity by 37.0% over control, driven by enhanced leaf litterfall, wood and fine root production, whereas UAN effects were marginal (8%). 15 N isotopic tracing revealed that CAN, through enhanced plant N uptake and increased ecosystem N retention, yielded a 3.5-fold higher C sequestration efficiency (∆C/∆N) of 54.5 ± 7.7 kg C kg –1 N, than UAN (12.2 ± 3.4 kg C kg –1 N) resulted from greater N loss through leaching. Physiological measurements indicated CAN enhanced leaf photosynthetic rates, modified leaf morphology, and extended leaf lifespan via delayed senescence. These findings provide robust empirical evidence that canopy N uptake is crucial for maximizing N-induced forest productivity, thereby holding significant implications for refining global C models and urging modelers to incorporate canopy processes for more accurate projections of future C sinks and climate change mitigation strategies.",

Coronaviruses exhibit highly selective packaging of their gRNA, in spite of the presence of a large excess of subgenomic viral and host RNA in infected cells. Failure to accomplish this selectivity does not impair virion assembly but renders the virus vulnerable to host innate immunity. In the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) packaging selectivity is brought about by a packaging signal (PS), an RNA structure found exclusively in gRNA and absent from subgenomic RNAs. However, it is not well resolved how virion structural proteins participate in the recognition of the PS. Previous studies with virions have shown that the nucleocapsid (N) protein carboxy-terminal RNA-binding domain (CTD) and the carboxy-terminal tail (domain N3) both have roles in PS recognition. Separately, work with a virus-like particle system has implicated the viral membrane (M) protein as the main factor in this process. Here, we pinpoint key amino acids in the CTD and domain N3 that govern selective gRNA packaging into virions, and we provide genetic evidence that the M protein endodomain also plays a required role. We show that the N protein CTD is the primary determinant of PS recognition, and we localize residues in the CTD structure that are critical for specific and nonspecific RNA binding.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with limited treatment options due to its desmoplastic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which impedes drug delivery and limits T cell infiltration. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown poor efficacy in PDAC, partly due to the desmoplastic stroma and low immunogenicity. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) promotes both fibrosis and immune evasion, making it a compelling target for TME remodeling. Here, we develop a dual-action, programmable immunoprobiotic delivery system (EcN@Nbs-NP@API-1) that combines Pin1 inhibition with PD-L1 blockade to enhance immunotherapy. This system uses Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to selectively deliver nanoparticles encapsulating the Pin1 inhibitor API-1 to PDAC, enabling sustained release to degrade the fibrotic stroma and upregulate PD-L1 on tumor cells, promoting immune infiltration. Engineered EcN also produces anti-PD-L1 nanobodies in situ, synergizing with API-1 to boost CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity. In orthotopic PDAC mouse models, this strategy remodels the TME, enhances immune cell infiltration, and improves antitumor response while minimizing systemic toxicity. Moreover, it shows efficacy in other ECM-rich tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its broader potential. This work presents a promising platform to overcome immunotherapy resistance in solid tumors.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is shifting species distributions, leading to changes in community composition and novel species assemblages worldwide. However, the responses of tropical forests to climate change across large-scale environmental gradients remain largely unexplored. Using long-term data over 66,000 trees of more than 2,500 species occurring over 3,500 m elevation along the hyperdiverse Amazon-to-Andes elevational gradients in Peru and Bolivia, we assessed community-level shifts in species composition over a 40+ y time span. We tested the thermophilization hypothesis, which predicts an increase in the relative abundances of species from warmer climates through time. Additionally, we examined the relative contributions of tree mortality, recruitment, and growth to the observed compositional changes. Mean thermophilization rates (TR) across the Amazon-to-Andes gradient were slow relative to regional temperature change. TR were positive and more variable among Andean forest plots compared to Amazonian plots but were highest at midelevations around the cloud base. Across all elevations, TR were driven primarily by tree mortality and decreased growth of highland (cool-adapted) species rather than an influx of lowland species with higher thermal optima. Given the high variability of community-level responses to warming along the elevational gradients, the high tree mortality, and the slower-than-warming rates of compositional change, we conclude that most tropical tree species, and especially lowland Amazonian tree species, will not be able to escape current or future climate change through upward range shifts, causing fundamental changes to composition and function in Earth’s highest diversity forests.",

          "abstract": "In cardiac muscle, myosin molecules exist in multiple structural states as they transit through their ATPase cycle, including an off-cycle resting or OFF-state with their catalytic heads in a folded structure known as the interacting-heads motif (IHM). The blocked head configuration (BHC) of the IHM is unusual because its light chain binding region is held in an exaggerated prestroke angle stabilized by interactions with its own S2 tail. An additional partial OFF-state, where the second head of the IHM is not folded back onto the blocked head, has been proposed, which still has the blocked head interacting with S2. Many mutations in the human β-cardiac myosin gene that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are thought to destabilize (decrease the population of) the OFF-states. The effects of pathogenic mutations on the folded back structural states are often studied using indirect assays, including a single-ATP turnover assay that detects the biochemical state of myosin functionally. Here, we use a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based sensor for direct quantification in solution of the myosin BHC state. Using the FRET sensor, we provide evidence that the myosin tail acts as an activator of the recovery stroke transition after ATP binding to poststroke state apomyosin and that BHC formation is rapid after ATP binding and depends on formation of the prestroke state. We propose that the positively charged loop 2 of the prestroke state head interacts with the Ring 2 cluster of negatively charged residues on the S2 tail to form a preBHC state that facilitates BHC state formation.",

As such, there is a need to develop new treatments for patients that improve survival and quality of life. Recently, there have been efforts to develop small molecules for heart failure that directly target components of the sarcomere, including cardiac myosin. Danicamtiv is one of these molecules; however, its direct effects on myosin’s single molecule mechanics and kinetics are not well understood. Using optical trapping techniques, stopped flow transient kinetics, and in vitro reconstitution assays, we found that danicamtiv reduces the size of cardiac myosin’s working stroke without affecting actomyosin detachment kinetics at the level of individual crossbridges. We demonstrate that danicamtiv accelerates actomyosin association kinetics, leading to increased recruitment of myosin crossbridges and subsequent thin filament activation at physiologically relevant calcium concentrations. We demonstrate important mechanistic differences with another cardiac myosin binding myotrope, omecamtiv mecarbil. Finally, we computationally model how the observed changes in mechanics and kinetics at the level of single crossbridges can contribute to increased cardiac contraction. Taken together, our results have important implications for the design of sarcomeric-targeting compounds for heart failure.",

A natural algorithm to achieve this is the edge-averaging process, where edges are repeatedly selected at random (according to independent Poisson clocks) and the opinions on the nodes of each selected edge are replaced by their average. The effectiveness of this algorithm is determined by its convergence rate. It is known that on a finite graph of n nodes, the opinions reach approximate consensus in polynomial time. We prove that the convergence is much faster when the initial opinions are disordered (independent identically distributed): The time to reach approximate consensus is O ( log 2 n ) , and this bound is sharp. For infinite graphs, we show that for every p ≥ 1 , if the initial opinions are in L p , then the opinion at each vertex converges to the mean in L p , and if p &gt; 4 , then almost sure convergence holds as well.",

          "authors": "Alejandro V. Cano, Olaf P. Jensen, Vasilis Dakos",
          "abstract": "Fish population biomass fluctuates through time in ways that may be either gradual or abrupt. While abrupt shifts in fish population productivity have been shown to be common, they are rarely integrated into stock assessment or fishery management, in part because of the difficulty of predicting when abrupt shifts may occur and which stocks are prone to such shifts. In this study, we address the latter challenge by designing a mechanism-agnostic context-specific approach that is based on exploiting the dynamical properties of fish population fluctuations for detecting potential abrupt shifts. We use time series of fish population biomass from three global datasets, first, to classify their shapes into abrupt and nonabrupt (linear, quadratic, or no change) classes, and, second, to predict classified shapes based only on their dynamical footprint (a set of metrics such as variance, autocorrelation, etc, of the time series). We find that populations prone to abrupt shifts can be detected with moderate accuracy in the three datasets in spite of data limitations. In total, we identified 50 populations at risk of future abrupt shifts across 11 different Large Marine Ecosystem regions. Our context-specific approach offers critical insights into population stability and enables the identification of stocks whose dynamical properties suggest that they would benefit from more precautionary management.",

          "abstract": "Phytophthora soja e-induced root rot poses a major threat to soybean production. While the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean– P. sojae interactions have been extensively studied, their biochemical basis remains largely unexplored. Previous research has identified key metabolic modules involved in pathogen defense, but structural diversity has largely been constrained by studies on single soybean accessions. Here, we broadened the chemical search space to a diverse soybean germplasm collection using high-throughput metabolomics as a powerful tool for comprehensive metabolic profiling. Chemical classes of lipids and phenylpropanoids again retrieved the most pronounced responses upon P. sojae infection in general. A two-layer analytical strategy further finely resolved metabolites into pathogenesis-, resistance-, and tolerance-type accumulation patterns, leading to the identification of cinnamaldehyde and coumestrol as potent defense metabolites. Bioassays validated cinnamaldehyde directly and strongly inhibited cyst germination and mycelial growth, and coumestrol, a benzofuran-type metabolite, exhibited broad-spectrum activity against spore germination as an identified phytoalexin. Multiomics analyses nailed down the candidate of coumestrol biosynthesis genes, and genetically overexpression of regulatory genes ( Dir2a/4a/4b ) in hairy root systems increased coumestrol accumulation thus positively correlating with improved host resistance. Interestingly, tolerance-type compounds may serve distinct ecological roles, as exemplified by daidzein, which, despite being classified as a tolerance-type metabolite, recruits more zoospores facilitating secondary infection in fact. This study highlights a systematic approach for population-level investigations and emphasizes the necessity of integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation to accurately predict metabolite or gene ecological functions.",

          "abstract": "The D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) is subject to light-induced damage. In plants, D1 photodamage activates translation of chloroplast psbA mRNA encoding D1, providing D1 for PSII repair. Three D1 assembly factors have been implicated in the regulatory mechanism: HCF244 and RBD1 activate psbA translation, whereas HCF136 represses psbA translation in the dark. To clarify the regulatory circuit, we analyzed psbA ribosome occupancy in dark-adapted and illuminated rbd1 and rbd1;hcf136 double mutants in Arabidopsis and in Zm- hcf244 and Zm- hcf244; Zm- hcf136 double mutants in maize. The results show that RBD1 is required for light-induced psbA translation but has only a small effect on psbA ribosome occupancy in the dark. RBD1 is not required for psbA translation when HCF136 is absent, indicating that RBD1 activates psbA translation in the light by inhibiting HCF136’s repressive effect. By contrast, HCF244 is required to recruit ribosomes to psbA mRNA in light, dark, and in the absence of HCF136. We demonstrate further that HCF244 is not required for the translational activator HCF173 to bind the psbA 5’UTR. These results show that RBD1 is central to the perception of the D1 photodamage that triggers D1 synthesis and that it activates psbA translation by relieving repression by an HCF136-dependent assembly intermediate. HCF244 activates downstream of those events without impacting HCF173’s binding to psbA mRNA. The results implicate a feature of nascent D1 that is affected by both HCF136 and RBD1 as the signal that reports D1 photodamage to regulate psbA translation rate as needed for PSII repair.",

In up to a quarter of individuals with BWSp, the epigenetic alterations are not confined to 11p15.5 imprinting control regions but also involve other imprinted gene clusters (multilocus imprinting disturbance; MLID). In a consanguineous family with two children diagnosed with BWSp and MLID, the affected individuals were homozygous for a missense variant in UHRF1 , a gene previously implicated in the maintenance of DNA methylation. To investigate whether the UHRF1 c. 2001G&gt;C, p.(Lys667Asn) missense substitution predisposes to abnormal establishment/maintenance of genomic imprinting patterns, a genetically engineered mouse model with a Uhrf1 p.(Lys661Asn) variant was developed. Mice homozygous for the variant born to heterozygous mothers did not display an abnormal phenotype, but homozygotes born to healthy homozygous mothers displayed a range of phenotypes including prenatal lethality. Also, MLID was observed in affected mouse embryos. These findings are consistent with biallelic UHRF1 variants in affected individuals resulting in an autosomal recessively inherited cause of MLID in humans and expand the range of epigenetic disorders associated with UHRF1.",

However, independent evidence is required to test this hypothesis. Here, we present extensive proxy data and numerical model results to show that irrespective of the largely hypersaline or oligohaline conditions proposed for the terminal Messinian, the eastern Mediterranean became oxygenated due to the ~1.5-km-high, turbulent and aerated cascade that refilled the basin, which created a salinity-stratified but oxygenated water column that allowed preservation of only the most recalcitrant organic components. Next, oxygen was gradually depleted over a period of up to 12,000 y due to remineralization of sinking organic matter, culminating in a stratified, anoxic basin. It took 33,000 y after flooding (7,000 y longer than suggested previously) for turbulent diffusion to weaken the stratification and allow resumption of convective deep-water renewal, which marked the final return of normal oxygenated marine conditions throughout the Mediterranean.",

Does the brain similarly support generalization across acting body parts for more evolutionarily recent actions, such as tool-use? We tested whether there is a body-part-independent action-type organization in sensorimotor areas by examining fMRI responses for tool-use actions that participants performed with their hands or feet. We additionally included individuals born without hands to test whether hand sensorimotor experience is necessary for the development of this action-type organization. Across analyses, we found a consistent dissociation in the motor system. The primary sensorimotor cortices encoded concrete, body-part specific information in both groups. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network represent abstract, action-type information independent of the body part for both groups. Together, our results suggest that the hierarchical organization of the motor system is not dependent on a long evolutionary history of an action. Further, this organization is not dependent on an individual’s manual sensorimotor experience. Our results also show that the functional reorganization in congenital handlessness follows the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex, revealing the limitations of brain plasticity.

Our models show that multiple phonological systems can be organized through parallel representations, preserving the unique aspects of each language while maintaining shared articulatory features. This parallel structure scaled effectively from two to three languages without needing additional neural architecture, highlighting the inherent efficiency in multilingual processing. Furthermore, the development of phonological representations varied based on the timing of language exposure, showing how earlier-learned languages shape the acquisition of subsequent ones.

We measured the abundance of millions of de novo Mu insertions across four tissue types. Within a tissue, the distribution of de novo Mu allele frequencies was highly reproducible between plants, showing that, despite the stochastic nature of mutation, repeated statistical patterns of mutation abundance emerge. In contrast, there were significant differences in the allele frequency distribution between tissues. At the extremes, root was dominated by a small number of highly abundant de novo insertions, while endosperm was characterized by thousands of insertions at low allele frequencies. Finally, we used the measured pollen allele frequencies to reinterpret a classic genetic experiment, showing that evidence for late Mu activity in pollen is better explained by cell division statistics.

          "abstract": "The bacterial flagellum is a complex nanomachine essential for motility, environmental sensing, and host colonization. While many of its core components have been well characterized, the relevance of proteins such as FliO, which are inconsistently annotated and poorly conserved at the sequence level, has remained ambiguous in their evolutionary and functional status. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic and structural analysis of FliO across &gt;30,000 representative genomes spanning &gt;100 bacterial phyla. Additionally, during this analysis, we found that approximately 40% of bacterial genomes contain flagellar genes—significantly fewer than previously reported. Using a custom pipeline combining low-threshold Hidden Markov models searches, operon context analysis, and structural information, we demonstrate that FliO is present in ~95% of genomes encoding the core flagellar components FliP, FliQ, and FliR. This suggests that FliO is a nearly ubiquitous and ancestral core component of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS). FliO exhibits considerable structural diversity, including lineage-specific acquisitions of LysM and AMIN domains. We identify FliO homologs not only in canonical flagellar systems but also in some virulence-associated T3SS and even some nonflagellated organisms, suggesting functional repurposing and highlighting its functional plasticity. Functional studies in Campylobacter jejuni reveal that FliO and its AMIN domain are critical for efficient amphitrichous flagellation, membrane stability of the export gate component FlhB, and colonization of the host. These findings establish FliO as a core, yet evolutionarily dynamic, component of flagella and provide insights into the evolution and diversification of bacterial secretion systems.",

To investigate the effect of warming duration on plant biomass responses, we analyzed a global dataset of 2,291 paired observations, revealing that warming increased overall aboveground plant biomass by 9.4% and belowground biomass by 2.6%. However, as the warming duration increased, the positive plant biomass response shifted to neutral or negative, with great biomass reductions in regions where mean annual temperatures exceeded 10 °C. Global aboveground biomass is projected to decline by 4 to 16% under a 2 °C increase in climate warming. Our study suggests that long-term climate warming will significantly weaken plant carbon storage, even if temperature increases remain within the targets of the Paris Agreement, and offers empirical constraints for global biomass–climate models.",

Using dense behavioral recordings of mathematicians’ moment-to-moment activity, we find that their blackboard interactions (e.g., writing, gesturing; N = 4 , 653 ) became increasingly unpredictable before an insight, analogous to the critical fluctuations that anticipate transitions in physical and ecological systems. We explore analytically when this early warning signal applies to varied systems with discrete, symbolic dynamics.

          "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring, but validation of the spatial scale(s) at which eDNA reflects extant communities is scarce, particularly in tropical forests: the terrestrial biome with the most concentrated diversity on earth. We leveraged spatially explicit tree inventory data from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in Puerto Rico to validate soil eDNA as a spatially explicit indicator of tree diversity/composition. Using a comprehensive local chloroplast trnL -P6 reference library, we analyzed soil samples at multiple scales through eDNA trnL -P6 metabarcoding. We compared eDNA taxonomic diversity/composition, considering several bioinformatic thresholds, with inventory data across a range of spatial scales, as well as random points to compare observed correlations with random expectations. Despite considerable fine-scale heterogeneity in soil plant eDNA composition, we detected 53 tree Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) across the LFDP, corresponding to 68% of tree OTUs from the census data. Encouragingly, this equated to 98% of the total basal area (and 98% of the total stems). An initial confusion matrix evaluation suggested a highly localized eDNA signal (within 5 m of the sampled locations). However, comparison with random expectations revealed a lack of support for a fine-scale spatial signal due to misclassification (i.e., eDNA false presence or/and false absence) of relatively common taxa. Our study shows that “universal” PCR primer metabarcoding of tree eDNA in tropical soils may be useful for assessing dominant taxa at landscape scales, but not for spatially explicit characterization of rare species and community composition at local scales.",

Sugars and nucleic acids are right-handed, while amino acids are left-handed in biological systems. Likewise, certain metabolites are homochiral, though their handedness varies. However, efforts to address the homochirality problem have often focused on a single compound, a single molecular class, or invoke an extraterrestrial origin. Here, we emphasize the importance of achieving homochirality across an entire prebiotic chemical network and explore a terrestrial pathway for its emergence. This pathway is supported by recent experimental results from several independent studies, as well as analyses of pristine asteroid materials. Our analysis identifies the genome as a key site for achieving network-scale homochirality on early Earth and addresses the opposite handedness of D -nucleic acids and L -peptides in biology through nonenzymatic, stereoselective coded peptide synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale scientific datasets today contain tens of thousands of random variables across millions of samples (for example, the RNA expression levels of 20,000 protein-coding genes across 30 million single cells). Being able to quantify dependencies between these variables would help us discover novel relationships between variables of interest. Simple measures of dependence, such as Pearson correlation, are fast to compute, but limited in that they are designed to detect linear relationships between variables. Complex measures are known with the ability to detect any kind of dependence, but they do not readily scale to many modern datasets of interest. We introduce the InterDependence Score (IDS), a scalable measure of dependence that captures linear and various nonlinear dependencies between random variables. Our IDS algorithm is motivated by a dependence measure defined in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, capable of capturing any type of dependence, and a fast (linear time) algorithm that neural networks natively implement to compute dependencies between random variables. We apply IDS to identify 1) relevant variables for predictive modeling tasks, 2) sets of words forming topics from millions of documents, and 3) sets of genes related to “gene-expression programs” in tens of millions of cells. We provide an efficient implementation that computes IDS between billions of pairs of variables across millions of samples in several hours on a single GPU.

PapB introduces six thioether linkages between internal Cys residues and carbon atom that is α to the side-chain carboxylate of Asp/Glu residues C-terminal to the Cys residues. Herein, we show that PapB also efficiently couples an internal Cys thiol to the C-terminal carboxylate of peptides terminating in D- or β-amino acids, forming α- or β-thioether macrocycles. Moreover, PapB tolerates β- and N-methyl amino acids within the peptide, resulting in the formation of macrocycles that are comprised entirely of unnatural amino acids, such as peptides containing all β-residues.

          "abstract": "Intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs) act as sites of assembly and release of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in macrophages and microglia. Recent work has shown that processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into a C-terminal fragment (CTF), termed C99, inhibits HIV-1 access to CD63+ MVBs and to counteract this, HIV-1 Group-specific antigen (Gag) increases C99 processing into toxic amyloids. However, the underlying reasons for this negative interplay between Gag and C99 remain unclear. Here, we show that HIV-1 Gag polyprotein and APP processing pathways intersect and compete, relying in different ways on two vesicular trafficking components: the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport protein, TSG101, and vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) subunit, VPS4A. VPS4A plays a complex role in infection by both directly regulating virion production and the abundance of distinct CTFs with differing subcellular localizations and effects on infection. Meanwhile, APP and C99’s use of TSG101 for insertion into vesicles limits Gag access to MVBs. Depletion of TSG101 resulted in impaired Gag localization to MVBs and processing into mature virions, and this could be partially reversed by codepletion of APP. By contrast, modulation of TSG101 or APP levels had no effect on the localization patterns of a Gag-P6 mutant that is unable to bind TSG101, while this mutant also failed to promote C99 degradation. Our findings reveal how CTF processing and HIV-1 maturation at MVBs converge in complex ways around VPS4A and TSG101, which in turn underlies how these processes negatively influence one another during virus replication in microglia.",

          "abstract": "Extrinsic apoptosis is initiated by signaling from death receptors, leading to the assembly of RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 complex. Subsequently, caspase-8 forms a filamentous structure through the oligomerization of its tandem death effector domain (tDED), resulting in caspase activation and cell death. Although the DED of FADD ( FADD DED) is homologous to the tDEDs of caspase-8 ( casp8 tDED) and both oligomerize to function, the functional form of FADD DED oligomer in extrinsic apoptosis remains unclear. Here, using cryogenic-electron microscopy, we elucidate the structure of FADD DED filaments comprising three helical chains assembled through three types of iterative interactions. Mutations disrupting FADD DED filament formation impair the recruitment of RIPK1 and caspase-8, and abrogate the cell death response, suggesting that FADD DED filamentation represents an important mechanistic step in the initiation of TNF-induced extrinsic apoptosis. Contrary to the belief that the homotypic death domains of RIPK1 and FADD are solely responsible for their interaction, we here show this interaction requires FADD DED filamentation. Furthermore, cFLIP can disrupt FADD DED filaments, uncovering an additional antiapoptotic mechanism of cFLIP beyond its disruption of caspase-8 filament. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that FADD DED filament thermodynamically favors casp8 tDED monomer over FADD DED monomer, thus explaining the hierarchy and stoichiometry of FADD/caspase-8 complex assembly. These findings highlight the hitherto unappreciated roles of FADD DED filament formation in extrinsic apoptosis.",

Metagenome sequencing and robust statistical analysis have linked specific strains, including the gut bacterium Campylobacter concisus , to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, together known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the roles of this and other strains in disease progression remain to be investigated. Herein, we assess the contribution of C. concisus secondary metabolites to inflammation. Through untargeted metabolomics, we identified a diverse array of nineteen indole-containing metabolites produced by C. concisus , including trisindoline, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. Collectively, these metabolites modulate inflammatory responses by significantly inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. The metabolites act through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor arylhydrocarbon receptor and in vivo intravital imaging revealed a marked increase in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, specifically neutrophils and macrophages, following the administration of trisindoline. Several indole metabolites also exhibited antimicrobial activity against commensal strains that facilitate a proper immune response. Our study provides a possible rationale for the association of C. concisus with IBD and underscores the complex interplay between gut bacteria and host immunity. The identification of indole-derived secondary metabolites as key modulators of inflammation offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Liquid brains conceptualize living systems that operate without central control, where collective outcomes emerge from local and dynamic interactions. This concept extends beyond ants and other social insects to include immune systems, slime molds, and microbiomes. In such systems, connectivity scales with population density, facilitating more efficient information transfer as group size increases. However, in sparse conditions, where fewer individuals interact, movement likely plays a crucial role in shaping connectivity, ensuring optimal collective efficiency. We tested this hypothesis during the foraging process of Aphaenogaster senilis , an ant species that does not primarily rely on chemical communication. We empirically measured ant movement behavior and characterized their foraging dynamics across large spatiotemporal scales, closely reflecting the species’ natural ecology. Integrating observed movement heterogeneity into a neuronal-like model, we quantitatively replicated ants foraging efficiency and spatiotemporal dynamics. Our results reveal that a simple feedback mechanism, mediated by local interactions, governs the foraging patterns of A. senilis . Such feedback is modulated by adjusting the proportion of two coexisting movement behaviors: recruits, which facilitated information transfer and food exploitation by aggregating closely to the nest and the food patches, and scouts, which could bypass this feedback and discover alternative food sources. Therefore, distinct movement patterns contributed differently to optimizing each phase of the foraging process, proving an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. Our findings underscore how incorporating specific biologically grounded insights into complex systems frameworks, enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying collective intelligence in biological systems.",

Cysteine dioxygenation is catalyzed in mammalian cells by 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO), an enzyme that manifests extreme O 2 sensitivity. The canonical substrates of this pathway in mammalia are the regulators of G-protein signaling 4, 5, and 16, as well as interleukin-32. In addition to operating as an O 2 -sensing mechanism, this pathway has previously been described as a sensor of nitric oxide (NO), with robust effects on substrate stability upon modulation of NO bioavailability being widely demonstrated. Despite this, no mechanism to describe the action of NO on the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway has yet been substantiated. We demonstrate that NO can regulate the stability of Cys N-degron substrates indirectly via the regulation of ADO cosubstrate availability. Through competitive, O 2 -dependent inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, NO can substantially modify cellular O 2 consumption rate and, in doing so, alter the availability of O 2 for Nt-Cys dioxygenation. We show that this increase in O 2 availability in response to NO exposure is sufficient to alter both dynamic and steady-state ADO substrate levels. It is likely that this mechanism operates to couple O 2 supply and mitochondrial respiration with responses to G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation.",

However, the neuroimmune mechanisms underlying CIBP remain largely elusive. Substance P (SP), which is known to play a pivotal role in pain perception, became the focal point of our study. To this end, we adopted a comprehensive approach combining behavioral and physiological methods to investigate its role in neuroimmune interactions in CIBP. The results showed that SP released by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via exocytosis initiates CIBP, with its release peaking on the 14th day and correlating with pain behavior. Macrophages were found to infiltrate the DRGs and the sciatic nerves. Notably, in mice with CIBP, the population of macrophage type I was significantly augmented. Significantly, we found that the deletion of macrophages led to a notable alleviation of CIBP, while the blockade of the SP-neurokinin 1 receptor pathway effectively mitigated the infiltration of macrophages and alleviated CIBP. In the advanced phase, DRGs released C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3 and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 to recruit macrophages. A two-phase model for CIBP progression in mice was proposed, with SP-induced macrophage infiltration in the primary phase and chemokine-mediated macrophage recruitment in the advanced phase. Our investigation has unearthed a previously unrecognized mechanism governing the neuroimmune interaction in CIBP, which highlights a critical target for impeding the progression of this debilitating pain, potentially opening up broad avenues for the development of effective therapeutic interventions at different stages of CIBP with cancer development.",

The particles interact through Coulomb forces mediated by the surrounding plasma, and as a result, the effective forces between particles can be nonconservative and nonreciprocal. Machine learning (ML) models are a promising route to learn these complex forces, yet their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. Here, we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in a laboratory dusty plasma. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, nonidentical particles, and learns the effective nonreciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy ( R 2 &gt; 0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model’s accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, identifying large deviations from common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify unknown physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.",

          "abstract": "River flow connectivity, the continuity of fluvial discharge in space and time, provides a crucial lifeline for most biotic communities on Earth. Yet there is still limited understanding of the impacts of climate change and human water withdrawal on river connectivity. Here, we assess the river flow connectivity of 217,001 river reaches in mainland China from 1961 to 2020 and the impact of different climate warming trends and water withdrawals for different sectors. We estimate that naturally intermittent rivers represent about 13% of all river reaches, with a large contrast between northern and southern China (12% vs. 1%, respectively). Although river intermittency decreased slightly during this period (i.e., river connectivity lengthened due to increasing precipitation), warming temperatures offset this decrease by reducing surface water persistence, causing the decrease (−476 vs. −233 km/y) to double when removing the long-term temperature trend. Critically, the length of intermittent rivers increased remarkably from 13 to 50% when considering human water withdrawal by agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, in addition to environmental flow requirements. Our findings highlight the urgent need to maintain sustainable water resources in a warming climate in which unregulated water abstractions increasingly threaten river flow connectivity, particularly in drying regions.",

          "abstract": "Cell and tissue movement in development, cancer invasion, and immune response relies on chemical or mechanical guidance cues. In many systems, this behavior is locally directed by self-generated signaling gradients rather than long-range, prepatterned cues. However, how heterogeneous mixtures of cells interact nonreciprocally and navigate through self-generated gradients remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for the self-organized chemotaxis of heterogeneous cell populations. We find that the relative chemotactic sensitivities of different cell populations control their long-time coupling and comigration dynamics, with boundary conditions such as external cell and attractant reservoirs substantially influencing the migration patterns. Our model predicts an optimal parameter regime that enables robust and colocalized migration. We test our theoretical predictions with in vitro experiments demonstrating the comigration of distinct immune cell populations, and quantitatively reproduce observed migration patterns under wild-type and perturbed conditions. Interestingly, immune cell comigration occurs close to the predicted optimal regime. Finally, we incorporate mechanical interactions into our framework, revealing a nontrivial interplay between chemotactic and mechanical nonreciprocity in driving collective migration. Together, our findings suggest that self-generated chemotaxis is a robust strategy for the navigation of mixed cell populations.",

Selective strengthening of a single “winner” climbing fiber (CF) afferent to each Purkinje cell (PC) and elimination of the other “loser” CF axons in the cerebellum has been a representative model of neural circuit refinement. Here, we examined the role of neurotransmission at CF-PC synapses in their postnatal development. We labeled a subset of CFs in neonatal mice with fluorescent markers and the tetanus toxin light chain to ablate neurotransmitter release from these CFs. Surprisingly, we found that such neurotransmitter release–deficient CFs were able to become the winners. However, synaptic transmission was crucial for the winning CF to extend its synaptic territory along the PC dendritic arbor and eliminate the loser CFs. These findings reveal how synaptic transmission governs multiple steps of synapse elimination but not the selection of the winner input that persists throughout life.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulators control mood, arousal, and behavior by inducing synaptic plasticity via G-protein-coupled receptors. While long-term presynaptic potentiation requires structural changes, mechanisms enabling potentiation within minutes remain unclear. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, we show that octopamine, the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine, potentiates evoked neurotransmitter release on the timescale of one minute via a G-protein-coupled pathway involving presynaptic OAMB receptors and phospholipase C. This fast potentiation correlates with elevated signals of the release factor Unc13A and the scaffolding protein Bruchpilot. Live, single-molecule imaging of endogenously tagged Unc13 revealed its instantly reduced motility and increased concentration in synaptic nanoclusters with potentiation. Presynaptic knockdown of Unc13A fully blocked fast potentiation. Moreover, deleting its N-terminal localization sequence mislocalized the protein fragment to the cytosol, but still allowed for rapid plasma membrane recruitment by diacylglycerol (DAG) analog phorbol esters and octopamine, implicating a role of more C-terminal domains. A point mutation of endogenous Unc13 in its DAG-binding C1 domain blocked plasticity-induced nanoscopic enrichment and synaptic potentiation. The mutation increased basal neurotransmission but reduced Unc13 levels, revealing a gain of function and potential homeostatic compensation. The mutation also blocked phorbol ester–induced potentiation, decreased the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmission, and caused short-term synaptic depression. Homeostatic potentiation induced by postsynaptic receptor block mirrored octopamine-induced Unc13 recruitment and required presynaptic OAMB receptors, indicating overlapping machinery. Thus, rapid Unc13 immobilization and nanoscale compaction are salient features of fast presynaptic potentiation.",

          "abstract": "Sialic acids (Sias) are a diverse family of nine-carbon backbone monosaccharides occupying terminal positions on cell surface and secreted glycans and are abundant at mucosal surfaces. Sias can be modified with O -acetyl esters on the side chain (C7 to C9) hydroxyls. Structural analysis and functional studies of these modifications are challenging due to chemical lability and variable resistance to sialidases. For in-depth analysis of the expression and functions of O -acetyl Sia modifications, we used a unique set of sialoglycan-recognizing probes, HPLC analysis of DMB-derivatized Sias and mice lacking the first known sialate O -acetyltransferase, CASD1. C7/C9- O -acetylated Sias are most abundant in the colon, with lower levels in the heart, brain, and spleen, and minimal levels in other digestive organs of wild-type mice. CASD1 deficiency led to a marked loss of C9/C7- O -acetylated Sias in the colon and other tissues. No differences were observed in colonic O -acetylated Sias from conventional and germ-free wild-type mice, indicating that Sia O -acetylation is independent of the commensal microbiota. Nonetheless, CASD1 deficiency caused subtle changes in microbial gene repertoire consistent with potential exploitation of Sias by subsets of intestinal microbes. Furthermore, CASD1-deficient mice exhibited more severe inflammation and ulceration upon colitis induction compared to controls. Reduced Sia O -acetylation was observed in mice during acute colitis and in colon biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Together, our findings suggest CASD1 is the primary physiologically relevant enzyme to add C7/C8/C9- O -acetyl ester groups to Sias and that these Sia modifications exert important gut-protective functions, perhaps by preventing microbial Sia release and metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly contributed to our understanding of human behavior and decision-making. Traditional RL models, however, often adopt a linear approach to updating reward expectations, potentially oversimplifying the nuanced relationship between human behavior and rewards. To address these challenges and explore models of RL, we utilized a method of model discovery using equation discovery algorithms. This method, currently used mainly in physics and biology, attempts to capture data by proposing a differential equation from an array of suggested linear and nonlinear functions. Using this method, we were able to identify a model of RL which we termed the Quadratic Q-Weighted model. The model suggests that reward prediction errors obey nonlinear dynamics and exhibit negativity biases, resulting in an underweighting of reward when expectations are low, and an overweighting of the absence of reward when expectations are high. We tested the generalizability of our model by comparing it to classical models used in nine published studies. Our model surpassed traditional models in predictive accuracy across eight out of these nine published datasets, demonstrating not only its generalizability but also its potential to offer insights into the complexities of human learning. This work showcases the integration of a behavioral task with advanced computational methodologies as a potent strategy for uncovering the intricate patterns of human cognition, marking a significant step forward in the development of computational models that are both interpretable and broadly applicable.",

          "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC), a statistical correlation of pair-wise brain signals from resting-state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI), is a widely used concept for mapping large-scale functional networks in both humans and animals. However, its underlying causal mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly for strong interhemispheric connectivity (e.g., homotopic connections) consistently observed in FC. In this study, we investigated the neural basis of RS FC in mice using fMRI with anatomically defined patterned optogenetic activation and inhibition of excitatory neurons in six cortical regions. Unlike commonly used optogenetic activation, optogenetic silencing suppresses spontaneous neural activity in a localized region, reducing RS synaptic inputs to downstream networked areas. Consequently, fMRI can track spontaneous functional connections without the neural perturbations associated with excitation. While conventional optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the targeted cortical areas predominantly elicited their ipsilateral functional responses in both cortical and subcortical regions, optogenetic silencing induced both intra- and interhemispheric cortical responses, which were stronger than cortical-subcortical connections. These effects more closely resembled statistically defined RS FC patterns, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of intrinsic FC. By modeling synaptic path length-dependent connectivity patterns based on structural connectivity (SC), we found that spontaneous functional connections can be explained by polysynaptic propagation, whereas evoked activity is largely restricted to monosynaptic pathways. These findings highlight the critical role of polysynaptic pathways in shaping spontaneous connectivity, suggesting that RS FC arises from causal interactions of spontaneous ongoing neural activity.",

We study the rate of IUs in 48 languages from every continent and from 27 distinct language families.

However, there have been few studies that investigate various types of cfDNA fragmentomics patterns in individuals with other diseases.

We found that individuals with venous thromboembolism, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, or scleroderma have cfDNA fragmentation signatures that closely resemble those found in individuals with advanced cancers. Furthermore, these signatures were highly correlated with increases in inflammatory markers in the blood. We demonstrate that these similarities in fragmentation signatures lead to high rates of false positives in individuals with autoimmune or vascular disease when evaluated using conventional binary classification approaches for multicancer earlier detection (MCED). To address this issue, we introduced a multiclass approach for MCED that integrates fragmentation signatures with protein biomarkers and achieves improved specificity in individuals with autoimmune or vascular disease while maintaining high sensitivity. Though these data put substantial limitations on the specificity of fragmentomics-based tests for cancer diagnostics, they also offer ways to improve the interpretability of such tests.

Here, we identify TANK-binding kinase (TBK1) as a critical signaling molecule enriched and activated in TAMs of BCBM tumors, playing an indispensable role in BCBM development and metastatic outgrowth in the brain. Mechanistically, BCBM cell-secreted matrix metalloproteinase 1 binds to protease-activated receptor 1 and integrin αVβ5 on macrophages, leading to TBK1 activation mediated by the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. Reciprocally, TBK1-regulated TAMs produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to drive breast cancer cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion, ultimately contributing to BCBM development and brain metastatic outgrowth. Inhibition of TBK1 signaling in TAMs or GM-CSF receptor in cancer cells impedes BCBM development and brain metastatic outgrowth. Correspondingly, the TBK1–GM-CSF signaling axis correlates with lower overall survival in patients with BCBM.

The supramarginal gyrus (SMG) is a structure within the inferior parietal lobule that specifically processes object-directed patterns of manipulation during functional object use. Here, we demonstrate that neural representations of complex object-directed actions in the SMG can be predicted by a linear encoding model that componentially builds complex actions from an empirically defined set of kinematic synergies. Each kinematic synergy represents a unique combination of finger, hand, wrist, and arm postures and movements. Control analyses demonstrate that models based on image-computable similarity (AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16) robustly predict variance in visual areas, but not in the SMG. We also show that SMG activity is specifically modulated by kinematic (as opposed to visual) properties of object-directed actions. The action-relevant, as opposed to visually relevant, nature of the representations supported by the SMG aligns with findings from neuropsychological studies of upper limb apraxia. These findings support a model in which kinematic synergies are the basic unit of representation, out of which the SMG componentially builds object-directed actions. In combination with other findings [Q. Chen et al., Cereb. Cortex 28 , 2162–2174 (2018)], we suggest that kinematic synergies are related to complex object-directed actions in a similar way to how articulatory and voicing features combine to form phonological segments in spoken language production.",

We investigated these mechanisms in the context of breast cancer where tumors are composed of diverse populations of cancer cells that differ in their ferroptosis sensitivity. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we determined that cancer cell populations with luminal differentiation are more resistant to ferroptosis than other cells within a heterogeneous tumor. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis and experimentation revealed that GATA3, a transcription factor that promotes luminal differentiation, has a causal role in ferroptosis resistance in luminal breast cancer cells. In pursuit of the mechanism involved, we found that GATA3 represses the expression of integrin β1 and its downstream signaling cascade. This observation led us to demonstrate that integrin β1 signaling is necessary for sensitivity to ferroptosis in basal breast cancer cells because it regulates a FAK/ROCK pathway that sustains the expression of ACSL4, a lipid-modifying enzyme that is essential for ferroptosis. The repression of integrin β1 by GATA3 inhibits this signaling pathway, rendering cells ferroptosis resistant. Together, these data provide insight into mechanisms of ferroptosis sensitivity and resistance that are linked to the cell biology and signaling pathways of the diverse types of cells present in breast tumors.",

          "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern-recognition receptor located on the plasma membrane, senses extracellular danger signals to initiate inflammatory immune responses. It is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), undergoes N-linked glycosylation, and is subsequently transported to the Golgi before ultimately reaching the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms underlying the processing and maturation of TLR4 in the ER remain elusive. Through whole genome-wide CRISPR screening, CCDC134 was identified as a critical and essential factor for TLR4-dependent inflammatory response. Localization of CCDC134 in the ER lumen rather than its exosome-mediated secretion is required for its role in TLR4 signaling. Loss of CCDC134 results in the retention of TLR4 in the ER for subsequent ER-associated degradation, and thus blockade of TLR4 maturation and plasma membrane trafficking. Defects in TLR4 processing and maturation in the ER in CCDC134-depleted cells are caused by aberrant hyperglycosylation and destabilization of glycoprotein 96 (gp96), a key chaperone of TLR4.

          "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts, our understanding of the virulence factors contributing to oral biofilm formation—a hallmark of dental caries—remains incomplete. We present evidence that the specialized metabolism of the oral microbiome is a critical yet underexplored factor in oral biofilm formation. Through microbiome analysis, we identified a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) encoding biosynthetic gene cluster that correlates with dental caries and is widely represented in oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans . This gene cluster produces two major mutanoclumpin metabolites, MC-584 and MC-586, which feature molecular scaffolds differing in a C–C macrocyclic linkage. Both metabolites synergistically promote robust biofilm formation of S. mutans through a rare dual-metabolite mode of action. Further, each metabolite binds uniquely to the S. mutans cell surface, resulting in distinct multicellular morphologies. The biosynthesis of mutanoclumpins employs a unique chemical logic that produces two major products, rare within PKS-NRPS assembly lines. This study underscores the importance of characterizing genes implicated in human diseases through microbiome analysis and lays the foundation for exploring strategies to inhibit streptococci-induced dental caries.",

          "abstract": "Foundation models in biology—particularly protein language models (PLMs)—have enabled ground-breaking predictions in protein structure, function, and beyond. However, the “black-box” nature of these representations limits transparency and explainability, posing challenges for human–AI collaboration and leaving open questions about their human-interpretable features. Here, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a variant, transcoders, from natural language processing to extract, in a completely unsupervised fashion, interpretable sparse features present in both protein-level and amino acid (AA)-level representations from ESM2, a popular PLM. Unlike other approaches such as training probes for features, the extraction of features by the SAE is performed without any supervision. We find that many sparse features extracted from SAEs trained on protein-level representations are tightly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms across all levels of the GO hierarchy. We also use Anthropic’s Claude to automate the interpretation of sparse features for both protein-level and AA-level representations and find that many of these features correspond to specific protein families and functions such as the NAD Kinase, IUNH, and the PTH family, as well as proteins involved in methyltransferase activity and in olfactory and gustatory sensory perception. We show that sparse features are more interpretable than ESM2 neurons across all our trained SAEs and transcoders. These findings demonstrate that SAEs offer a promising unsupervised approach for disentangling biologically relevant information present in PLM representations, thus aiding interpretability. This work opens the door to safety, trust, and explainability of PLMs and their applications, and paves the way to extracting meaningful biological insights across increasingly powerful models in the life sciences.",

          "abstract": "AI is now a cornerstone of modern dataset analysis. In many real world applications, practitioners are concerned with controlling specific kinds of errors, rather than minimizing the overall number of errors. For example, biomedical screening assays may primarily be concerned with mitigating the number of false positives rather than false negatives. Quantifying uncertainty in AI-based predictions, and in particular those controlling specific kinds of errors, remains theoretically and practically challenging. We develop a strategy called multidimensional informed generalized hypothesis testing (MIGHT) which we prove accurately quantifies uncertainty and confidence given sufficient data, and concomitantly controls for particular error types. Our key insight was that it is possible to integrate canonical cross-validation and parametric calibration procedures within a nonparametric ensemble method. Simulations demonstrate that while typical AI based-approaches cannot be trusted to obtain the truth, MIGHT can be. We apply MIGHT to answer an open question in liquid biopsies using circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in individuals with or without cancer: Which biomarkers, or combinations thereof, can we trust? Performance estimates produced by MIGHT on ccfDNA data have coefficients of variation that are often orders of magnitude lower than other state of the art algorithms such as support vector machines, random forests, and Transformers, while often also achieving higher sensitivity. We find that combinations of variable sets often decrease rather than increase sensitivity over the optimal single variable set because some variable sets add more noise than signal. This work demonstrates the importance of quantifying uncertainty and confidence—with theoretical guarantees—for the interpretation of real-world data.",

Currently, the high potential MnO 2 /Mn 2+ redox conversion can only be well activated in electrolytes with a very low pH value, which is not friendly to the Zn metal anode. To overcome these limitations, we have designed mild amphiphilic hydrogel electrolytes (AHEs) with a wide electrochemical stability window (ESW) and high ionic activity. The design is based on the mechanism that trace amounts of hydrophobic moieties enhance the hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic groups and water molecules in the hydrogel electrolytes. The developed AHE possesses an ESW up to ~3.0 V even at a high water content of ~76 wt%. The assembled Zn||MnO 2 pouch cells using the hydrogel electrolytes demonstrated a large areal capacity of ~5 mAh cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 and a high-voltage and flat discharging plateau of ~1.9 V. Furthermore, a pouch cell with an area of 40 cm 2 was fabricated, exhibiting a capacity of ~125 mAh at 2 mA cm −2 . Two pouch cells (25 cm 2 ) in series were used to drive a 3.7 V-powerable electric fan. This work highlights the rational design of wide-ESW AHEs with high ionic activity as a promising approach to achieving portable and scalable applications of aqueous high-voltage Zn||MnO 2 batteries.",

In this study, we used metagenomics, viromics, and laboratory validation to explore how nano-biochar affects phage–host interactions and ARGs dissemination in vermicomposting. Our results revealed distinct niche-specific phage life strategies. In vermicompost, lytic phages dominated and used a “kill-the-winner” strategy to suppress antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). In contrast, lysogenic phages prevailed in the earthworm gut, adopting a “piggyback-the-winner” strategy that promoted ARGs transduction through mutualistic host interactions. Nano-biochar induced the conversion of lysogenic to lytic phages in the earthworm gut, while concurrently reducing the abundance of lysogenic phages and their encoded auxiliary metabolic genes carried by ARB. This shift disrupted phage–host mutualism and inhibited ARGs transmission via a “phage shunting” mechanism. In vitro validation with batch culture experiments further confirmed that lysogenic phages increased transduction of ARGs in the earthworm gut, while nano-biochar reduced the spread of ARGs by enhancing lysis infectivity. Our study constructs a mechanistic framework linking nano-biochar induced shifts in phage lifestyles that suppress ARG spread, offering insights into phage–host coadaptation and resistance mitigation strategies in organic waste treatment ecosystems.",

However, emerging evidence suggests that these number–space connections may reflect our evolutionary history and emerge even in the absence of cultural tools. We examined how task-naïve monkeys learn spatial and numerical concepts over time. Monkeys’ learning trajectories revealed successful learning of both numerical and geometric concepts. Discriminability effects showed that abstract quantitative features were stronger predictors of accuracy on both tasks than low-level visual similarity, reflecting abstract processing of both tasks. Cross-lagged analyses revealed that learning in the geometry task significantly predicted future gains in numerosity performance, even after controlling session-level trends, within-task stability, and general performance factors. Together, these findings provide evidence that spatial and numerical learning in primates rely on mutual cognitive processes. Such representations could form the evolutionary foundation for the well-documented “cognitive bridge” between numerical and spatial reasoning in human development.",

          "abstract": "Morphological change occurs over macroevolutionary timescales under the action of natural selection and genetic drift combined with developmental processes shaping organogenesis. Although determining their relative weight is made difficult by discrepancies between paleontological and neontological data, mammalian tooth morphology may bridge the gap between fossil record and laboratory observations. Fossils indicate that mammals have frequently diversified after evolving molars bearing more cusps, while developmental biology shows these emerge through the iterative signaling of enamel knots. However, this theoretical evo-devo model of mammalian tooth evolution has not been tested with empirical data from both fossils and laboratory experiments. In doing so, we identify a shared developmental basis for the convergent, ratcheted evolution of increasingly complex molars in arvicoline rodents (voles, lemmings, muskrats). Longer, narrower molars lead to more cusps throughout development and deep time, suggesting that tooth development directed morphological evolution. Both the arvicoline fossil record and vole tooth development show slower transitions toward the highest cusp counts. This pattern suggests that the developmental processes fueling the evolution of increasingly complex molars may also limit the potential for further complexity increases. Integrating paleontological and developmental data shows that long-term evolutionary trends can be accurately and mostly explained by the simple tinkering of developmental pathways.",

          "abstract": "Establishment of correct chromatin configuration in male meiosis is essential for sperm formation and male fertility. However, how chromatin remodeling contributes to meiotic progression in male germ cells is not well understood. Here, we find that the ISWI family ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor SMARCA5 (SNF2H) plays a critical role in regulating meiotic prophase progression during spermatogenesis in mice. Male mice with germ cell-specific depletion of SMARCA5 are infertile and unable to form sperm. Conditional knockout of Smarca5 results in meiotic progression failure, with abnormal spermatocytes appearing at the pachytene stage of meiosis I and subsequent accumulation of defects in chromosome synapsis, DNA repair, and transposon control, along with elevated rates of apoptosis. SMARCA5 interacts with known cofactors BAZ1A/ACF and BAZ2A/TIP5, as well as numerous DNA repair and recombination factors, in the testis. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed failure to achieve a normal transcriptional state in premeiotic spermatogonia and during meiotic prophase, with reduced levels of meiotic gene transcripts and increasingly aberrant transcriptional states at later stages of spermatogenic development. Transcriptional misregulation in meiotic prophase was preceded by a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility in spermatogonia at promoters and repeat elements. Our findings suggest that SMARCA5 restricts chromatin accessibility in male germ cells to guide appropriate chromatin remodeling during meiotic recombination, contrasting with its role promoting chromatin accessibility during female meiosis.",

In bacteria, Dam methylation is the most studied DNA modification, while RecA-mediated HR is a primary mechanism to repair DNA damages including double-stranded breaks, single-stranded gaps, and stalled replication forks. While HR regulation by proteins is extensively studied, whether methylation of DNA itself directly affects the functions of RecA and HR remains unclear. Mainly by single-molecule experiments, we report that Dam methylation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) promotes RecA assembly, partially by reducing the effective charge of ssDNA under counterion screening. Furthermore, Dam methylation of double-stranded DNA promotes homologous pairing, joint molecule growth, and strand exchange. In cellular experiments, dam deletion impairs HR, whereas hypermethylation of the adenines in the genome enhances HR in P1 transduction assays and DNA-damage sensitivity tests without significantly upregulated HR-related genes. In addition, the preference of RecA for Dam-methylated DNA in RecA assembly and homologous pairing is conserved across divergent species covering a gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae , a gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and a flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Dam methylation of ssDNA increases the ATPase activity of molecular motors such as RecQ helicase that containing RecA-like domains.

          "abstract": "An understanding of the CO 2 + H 2 O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air–water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO 2 makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ machine-learned potentials trained to various levels of theory to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO 2 hydration at the air–water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated “in-and-out” mechanism: CO 2 diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils an unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air–water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO 2 hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.",

Despite its established therapeutic efficacy, CBZ has been reported to worsen seizures in another form of epilepsy, generalized absence seizures, in both clinical and experimental settings. In this study, we focused on thalamic reticular (RT) neurons, which regulate thalamocortical network activity in absence seizures, to investigate whether CBZ alters their excitability, thereby contributing to the exacerbation of seizures. Using ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that CBZ selectively inhibits the tonic firing of RT neurons in a dose-dependent manner without affecting burst firing. At the RT-thalamocortical synapse, CBZ significantly increases the failure rate of GABAergic synaptic transmission, with greater effects on somatostatin–than parvalbumin-expressing RT neurons. In vivo EEG recordings and open-field behavior in Scn8a med± mouse model confirmed that CBZ treatment exacerbates absence seizures, increasing both seizure frequency and duration while reducing locomotor activity. In addition, CBZ further amplifies the preexisting reduction in tonic firing of RT neurons in Scn8a med± mice. These findings uncover a mechanism by which CBZ exacerbates absence seizures through selective inhibition of RT neuron excitability and disruption of GABAergic synaptic transmission. This work provides mechanistic insights into the paradoxical effects of CBZ and suggests potential avenues for optimizing epilepsy treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that stress generally suppresses immunity. However, under certain conditions, acute stress has been shown to stimulate the immune system, particularly those at barrier surfaces like the skin. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. In the present study, we have identified an immune-enhancing effect of stress using zebrafish larvae. The use of this animal model allowed us to visualize the redistribution of macrophages to the skin upon exposure to an acute stressor, which appeared to be dependent on the increased levels of cortisol. Through real-time imaging of fluorescently labeled leukocytes, we observed that this cortisol-driven redistribution was mediated by both the mineralocorticoid and the glucocorticoid receptor, which upregulated the chemokine receptor Cxcr4. Strikingly, this stress-induced macrophage migration required the presence of melanocytes in the skin, which increased the expression of the gene encoding Cxcl12, the ligand for Cxcr4. This result indicates a pivotal role for pigment cells in immune regulation under stress. Functional assays further revealed that the redistributed macrophages actively increased antigen uptake from the external environment, suggesting an elevated state of immune readiness. Together, we demonstrate that acute stress triggers a coordinated, cortisol-mediated response that enhances immune surveillance at the skin barrier. This stress-induced enhancement of barrier immunity potentially prepares the organism for increased pathogen exposure under challenging conditions.",

Defects in processing G4 structures are associated with replication stress, a common property of both B cell cancers and hyperproliferative premalignant cells. Genome instability arising from replication stress is a hallmark of cancer and strongly contributes to the chromosome rearrangements in B cell cancers. Here, we define the impact of G4-stabilizing ligands on generating genome instability in primary and malignant B cells. Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) causes breaks and chromosome rearrangements at ribosomal DNA and pericentromeric major satellite regions in both mouse primary B cell culture and CH12 lymphoma cells. PDS also causes extensive pericentromeric DNA damage in immortalized human B cell lines. Remarkably, PDS causes high level of tetraploid metaphase cells correlated with high level of dicentric chromosomes specifically in primary but not in CH12 B cells. Unlike primary B cells, CH12 cells undergo checkpoint activation and strong G2/M arrest in response to PDS treatment thus preventing tetraploid appearance. Altogether, these results highlight the difference between primary and malignant B cells in response to PDS, revealing the therapeutic potential of G4-stabilizing drugs to selectively suppress tumor cell growth and proliferation.",

          "abstract": "Indirect ecological effects occur when the impact of one species on another is mediated by a third species or the shared environment. Although indirect effects are ubiquitous in nature, we know remarkably little about how they may drive ecoevolutionary processes across community boundaries. Here, we show that insect (aphid) herbivory on macrophytes (duckweed) drove the adaptive evolution of a planktonic crustacean ( Daphnia magna ) in large outdoor aquatic mesocosms via indirect ecological effects. Aphid herbivory reduced duckweed growth and increased the nutrient and light availability in the water column, which promoted phytoplankton growth and boosted the abundance of D. magna that feed on phytoplankton. Whole-genome pool-sequencing and phenotypic assays revealed aphid-herbivory-mediated evolutionary changes to Daphnia population. Transplant experiments indicated that these evolutionary changes were adaptive. Furthermore, aphid-herbivory-mediated biotic and abiotic changes in the aquatic community increased the performance of the macrophytes and aphids. These results demonstrate that indirect ecological effects can shape ecoevolutionary interactions between seemingly independent species in natural communities.",

          "abstract": "Suspensions of self-propelled objects represent a novel paradigm in colloidal science. In such “active baths,” traditional concepts such as Brownian motion, fluctuation–dissipation relations, and work extraction from heat reservoirs, must be extended beyond the conventional framework of thermal baths. Unlike thermal baths, which are characterized by a single parameter, the temperature, the fundamental descriptors of an active bath remain elusive. Particularly relevant are confined environments, which are common conditions for bacteria in Nature and in microbioreactor devices. In this study, buoyant passive tracers are employed as generalized probes to extract the properties of an active bath comprising motile bacteria confined within a droplet. By describing the bacterial suspension as a colored noise acting on the tracer, we extract the temporal memory τ b and characteristic intensity u b of such noise, finding that τ b varies little across the explored experimental conditions and u b is positively correlated with bacterial concentration. Notably, we put forward the generalizing concept of “bath diffusivity,” D b = u b 2 τ b , as a central predictor for the momentum transfer properties of this out-of-equilibrium situation. We show that D b scales linearly with bacterial concentration, modulated by a factor representing the role of confinement, expressed as the ratio of the confining radius to the probe radius. This finding, while still awaiting a complete theoretical explanation, offers insights into the transport or mixing properties of confined active baths and paves the way for a deeper understanding of active emulsions driven by confined active matter.",

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship has highlighted the rise of “diversity projects” across various educational and business contexts, but few studies have explored the meaning of diversity in biomedical research. In this paper, we employ a computationally driven matching technique to examine quantitative trends in the use of various forms of diversity and population terminology in a sample of nearly two million biomedical abstracts spanning a 30-y period. The curated dictionaries we leverage to detect these trends were formalized into open-source software that are publicly available for other researchers to use. Our analyses demonstrate marked growth in diversity, sex, gender, life course, and socioeconomic terms while terms relating to race and ethnicity largely plateaued or declined in usage, beginning in the mid-2000s. In addition, the use of national, continental, and subcontinental population labels increased dramatically over the same period. We also present logistic regression analyses to investigate what may be fueling the rise in use of diversity terminology. We argue that the use of diversity has grown to encompass concepts beyond its historical origins in race-based programs as it has in fields like higher education and employment. Despite some critics’ claims regarding the role of diversity in research, we do not find evidence that its use signals retreat from or commitment to equity and inclusion efforts.",

          "abstract": "Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a Ca 2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. In excitation–contraction (E-C) coupling, RyR1 opens by depolarization of transverse tubule membrane via physical interaction with dihydropyridine receptor, which is referred to as depolarization-induced Ca 2+ release (DICR). RyR1 can also be gated via Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR), in which binding of Ca 2+ directly opens the channel. Thus, RyR1 has two Ca 2+ release modes; DICR and CICR, but the physiological role of CICR has been a matter of debate: whether CICR can amplify Ca 2+ signals in E-C coupling. To address this issue, we created a mouse model carrying a mutation in the Ca 2+ -binding site in RyR1 (RyR1-E3896A), which selectively inhibits CICR. Surprisingly, the homozygous RyR1-E3896A mice show no appreciable changes in E-C coupling, ex vivo muscle contraction, in vivo muscle performance, or muscle fiber type. Gain-of-function mutations in RyR1 cause malignant hyperthermia (MH), which is a lethal disease triggered by inhalational anesthetics. The E3896A mutation conferred resistance to isoflurane-induced MH episodes and severe heat stroke triggered by environmental heat stress. Our data suggest that RyR1-mediated CICR plays a negligible role in E-C coupling of normal skeletal muscle but may increase the risk for muscle diseases when excessively activated.",

They may originate from a common source or from parallel sources, or arise from distinct precursors that follow separate developmental pathways, ultimately converging on comparable structures and roles. When asymmetries emerge and persist through development, members of the pair can specialize in ways that might increase fitness. Here, we report that the Drosophila melanogaster female’s pair of spermathecae, which appear similar and have the common role of sperm storage, derive from different developmental compartments defined by expression of lineage-tracing markers corresponding, respectively, to the key patterning genes engrailed and wingless . We further find that the two spermathecae show significant differences in size, secretory activity, and calcium levels and, perhaps as a consequence, sperm retention dynamics. These results open broad avenues for understanding how developmental, physiological, and behavioral asymmetries arise and impact reproductive success.",

          "abstract": "The FliPQR complex constitutes a channel for export of the flagellar proteins involved in axial structure assembly. It also serves as a template for the assembly of the rod structure, which consists of FliE, FlgB, FlgC, FlgF, and FlgG. FliP, FliQ, and FliR assemble into a right-handed helical structure within the central pore of the flagellar basal body MS-ring, and the complex has two gates on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides. The periplasmic gate, formed by the N-terminal α-helices of FliP and FliR, remains closed until six FliE subunits assemble onto FliP and FliR to form the first layer of the rod, but it has remained unclear how each FliE subunit opens the gate and assembles in the absence of the rod cap required for efficient assembly of other rod proteins. Here, we present a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the FliPQR complex in closed form at 3.0 Å resolution. A β-cap, formed by the N-terminal β-strands of FliP and FliR, is located at the top of the FliPQR complex and tightly seals the closed gate. The β-cap has a narrow pore that efficiently and accurately leads the first FliE subunit to its assembly site. Interactions of FliE with FliP and FliR induce a conformational change in FliP and FliR, with their N-terminal α-helices move up and outward to open the gate. Consequently, each of the N-terminal β-strands of FliP and FliR detaches from the β-cap one after another, thereby creating a docking site for the next FliE subunit to efficiently assemble.",

          "abstract": "While Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)+ breast cancer treatment is considered effective, resistance to endocrine therapy is common. Since ERα is still the main driver in most therapy-resistant tumors, alternative therapeutic strategies are needed to disrupt ERα transcriptional activity. In this work, we position TRIM24 as a therapeutic target in endocrine resistance, given its role as a key component of the ERα transcriptional complex. TRIM24 interacts with ERα and other well-known ERα cofactors to facilitate ERα chromatin interactions and allows for maintenance of active histone marks including H3K23ac and H3K27ac. Consequently, genetic perturbation of TRIM24 abrogates ERα-driven transcriptional programs and reduces tumor cell proliferation capacity. Using a recently developed degrader targeting TRIM24, ERα-driven transcriptional output and growth were blocked, effectively treating not only endocrine-responsive cell lines but also drug-resistant derivatives thereof as well as cell line models bearing activating ESR1 point mutations. Finally, using human tumor-derived organoid models, we could show the efficacy of TRIM24 degrader in the endocrine-responsive and -resistant setting. Overall, our study positions TRIM24 as a central component for the integrity and activity of the ERα transcriptional complex, with degradation-mediated perturbation of TRIM24 as a promising therapeutic avenue in the treatment of primary and endocrine resistance breast cancer.",

This trajectory of vocal development in humans is radically different from those of our close phylogenetic relatives, cercopithecoid monkeys and apes. In these primates, social feedback seems to play no significant role in their vocal development. Oddly,marmoset monkeys, a more distantly related primate species, do exhibit socially guided vocal learning. How can this be? We hypothesized that the evolution of human and marmoset vocal learning in early infancy is facilitated by their neurally altricial births (relative to other primates) and their cooperative breeding social environment. Our analysis found that, indeed, both human and marmoset brains are growing faster at birth when compared with chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, making humans and marmoset monkeys altricial relative to these other primates. The time interval of this faster brain growth overlaps with important vocal learning milestones. We formalized our hypothesis using a simple model showing that if vocal learning is influenced by the timing of brain growth and social stimuli, it benefits from an altricial brain and a cooperative breeding environment. Our data support the idea that the evolution of socially guided vocal learning during early infancy in humans and marmosets was afforded by infants with an altricial brain embedded in a vocally rich environment.",

          "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) persistently threaten wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, and public health. The East Asian–Australasian Flyway plays a crucial role in HPAIV dynamics due to its large populations of migratory waterfowl and poultry. Over recent decades, this flyway has undergone substantial landscape changes, including both losses and gains of waterfowl habitats. These changes can affect waterfowl distributions, increase contact with poultry, and consequently alter ecological conditions that favor avian influenza virus (AIV) evolution. However, limited research has assessed these likely impacts. Here, we integrated empirical data and an individual-based model to simulate AIV transmission in migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry, including wild-to-poultry spillover and reassortment dynamics in poultry, across landscapes representing the years 2000 and 2015. We used the reassortment incidence as a proxy for ecological and transmission conditions that support viral diversification and the emergence of novel subtypes. Our simulations show that landscape change reshaped the waterfowl distribution, facilitated bird aggregation at improved habitats, increased coinfection, and raised reassortment rate by 1,593%, indicating a substantially higher potential for viral diversification and emergence. Model-generated risk maps show expanded and increased reassortment risk in southeastern China, the Yellow River Basin, and northeastern China. These findings suggest the importance of landscape change as a driver of potential AIV diversification and subtype emergence. This underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate landscape dynamics, host movement, and viral evolution to better assess and mitigate future risk.",

          "abstract": "Small and fragmented populations are at high risk of local extinction, in part because of elevated inbreeding and subsequent inbreeding depression. A major conservation priority is to identify the mechanisms and extent of inbreeding depression in small populations. The eastern massasauga ( Sistrurus catenatus ) rattlesnake is listed as Federally Threatened in the United States, having experienced significant habitat fragmentation and concomitant population declines over the past 200 years. Here, we use long-term monitoring of two wild populations of eastern massasaugas in Michigan to estimate the extent of inbreeding in each population, identify mechanisms that generate inbreeding, and test for the impact of inbreeding on fitness. Using targeted genomic data and spatial coordinates of capture locations from over 1000 individuals, we find evidence of inbreeding and link inbreeding to spatial kinship structure within populations, possibly driven by limited dispersal. We reconstruct multigenerational pedigrees for each population to measure reproductive output and use long-term capture–recapture data to estimate individual survival (i.e., the two major components of fitness). We find evidence of inbreeding depression in both fitness metrics. The 5% most inbred individuals are 13.5% less likely to have any surviving offspring and have 11.6% lower annual survival compared to all less inbred individuals. By combining genomics and long-term monitoring data, we are able to link the life history of eastern massasaugas to inbreeding and detect relationships between fitness and inbreeding. These insights provide important conservation context for future management and for understanding how spatial structure can generate inbreeding depression even at fine spatial scales.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of protein sequence and structure databases has resulted in a significant number of proteins with ambiguous or unknown function. While advances in machine learning techniques hold great potential to fill this annotation gap, current methods for function prediction are unable to associate global function reliably to the specific residues responsible for that function. We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pretrained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to simultaneously predict function and provide residue-level annotations. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score &gt; 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome—predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families—we predict several bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.",

          "abstract": "The human Fic enzyme FicD plays an important role in regulating the Hsp70 homolog BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum: FicD reversibly modulates BiP’s activity through attaching an adenosine monophosphate to the substrate binding domain. This reduces BiP’s chaperone activity by shifting it into a conformation with reduced substrate affinity. Crystal structures of FicD in the apo, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-bound, and BiP-bound states suggested significant conformational variability in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. However, nothing is known about the underlying dynamics. In this study, we investigate the conformational dynamics of FicD’s TPR motifs using two-color, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. We demonstrate that the TPR motifs exhibit conformational dynamics between a TPR-out and a TPR-in conformation on timescales ranging from microseconds to milliseconds. In addition, we extend our investigation on multiple labeling positions within FicD, revealing how conformational dynamics vary depending on the location within the TPR motif. We quantify the motions with dynamic photon distribution analysis for the FRET constructs and generate an ensemble of structures for the different states consistent with the smFRET data using molecular dynamic simulations. We propose a conformational landscape model for FicD where the TPR-in/out states exist in equilibrium and the fraction of dynamic population is altered due to the presence of ATP and BiP. These results indicate that not only is FicD dynamic, but the dynamics are linked to the functionality and interactions of FicD with BiP.",

As a driven quantum system, it features dynamical localization, specifically Anderson localization in momentum space.

Here, we present evidence for many-body dynamical localization for the Lieb-Liniger version of the many-body quantum kicked rotor. After some initial evolution, the momentum distribution of interacting quantum-degenerate bosonic atoms in one-dimensional geometry, kicked hundreds of times by means of a pulsed sinusoidal potential, stops spreading. Our results shed light on the boundary between the classical, chaotic world and the realm of quantum physics.",

In this work, we found that the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) activates a mitochondrial defense based on the essential B vitamin folate. During infection of cultured mammalian cells with the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii , ATF4 increased mitochondrial DNA levels by driving the one-carbon metabolism processes that use folate in mitochondria. Triggered by host detection of mitochondrial stress induced by parasite effectors, ATF4 limited Toxoplasma access to folates required for deoxythymidine monophosphate synthesis, thereby restricting parasite growth. Thus, ATF4 rewires mitochondrial metabolism to mount a folate-based metabolic defense against Toxoplasma .",

In this study, we reveal that maize enhances its defense in high-density conditions through a plant-soil feedback mechanism triggered by the leaf volatile linalool. Linalool activates jasmonate signaling in neighboring plants and promotes root exudation of benzoxazinoids, especially 2-(2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one)-β-d-glucopyranose (HDMBOA-Glc). These exudates in turn reshape the rhizosphere microbiome composition to favor growth of specific bacterial taxa that trigger broad-spectrum resistance, albeit at the cost of maize growth. This microbiome-driven feedback loop is governed by salicylic acid signaling.

The impacts of genomic erosion in remnant populations were reversed in an admixed breeding program, suggesting the potential benefits of genetic rescue.

We used a global acoustic dataset of more than 60 million detections, representing 583 diurnal bird species, to synthesize effects of light pollution on avian vocalization. On average, light pollution prolonged vocal activity by 50 min. Light pollution responses were strongest for species with large eyes, open nests, migratory habits, and large ranges and during the breeding season.

Stress-induced lysosomal lipid signaling contributed to both the recruitment and activation of LYVAC. By directly sensing lysosomal phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, the lipid transfer domain of LYVAC mediated directional ER-to-lysosome lipid movement, leading to osmotic membrane expansion of lysosomes.

Finally, we find that some Neanderthals carry the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype, and that it was likely introgressed into modern human populations through Neanderthal introgression rather than Denisovan introgression.",

          "abstract": "Copper-catalyzed radical C(sp 3 )‒N coupling has become a major focus in synthetic catalysis over the past decade. However, achieving this reaction manifold by using enzymes has remained elusive. In this study, we introduce a photobiocatalytic approach for radical benzylic C(sp 3 )‒N coupling using a copper-substituted nonheme enzyme. Using rhodamine B as a photoredox catalyst, we identified a copper-substituted phenylalanine hydroxylase that facilitates enantioconvergent decarboxylative amination between N -hydroxyphthalimide esters and anilines. Directed evolution remodeled the active site, resulting in high enantioselectivities for most substrates. On the basis of molecular modeling and mechanistic studies, we propose that the enzyme accommodates a copper-anilide complex that reacts with a benzylic radical. This study expands the scope of non-natural biocatalytic transition metal catalysis to copper-catalyzed radical coupling.",

          "abstract": "A primary axiom in geoscience is that the evolution of plants drove global changes in river dynamics. Notably, the apparent sinuosity of rivers, derived from the variance of sediment accretion direction measured in rocks, dramatically increased when land plants evolved, ca. 425 Ma. This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we find that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction. These results explain why meandering rivers have been under-recognized in pre-vegetation stratigraphy.",

We demonstrate the synthesis of grating pixels for arbitrary spectral responses, and we achieved rapid (&lt;10 nanoseconds), high-contrast (&gt;100 decibels), wavelength-selective switching through collective, nanometer-scale electrostatic perturbations.

Most therapeutic drugs, whether they are small molecules or biologics, exert their effects through impeding such interactions, whether they are of an enzyme with its substrate or a ligand with its receptor. Conversely, a handful of approved drugs and a larger number of candidates in development have the opposite effect: They either activate or inhibit a biological output by stabilizing a preexisting complex through reducing the rate at which its components dissociate ( k off ). In this Review, we present examples of therapeutic candidates that we term “LOCKTACs,” which modulate k off , and discuss possible theoretical and practical advantages of this class of drugs. Prospective discovery of LOCKTACs has the potential to usher in a new class of therapeutics for today’s most challenging targets.",

          "abstract": "Maternal antibodies fundamentally regulate gut immunity in the developing infant, yet the mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. We found that maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG), ingested in the first week of life, restrained microbiota-dependent adaptive immune responses weeks later, after weaning. This activity was linked to maternal antibodies that could bind bacteria in the neonatal gut and the ability of microbe-IgG complexes to engage Fc and complement-dependent effector functions in offspring. Ingestion of microbiota-specific maternal IgG also limited aberrant neonatal responses to dietary antigens encountered at weaning. These discoveries suggest that maternal IgG engages the immune system of offspring in early postnatal life to tune mucosal responses and reinforce intestinal homeostasis in the face of dynamic shifts in food and bacterial antigens during development.",

Whereas Berry curvature–mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric–induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here, we show that spin-momentum locking, a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit–coupled materials, leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measured and electrically controlled in 111-oriented LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.",

In this work, we experimentally controlled the abundance of the central enzyme in methanogenesis, methyl–coenzyme M reductase (MCR), in Methanosarcina acetivorans and tested whether its cellular concentration alters methane isotopic compositions. We found that during growth on methanol and acetate, lowering the expression of mcr increases the degree of hydrogen isotope exchange between methane and water. Using an isotope-enabled model of methanogenesis, we found that these changes result from an increase in reversibility of enzymes involved in the oxidation of the substrate methyl group. This result indicates that methane produced from organic compounds can deviate from commonly assumed pathway-specific isotope effects, with implications for the interpretation of environmentally relevant methane sources.",

We investigated how energy disorders affect vibrational polariton dynamics by probing ultrafast dynamics in 2,6-di- tert -butylphenol in liquids (inhomogeneous) and solids (homogeneous) using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In liquids, energy disorder disrupted delocalization, preventing vibrational energy transfer. By contrast, with reduced inhomogeneity, vibrational strong coupling in solids restored delocalization and enabled energy transfer. We established a stringent delocalization criterion, requiring collective coupling strengths exceeding three times inhomogeneous linewidths to sustain polariton coherence. This finding highlights energy disorder’s detrimental effects and outlines strategies to overcome localization—either by minimizing disorder through chemical control or by achieving sufficient couplings using advanced photonic structures.",

For different initial states, we reveal universal scaling in the experimentally accessible finite-time dynamics by elucidating and accounting for the initial-state-dependent prescaling effects.

We find that recent changes in primates are associated with immune barrier function and lipid and xenobiotic metabolism and that human-specific genetic features affect these functions. Enhancer assays, genetic deletion, and in silico mutagenesis resolve evolutionarily important enhancers of lactase ( LCT ) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ( IGFBP2 ).

          "abstract": "Flood impacts in Europe are considered to be increasing, but attribution of impacts to climatic and societal drivers of past floods has been limited to a selection of recent events. Here, we present an impact attribution study covering 1729 riverine, flash, coastal, and compound events that were responsible for an estimated 83 to 96% of flood-related impacts in Europe between 1950 and 2020. We show that, in most regions, the magnitude of flood impacts relative to the 1950 baseline has been regulated primarily by direct human actions. The population and economic value at risk have increased, but the effect of exposure growth has been largely compensated by reductions in vulnerability due to improved risk management. Observed long-term changes in climate and human alterations of river catchments were also important drivers of flood hazard in many regions, but ultimately less relevant for trends in total, continental-wide impacts.",

          "abstract": "Expanding gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) populations in Europe and North America contribute to increased risks of livestock predation, which can threaten human livelihoods and lead government agencies to target wolves for lethal removal. Public wolf hunting is a highly contentious strategy for mitigating these risks, yet few empirical studies examine its effectiveness in doing so. Using difference-in-differences and structural equation modeling of data from the northwestern US between 2005 and 2021, we analyzed impacts of wolf hunting on livestock predation by wolves and government removal of wolves in the same year and with a 1-year time lag while controlling for social and environmental variables. We found that public wolf hunting had a small negative effect on livestock predation but had no effect on government lethal removal of wolves in the same or subsequent years. Our findings challenge the assumption that wolf hunting is an effective management strategy for reducing livestock predation and lethal removal.",

          "abstract": "DNA has emerged as a robust platform for engineering molecular circuits with arbitrary logic operations. Nevertheless, implementing DNA circuits for such functions generally relies on the use of dual-rail expression that doubles the number of required gates, constraining the achievable complexity in a single solution. A fundamental limitation is that conventional single-rail circuits cannot support nonfirst-layer NOT operations. Here, we introduce the design of a DNA synchronizer (DSN), a temporal regulation module that enables time-dependent NOT function, to circumvent the fundamental limitation of conventional single-rail designs. Tuning the binding affinity between the DSN strand and an inverter strand allows for regulating the execution time of NOT gates at varying cascade depths. Single-rail NAND and NOR gates are implemented using DSNs, which are Boolean complete. We further demonstrate a 4-bit square root circuit using a minimal set of only five gates. This single-rail architecture holds promise for developing compact yet scalable DNA computing circuits while advancing applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.",

Using northwest Himalaya as a case study, we examine the ecological resilience and genetic diversity of an understudied traditional crop, black pea (scientific name unclear), alongside barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), and compare them to the introduced cash crop, green pea ( Pisum sativum L. ). Participatory field experiments with local farmers revealed that traditional crops outperform introduced varieties in survival and reproduction traits across sites. To our knowledge, we generate the first whole-genome sequencing data for black peas. Clustering and nutritional analyses highlight black pea’s genetic richness and dietary potential. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge with ecological science to sustain agrobiodiversity, enhance climate resilience, and promote sustainable food systems.

          "abstract": "Eukaryotes have evolved defense systems to protect their genomes from invasive genetic elements. We report a fungal defense mechanism, tandem repeat–induced sexual silencing (TRISS), active during sexual stages. TRISS is a unique RNA interference (RNAi) pathway distinct from known mechanisms like quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Triggered by tandem repeats, it involves RNAi components similar to quelling but uniquely includes the MSUD-specific Argonaute Sms2. TRISS operates independently of recombination. We identified small interfering RNA sassociated with TRISS (trasiRNAs) in tandem repeats. Sms2, guided by trasiRNAs, mediates translational repression of target mRNAs and is crucial for trasiRNA biogenesis. TRISS requires the DNA methyltransferase Rid but not Rid-mediated repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Both Sms2 and Rid interact with replication protein A (RPA) to recruit the RPA-Qde1/RdRP complex, dependent on the helicase Qde3. This study reveals a potentially conserved strategy linking RIP and RNAi to silence tandem repeats during fungal sexual stages, offering insights into fungal genome defense.",

The precisely modulated atomic/electronic configuration optimizes the adsorption configuration and bonding strength between substrate/intermediates and catalysts surfaces. The amorphous catalyst achieves 96.2% selectivity at 99.1% conversion under mild conditions, with a time of flight of 6004 hour −1 . These results demonstrate that amorphous architectures, with their disordered atomic arrangements, uniformly distributed active sites, and tunable adsorption energetics, establish a generalized design framework for high-performance catalysts, achieving superior selectivity and activity compared to crystalline systems.",

Previous dual-comb–based methods can extend the NAR, but asynchronous measurement error (AME) is commonly introduced, which greatly limits the ranging accuracy. Here, we propose a cross dual-microcomb absolute ranging scheme based on dispersion-interferometry method. The AME introduced during dynamic measurement is completely eliminated by one-shot spectral sampling, while the NAR is extended from 3 millimeters to 339 meters by Vernier effect when the repetition-rate jitter is 2 hertz. In addition, the excellent system performance has been verified at different distances and the Allan deviation down to 5.63 nanometers after averaging 56 seconds. Our scheme boasts the potential of straightforward chip architecture and minimal detector requirements and provides an advanced method for future high-precision long-distance ranging and miniaturized lidar systems.",

We elucidate the mechanism of complex crater formation by examining crater formation on different polymer substrates resulting from microparticle impacts with tunable microparticle diameter (1.8 to 6.1 micrometers) and impact velocities up to 840 meters per second. Central uplift is uniquely observed in craters on amorphous polymers, with the degree of complexity directly linked to the polymer thermal properties and homogeneity. We demonstrate that the complex crater volume scales with the ratio of the specific kinetic energy of the impacting object to the specific energy required to raise the impacted substrate to its glass transition temperature (the Eckert number). Our results also confirm that complex crater formation can occur not only for macroscopic celestial collisions but also during sufficiently high velocity collisions at the micrometer scale.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which β-hydroxybutyrate is converted to β-hydroxybutyryl–coenzyme A (BHB-CoA), the cofactor for Kbhb, remains unknown. Here, we report that acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) coupled with lysine acetyltransferase 7 (KAT7) modulates β-hydroxybutyrylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9bhb) to promote transcription. We show that KAT7 serves as a β-hydroxybutyryltransferase and preferably catalyzes histone Kbhb, especially H3K9bhb, in 1171 identified Kbhb substrates. ACSS2 is a BHB-CoA synthetase. This enzyme can sense cellular β-hydroxybutyrate and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to and colocalizes with KAT7 at specific locus of chromatin. The ACSS2-generated BHB-CoA can fuel KAT7 for histone H3K9bhb. We demonstrate that the β-hydroxybutyrate drives the ACSS2-KAT7-H3K9bhb axis to promote epigenetic regulation and tumor cell growth. Our study not only identifies the founding member of BHB-CoA ligase but also reveals the mechanism underlying KAT7-catalyzed histone Kbhb using ACSS2-generated BHB-CoA.",

Conditional knockout of Rpa1 , a representative DNA damage response factor, in early limb bud mesenchyme results in the near-total absence of forelimbs and severely underdeveloped hindlimbs. Mechanistically, Rpa1 deletion leads to extensive DNA damage and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, driving transcription of Zbp1 . Rpa1 deletion also leads to accumulation of Z-DNA bound by ZBP1, triggering the full activation of ZBP1 and subsequent mesenchymal stem cell death through PANoptosis.

By using yeast two-hybrid assays, we identify 2705 protein-protein interactions involving PPNLSPs from stem nematode Ditylenchus destructor , and by using computational methods, we predict conserved interactions of D. destructor proteins at the genome-wide level. Integration of these data allows generating a comprehensive protein interactome map, showing established complexes and PPNLSP modules, and allowing functional annotations for 306 uncharacterized PPNLSPs. Among these interactions, we identify multiple PPNLSPs associated with chemotaxis and infectivity based on these PPNLSP modules and propose a chemotaxis pathway model of host seeking.

Here, we show that efficient termination by Pol I, paused by termination roadblock protein, is caused by RNA hairpin of the nascent pre-rRNA. Hairpin-dependent termination takes place at a physiological rate and does not require trans-acting factors. The function of the roadblock protein and the T-rich sequence is to synergistically cause deep backtracking of Pol I toward the termination RNA hairpin. Simultaneously, Pol I is catalytically inactivated, preventing rescue from backtracking through RNA cleavage and thus committing Pol I to termination. Termination RNA hairpins are present in most of Pol I terminators of eukaryotes, suggesting conservation of the RNA hairpin–dependent mechanism of Pol I transcription termination.

Mechanistically, TMEM16F-mediated phospholipids (PLs) scrambling orchestrates extensive remodeling of PM lipids, translocating PLs at the lesion sites to reduce membrane tension, therefore mitigating the membrane damage. Unexpectedly, failure of PL scrambling in TMEM16F-deficient cells leads to lytic cell death, exhibiting PM collapse and unleashing substantial danger-associated molecule patterns. TMEM16F-deficient tumors exhibit decelerated progression. Notably, lipid scrambling inhibition synergizes with PD-1 blockade to trigger robust tumor immune rejection. The antiparasitic drug ivermectin enhances the responsiveness to PD-1 blockade by suppressing TMEM16F. Our findings uncover TMEM16F-mediated lipid scrambling as an anti-ferroptosis regulator by relocating PLs on the PM during the final stages of ferroptosis.

We demonstrate that embryos apply forces remodeling the matrix with species-specific displacement amplitudes and distinct radial patterns: principal displacement directions for mouse embryos, expanding on the surface while human embryos insert in the matrix generating multiple traction foci. Implantation-impaired human embryos showed reduced displacement, as well as mouse embryos with inhibited integrin-mediated force transmission. External mechanical cues induced a mechanosensitive response, human embryos recruited myosin, and directed cell protrusions, while mouse embryos oriented their implantation or body axis toward the external cue.

Although information from aversive and appetitive training competes within 3 hours after conditioning, approach behavior gradually prevails, and avoidance behavior decays. The training type–dependent neural network consolidating and storing contradictory memory differs from the circuit for sole aversive and reward memory.

We present a coupled chemical and thermal evolution model tracking Ceres’s interior aqueous environment through time. If the rocky interior reached ≳550 K, then fluids released by rock metamorphism would have promoted conditions favorable for habitability by introducing redox disequilibrium into the ocean, a source of chemical energy for chemotrophs.

We used spatially explicit simulations of paleogenomic diversity and high-quality paleogenomic data from 67 prehistoric individuals to assess how population dynamics between Indigenous European hunter-gatherers and incoming farmers varied across space and time. Our results demonstrate that admixture between the two groups increased locally over time at each stage of the Neolithic expansion along the continental route.

We use iterative exponential growth to synthesize monodisperse mesogenic oligomers ranging from dimer to octamer. By analyzing their phase behavior and microstructure, we elucidate how length-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic effects tune their hierarchical degree of ordering. The oligomers’ length-dependent crystalline order drives the formation of scrolled sheets in shorter oligomers and twisted ribbons in longer oligomers.

Our findings highlight this FTO degrader as a valuable tool compound for elucidating the functional roles of FTO in cancer and as a potential foundation for the development of selective anticancer therapies.",

Mitophagy, a critical process for mitochondrial quality control, is severely impaired in exhausted CD8 + T cells, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We identified ubiquitin-specific protease 30 (USP30), a mitochondrial deubiquitinase that inhibits mitophagy, as a key factor up-regulated in exhausted CD8 + T cells. Notably, prolonged antigen stimulation triggers the T cell receptor and nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 signaling, which drives the transcriptional up-regulation of USP30. Excitingly, our interventions targeting USP30 through genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition effectively restored mitophagy, improved mitochondrial fitness, and rejuvenated CD8 + T cell effector functions. These interventions reinvigorated antitumor responses and markedly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings establish USP30 as a critical regulator of mitophagy and a promising therapeutic target for reversing T cell exhaustion and enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",

The recovery that ensued is projected to continue in the center and east, leaving the west out. We show that these two patterns—uniform variation and east-west contrast—are present in instrumental observations and in simulations with constant or time-varying external forcing. Uniform variation is amplified by 20th century external forcing, while a global warming–induced strengthening of the monsoon seeds the east-west contrast. This contrast is deepened by a mid-21st century transition to a North Atlantic cooling relative to the global tropical oceans, which affects the western Sahel most strongly because it is immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic, leading to a divergence in outcomes—between a progressively wetter central and eastern Sahel and an abruptly drier western Sahel—that is unparalleled in instrumental observations.",

Although thalamocortical circuit dysfunction has been implicated in these symptoms, its precise roles in ASD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), a key modulator of thalamocortical activity, to ASD-related behavioral deficits using a Cntnap2 knockout mouse model. Cntnap2 −/− mice displayed increased seizure susceptibility, locomotor activity, and repetitive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced intrathalamic oscillations and burst firing in RT neurons, accompanied by elevated T-type calcium currents. In vivo fiber photometry confirmed behavior-associated increases in RT population activity. Notably, pharmacological and chemogenetic suppression of RT excitability via Z944, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and via C21 activation of the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di significantly improved ASD-related behaviors. These findings identify RT hyperexcitability as a mechanistic driver of ASD and highlight RT as a potential therapeutic target.",

To investigate these spatiotemporal dynamics during one of Europe’s most transformative periods, we compiled a dataset of radiocarbon dates from 967 burials, applying kernel density estimation alongside optimal linear estimation. We show that the adoption of CW and BB funerary rites is not synchronized with, and often contradicts, the spread of steppe ancestry. Furthermore, we show that these burial traditions spread rapidly and polyfocally among dispersed communities before a brief yet continent-wide consolidation phase around 2600 BCE for CW and 2400 BCE for BB, suggesting broad, simultaneous societal changes among preliterate societies.",

The MFSA strategy disassembled the structure based on fragmentation patterns, recognized targets via a pseudo-library, and reassembled the structure using characteristic ions and neutral losses.

Using an in-house daphnane library, CNPs-MFSA outperformed SIRIUS, MS-FINDER, and MetFrag in Top-1 annotation accuracy. By applying CNPs-MFSA to 56 Thymelaeaceae plants, 204 high-confidence daphnanes within 822 annotated results, including 105 previously unreported compounds were found.

These quantum vibropolaritonic states exhibit characteristic vacuum Rabi splitting, which not only enables manipulation of molecular vibrations but also provides a unique optical transducer. The feasibility of this strategy is established by combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Through fabrication of a microfluidic infrared flow cell, definitive experimental validation of vibropolaritonic sensing is achieved. We believe that this study represents a major advance in harnessing hybrid light-matter states for molecular sensing and offers exciting potential to affect applications in areas including chemical sensing, environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and bioprocess monitoring.",

A total of 82 humans are analyzed, together with 53 animals and 35 modern plants to establish regional isotope baselines. Results show statistically significant isotopic differences between victims and nonvictims and suggest that the former were members of invading groups brutally killed, perhaps exposed and deposited in pits—together with trophies in the form of severed upper limbs—by local groups in what might be one of the earliest well-documented instances of martial victory celebrations in prehistoric Europe.",

Here, we demonstrate in laboratory simulation experiments that hydrogen trioxide effectively forms in water–molecular oxygen ice analogs at temperatures as low as 5 kelvin under exposure to proxies of galactic cosmic rays. Exploiting synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry, hydrogen trioxide along with hydrogen peroxide and the hydroperoxyl radical was identified during the temperature-programmed desorption of the irradiated ices.

Most modern QEC protocols rely on measurements and feed-forward operations, which are experimentally demanding and often prone to high error rates. Additionally, no single-error–correcting code intrinsically supports the full set of logical operations required for universal quantum computing. In this work, we present a complete toolbox for fault-tolerant universal quantum computing without measurements during algorithm execution by combining the strategies of code switching and concatenation. We develop fault-tolerant, measurement-free protocols to transfer encoded information between 2D and 3D color codes that offer complementary and, in combination, universal sets of robust logical gates. Moreover, we extend the scheme to higher-distance codes by concatenating the 2D color code and integrating code switching for operations lacking a natively fault-tolerant implementation. Our measurement-free approach thereby provides a practical and scalable pathway for universal quantum computing on state-of-the-art quantum processors.",

Here, we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar.

Using a naturally occurring, cost-effective quinine organocatalyst, we achieved high enantioselectivity in chiral sulfinimidate ester formation via asymmetric S─O bond formation. The catalyst plays dual critical roles, facilitating both the reduction of S(VI) substrates and the catalytic stereoselective formation of S─O bonds.

          "abstract": "During acute oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) dysfunction, reversal of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) maintains the redox state of the Coenzyme Q (Q)–pool by using fumarate as terminal electron acceptor in certain tissues and cell lines. We identified the action of SDHAF2 protein, a complex II assembly factor, as critical for metabolic adaptation during complex III dysfunction in HEK293T cells. SDHAF2 loss during complex III inhibition led to a net reductive TCA cycle from loss of succinate oxidation, loss of SDHA active site–derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, insufficient glycolytic adaptation, and a severe growth impairment. Glycolysis adapted cells, however, did not accumulate SDHAF2 upon Q-pool stress, exhibited a net reductive TCA cycle and mild growth phenotypes regardless of SDHAF2 presence. Thus, our study reveals how complex II assembly controls a balance between dynamics of TCA cycle directionality, protection from Q-pool stress, and an ability to use ROS-meditated signaling to overcome acute OXPHOS dysfunction in cells reliant on mitochondrial respiration.",

          "abstract": "Solid-state electrolyte (SSE) is anticipated to exhibit proper mechanical strength and effectively inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrites. However, the growth of lithium dendrites is inevitable, driven by the intrinsic properties of SSEs. Hence, guiding the growth of lithium dendrites in a controllable way is more feasible instead of completely preventing their growth. Here, we present a strategically designed structural layer composed of graded lithium nitride particles, which guides the growth of lithium dendrites within confined spaces. Meanwhile, this layer is paired with a less lithium-stable electrolyte and enables the guided lithium dendrites to self-limit within localized regions at the interface. The comprehensive analysis further reveals that the designed bilayer SSE effectively harnesses the interface-generated pressure during battery cycling, achieving dynamic control of lithium dendrite growth. This interfacial structure design of SSE holds broad applicability for regulating lithium dendrites in all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.",

Here, we performed an epigenetic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in CD8 + T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy setting and found that Prdm12 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in nociceptive neuron development but uncharacterized within immunological contexts. Prdm12 deletion markedly enhanced in vivo tumor clearance of mouse CD8 + T cells and promoted activation, effector differentiation marker expression, and cytokine secretion in both murine and human CD8 + T cells in vitro. Mechanistically, Prdm12 deficiency augmented effector transcriptional programs while inhibiting exhaustion of CGRP-RAMP1 neuroimmune axis facilitation. Additionally, Prdm12 ablation remodeled the chromatin accessibility landscape, with H3K9me3 deposition at loci regulating T cell differentiation ( Trib1 and Sgk1 ) and exhaustion ( Rgs1 and Nr4a2 ).

One possible hypothesis explaining this dichotomy is that cancer genes regulate common targets, which then function as master regulators of essential cancer phenotypes. To identify mechanisms that drive the most fundamental feature shared by all tumors—unrestricted cell proliferation—we used a multiomic approach, which identified translation and ribosome biogenesis as common targets of major oncogenic pathways across cancer types. Proteomic analysis of tumors and functional studies of cell cultures established nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 as a key node, whose convergent regulation, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally, is critical for tumor cell proliferation. Our results indicate that lineage-specific oncogenic pathways regulate the same set of targets for growth control, revealing key downstream nodes that could be targeted for therapy or chemoprevention.",

Here, we describe a mechanism by which tubulin tyrosine ligase–like 11 (TTLL11) expands and diversifies the code. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed a unique bipartite MT recognition strategy wherein TTLL11 binding and catalytic domains engage adjacent MT protofilaments. Biochemical and cellular assays identified previously uncharacterized polyglutamylation patterns, showing that TTLL11 directly extends the primary polypeptide chains of α- and β-tubulin in vitro, challenging the prevailing paradigms emphasizing lateral branching. Moreover, cell-based and in vivo data suggest a cross-talk between polyglutamylation and the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle likely linked to the TTLL11-mediated elongation of the primary α-tubulin chain.

However, the mechanisms linking this pathway with membrane dynamics and signaling remain elusive. Here, we used cryo–focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional tomography to identified GDSVs as a distinct vesicle population at the pollen tube tip. We further demonstrated that tobacco LORELEI-like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein 4 (NtLLG4), a key signaling molecule controlling membrane dynamics and integrity, functions as a receptor for NtPPME1, regulating its polar exocytosis via GDSVs to control cell wall stiffness.

Phylogenetic analysis confirms Austrobaileyales as sister to monocots, magnoliids, and eudicots, clarifying their evolutionary position. We identified an Austrobaileyales-specific whole-genome duplication postdiversification from Amborellales and Nymphaeales. Integrating coexpression networks and biochemical assays, we delineated five key steps in DBCOD lignan biosynthesis, including dimerization, hydroxylation, methylation, and C─C phenol coupling. Notably, we found SchCYP719G1b, a previously unidentified enzyme catalyzing C─C linkage to form the signature DBCOD scaffold.

Nonlocal cobbles were transported up to 13 kilometers for on-site reduction, resulting in assemblage patterns inconsistent with accumulations formed by repeated short-distance transport events.

However, gaining an unambiguous assignment solely from this spectrum is generally not possible because amino acid–type information cannot be gleaned only from the 13 C α shifts and the low resolution in the 13 C dimension, which is limited by the homonuclear coupling of the 13 C α and 13 C β nuclei.

However, HMGB1 is less abundant than H1 and binds nucleosomes more weakly, raising the question of how it competes with H1. Here, we find that HMGB1 increases nucleosomal DNA accessibility without displacing H1. HMGB1 also increases the dynamics of condensed, H1-bound chromatin. Unexpectedly, cryo–electron microscopy structures show HMGB1 bound at internal locations on nucleosomes and local DNA distortion. These sites are away from where H1 binds, explaining how HMGB1 and H1 can co-occupy a nucleosome. Our findings suggest a model where HMGB1 counteracts the effects of H1 by distorting nucleosomal DNA and disrupting interactions of the H1 carboxyl-terminal tail with DNA. Compared to mutually exclusive binding, co-occupancy by HMGB1 and H1 allows greater diversity in dynamic chromatin states. More generally, these results explain how architectural proteins acting at the nucleosome scale can have large effects on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.",

          "abstract": "Optical selection rules endorsed by symmetry are crucial for understanding the optical properties of quantum materials and the associated ultrafast spectral phenomena. Here, we introduce momentum-resolved Floquet optical selection rules using group theory to elucidate the pump-probe photoemission spectral distributions of monolayer black phosphorus (BP), which are governed by the symmetries of both the material and the lasers. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we further investigate the dynamical evolution of Floquet(-Volkov) states in the photoemission spectra of monolayer BP, revealing their spectral weights at specific momenta for each sideband. These observations are comprehensively explained by the proposed Floquet optical selection rules. Our framework not only clarifies experimental photoemission spectra but also uncovers unexplored characteristics under different pump-probe configurations. Our results are expected to deepen the understanding of light-induced ultrafast spectra in BP and can be extended to other Floquet systems.",

          "authors": "Seungjun Kim, Syungjin Han",
          "abstract": "The developmental state model indicates that targeted industrial policies promote technological advancement among incumbent firms. However, the long-term repercussions for nonincumbent firms remain under-explored. We argue that targeted state support may unintentionally reduce innovation in nonincumbent firms. Using innovation data on South Korean firms and novel data on the political profiles of 4,936 corporate board members, we find that firms with political connections to the president tend to engage in less innovation. Interestingly, this reduced innovation among politically connected firms is linked to their ability to secure contracts with incumbents. These findings reveal unintended consequences of South Korean industrial policies. Non-incumbent firms that recognize the strategic value of political connections focus on maximizing short-term profits, thereby diminishing their focus on innovation. Concurrently, incumbent firms that rely on government support effectively pay a “tax” for this favor by granting contracts to non-incumbent firms.",
