          "abstract": "ATP generated in the mitochondria is exported by an ADP/ATP carrier of the SLC25 family 1 . The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cannot synthesize ATP but must import cytoplasmic ATP to energize protein folding, quality control and trafficking 2,3 . It was recently proposed that a member of the nucleotide sugar transporter family, termed SLC35B1 (also known as AXER), is not a nucleotide sugar transporter but a long-sought-after ER importer of ATP 4 . Here we report that human SLC35B1 does not bind nucleotide sugars but indeed executes strict ATP/ADP exchange with uptake kinetics consistent with the import of ATP into crude ER microsomes. A CRISPR–Cas9 cell-line knockout demonstrated that SLC35B1 clusters with the most essential SLC transporters for cell growth, consistent with its proposed physiological function. We have further determined seven cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human SLC35B1 in complex with an Fv fragment and either bound to an ATP analogue or ADP in all major conformations of the transport cycle. We observed that nucleotides were vertically repositioned up to approximately 6.5 Å during translocation while retaining key interactions with a flexible substrate-binding site. We conclude that SLC35B1 operates by a stepwise ATP translocation mechanism, which is a previously undescribed model for substrate translocation by an SLC transporter.",

          "abstract": "Cell heterogeneity is a universal feature of life. Although biological processes affected by cell-to-cell variation are manifold, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity and differential drug responses, the sources of cell heterogeneity remain largely unclear 1,2 . Mutational and epigenetic signatures from cancer (epi)genomics are powerful for deducing processes that shaped cancer genome evolution 3–5 . However, retrospective analyses face difficulties in resolving how cellular heterogeneity emerges and is propagated to subsequent cell generations. Here, we used multigenerational single-cell tracking based on endogenously labelled proteins and custom-designed computational tools to elucidate how oncogenic perturbations induce sister cell asymmetry and phenotypic heterogeneity. Dual CRISPR-based genome editing enabled simultaneous tracking of DNA replication patterns and heritable endogenous DNA lesions. Cell lineage trees of up to four generations were tracked in asynchronously growing cells, and time-resolved lineage analyses were combined with end-point measurements of cell cycle and DNA damage markers through iterative staining. Besides revealing replication and repair dynamics, damage inheritance and emergence of sister cell heterogeneity across multiple cell generations, through combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we delineate how common oncogenic events trigger multiple routes towards polyploidization with distinct outcomes for genome integrity. Our study provides a framework to dissect phenotypic plasticity at the single-cell level and sheds light onto cellular processes that may resemble early events during cancer development.",

          "abstract": "Skeletal editing comprises the structural reorganization of compounds. Such editing can be achieved through atom swapping, atom insertion, atom deletion or reorganization of the compound’s backbone structure 1,2 . Conducted at a late stage in drug development campaigns, skeletal editing enables diversification of an existing pharmacophore, enhancing the efficiency of drug development. Instead of constructing a heteroarene classically from basic building blocks, structural variants are readily accessible directly starting from a lead compound or approved pharmacophore. Here we present C to N atom swapping in indoles at the C2 position to give indazoles through oxidative cleavage of the indole heteroarene core and subsequent ring closure. Reactions proceed through ring-opened oximes as intermediates. These ring deconstructed intermediates can also be diverted into benzimidazoles resulting in an overall C to N atom swapping with concomitant skeletal reorganization. The same structural diverting strategies are equally well applicable to benzofurans leading to either benzisoxazoles or benzoxazoles. The compound classes obtained through these methods—indazoles 3,4 , benzisoxazoles 5 , benzimidazoles 6,7 and benzoxazoles 8 —are biologically relevant moieties found as substructures in natural products and pharmaceuticals. The procedures introduced substantially enlarge the methods portfolio in the emerging field of skeletal editing.",

          "abstract": "The decline in malaria deaths has recently stalled owing to several factors, including the widespread resistance of Anopheles vectors to the insecticides used in long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) 1,2 . One way to mitigate insecticide resistance is to directly kill parasites during their mosquito-stage of development by incorporating antiparasitic compounds into LLINs. This strategy can prevent onward parasite transmission even when insecticides lose efficacy 3,4 . Here, we performed an in vivo screen of compounds against the mosquito stages of Plasmodium falciparum development. Of the 81 compounds tested, which spanned 28 distinct modes of action, 22 were active against early parasite stages in the mosquito midgut lumen, which in turn prevented establishment of infection. Medicinal chemistry was then used to improve antiparasitic activity of the top hits from the screen. We generated several endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) that inhibited the P. falciparum cytochrome bc 1 complex (CytB). Two lead compounds that targeted separate sites in CytB (Q o and Q i ) showed potent, long-lasting and stable activity when incorporated and/or extruded into bed net-like polyethylene films. ELQ activity was fully preserved in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and parasites resistant to these compounds had impaired development at the mosquito stage. These data demonstrate the promise of incorporating ELQ compounds into LLINs to counteract insecticide resistance and to reduce malaria transmission.",

          "abstract": "The isotopic composition of lavas associated with mantle plumes has previously been interpreted in the light of core–mantle interaction, suggesting that mantle plumes may transport core material to Earth’s surface 1–5 . However, a definitive fingerprint of Earth’s core in the mantle remains unconfirmed. Precious metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), are highly concentrated in the metallic core but extremely depleted in the silicate mantle. Recently discovered mass-independent Ru isotope variations ( ε 100 Ru) in ancient rocks show that the Ru isotope composition of accreted material changed during later stages of Earth’s growth 6 , indicating that the core and mantle must have different Ru isotope compositions. This illustrates the potential of Ru isotopes as a new tracer for core–mantle interaction. Here we report Ru isotope anomalies for ocean island basalts. Basalts from Hawaii have higher ε 100 Ru than the ambient mantle. Combined with unradiogenic tungsten (W) isotope ratios, this is diagnostic of a core contribution to their mantle sources. The combined Ru and W isotope systematics of Hawaiian basalts are best explained by simple core entrainment but addition of core-derived oxide minerals at the core–mantle boundary is a possibility.",

          "abstract": "Decades of research have demonstrated that recovery from serious neurological injury will require synergistic therapeutic approaches. Rewiring spared neural circuits after injury is a long-standing goal of neurorehabilitation 1,2 . We hypothesized that combining intensive, progressive, task-focused training with real-time closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV) to enhance synaptic plasticity 3 could increase strength, expand range of motion and improve hand function in people with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Here we report the results from a prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized study combining gamified physical therapy using force and motion sensors to deliver sham or active CLV (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04288245). After 12 weeks of therapy composed of a miniaturized implant selectively activating the vagus nerve on successful movements, 19 people exhibited a significant beneficial effect on arm and hand strength and the ability to perform activities of daily living. CLV represents a promising therapeutic avenue for people with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury.",

          "abstract": "Carbon has a central role in biology and organic chemistry, and its solid allotropes provide the basis of much of our modern technology 1 . However, the liquid form of carbon remains nearly uncharted 2 , and the structure of liquid carbon and most of its physical properties are essentially unknown 3 . But liquid carbon is relevant for modelling planetary interiors 4,5 and the atmospheres of white dwarfs 6 , as an intermediate state for the synthesis of advanced carbon materials 7,8 , inertial confinement fusion implosions 9 , hypervelocity impact events on carbon materials 10 and our general understanding of structured fluids at extreme conditions 11 . Here we present a precise structure measurement of liquid carbon at pressures of around 1 million atmospheres obtained by in situ X-ray diffraction at an X-ray free-electron laser. Our results show a complex fluid with transient bonding and approximately four nearest neighbours on average, in agreement with quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The obtained data substantiate the understanding of the liquid state of one of the most abundant elements in the universe and can test models of the melting line. The demonstrated experimental abilities open the path to performing similar studies of the structure of liquids composed of light elements at extreme conditions.",

          "abstract": "The amputation of a salamander limb triggers anterior and posterior connective tissue cells to form distinct signalling centres that together fuel regeneration 1 . Anterior and posterior identities are established during development and are thought to persist for the whole life in the form of positional memory 2 . However, the molecular basis of positional memory and whether positional memory can be altered remain unknown. Here, we identify a positive-feedback loop that is responsible for posterior identity in the limb of an axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum ). Posterior cells express residual Hand2 transcription factor from development, and this primes them to form a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh signalling is also upstream of Hand2 expression. After regeneration, Shh is shut down but Hand2 is sustained, safeguarding posterior memory. We used this regeneration circuitry to convert anterior cells to a posterior-cell memory state. Transient exposure of anterior cells to Shh during regeneration kick-started an ectopic Hand2–Shh loop, leading to stable Hand2 expression and lasting competence to express Shh . Our results implicate positive-feedback in the stability of positional memory and reveal that positional memory is reprogrammed more easily in one direction (anterior to posterior) than in the other. Modifying positional memory in regenerative cells changes their signalling outputs, which has implications for tissue engineering.",

          "abstract": "Research on social comparison as a behaviour change technique (SC-BCT) has increased substantially. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating SC-BCTs across the behavioural sciences (PROSPERO: CRD42022343154). We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science from inception to January 2024. Seventy-nine randomized controlled trials ( N = 1,356,521) investigating effects on behaviours related to climate change mitigation, health, performance and service were included. In the short term (mean 3.7 months post-intervention), SC-BCTs produced small effects relative to both passive (Hedges’ g = 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.23; k = 37; P &lt; 0.001) and active control conditions ( g = 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.31; k = 42; P &lt; 0.001). A greater number of SC-BCT sessions and emphasis on desired (versus undesired) behaviours were associated with larger effects. Moderation effects were observed in only a few analyses, highlighting the need for further testing. SC-BCTs also produced significant small effects in the long term (mean 6.2 months post-intervention). Small effects should be interpreted in the context of low cost and scalability (for example, sending one or two emails).

This study provides compelling evidence of ICT’s impact by examining China’s cities. We introduce the rural–urban migrant workforce Geographical Diversity Index (GDI), a metric that captures the mobility patterns of 20 million migrant workers across Chinese cities from Q1 2019 to Q4 2023. This study highlights how ICT usage shapes migration dynamics and connectivity across geographic spaces, with implications for labor mobility and urban inclusivity. Using panel vector autoregression models, we establish a causal relationship between ICT usage and GDI, revealing heterogeneous impacts: large cities and male workers benefit more from ICT usage than small cities and female workers. While ICT-driven diversity enhances labor productivity, it also increases migrant workers’ job-hunting travel distances, contributing to higher carbon emissions. These findings underscore the dual role of ICT as a facilitator of inclusivity and a source of sustainability challenges, offering critical insights for policymakers aiming to leverage digital tools for equitable and sustainable urban development.",

Improving law enforcement’s ability to identify correct identifications could have profound implications for criminal justice.

Participants (Experiment 1: N = 1,092, Experiment 2: N = 1,809) saw an eyewitness’s lineup identification, accompanied by the eyewitness’s verbal confidence statement (e.g., “I’m pretty sure”) and either a featural (“I remember his eyes”), recognition (“I remember him”), or familiarity (“He looks familiar”) justification. They then judged the accuracy of the eyewitness’s identification. AI-assistance (vs. no assistance) improved people’s ability to distinguish between correct identifications and misidentifications, but only when they evaluated lineup identifications based on recognition or featural justifications. Discrimination of identifications based on familiarity justifications showed little improvement with AI-assistance. This project is a critical step in evaluating human-algorithm interactions before widespread use of AI-assistance by law enforcement.",

A significant predictor of attitudes toward Congress is perceptions of corruption, with perceptions of corruption in government linked to less legitimacy. This study tests whether knowledge of Congressional stock trading affects legitimacy and compliance with Congressional authority. In a preregistered experiment with US citizens ( n = 506), participants who read a report detailing how Congressmembers made higher-than-expected profits from stock trading in 2024 reported increased perceptions of corruption and decreased legitimacy in Congress. They also viewed laws passed by Congress as less fair and were less willing to comply with such laws. Perceptions of Congressional legitimacy mediated the effect of stock trading knowledge on willingness to comply with congressional laws and perceptions of congressional laws as fair. A preregistered follow-up experiment ( n = 664) shows that these effects are not driven by how much Congressmembers profit but by how trading negatively affects broader perceptions of legitimacy. These findings highlight the detrimental effects of Congressional stock trading on perceptions of legitimacy and respect for the law.",

Linear waves and shocks, which are supported by MHD framework, are ubiquitous in almost all plasma environments. A thorough understanding of the interaction between linear waves and shocks is useful not only for heliophysics and astrophysics but also for other applications such as inertial confinement fusion. We revisit the theoretical problem of shock-wave interaction based on the linearized boundary conditions of MHD. The shock is regarded as an ideal discontinuity and individual wave modes are considered to impact the shock from upstream. The wavevectors and amplitudes of the downstream transmitted waves are calculated. We further develop a method to apply the theory directly to in-situ heliospheric shock observations. The validity of the method is demonstrated through the example of a fast-forward interplanetary shock observed at 1 AU.",

The turnover of surface pMHC-II on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is controlled by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of pMHC-II by the E3 ubiquitin ligase March-I. To study March-I protein expression, we have generated a mouse in which a V5 epitope-tag was knocked-in to the endogenous March-I gene, thereby allowing us to follow the fate of March-I using high-affinity anti-V5 antibodies. Quantitative analysis revealed that resting spleen DCs and B cells express only ~500 and 125 March-I molecules/cell, respectively. Endogenous March-I protein has a very short half-life in DCs and March-I mRNA, March-I protein, and MHC-II ubiquitination are rapidly terminated upon activation of both DCs and B cells. Like March-I, CD83 is a known regulator of MHC-II expression in APCs and we also show that CD83 suppresses endogenous March-I-dependent MHC-II ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation in mouse spleen DCs. Thus, our study reveals molecular mechanisms for both March-I- and CD83-dependent regulation of MHC-II expression in APCs.",

          "abstract": "Only two nonvisual arrestins recognize many hundreds of different, intracellularly phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Due to the highly dynamic nature of GPCR•arrestin complexes, the critical determinants of GPCR–arrestin recognition have remained largely unclear. We show here that arrestin2 recruitment to the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR) can be induced by an arrestin-activating phosphopeptide that is not covalently linked to the receptor and that the recruitment is independent of the presence and type of the orthosteric receptor ligand. Apparently, the arrestin–receptor interaction is driven by the conformational switch within arrestin induced by the phosphopeptide, whereas the electrostatic attraction toward the receptor phosphosites may only play an auxiliary role. Extensive NMR observations show that in contrast to previous static GPCR•arrestin complex structures, the β 1 AR complex with the beta-blocker carvedilol and arrestin2 is in a G protein-inactive conformation. The insensitivity to the specific receptor conformation provides a rationale for arrestin’s promiscuous recognition of GPCRs and explains the arrestin-biased agonism of carvedilol, which largely blocks G protein binding, while still enabling arrestin engagement.",

          "abstract": "Found from bacteria to humans, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are the least understood protein chaperones. HSPB5 (or αB-crystallin) is among the most widely expressed of the 10 human sHSPs, including in muscle, brain, and eye lens where it is constitutively present at high levels. A high content of disorder in HSPB5 has stymied efforts to uncover how its structure gives rise to function. To uncover its mechanisms of action, we compared human HSPB5 and two disease-associated mutants, R120G and D109H. Expecting to learn how the mutations lead to loss of function, we found instead that the mutants are constitutively activated chaperones while wild-type HSPB5 can transition reversibly between nonactivated (low activity) and activated (high activity) states in response to changing conditions. Techniques that provide information regarding interactions and accessibility of disordered regions revealed that the disordered N-terminal regions (NTR) that are required for chaperone activity exist in a complicated interaction network within HSPB5 oligomers and are sequestered from solvent in nonactivated states. Either mutation or an activating pH change causes rearrangements in the network that expose parts of the NTR, making them more available to bind an aggregating client. Although beneficial in the short-term, failure of the mutants to adopt a state with lower activity and lower NTR accessibility leads to increased coaggregation propensity and, presumably, early cataract. The results support a model where chaperone activity and solubility are modulated through the quasi-ordered NTR and its multiple competing interactions.",

The emerging LYTACs (Lysosome-targeting chimeras) technology combines drug-targeting strategies with lysosomal degradation, providing a novel approach to drug development and offering new possibilities for disease therapy. However, the clinical applicability of current LYTAC degraders is limited by the variable expression of lysosome-targeting receptors (LTRs) in tissues. To overcome this limitation, we herein hijacked a YXXØ sorting signal that derived from lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a (LAMP-2a) to develop a signal aptamer platform (SApt), which exhibits high specificity for targeting membrane proteins and inducing efficient lysosomal degradation. SApts were synthesized by conjugating the YXXØ signal peptide to the aptamer’s terminus through a click reaction. Our study demonstrated that SApts efficiently degrade disease-associated membrane proteins, such as PTK7, Met, and NCL, based on the inherent signals rather than specific LTR. The potent antitumor efficacy of SApts was further confirmed in a xenograft tumor model, where in vivo degradation of PTK7 was observed. Collectively, our work provides insights into the development of a simple and universal lysosomal degradation platform with potential translational value in clinical treatment.",

          "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will soon cruise our roads as a global undertaking. Beyond completing driving tasks, AVs are expected to incorporate ethical considerations into their operation. However, a critical challenge remains. When multiple road users are involved, their impacts on AV ethical decision-making are distinct yet interrelated. Current AVs lack social sensitivity in ethical decisions, failing to enable both differentiated consideration of road users and a holistic view of their collective impact. Drawing on research in AV ethics and neuroscience, we propose a scheme based on social concern and human-plausible cognitive encoding. Specifically, we first assess the individual impact that each road user poses to the AV based on risk. Then, social concern can differentiate these impacts by weighting the risks according to road user categories. Through cognitive encoding, these independent impacts are holistically encoded into a behavioral belief, which in turn supports ethical decisions that consider the collective impact of all involved parties. A total of two thousand benchmark scenarios from CommonRoad are used for evaluation. Empirical results show that our scheme enables safer and more ethical decisions, reducing overall risk by 26.3%, with a notable 22.9% decrease for vulnerable road users. In accidents, we enhance self-protection by 8.3%, improve protection for all road users by 17.6%, and significantly boost protection for vulnerable road users by 51.7%. As a human-inspired practice, this work renders AVs socially sensitive to overcome future ethical challenges in everyday driving.",

          "abstract": "Motile cells migrate directionally in the electric field (EF) in a process known as galvanotaxis, an important phenomenon in wound healing and development. We previously reported that individual fish keratocyte cells migrate to the cathode in EFs, that inhibition of PI3 kinase (PI3K) reverses single cells to the anode, and that large cohesive groups of either unperturbed or PI3K-inhibited cells migrate to the cathode. Here, we report that small uninhibited cell groups move to the cathode, while small groups of PI3K-inhibited cells move to the anode. Small groups move faster than large groups, and groups of unperturbed cells move faster than PI3K-inhibited cell groups of comparable sizes. The shapes and sizes of large groups change little when they start migrating, while size and shapes of small groups change significantly, and lamellipodia disappear from the rear edges of these groups. The computational model, according to which cells inside and at the edge of the group interpret directional signals differently, explains the observations. Namely, cells in the group interior are directed to the cathode independently whether they are PI3K-inhibited or not. Meanwhile, the edge cells behave like individual cells: They are directed to the cathode in uninhibited groups and to the anode in PI3K-inhibited groups. As a result, all cells drive uninhibited groups to the cathode, while larger PI3K-inhibited groups are directed by cell majority in the group interior to the cathode, while majority of the edge cells in small groups win the tug-of-war driving these groups to the anode.",

          "abstract": "We demonstrate that exposure to the AB5 subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, concomitant with a proinflammatory response across distinct cell subsets. Notably, SubAB selectively induces type-I interferon (IFN) expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, acting synergistically with Toll-like receptor 7 stimulation. The induction of type-I IFN in response to SubAB relies on stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation, coupled with protein synthesis inhibition mediated by protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit-alpha. By impeding mRNA translation through the integrated stress response, SubAB precipitates the downregulation of the negative innate signaling feedback regulator Tax1-binding protein 1. This downregulation is necessary to unleash TANK-binding kinase 1 signaling associated with STING activation.

          "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by rapid evolution from chemosensitivity to chemoresistance and limited treatment options. However, the mechanisms underlying this evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Retinoid X receptor γ (RXRγ) is uniquely overexpressed in chemo-resistant SCLC tumors, and that RXRγ serves as an essential factor driving chemoresistance in SCLC. RXRγ forms phase-separated droplets with LSD1 in the nucleus, which enhances RXRγ-mediated gene transcription activity and reprograms gene expression, promoting tumor stemness and metastasis, and eventually driving SCLC chemoresistance. In turn, RXRγ antagonist disrupts RXRγ–LSD1 interaction, reducing their binding to the target gene locus, markedly suppressing the expression of the RXRγ target gene network. Finally, RXRγ antagonists strongly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple preclinical SCLC models, resulting in a substantial extension of survival in mouse models. Thus, these results establish RXRγ as a key player in SCLC by phase separation and as a potential therapeutic target for this deadly disease.",

          "abstract": "The process of domestication is commonly perceived as a human achievement, and domestic species are typically assumed to be those under human control. Domestic species have emerged from a greater diversity of interactions than this perspective allows, and none of the many definitions proposed for domestication can readily, reliably, and consistently distinguish domestic and nondomestic populations. Here, we propose that the process of domestication should instead be defined solely as evolution of a nonhuman population in response to an anthropogenic niche and that a domestic population is one that cannot sustain itself outside of an anthropogenic niche. As a result, this definition does not require comparisons with a presumed and largely unobservable ancestor. Instead, it focuses on the observable relationship between a nonhuman population and humans. It also avoids making assumptions about how domestication happens, thus enabling an exploration of the mechanisms underlying the process of adaptation to an anthropogenic niche. By applying this definition to plants, animals, and microbes, we illustrate its utility for investigating the evolution of the relationship between humans and other species and for anticipating which species are likely to survive in an increasingly human-influenced world. Domestication is simply an evolutionary process resulting from the interaction between two species, one of which is human. As we work to protect Earth’s biodiversity, this definition allows us to understand why, in response to the conditions human societies create, some species survive and thrive, while others struggle and go extinct.",

Numerous studies have investigated the morphology of Bouligands and their mechanical properties, yet understanding their structure–function relationship remains challenging due to the complex mechanical responses of biological materials and the limitation of current characterization techniques. Motivated to elucidate the design principles of the natural Bouligand structure for impact mitigation, we conduct impact experiments on synthetic Bouligand films composed of cellulose nanocrystals. By controlling the sonication conditions and evaporation rate of the cellulose nanocrystal suspensions, Bouligand films with controlled variations in pitch and thicknesses are generated. The impact performance and mechanical response of these materials are quantified using a microprojectile-based coefficient of restitution experiments and postimpact damage characterization. Our studies reveal two different energy dissipation mechanisms: plastic deformation and acoustic wave attenuation. The transition in mechanism is governed by the film thickness, the helical pitch dimension, and the moisture content of the film.",

Activated resident, not monocyte-derived, macrophages relocated to the injury site via Cx3cr1 and phagocytosed dysfunctional/detached astrocytes via scavenger receptors and TLR4, particularly after repetitive concussion. Additionally, microglia sealed areas of blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption via purinergic pathways.

          "abstract": "The ecological upheavals produced by the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction event (K-Pg, −66 Ma) have been mostly studied at large scale with emphasis on clades’ diversity dynamics. How this event affected the structure of paleocommunities is comparatively less investigated, especially within large vertebrate clades like fish. Here, we quantified changes in the contribution of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, rays) and actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes) to the fish community across the K-Pg extinction by analyzing ichthyolith (fossil teeth and denticles) abundance through time. Based on extensive sampling of 20 horizons from two outcrops spanning the K-Pg event in Austria (&gt;4 tons of rock, &gt;9,000 ichthyoliths), we show that the K-Pg event fostered elasmobranch abundance while reducing actinopterygian density in the Tethys Ocean. Elasmobranch ichthyolith dominance in postextinction communities is not driven by estimated local environmental change (paleobathymetry, bottom-water oxygenation) and may relate to the greater independence of this clade from lower trophic levels in their ecology and early life stages than actinopterygians. We further measured the size structure of ichthyolith assemblages and found that the K-Pg event initiated an increase in the range of ecological niche space occupied by elasmobranchs simultaneously to the demise of actinopterygians in postextinction communities. Finally, using the fine taxonomic resolution of the elasmobranch fossil record, we demonstrate that local environmental fluctuations controlled elasmobranch community structure and richness, which are decoupled from global-scale upheavals. Our results challenge previous hypotheses and provide insights into global and regional environmental forcing over the structure of fish communities across a mass extinction event.",

Manipulation of stomatal densities alters dehiscence dynamics, suggesting a contribution of controlled transpiration. Furthermore, analyses of subcellular markers revealed the occurrence of a developmentally prepared and environmentally triggered programmed cell death (PCD) process in specific anther tissues, epidermis and endothecium.

This study aimed to identify mechanisms governing the sex-specific efficacy of TNFR2 activation on abrogating pain and motor disease severity in mice experiencing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS. We find that the XX sex-chromosome complement is indispensable for TNFR2-mediated attenuation of EAE-associated motor disease. Mice with XY chromosomes experienced exacerbated motor disease severity, associated with an elevated magnitude of neurodegeneration and demyelination. Contrasting this, we show that TNFR2-mediated alleviation of EAE induced CNP is both sex and sex-chromosome independent. However, the alleviation of CNP following TNFR2 activation across two different neuropathic pain models (EAE and chronic constriction injury) was dependent on the gonadal hormone Activin-A. This suggests a shared mechanism through which gonadal-derived factors impact TNFR2-mediated pain relief, independent of sex hormones. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex chromosomes and sex-independent gonadal hormones in evaluating potential sex-specific differences in drug efficacy during therapeutic development.",

Through a systematic literature review, in-depth case studies, and framework development, we provide a structured methodology for capturing the diverse benefits of these technologies. Our findings reveal that platform technologies generate value across strategic, technical, and adaptive dimensions, requiring a multifaceted valuation approach. The proposed Platform Value Identification across Strategic, Technical, and Adaptive domains Framework defines key value drivers, specifies quantitative assessment metrics, and provides implementation guidance to inform strategic decision-making in research and development investment, portfolio management, and business development. Application of the framework to case studies of Alnylam’s RNAi platform, Genentech’s therapeutic antibody platform, and Moderna’s mRNA platform demonstrates its broad utility and impact potential. By adopting this holistic, data-driven approach, stakeholders can better assess the long-term value and competitive advantages of well-implemented platform technologies, accelerating the development of transformative therapies for patients.",

          "abstract": "The prolyl isomerase Pin1 catalyzes the cis – trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds, a noncovalent posttranslational modification that influences cellular and molecular processes, including protein–protein interactions. Pin1 is a two-domain enzyme containing a WW domain that recognizes phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline (pS/pT-P) canonical motifs and an enzymatic PPIase domain that catalyzes proline cis – trans isomerization of pS/pT-P motifs. Here, we show that Pin1 uses a tethering mechanism to bind and catalyze proline cis – trans isomerization of a noncanonical motif in the disordered N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) domain of the human nuclear receptor PPARγ. NMR reveals multiple Pin1 binding regions within the PPARγ AF-1, including a canonical motif (pS112-P113) that when phosphorylated by the kinase ERK2 binds the Pin1 WW domain with high affinity. NMR methods reveal that Pin1 also binds and accelerates cis – trans isomerization of a noncanonical motif containing a tryptophan-proline motif (W39-P40) previously shown to be involved in an interdomain interaction with the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPARγ. Cellular transcription studies combined with mutagenesis and Pin1 inhibitor treatment reveal a functional role for Pin1-mediated acceleration of cis – trans isomerization of the PPARγ W39-P40 motif. Our data inform a refined model of the Pin1 catalytic mechanism where the WW domain can bind a canonical pS/T-P motif and tether Pin1 to a target, which enables the PPIase domain to exert catalytic cis – trans isomerization at a distal noncanonical site.",

          "abstract": "The switch from precursor cell proliferation to onset of differentiation in adult stem cell lineages must be carefully regulated to produce sufficient progeny to maintain and repair tissues, yet prevent overproliferation that may enable oncogenesis. In the Drosophila male germ cell lineage, spermatogonia produced by germ line stem cells undergo a limited number of transit amplifying mitotic divisions before switching to the spermatocyte program that sets up meiosis and eventual spermatid differentiation. The number of transit amplifying divisions is set by accumulation of the bag-of-marbles (Bam) protein to a critical threshold. In bam mutants, spermatogonia proliferate through several extra rounds of mitosis and then die without becoming spermatocytes. Here, we show that a key role of Bam for the mitosis to differentiation switch is repressing expression of Held Out Wings ( how ), homolog of mammalian Quaking. Knockdown of how in germ cells was sufficient to allow spermatogonia mutant for bam or its partner benign gonial cell neoplasm to differentiate, while forced expression of nuclear-targeted How protein in spermatogonia wild-type for bam resulted in continued proliferation at the expense of differentiation. Our findings suggest that Bam targets how RNA for degradation by acting as an adapter to recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex via binding its subunit, Caf40. As How is itself an RNA-binding protein with roles in RNA processing, our findings reveal that the switch from proliferation to meiosis and differentiation in the Drosophila male germ line adult stem cell lineage is regulated by a cascade of RNA-binding proteins.",

          "abstract": "Many human phenotypic traits vary between the sexes, including adult height for which males are, on average, 13 cm taller than females. The biological mechanisms for this sexual dimorphism are not entirely understood. One hypothesis to explain the sexual dimorphism in height relates to differential expression in males and females of SHOX , a height-related gene in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) on the X and Y sex chromosomes. SHOX expression is reduced on the inactive X chromosome (Xi), compared to the active X in females. Sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), characterized by an atypical number of X and/or Y chromosomes, serve as informative models for investigating PAR1-related gene dosage effects. Here, we leveraged three large biobanks to study 928,605 individuals, including 1,225 adults with SCAs: 45,X (n = 95), 47,XXY (n = 505), 47,XYY (n = 290), and 47,XXX (n = 335). By modeling height across individuals with various sex chromosome complements, we quantified the contributions of five sex-related genomic contributors to height, including Xi chromosome dosage, Y chromosome dosage, male sex hormones, and effects of Klinefelter and Turner syndromes. We found that a unit increase in Y chromosome dosage confers 3.1cm (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.3) more to height than a unit increase in Xi chromosome dosage, independent of hormonal variables. The larger increase in height conferred by the Y chromosome explained 22.6% of the observed difference in height between 46,XY males and 46,XX females. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that reduced SHOX expression in females results in a net difference in height between the sexes.",

Here, we used a genomics-led approach to identify candidate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) hypothesized to produce HPS-containing natural products. We show that one of these BGCs is on the pathogenicity megaplasmid of the plant pathogen Rhodococcus fascians and produces lydiamycin A, a macrocyclic pentapeptide. The presence of genes predicted to make an HPS-like chemophore informed the structural recharacterization of lydiamycin via NMR and crystallography to show that it features a rare 2-pentyl-succinyl chemophore. We demonstrate that lydiamycin A inhibits bacterial PDF in vitro and show that a cluster-situated PDF gene confers resistance to lydiamycin A, representing an uncommon self-immunity mechanism associated with the production of a PDF inhibitor . In planta competition assays showed that lydiamycin enhances the fitness of R. fascians during plant colonization.

          "abstract": "We perceive a stable, continuous world despite drastic changes of retinal images across saccades. However, while persistent objects in daily life appear stable across saccades, stimuli flashed around saccades can be grossly mislocalized. We address this puzzle with our recently proposed circuit model for perisaccadic receptive-field (RF) remapping in the lateral interparietal area (LIP) and frontal eye fields (FEF). The model uses center-excitation/surround-inhibition connections to store a relevant stimulus’ retinal location in memory as a population activity. This activity profile is updated across each saccade by directional connections gated by the corollary discharge (CD) of the saccade command. The updating is a continuous backward (against the saccade) shift of the population activity (equivalent to continuous forward remapping of the RFs), whose cumulative effect across the saccade is a subtraction of the saccade vector. The model that correctly updates persistent stimuli, and flashes well before and after saccades, produces the observed forward and backward translational mislocalization for flashes around the saccade onset and offset, respectively, because of insufficient and unnecessary cumulative updating after the saccade, caused by visual response latency and sluggish CD time course. We confirm the model prediction that for perisaccadic RFs measured with flashes before the saccades, the forward remapping magnitudes across the saccades are smaller for later flashes. Our work suggests that transsaccadic perception is stable because the presaccadic retinal position of an object is updated to match the postsaccadic (reafferent) retinal position of the same object, and that the brain uses “unaware” decoders which do not distinguish between different origins of neurons’ activities.",

          "abstract": "The maintenance of biodiversity crucially depends on the evolutionary potential of populations to adapt to environmental change. Accelerating climate change and extreme temperature events urge us to better understand and forecast evolutionary responses. Here, we harnessed the power of experimental evolution with the microbial model system yeast ( Saccharomyces spp. ) to measure the evolutionary potential of populations to adapt to future warming, in real-time and across the entire phylogenetic diversity of the genus. We tracked the evolution of thermal performance curves (TPCs) in populations of eight genetically and ecologically diverse species under gradually increasing temperature conditions, from 25 to 40 °C, for up to 600 generations. We found that evolving toward higher critical thermal limits generally came at a cost, causing a decrease in both thermal tolerance and maximum growth performance. The evolution of TPCs varied significantly between species with strong genotype-by-environment interactions, revealing two main trajectories: i) Warm-tolerant species showed an increase in both optimum growth temperature and thermal tolerance, consistent with the “hotter is wider” hypothesis. ii) Cold-tolerant species on the other hand evolved larger thermal breadth and higher thermal limits, but suffered from reduced maximum performance overall, consistent with the generalist or “a jack of all temperatures is a master of none” hypothesis. In addition, cold-tolerant species never reached the warm-tolerant species’ upper thermal limits. Our results show that adaptive strategies to increasing temperatures are complex, highlighting the need to consider both within and between species diversity when predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on populations.",

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can provide detailed, atomistic mechanisms of this sophisticated ion permeation. However, currently there are clear inconsistencies between computational predictions and experimental results. First, the ion occupancy of the SF in simulations is lower than expected (~2.5 in MD compared to ~4 in X-ray crystallography). Second, in many reported MD simulations of K + channels, K + conductance is typically an order of magnitude lower than experimental values. This discrepancy is in part because the force fields used in MD simulations of potassium channels do not account for polarization. One of the proposed solutions is the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC), a force field modification that scales down formal charges, to introduce the polarization in a mean-field way. When the ECC is used in conjunction with the Charmm36m force field, the simulated K + conductance increases 13-fold. Following the analysis of ion occupancy states using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange simulations, we propose a parameter set for Amber14sb, that also leads to a similar increase in conductance. These two force fields are then used to compute the full current–voltage (I-V) curves from MD simulations, approaching quantitative agreement with experiments at all voltages. In general, the ECC-enabled simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment, in terms of ion occupancy, conductance, current–voltage response, and K + /Na + selectivity.",

          "abstract": "Acute knockout of the rod photoreceptor transcription factor Nrl delays retinal degeneration in multiple mouse models of blindness, but the downstream transcriptomic changes that mediate these therapeutic effects are unknown. Here, we show that acute Nrl knockout causes upregulation of a subset of cone genes in rods as well as downregulation of rod genes, including the rod-specific transcriptional repressor Nr2e3 . We hypothesized that Nr2e3 downregulation might mediate some of the therapeutic effects of Nrl knockout. Indeed, acute knockout of Nr2e3 prevents photoreceptor degeneration and preserves visual function in mice with mutations in the catalytic subunit of the rod-specific phosphodiesterase ( Pde6b rd10/rd10 ). Upregulation of Pde6c , the cone-specific paralog of Pde6b , in Nr2e3 -knockout rods is required to prevent degeneration in Pde6b rd10/rd10 mice, suggesting that this therapeutic effect is mediated, at least in part, by a gene-replacement mechanism. In contrast, acute Nr2e3 knockout fails to prevent degeneration caused by loss- or gain-of-function mutations in Rhodopsin ( Rho −/− and Rho P23H/P23H ), whereas acute Nrl knockout delays degeneration in both models. Surprisingly, the therapeutic effect of acute Nrl knockout in Pde6b rd10/rd10 mice does not depend on Pde6c upregulation. These results suggest that acute Nrl knockout may exert its therapeutic effects via a mechanism independent of Nr2e3 downregulation, perhaps by downregulating other rod genes. We conclude that acute NRL knockout may be a promising gene-independent strategy for preventing photoreceptor degeneration in human patients.",

          "abstract": "Oxygen is crucial for mitochondrial energy production in neurons and is efficiently stored and transported within the hydrophobic core of phospholipid bilayers. Using a diffusive model derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that oxygen storage in a bilayer follows first-order kinetics, which can be effectively represented by an RC (resistor–capacitor) circuit. For myelin, with multiple bilayers, oxygen transport is modeled through a ladder network of RC circuits, where oxygen permeation resistance and oxygen storage capacity scale linearly with bilayer count. Meanwhile, the characteristic time constant scales quadratically with myelin thickness, e.g. enhancing the characteristic time constant from 30 ns for one 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer to 506 μ s for 200 POPC bilayers. This model shows that myelin sheaths serve as compact oxygen reservoirs, dampening sudden oxygen changes due to their slower release kinetics. During increased neuronal activity, the model suggests that myelination extends the ability to sustain elevated oxygen demand, implying a buffering role for myelin against oxygen fluctuations, while the need for vascular response remains critical in maintaining long-term oxygen homeostasis.",

Phosphatidylserine synthases 1 and 2 (PSS1 and PSS2) are homologous enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS) from different substrates. PSS2 shows a preference for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as its substrate, whereas PSS1 can utilize either PE or phosphatidylcholine. Previous studies showed that inhibiting PSS1 promotes SREBP-2 cleavage. Interestingly, despite their homology, our findings reveal that PSS2 exerts an opposing effect on the cleavage of both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. We resolved the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human PSS2 at 3.3 Å resolution. Structural comparison of the catalytic cavities between PSS1 and PSS2 along with molecular dynamics simulations uncovers the molecular details behind the substrate preference of PSS2 for PE. The lipidomic analysis showed that PSS2 deficiency leads to PE accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum, which has been shown to inhibit the cleavage of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in mice. Thus, our findings reveal the intricate network of intracellular phospholipid metabolism and underscore the distinct regulatory roles of homologous proteins in cellular activities.",

          "abstract": "IgG antibodies are the basis for many successful therapeutics. A single, N-linked glycan is present on the Fc on all IgGs, and the composition of that glycan exerts marked influence over effector functions of the IgG. We and others have shown terminal sialylation of the Fc glycan confers anti-inflammatory activity to the IgG1 subclass and is thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. However, whether sialylation results in anti-inflammatory activity for other IgG subclasses is unknown. We found that IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2 nor IgG4, suppressed autoantibody-mediated inflammation in vivo when sialylated. This activity was dependent upon human DC-SIGN or its murine ortholog, SIGN-R1. Fc γ receptor-binding profiles for asialylated and sialylated IgG subclasses reinforced these similarities, with IgG1 and IgG3 sharing binding patterns. Amino acid sequence alignments identified two uniquely conserved amino acid residues at positions 234 and 327 of the CH2 domain of all human IgG1 and IgG3 allotypes that were distinct from IgG2 and IgG4. Indeed, molecular modeling of the shared residues in IgG1 and IgG3 revealed a hydrophobic-heavy interchain interaction that was not present in IgG2 nor IgG4. Introduction of those IgG1/3 residues into an IgG4-Fc resulted in anti-inflammatory activity in vivo when sialylated. Conversely, a reciprocal sialylated IgG1 mutant with IgG2/4 residues lacked anti-inflammatory activity. These results define the amino acid requirements of anti-inflammatory sialylated IgG and enable rational amino acid and glycan engineering across all therapeutic IgG subclasses.",

Characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of these consequences may provide baseline estimates of past diversity and productivity to aid management targets, help predict future dynamics, and facilitate the identification of evolutionary factors limiting fish population recovery. Here, we evaluate human impacts on the evolution of the iconic Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ), one of the longest and most intensely exploited marine fishes, with a tremendous cultural and economic importance. We sequenced whole genomes from modern (n = 49) and ancient (n = 41) specimens dating up to 5,000 y ago, uncovering several findings. First, we identify temporally stable patterns of population admixture, as bluefin tuna caught off Norway and in the eastern Mediterranean share a greater degree of ancestry with Gulf of Mexico bluefin tuna than western and central Mediterranean bluefin tuna. This suggests that Atlantic spawning areas are important mixing grounds for the genetic diversity of Mediterranean bluefin tuna. We model effective population size to show that Mediterranean bluefin tuna began to undergo a demographic decline by the year 1900 to an extent not observed across the previous millennia. Coinciding with this, we found that heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity were significantly lower in modern (2013 to 2020) than ancient (pre-1941) Mediterranean bluefin tuna, suggesting that bluefin tuna underwent a genetic bottleneck. With this work, we show how ancient DNA provides unique perspectives on ecological complexity with the potential to inform the management and conservation of fishes.",

          "abstract": "It is clear that the escalating epidemic of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has reached a crisis level in the United States, that overweight and obesity are drivers, and that diets and the food system have major roles. It is also clear that nutrition and medical research point to increased healthful fruit and vegetable intake as a key part of any strategy to manage the crisis. But although increasing healthful intake entails both expanding production of fruits and vegetables and improving their healthful characteristics, horticulture has generally been sidelined or taken for granted when strategies are envisioned. This article makes the case that horticulture research and practice can and should be equal partners with nutrition and medicine in the pressing search for effective crisis-management strategies. To do so, it first “runs the numbers” for the scale of the crisis, for trends in fruit and vegetable intake and production, for the scant federal support for horticultural crop production and research, and for horticulture research’s high return on investment. The article then sketches a roadmap to integrate horticulture research and community outreach with nutrition and healthcare, stressing new opportunities. The goal is a US food system that i) makes healthful fruits and vegetables accessible, affordable, and appealing for all and ii) complements a healthcare system spanning patient-based to population-based nutrition.",

          "abstract": "New evidence on the timing of early angiosperm evolution is presented through the discovery of four well-dated tricolpate pollen grains from the Early Cretaceous midlatitudes. Recovered from nearshore marine sediments in the Lusitanian Basin of Portugal, these fossils significantly expand the pre-Aptian tricolpate pollen record and document a greater number of pre-Aptian tricolpate grains in the midlatitudes than previously recognized. The fossil evidence was obtained through the innovative application of advanced microscopy techniques and was precisely dated through biostratigraphy and strontium isotope stratigraphy on material from the same section. These findings extend the first occurrence of tricolpate pollen to the early late Barremian (~123.0 Ma) in Portugal and possibly worldwide. Our findings provide fossil evidence with minimal dating uncertainty, as both the fossils and their age determination come from the same well-constrained sections, eliminating the need for cross-correlation. This establishes the most reliable age for the first occurrence of tricolpate pollen, unequivocally linked to the eudicot clade—an early derived lineage within angiosperms. These fossils serve as a robust calibration point for phylogenetic studies. Additionally, our study emphasizes the importance of methodological advancements in refining the fossil plant record. The newly applied fluorescence screening method when adapted also in future research could further enhance the detection of rare fossils, offering insights into the diversification of angiosperms.",

          "abstract": "Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather models and long-term climate emulators. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI weather model FourCastNet on the 1979–2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3–5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018–2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3–5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3–5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather and climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models. Other types of weather extremes need to be similarly investigated. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI models to reliably provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful TCs, and, possibly, other weather extremes.",

These conditions are pathologically related, and TBI is one of the greatest risk factors for AD. Although blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption drives progression of both AD and TBI, strategies to preserve BBB integrity have been hindered by lack of actionable targets. Here, we identify 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), an enzyme that catabolizes eicosanoids and other anti-inflammatory mediators, as a therapeutic candidate that protects the BBB. We demonstrate that 15-PGDH is enriched in BBB-associated myeloid cells and becomes markedly elevated in human and mouse models of AD and TBI, as well as aging, another major risk factor for AD. Pathological increase in 15-PGDH correlates with pronounced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, alongside profound BBB structural degeneration characterized by astrocytic endfeet swelling and functional impairment. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic reduction of 15-PGDH in AD and TBI models strikingly mitigates oxidative damage, suppresses neuroinflammation, and restores BBB integrity. Most notably, inhibiting 15-PGDH not only halts neurodegeneration but also preserves cognitive function at levels indistinguishable from healthy controls. Remarkably, these neuroprotective effects in AD are achieved without affecting amyloid pathology, underscoring a noncanonical mechanism for treating AD. In a murine microglia cell line exposed to amyloid beta oligomer, major protection was demonstrated by multiple anti-inflammatory substrates that 15-PGDH degrades. Thus, our findings position 15-PGDH inhibition as a broad-spectrum strategy to protect the BBB and thereby preserve brain health and cognition in AD and TBI.",

Through deletion of Utx in the skin, we demonstrate direct regulation of both retinoid metabolic genes such as Crabp2 , as well as key genes involved in epidermal stem cell fate and differentiation (i.e., Cdh1 , Grhl3 , Ctnnb1 ). Spatial analyses show that UTX loss dysregulates epidermal, sebaceous, and hair follicle differentiation programs. Strikingly, this only occurs in homozygous females, demonstrating that UTX’s Y-linked paralog, UTY ( Kdm6c ), can compensate in males. Further, we observe genome-wide losses of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) with minimal changes in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), revealing that UTX functions primarily noncatalytically to promote skin homeostasis. Together, the elucidation of these links between epigenetics, metabolic signaling, and epithelial differentiation offers new insights into how epigenetic modulation may allow for fine-tuning of key signaling pathways to treat disease.",

For dioecious species (those with separate sexes), it is unclear how commonly unique climate sensitivities of females and males could influence projections for species-level responses to climate change. We developed demographic models of range limitation, parameterized from geographically distributed common garden experiments, with females and males of a dioecious grass species ( Poa arachnifera ) throughout and beyond its range in the south-central U.S. We contrasted predictions of a standard female-dominant model with those of a two-sex model that accounts for feedbacks between sex ratio and vital rates. Both model versions predict that future climate change will induce a poleward shift of niche suitability beyond current northern limits. However, the magnitude of the poleward shift was underestimated by the female-dominant model because females have broader temperature tolerance than males but become mate-limited under female-biased sex ratios, which are forecasted to become more common under future climate. Our results illustrate how explicitly accounting for both sexes can enhance population viability forecasts and conservation planning for dioecious species in response to climate change.",

Using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model system we show that neuronal activation of the integrated stress response triggers expression of the Interleukin-6 homolog unpaired 3 ( upd3 ), which is both necessary and sufficient for axon length–dependent degeneration of presynapses. Upd3 activates phagocytic glia, triggering phagocytic removal of presynapses preferentially on neurons with long axons, thus revealing an intrinsic axon length–dependent vulnerability to glial insult. Finally, we found that axon length–dependent presynapse loss in fly models of human NDDs utilized this pathway, requiring upd3 and glial expression of the phagocytic receptor draper. Our studies identify inflammatory cytokine signaling and glial phagocytosis as key determinants of axon length–dependent vulnerability, thus mechanistically linking these hallmarks of NDDs.",

Its dysfunction is linked to various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Hao-Fountain syndrome. Unlike other USP-family enzymes, the triad of catalytic residues in USP7 adopts an inactive conformation and undergoes rearrangement into the active state upon substrate binding. Despite its potential importance for regulating the enzyme’s activity, the dynamics of USP7 have not been explored. In this study, we combine advanced CPMG NMR relaxation dispersion measurements with the analysis of enzyme kinetics to investigate the conformational dynamics of USP7 in solution and its role in enzyme activation. Our results suggest that apo-USP7 exists in a dynamic equilibrium, transiently switching between inactive and low-populated active conformations, indicating that enzyme activation can occur spontaneously, even in the absence of a substrate. Furthermore, we show that the Hao-Fountain syndrome-associated variant G392D enhances the conformational dynamics of the enzyme, leading to a significant increase in its catalytic activity. This study captures the sparsely populated, \"invisible\" active conformation of USP7 and demonstrates how changes in enzyme dynamics can contribute to activity, offering broader insights into enzyme function and disease mechanisms.",

We report herein that the binding of an antiviral agent, acetic acid benzodiazepine (BDAA), to YFV NS4B not only rapidly inhibits YFV RNA synthesis, but also induces the activation of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-sensing pathways to accelerate the apoptosis of infected cells. Genetic analyses revealed that all the three cytoplasmic dsRNA-sensing pathways contribute to YFV induction of apoptosis, whereas only retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors and RNase L pathways are required for BDAA acceleration of infected cell death. Our findings support the notion that BDAA binding of NS4B impairs the integrity of ROs, leading to the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and exposure of viral RNA replication intermediates for the activation of dsRNA sensors and acceleration of infected cell apoptosis.

          "abstract": "Animal behavior can be decomposed into a sequence of discrete activity bouts over time. Analyzing the statistical structure of such behavioral sequences can provide insights into the drivers of behavioral decisions. Laboratory studies, predominantly in invertebrates, have suggested that behavioral sequences exhibit multiple timescales and long-range memory, but whether these results can be generalized to other taxa and to animals in natural settings remains unclear. By analyzing accelerometer-inferred predictions of behavioral states in three species of social mammals (meerkats, white-nosed coatis, and spotted hyenas) in the wild, we found surprisingly consistent structuring of behavioral sequences across all behavioral states, all individuals, and all study species. Behavioral bouts were characterized by decreasing hazard functions, wherein the longer a behavioral bout had progressed, the less likely it was to end within the next instant. The predictability of an animal’s future behavioral state as a function of its present state always decreased as a truncated power-law for predictions made farther into the future, with very similar estimates for the power law exponent across all species. Finally, the distributions of bout durations were also heavy-tailed. Why such shared structural principles emerge remains unknown, and we explore multiple plausible explanations, including environmental nonstationarity, behavioral self-reinforcement, and the hierarchical nature of behavior. The existence of highly consistent patterns in behavioral sequences across our study species suggests that these phenomena could be widespread in nature, and points to the existence of fundamental properties of behavioral dynamics that could drive such convergent patterns.",

We dissect a catch bond mechanism in which force shifts vinculin between either a weakly or strongly bound state. Our results demonstrate that models for these states have unbinding times consistent with those from single-molecule studies, and suggest that both have some intrinsic catch-bonding behavior. We provide atomistic insight into this behavior, and show how a directional pulling force can promote the strong or weak state.

Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in the brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in metabolic reprogramming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of Aβ. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased levels of Aβ plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism and the ability of the cells to take up Aβ, such that reduced insulin signaling in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. Together, these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.",

          "abstract": "Nonenzymatic RNA copying is thought to have been responsible for the replication of genetic information during the origin of life. However, chemical copying with the canonical nucleotides (A, U, G, and C) strongly favors the incorporation of G and C and disfavors the incorporation of A and especially U because of the stronger G:C vs. A:U base pair and the weaker stacking interactions of U. Recent advances in prebiotic chemistry suggest that the 2-thiopyrimidines were precursors to the canonical pyrimidines, raising the possibility that they may have played an important early role in RNA copying chemistry. Furthermore, 2-thiouridine (s 2 U) and inosine (I) form by deamination of 2-thiocytidine (s 2 C) and A, respectively. We used thermodynamic and crystallographic analyses to compare the I:s 2 C and A:s 2 U base pairs. We find that the I:s 2 C base pair is isomorphic and isoenergetic with the A:s 2 U base pair. The I:s 2 C base pair is weaker than a canonical G:C base pair, while the A:s 2 U base pair is stronger than the canonical A:U base pair, so that a genetic alphabet consisting of s 2 U, s 2 C, I, and A generates RNA duplexes with uniform base pairing energies. Consistent with these results, kinetic analysis of nonenzymatic template-directed primer extension reactions reveals that s 2 C and s 2 U substrates bind similarly to I and A in the template, and vice versa. Our work supports the plausibility of a potentially primordial genetic alphabet consisting of s 2 U, s 2 C, I, and A and offers a potential solution to the long-standing problem of biased nucleotide incorporation during nonenzymatic template copying.",

Sub-100 nm diamond nanosensors can readily be delivered into intact cells and even living organisms. However, applications beyond current proof-of-principle experiments require a substantial increase in sensitivity, which is limited by surface induced charge instability and electron-spin dephasing. In this work, we utilize engineered core-shell structures to achieve a drastic increase in qubit coherence times ( T 2 ) from 1.1 to 35 μs in bare nanodiamonds to upward of 52 to 87 μs. We use electron-paramagnetic-resonance results to present a band bending model and connect silica encapsulation to the removal of deleterious mid-gap surface states that are negatively affecting the qubit’s spin properties. Combined with a 1.9-fold increase in particle luminescence these advances correspond to up to two-order-of-magnitude reduction in integration time. Probing qubit dynamics at a single particle level further reveals that the noise characteristics fundamentally change from a bath with spins that rearrange their spatial configuration during the course of an experiment to a more dilute static bath. The observed results shed light on the underlying mechanisms governing fluorescence and spin properties in diamond nanocrystals and offer an effective noise mitigation strategy based on engineered core-shell structures.",

          "abstract": "During arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis AM fungi form tree-shaped structures called arbuscules in root cortex cells of host plants. Arbuscules and their host cells are central for reciprocal nutrient exchange between the symbionts. REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION1 ( RAM1 ) encodes a GRAS protein crucial for transcriptionally regulating plant genes needed for arbuscule development and nutrient exchange. Similar to other GRAS proteins, RAM1 likely does not bind to DNA and how RAM1 activates its target promoters remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RAM1 interacts with five AM-induced APETALA 2 (AP2) transcription factors of the WRINKLED1-like family called CTTC MOTIF-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (CBX1), WRI3, WRI5a, WRI5b, and WRI5c via a C-terminal domain containing the M2/M2a motif. This motif is conserved and enriched in WRI proteins encoded by genomes of AM-competent plants. RAM1 together with any of these WRI proteins activates the promoters of genes required for symbiotic nutrient exchange, namely RAM2 , STUNTED ARBUSCULES (STR), and PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 4 (PT4) , in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This activation as well as target promoter induction in Lotus japonicus hairy roots depends on MYCS ( MYCORRHIZA SEQUENCE )-elements and AW -boxes, previously identified as WRI-binding sites. The WRI genes are activated in two waves: Transcription of RAM1 , CBX1, and WRI3 is coregulated by calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-activated CYCLOPS, through the AMCYC-RE in their promoter, and DELLA, while WRI5a , b, and c promoters contain MYCS -elements and AW -boxes and can be activated by RAM1 heterocomplexes with CBX1 or WRI3. We propose that RAM1 provides an activation domain to DNA-binding WRI proteins to activate genes with central roles in AM development and function.",

          "abstract": "In response to changing blood pressure, arteries adjust their caliber to control blood flow. This vital autoregulatory property, termed vascular myogenic tone, stabilizes downstream capillary pressure. Here, we reveal that tissue temperature, combined with intraluminal pressure, critically determines myogenic tone. Heating steeply activates tone in skeletal muscle, gut, brain, and skin arteries with temperature coefficients ( Q 10 ) of ~11 to 20. Each of these tissues has a distinct resting temperature, and we find that arterial thermosensitivity is tuned to this temperature, making myogenic tone sensitive to small thermal fluctuations. Interestingly, temperature and intraluminal pressure are sensed largely independently and the signals integrated to trigger myogenic tone. We demonstrate that thermosensitive channels TRPV1 and TRPM4 mediate heat-induced tone in skeletal muscle arteries with discrete temperature sensitivities. Similarly, TRPM4 contributes to heat-induced tone in gut and brain arteries. The half-maximal responses occur at approximately 31 °C for TRPV1 and 33 °C for TRPM4. Variations in tissue temperature are known to alter blood fluidity and therefore vascular conductance; remarkably, thermosensitive tone counterbalances this effect, thus protecting capillary integrity and fluid balance. In conclusion, thermosensitive myogenic tone is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism regulating tissue perfusion.",

          "abstract": "In large, natural ecosystems, many ( ≳ 1) phenotypically relevant mutants can emerge over the characteristic turnover time of the population. When this is the case, there can be ‘eco-evolutionary feedback’ between the dynamical processes that underlie mutation, selection and ecology. We show that, owing to such feedback, the precise details of the mutational process can have a qualitative impact on the long-term behavior of an eco-evolutionary system, in contrast to the classical population genetic assumption that all mutations can be modeled with an effective, homogeneous rate. We demonstrate this in the context of a version of MacArthur’s consumer-resource model in which consumers mutate along a resource preference trait-space. Starting from a stochastic individual-based model, we simulate the system in the case where mutations are exogenously generated at a fixed rate (e.g. via external mutagens) and in the case where mutations are coupled to replication (e.g. via DNA copying errors). We find that, surprisingly, replication-coupled mutations are capable of generating a patterned phase in the limit of fast ecological relaxation – precisely the regime where classical population genetic models are expected to operate. We derive a mean-field description of the stochastic model and show that the patterned phase comes about due to a Turing-like mechanism driven by the non-reciprocal and nonlinear nature of replicative mutations. Furthermore, we show that additional interactions like those due to host defense mechanisms can extend the patterned regime to arbitrarily high dimensional phenotype spaces. We demonstrate that these results are robust to demographic noise and model choices and we discuss systems in which this phenomenology might be relevant.",

          "abstract": "Desert surfaces are typically nonuniform, with individual sand dunes generally surrounded by gravel or nonerodible beds. Similarly, beaches vary in composition and moisture that enhances cohesion between the grains. These bed heterogeneities affect the aeolian transport properties greatly and can then influence the emergence and dynamics of bedforms. Here, we propose a model that describes how, due to transport capacity being greater on consolidated than erodible beds, patches of sand can grow, migrate, and spread to form bedforms with meter-scale length. Our approach has a quantitative agreement with high-resolution spatiotemporal observations, where conventional theory would predict the disappearance of these small bedforms. A crucial component of the model is that the transport capacity does not instantly change from one bed configuration to another. Instead, transport capacity develops over a certain distance, which thereby determines the short-term evolution of the bedform. The model predicts various stages in the development of these meter-scale bedforms, and explains how the evolution of bed elevation profiles observed in the field depends on the duration of the wind event and the intensity of the incoming sand flux. Our study thus sheds light on the initiation and dynamics of early-stage bedforms by establishing links between surface properties, emerging sand patterns, and protodunes, commonly observed in coastal and desert landscapes.",

As irradiance levels are reduced, however, the particle nature of light is heightened, giving rise to Poisson noise, or photon sparsity that restricts only a few (0.5%) image pixels to comprise a photon. Photon sparsity can be addressed by collecting approximately 200 photons per pixel; this, however, requires long acquisitions and, as such, suboptimal imaging rates. Here, we introduce near-zero photon bioimaging, a method that operates at kHz rates and 10,000-fold lower irradiance than standard microscopy. To achieve this level of performance, we uniquely combined a judiciously designed epifluorescence microscope enabling ultralow background levels and AI that learns to reconstruct biological images from as low as 0.01 photons per pixel. We demonstrate that near-zero photon bioimaging captures the structure of multicellular and subcellular features with high fidelity, including features represented by nearly zero photons.

How auditory neural circuits respond to extended input sequences to guide behavior is not understood. We address this problem using Drosophila acoustic communication, a behavior involving the male’s production of and female’s response to long, highly variable courtship songs. Here we ask whether female neural and behavioral responses to song are better described by a linear–nonlinear feature detection model vs. a nonlinear accumulation model. Comparing both models against head-fixed neural recordings and pure-behavioral recordings of unrestrained courtship, we found that while both models could explain the neural data, the accumulation model better predicted female locomotion during courtship, outperforming several alternative predictors. To understand how the accumulation model encoded song to predict locomotion, we analyzed the relationship between neural activity simulated by the model and female locomotion during courtship—this revealed the model’s reliance on heterogeneous nonlinear adaptation and slow integration. Finally, we asked how adaptation and integration processes could cooperate across the model neural population to encode temporal patterns in song. Simulations revealed how adaptation can transform song inputs prior to integration, allowing fine-scale song information to be retained in the population code for long periods. Thus, modeling fly auditory responses as a nonlinearly adaptive, accumulating population code accounts for female locomotor responses to song during courtship and suggests a biologically plausible mechanism for the online encoding of extended communication sequences.",

The fossil record, however, indicates that living space and energy availability and access have increased over time in response to pervasive natural selection that favors traits conferring as much power (energy per unit time) as possible, given the constraints imposed by external conditions and other organisms. Through various collaborative relationships and power-enhancing innovations, the inevitable tradeoffs among reproductive parameters envisioned in the EFP are relaxed enough that allocation to offspring can vary in space and time. We suggest that the EFP applies only under highly specific conditions of local constancy of energy availability and not to the biosphere as a whole. We note that fitness, however defined, need therefore not be constant and is difficult to measure in extant species and to infer with proxies in fossil taxa.",

          "abstract": "Our biological clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), controls behavioral activity rhythms by producing circadian rhythms in SCN electrical activity. Behavioral studies in humans suggest that the clock is sensitive not only to light but also to physical activity. Here, we examined the effect of physical activity on the brain’s clock in the diurnal rodent, Arvicanthis ansorgei . We found that the electrical activity of SCN neurons in vitro is high during the day and low during the night. Recordings via stationary microelectrodes in freely moving Arvicanthis revealed that the SCN baseline rhythm in discharge was superimposed by increments in electrical activity. These increments in electrical activity occurred during brief (seconds) or long (hours) periods of spontaneous activity of the animal and were observed at each phase of the cycle, i.e., both day and night. To establish the causal relation, we manipulated the animal’s activity by providing it with a running wheel. The voluntary use of the wheel resulted in direct and significant increments in SCN electrical activity. We conclude that behavioral activity triggers the increments in SCN electrical activity, rather than vice versa. Consequently, physical activity during the day will raise the amplitude of the SCN electrical discharge rhythm, thereby strengthening clock function. In contrast, night-time activity will be countereffective and attenuate the rhythm in electrical activity. The data elucidate the route via which daytime exercise supports clock function.",

          "abstract": "Coevolution is a ubiquitous driver of diversification in both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between species. In mutualisms, coevolution can result in trait complementarity between partners that facilitates their persistence. Despite its importance, most of what we know about coevolution in mutualism comes from obligate interactions, whereas we know comparatively little about facultative interactions, arguably the most common type of mutualism. To evaluate coevolutionary dynamics in facultative mutualism and test how it compares with obligate mutualisms, we used a synthetic yeast mutualism where the partners exchange essential nutrient resources. We manipulated mutualism dependency by controlling the availability of mutualistic resources in the environment and measured coevolution via time-shift assays and tracking the evolution of mutualistic traits over time. In addition, we genotyped the evolved and ancestral mutualists to test for differences in the strength of coevolutionary selection between facultative and obligate mutualisms. We found evidence of coevolution in both facultative and obligate mutualisms, but coevolution was weaker and slower in facultative mutualisms. We also found evidence for evolution of trait complementarity in obligate mutualisms but not in facultative mutualisms. Furthermore, obligate mutualists had more SNPs under positive selection than facultative mutualists. Together, these results provide strong evidence that mutualism dependency impacts both the strength of coevolution and the rate of trait evolution.",

Although there are several models for how gradients can pattern cell behavior, it is not clear how cells react to gradients when the population is undergoing 3D morphogenesis, in which cell–cell and cell–signal interactions are continually changing. Dictyostelium cells follow gradients of their nutritional source to feed and maintain their undifferentiated state. Using lightsheet imaging to simultaneously monitor signaling, single-cell, and population dynamics, we show that the cells migrate toward nutritional gradients in swarms. As swarms advance, they deposit clumps of cells at the rear, triggering differentiation. Clump deposition is explained by a physical model in which cell swarms behave as active droplets: cells proliferate within the swarm, with clump shedding occurring at a critical population size, at which cells at the rear no longer perceive the gradient and are not retained by the emergent surface tension of the swarm. The model predicts vortex motion of the cells within the swarm emerging from the local transfer of propulsion forces, a prediction validated by 3D tracking of single cells. This active fluid behavior reveals a developmental mechanism we term “musical chairs” decision-making, in which the decision to proliferate or differentiate is determined by the position of a cell within the group as it bifurcates.",

          "abstract": "Myosin is the primary motor protein in skeletal muscle, responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis that drives muscle contraction. In addition to force production, resting myosin consumes ATP in futile cycles at two rates, the slower one being associated with the Super Relaxed State (SRX), in contrast to the less inhibited Disordered Relaxed State (DRX). The SRX is typically measured using the mantATP chasing technique, where the decay of a fluorescent ATP analogue is fitted using a multiexponential function. Recently, significant concerns have been raised regarding the use of this technique, particularly when applied to soluble myosin preparations. While skinned fibers offer the advantage of preserving the native thick filament structure and myosin cooperativity, limited diffusion and nonspecific mantATP binding pose challenges. In this study, we combine experimental data and in-silico modeling to dissect the contributions of different components in the mantATP chasing signal. We analyze control skinned fibers and fibers subjected to myosin extraction. Our analysis shows that the nonspecific component partially overlaps with the DRX timescale. In contrast, the slow component linked to myosin SRX nucleotide release is characterized by a time constant that significantly differs from those of the nonspecific signal and DRX, enabling its reliable estimation using this technique. Our findings indicate that evaluating nonspecific mantATP components is necessary to obtain a reliable estimation of both SRX and DRX. We validated our analysis by comparing populations and time constants obtained from chasing with mantATP to mantATPase rates in control conditions and upon piperine-induced SRX destabilization.",

Recent findings have demonstrated that macrophages can transfer their own CALR onto exposed asialoglycans on target cells, marking them for PrCR. Despite the critical role CALR plays in this process, the molecular mechanisms behind its secretion by macrophages and the formation of binding sites on target cells remain unclear. Our findings show that CALR undergoes C-terminal cleavage upon secretion, producing a truncated form that functions as the active eat-me signal detectable on target cells. We identify cathepsins as potential proteases involved in this cleavage process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that macrophages release neuraminidases, which modify the surface of target cells and facilitate CALR binding. These insights reveal a coordinated mechanism through which lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages regulate CALR cleavage and neuraminidase activity to mark target cells for PrCR.

While the mechanism of auxin-mediated root gravitropism is comparably well-understood, the root’s capability to grow toward moist soil for water uptake and drought avoidance, termed root hydrotropism, remains largely mysterious. Here, we provide key insights into the mechanism of hydrotropic growth and assign a role to the master regulator of hydrotropism, MIZU-KUSSEI 1 (MIZ1). We show that efficient hydrotropism requires the attenuation of antagonistically acting gravitropism, which is inhibited under drought conditions. Drought stress interferes with subcellular trafficking and the lateral mobility of PIN auxin transporters, which are polarly localized at the root cell plasma membranes. This leads to defects in PIN2 polarity and gravity-induced polarization of PIN3, ultimately inhibiting gravity-induced auxin redistribution and root bending. The miz1 mutant is defective in all these regulations, and in support of MIZ1’s action on PINs, pin mutations rescue the hydrotropic defects in the miz1 mutant. These observations identify a mechanism for how drought via MIZ1 attenuates gravitropism to promote root hydrotropism for efficient water foraging under drought conditions.",

Segmental amplifications often encompass large genomic regions surrounding the gene(s) under selection for higher dosage. Overexpression of coamplified neighboring genes imposes a substantial metabolic burden. While compensatory mutations can decrease inappropriate overexpression of coamplified genes, it takes time for such mutations to arise. The extent to which intrinsic regulatory mechanisms modulate expression of coamplified genes in the immediate aftermath of segmental amplification is largely unknown. To address the collateral effects of segmental amplification, we evolved replicate cultures of an Escherichia coli mutant under conditions that select for higher dosage of an inefficient enzyme whose weak activity limits growth rate. Segmental amplifications encompassing the gene encoding the weak-link enzyme arose in all populations. Amplified regions ranged in size (33 to 125 kb) and copy number (2 to ≥14 copies). We performed RNA-seq and label-free proteomics to quantify expression of amplified genes present at 2, 6, and 14 copies. mRNA expression generally scales with gene copy number, but protein expression scales less well with both gene copy number and mRNA expression. We characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying discrepancies between gene copy number and expression for several cases. We also show that segmental amplifications can have system-wide consequences by indirectly altering expression of nonamplified genes. Our findings indicate that the fitness benefit derived from segmental amplification depends on the combined effects of amplicon size, gene content, and copy number as well as collateral effects on nonamplified genes.",

Herein, we combine cosmogenic nuclide dating of cave-bound river deposits, river profile analysis, and numerical modeling to provide the first direct age constraints and systematic analysis of incision processes at work in Hells Canyon. Our study reveals a significant drainage capture triggered rapid incision at ~2.1 ± 1.0 Ma, establishing the Snake River’s modern route into the Columbia River system. The increased drainage area and subsequent increase in stream power resulted in the rapid incision of Hells Canyon and the formation of tributary knickpoints (KPs) that decrease in elevation away from the capture location. Cosmogenic dating of cave deposits indicates incision rates increased from ~0.01 to ~0.16 mm y −1 . Numerical modeling of the stream capture supports these observations, demonstrating how abrupt drainage area increase drives rapid river incision.

A chromosomal translocation joins the low-complexity domain (LCD) of the RNA-binding protein EWS (EWS LCD ) with the DNA-binding domain of Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1 DBD ), creating EWS::FLI1, a potent fusion oncoprotein essential for EwS development and responsible for over 85% of EwS tumors. EWS::FLI1 forms biomolecular condensates in vivo and promotes tumorigenesis through mediation of aberrant transcriptional changes and by interfering with the normal functions of nucleic acid-binding proteins like EWS through a dominant-negative mechanism. In particular, the expression of EWS::FLI1 in EwS directly interferes with the biological functions of EWS leading to alternate splicing events and defects in DNA-damage repair pathways. Though the EWS LCD is capable of phase separation, here we report a direct interaction between FLI1 DBD and EWS LCD that enhances condensate formation and alters the physical properties of the condensate. This effect was conserved for three related E-twenty-six transformation-specific (ETS) DNA-binding domains (DBDs) while DNA binding blocked the interaction with EWS LCD and inhibited EWS::FLI1 condensate formation. NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis studies confirmed that ETS DBDs transiently interact with EWS LCD via the ETS DBDs “wings.” Together these results revealed that ETS DBDs, particularly FLI1 DBD , enhance EWS LCD condensate formation and rigidity, supporting a model in which electrostatic and structural interactions drive condensate dynamics with implications for EWS::FLI1-mediated transcriptional regulation in EwS.",

We refer to these systems as “anthropomorphic conversational agents” to aptly conceptualize the ability of LLM-based systems to mimic human communication so convincingly that they become increasingly indistinguishable from human interlocutors. This ability challenges the many efforts that caution against “anthropomorphizing” LLMs, attaching human-like qualities to nonhuman entities. When the systems themselves exhibit human-like qualities, calls to resist anthropomorphism will increasingly fall flat. While the AI industry directs much effort into improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs—with mixed results—the progress in communicative abilities remains underappreciated. In this perspective, we aim to raise awareness for both the benefits and dangers of anthropomorphic agents. We ask: should we lean into the human-like abilities, or should we aim to dehumanize LLM-based systems, given concerns over anthropomorphic seduction? When users cannot tell the difference between human interlocutors and AI systems, threats emerge of deception, manipulation, and disinformation at scale. We suggest that we must engage with anthropomorphic agents across design and development, deployment and use, and regulation and policy-making.

          "abstract": "Mutation rates vary across the tree of life by many orders of magnitude, with fewer mutations occurring each generation in species that reproduce quickly and maintain large effective population sizes. A compelling explanation is that large effective population sizes facilitate selection against weakly deleterious “mutator alleles” such as variants that modulate cell division or interfere with the molecular efficacy of DNA repair. However, while the fidelity of a single cell division largely determines microorganisms’ mutation rates, the relationship of the mutation rate to the molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair is more complex in multicellular species with long generation times. Since long generations leave more time for mutations to accrue each generation, we posit that a long generation time likely amplifies the fitness consequences of any damage agent or DNA repair defect that creates extra mutations in the spermatogonia or oocytes. This leads to the counterintuitive prediction that the species with the highest germline mutation rates per generation are also the species with most effective mechanisms for avoiding and repairing mutations in their reproductive cells. Consistent with this, we show that mutation rates in the reproductive cells are inversely correlated with generation time; in contrast, the number of germline mutations that occur during prepuberty development trends weakly upward as generation time increases. Our results parallel recent findings that the longest-lived species have the lowest mutation rates in adult somatic tissues, potentially due to selection to keep the lifetime mutation load below a harmful threshold.",

          "abstract": "Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive its faithful representation. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. When applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets arising from large-scale atmospheric fields, our approach proves its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with other local dynamical indices, and how it reveals the scale-dependent nature of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its link to information theory, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.",

          "abstract": "Physical exercise is known to reduce depression, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain unclear. Based on a chronic restraint stress model in mice, we showed that 4-wk treadmill exercise profoundly maintained normal neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), in association with the prevention of depressive-like behaviors. Microarray analysis conducted in the NAc revealed that the oxytocin (OT) receptor displayed the most significant differential expression, implying a crucial involvement of OT signaling in exercise-induced antidepressant effects. In vivo fiber photometry revealed disrupted OT release in the NAc and altered activity of OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and their projections to the NAc in stressed mice, which were restored by exercise. Moreover, we found that stress-induced depressive-like behaviors were prevented by activation of the PVN–NAc OT circuit. Additional inhibition of the PVN–NAc OT circuit blocked the antidepressant effects of exercise in stressed mice. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of the PVN–NAc OT circuit in regulating depressive-like behaviors, which is required for the antidepressant effects of exercise. This neural circuit mechanism provides an explanation for brain network adaptations upon exercise and also suggests a promising therapeutic target for depression.",

          "abstract": "Measures of general cognitive ability (GCA) are highly stable from adolescence onward, particularly at the level of genetic influences. In contrast, measurement of GCA in early life (before 3 y old) is less reliable and less is known about the stability of GCA across this period, including its relation to adult GCA. Using data from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin study (N = 1,098), we examined the stability of GCA measures across 5 time-points (years 1 to 2, 3, 7, 16, and 29), including how an array of cognitive measures given at 7 and 9 mo relate to later GCA. We then examined the genetic and environmental stability of GCA across the first 30 y of life using complementary methods: twin analyses and polygenic scores (PGSs). Two infant cognition measures, object novelty and tester-rated task orientation, predicted GCA in adulthood ( r = 0.16 and 0.18, respectively). Correlational analyses were consistent with a pattern of increasing stability across development for GCA measures between year 1 to 2 and adulthood ( r = 0.39 to 0.85). Subsequent twin analyses revealed that 22% of variance in adulthood GCA was captured by genetic influences on GCA from year 3 or earlier, with an additional 10% explained by shared environmental influences on GCA at year 1 to 2. PGSs for adulthood GCA and educational attainment predicted GCA from 1 to 2 y onward ( β s = 0.09 to 0.44) but not infant cognition. Findings suggest that genetic and environmental influences on GCA demonstrate considerable stability as early as age 3 y, but that measures of infant cognition are less predictive of later cognitive ability.",

          "abstract": "Failure to anticipate new forms of antibiotic resistance has led to resistance developing rapidly to virtually all antibiotics that have entered clinical use. Many of the most problematic types of resistance originated in the environment, where ancient arms races between antibiotic-producing microbes and their competitors have created vast arsenals of antibiotics and resistance. Seizing on the knowledge that resistance in nature is frequently a harbinger of future clinical resistance, we propose introducing an additional step into the antibiotic development process that exploits the susceptibility of development candidates to environmental resistance as a metric for prioritizing lead compounds and as a roadmap for their structural optimization. Using the antibiotic albicidin as a model, we show how the environmental resistome can guide the development of more resistance-tolerant leads. We used metagenomic surveys to identify resistance vulnerabilities for albicidin and guide the synthesis of analogs that evade the resistance threats. We found that natural albicidin analogs (congeners) were especially enriched in structural features that escape resistance, which inspired our syntheses and provided compelling evidence for the evolution of families of antibiotics in response to resistance in nature. The coupling of metagenomics-based resistance surveillance with structural optimizations of new antibiotics is a broadly applicable approach that is easily integrated into antibiotic development programs to generate compounds that are more resilient in the face of resistance.",

          "abstract": "Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by the opacification of the cornea owing to the abnormal deposition of cholesterol. SCD-associated mutations have been identified in the gene encoding UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1), which uses geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize the vitamin K 2 subtype menaquinone-4 (MK-4). Beyond its enzymatic role, UBIAD1 serves as a key regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids such as GGpp and MK-4. Sterol-induced binding to UBIAD1 inhibits the sterol-accelerated ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR to maintain the synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids under conditions of cholesterol repletion. GGpp dissociates the HMGCR–UBIAD1 complex, triggering maximal ERAD of HMGCR and ER-to-Golgi translocation of UBIAD1. However, SCD-associated UBIAD1 resists this GGpp-induced dissociation and remains sequestered in the ER. ER retention of UBIAD1 leads to inhibition of HMGCR ERAD, promoting increased synthesis and accumulation of cholesterol. Here, chemical genetic screening was utilized to identify molecules that restored Golgi localization of SCD-associated UBIAD1 (N102S) and thereby relieve inhibition of HMGCR ERAD. We found that the chemotherapeutic tyrosine kinase inhibitor Apatinib stimulated ER-to-Golgi transport of both N102S and wild type UBIAD1. This effect required GGpp but was independent of Apatinib’s tyrosine kinase inhibition. Apatinib-mediated Golgi transport of UBIAD1 enhanced the ERAD of HMGCR. Photoaffinity labeling studies indicated that Apatinib binds directly to UBIAD1, suggesting that the drug allosterically activates GGpp-induced transport of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi.",

          "abstract": "Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that plays a central role in sensing calcium and governing transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational signaling networks. Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans , the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, orthologs of components of the Ingression Progression Complex required for septation and budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations largely restore growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal that the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.",

          "abstract": "Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase ( MTAP ) gene deletions are frequent in human cancers. Loss of MTAP leads to significantly increased cellular levels of methylthioadenosine (MTA), a cellular metabolite and specific inhibitor of the cell-essential enzyme Protein Arginine Methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5). Using a cofactor-directed screening strategy and DNA-encoded libraries, we identify a class of PRMT5 inhibitors that cooperatively inhibit PRMT5 in the presence of MTA. An optimized inhibitor, AM-9934, selectively inhibits PRMT5 in MTAP -deleted cells and in transplanted tumors while sparing MTAP -expressing counterparts, leading to specific suppression of viability in MTAP -deleted cells. Structural studies show that AM-9934 occupies the arginine substrate pocket of MTA-bound PRMT5. This study introduces a broadly applicable method for directed DNA-encoded library screening toward a desired mechanistic outcome and highlights MTA-selective PRMT5 inhibition as an attractive therapeutic strategy with a potentially broad therapeutic index in patients with MTAP -deleted cancers.",

During development, olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons first contact their partner projection neuron dendrites on the spherical surface of the antennal lobe, regardless of whether the adult glomeruli lie near the surface or inside. Along this 2D surface, axons of each ORN type take a specific, arc-shaped trajectory that precisely intersects with their partner dendrites. Altering axon trajectories compromises synaptic partner matching. A 3D search is thus reduced to one dimension, simplifying partner matching.",

In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 human clinical trial, the recombinant, germline-targeting envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer BG505 SOSIP.v4.1-GT1.1, adjuvanted with AS01 B , induced bnAb precursors of the VRC01-class at a high frequency in the majority of vaccine recipients. These bnAb precursors, that target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design.",

Although the most promising realizations of quantum computers are based on various matter-qubit platforms, implementing blind quantum computing on matter qubits remains a challenge. Using silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in nanophotonic diamond cavities with an efficient optical interface, we demonstrated a universal quantum gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit blind gates over a distributed two-node network. Using these ingredients, we performed a distributed algorithm with blind operations across our two-node network, proving a route to develop blind quantum computation with matter qubits in distributed, modular architectures.",

          "abstract": "Climate change increasingly drives local population dynamics, shifts geographic distributions, and threatens persistence. Gene flow and rapid adaptation could rescue declining populations yet are seldom integrated into forecasts. We modeled eco-evolutionary dynamics under preindustrial, contemporary, and projected climates using up to 9 years of fitness data from 102,272 transplants (115 source populations) of Boechera stricta in five common gardens. Climate change endangers locally adapted populations and reduces genotypic variation in long-term population growth rate, suggesting limited adaptive potential. Upslope migration could stabilize high-elevation populations and preserve low-elevation ecotypes, but unassisted gene flow modeled with genomic data is too spatially restricted. Species distribution models failed to capture current dynamics and likely overestimate persistence under intermediate emissions scenarios, highlighting the importance of modeling evolutionary processes.",

Here we use a degenerate Fermi gas loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice to study the effect of a tunable Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The clock laser introduces a spin-orbit coupling spiral phase and breaks the isotropy of superexchange interactions, leading to XXZ-type spin anisotropy. By tuning the lattice confinement and applying imaging spectroscopy, we map out favorable atomic coherence regimes. We transition through various interaction regimes and observe coherent superexchange, tunable through on-site interaction and site-to-site energy shift, affecting the Ramsey fringe contrast over timescales &gt;1 second. This study lays the groundwork for using a three-dimensional optical lattice clock to probe quantum magnetism and spin entanglement.",

Its realization requires the on-demand generation and synchronization of single electrons. In this work, we demonstrate the coherent collision of single electrons, generated by voltage pulses, in a graphene Mach-Zehnder interferometer. By measuring shot noise resulting from the collisions, we unveil fundamental characteristics of colliding electrons, highlighting the complementarity between the indistinguishable and distinguishable parts of their wave functions. The former is manifested through fermionic Hong-Ou-Mandel destructive interference, whereas the latter is discerned through double-winding Aharonov-Bohm interference in the noise. The interference visibilities of around 60% enable comprehensive quantum state tomography. Our findings may place coherent operations involving flying qubits within reach in graphene.",

          "abstract": "Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration. Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action. Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6). The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months. The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects. These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.",

Although Gauss incompatibility has long been recognized as the source of morphing in naturally growing slender organs, here we show that the growth profile of rose petals remains Gauss compatible. Their distinctive shape emerges from a different type of geometric incompatibility, the Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson (MCP) incompatibility, which leads to the formation of localized cusps along the petal margins. We validated this mechanism in model disc petals theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. Our study reveals distinct morphological regimes, ranging from smooth edges to cusp-forming configurations, and demonstrates how stress focusing at cusps influences subsequent petal growth. These findings position MCP incompatibility as a generic mechanism for cusp formation in both natural and manmade self-morphing sheets.",

However, the extent to which TCs affect infant survival in LMICs is not well understood. We examined the impact of TC exposure on infant mortality by linking recently developed TC wind field data with 1,682,249 nationally representative infant survival records from 2002 to 2021 across seven LMICs. We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries. Further investigation is warranted to understand the mechanisms through which TCs affect infant mortality and why some countries’ children fare better after TC exposure than others.",

Poisson regression models adjusted for demographic and temporal factors showed higher incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for severe outcomes in the most deprived areas compared to the least. We note higher IRRs for severe outcomes for all non-white relative to white ethnicities. The magnitude of IRRs for both deprivation and ethnicities declined from the wild-type to the omicron periods for severe outcomes. For infections, we observed IRRs above one for non-white ethnicities during the wild-type and alpha periods. Vaccination significantly reduced risks across all groups. For severe outcomes, preexisting health inequalities led to large and persistent disparities. For infections, measures must be structured with ethnicity and deprivation in mind early in a pandemic.",

          "abstract": "Transport of elementary excitations is a fundamental property of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, essential for wide-ranging phenomena and device applications. Although exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1 to 2 micrometers, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons enables extended transport lengths and offers opportunities to use photonic mode engineering for tailored transport. Conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons, however, are challenging to tune and integrate into photonic circuits. We report the transport of transition metal dichalcogenide polaritons in 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode engineering, and integration. We achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in transport length compared to bare excitons and reveal transport dependence on polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which are controlled via photonic crystal design and pump intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These findings establish 2D photonic crystal polaritons as a versatile platform for advancing photonic energy transport technologies.",

We developed a biomimetic compound eye camera with an effective pixel number of 4.3 megapixels capable of producing full-color panoramic images with a viewing angle of 165° and resolving power of 40 micrometers. Using rich visual information, our system achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction, precise 3D position prediction, high-accuracy classification, and pattern recognition through a multistage neural network. Moreover, our compact biomimetic visual system can simultaneously track the 3D motion of multiple miniature targets independently.

In this study, we solved the PSI-LHCI structure of Galdieria sulphuraria NIES-3638 at 2.19-angstrom resolution using cryo–electron microscopy, revealing a PSI monomer core associated with seven LHCI subunits. Structural analysis uncovered the absence of phylloquinones, the common secondary electron acceptor in PSI of photosynthetic organisms, suggesting adaptation to a benzoquinone-like molecule. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that G. sulphuraria retains traits characteristic of an ancestral red alga, including distinctive LHCI binding and interaction patterns. Variations in LHCI composition and interactions across red algae, particularly in red-lineage chlorophyll a / b –binding–like protein and red algal LHCs, highlight evolutionary divergence and specialization. These findings not only deepen our understanding of red algal PSI-LHCI diversification but also enable us to predict features of an ancestral red algal PSI-LHCI supercomplex, providing a framework to explore evolutionary adaptations from an ancestral red alga.",

However, directly observing and controlling these rotational phenomena across these different scales remains a challenge. Here, we introduce an acoustofluidic spinning control method that dynamically guides particles into three-dimensional, periodic spatial patterns within a droplet. Using surface acoustic waves, we induce internal streaming that generates centrifugal forces counteracted by surface tension, leading to the formation of rotating Stokes waves along the droplet’s equator. We show that fluid motion inside the droplet couples with these rotating waves, giving rise to a controllable superimposed helical particle orbit. These findings provide a platform for controlled rotational flows with potential applications in droplet-based microfluidics, biochemical processing, and tunable particle transport in lab-on-a-chip systems.",

Engineered living cells can redirect drug delivery systems to effectively reach targeted sites. Here, we used living macrophages as vehicles, attaching them with GeS nanosheets (GeSNSs) carrying β-elemene for transport to tumor sites. GeSNSs act as efficient sonosensitizers, enhancing ultrasound-induced reactive oxygen species generation for treating 4T1 breast tumors. Notably, macrophage hitchhiking delivery of β-elemene–loaded GeSNSs not only achieves high accumulation in tumor regions and suppresses tumor growth under ultrasound treatment, but also effectively remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by improving M1-like macrophage polarization and enhancing the populations of mature dendritic cells, CD4 + , and CD8 + lymphocytes, thereby facilitating enhanced sonodynamic chemoimmunotherapy. These findings underscore the potential of macrophage hitchhiking strategy for drug delivery and suggest broader applicability of engineered living materials–mediated delivery technologies in disease therapy.",

Enhancing single-photon emission by engineering their photonic environment is essential for improving overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often limited by the need for ultraprecise emitter placement within conventional photonic cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moiré pattern, we propose a multilayer moiré photonic crystal with a robust isolated flatband. Theoretical analysis reveals that, with nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moiré cavity simultaneously has a high Purcell factor and large tolerance over the emitter’s position, breaking the constraints of conventional cavities. We then experimentally demonstrate various cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena with a quantum dot in moiré cavity. A large tuning range (up to 40-fold) of quantum dot’s radiative lifetime is achieved through strong Purcell enhancement and inhibition effects. Our findings open the door for moiré flatband cavity–enhanced quantum light sources and quantum nodes for the quantum internet.",

          "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that the hippocampus is essential for exploiting predictive relationships during perception. However, it remains unclear whether the hippocampus drives the communication of predictions to sensory cortex or receives prediction signals from elsewhere. We collected 7-tesla fMRI data in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) while auditory cues predicted abstract shapes. Strikingly, neural patterns evoked by predicted shapes in CA2/3, pre/parasubiculum, and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were negatively correlated to patterns evoked by the same shapes when actually presented. Using layer-specific analyses, we ask: In which direction are predictions communicated between the hippocampus and neocortex? Superficial layers of the MTL cortex project to the hippocampus, while the deep layers receive feedback projections. Informational connectivity analyses revealed that communication between CA2/3 and PHC was specific to the deep layers of PHC. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates predictions through pattern completion in CA2/3 and feeds these predictions back to the neocortex.",

Here, we use WO 3 as a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–compatible switching oxide and demonstrate a proof-of-concept materials design approach to enhance endurance and device-to-device uniformity in WO 3 -based memristive devices while preserving other performance metrics. These devices show stable resistive switching behavior with &gt;10 6  cycles, &gt;10 5 -second retention, &gt;10 on/off ratio, and good device-to-device uniformity, without using current compliance. All these metrics are achieved using a one-step pulsed laser deposition process to create self-assembled nanocomposite thin films that have regular guided filaments of ≈100-nanometer pitch, preformed between WO 3 grains and interspersed smaller Ce 2 O 3 grains.",

          "abstract": "Viral muscle soreness (VMS) is a common feature during acute viral infections, including those caused by enteroviruses, and it substantially diminishes patients’ quality of life. At present, we aim to establish the “brain-muscle” axis to explore the underlying mechanisms of VMS. We initially observed that diminished pain threshold occurred in enterovirus A71 (EV-A71)–infected C57BL/6J and AG6 mice. Subsequently, RNA sequencing data showed that lipocalin 2 (LCN2) was up-regulated during multiple viral infections, including EV-A71, Japanese encephalitis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and West Nile virus, which all caused VMS. As expected, Lcn2 -deficient C57BL/6 J ( Lcn2 −/− ) mice exhibited greater pain tolerance, as shown by stronger grip force and stable motor function after EV-A71 infection. Mechanistically, EV-A71–induced high-mobility group 1 (HMGB1) stimulated astrocyte-derived LCN2 secreted into the circulatory system, which enhanced glycolysis and induced lactate buildup in muscle through increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) expression and decreasing pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Together, HMGB1/LCN2/PDK1/lactate pathway in the brain-muscle axis promoted VMS development.",

While hydrophilic pores enable liquid formation from undersaturated vapor without energy input, the condensate typically remains confined, limiting practical utility. Here, we explore the use of amphiphilic nanoporous polymer-infiltrated nanoparticle films that condense and release liquid water under isothermal and undersaturated conditions. By tuning the polymer fraction and nanoparticle size, we optimize condensation and droplet formation. As vapor pressure increases, voids fill with condensate, which subsequently exudes onto the surface as microscopic droplets. This behavior, enabled by a balance of polymer hydrophobicity and capillarity, reveals how amphiphilic nanostructures can drive accessible water collection. Our findings provide design insights for materials supporting energy-efficient water harvesting and heat management without external input.",

GLF-MINFLUX allowed live-cell single-protein tracking with 7.8-nanometer precision at ~200-microsecond temporal resolution, revealing distinct diffusion behaviors and rates between the basal membrane and filopodia.

To elucidate the drivers of mantle redox variation, we performed mixed reaction experiments between carbonatite melt and Fe 0 -bearing peridotite at 9 to 21 gigapascals under varying redox conditions. Comparing our results with sublithospheric diamond inclusions, we find that majorite and ferropericlase inclusions from the Amazonia Craton reflect a predominantly reduced, nonplume mantle environment, while majorites from the Kaapvaal Craton indicate a fully oxidized plume setting. In nonplume environments, carbonatite melts are progressively consumed until fully frozen as reduced carbon. Attachment of these materials to the cratonic keel further enhances craton stability. In plume environments, carbonatite melts surpass the redox buffering capacity of Fe 0 , leading to an oxidized, CO 2 -rich melt-bearing mantle. Impregnation of these melts into the lithosphere weakens the cratonic keel, resulting in lithosphere delamination, surface uplift, and widespread volcanism.",

We observed four to five orders of magnitude variation in import system abundances, with copy numbers tuned to nutrient hierarchies essential for growth. Abundances of substrate-binding proteins are unrelated to their substrate binding affinities but are tightly yet inversely correlated with their interaction affinity with permeases.

Variant polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are “writers” of ubiquitylation on histone H2A K118 and K119, crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by variant PRC1 complexes couples to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until it reaches a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2, and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.",

The results revealed that sheep are susceptible to JEV infection and develop viremia, with levels and duration comparable to those observed in pigs, a known JEV-amplifying host. Mosquitoes fed viremic sheep blood showed an infection rate of 40.6 to 57.1%. These findings indicate that sheep can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV, potentially contributing to JEV transmission and increasing the public health risk of human infections.

The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation, and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were made homozygous, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild type and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set, indicating that the synthetic centromere was fully functional. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22.",

S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2 hi TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (T regs ) to T H 17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.",

Here, we performed a comprehensive laboratory study of rhenium redox transitions on variably oxidized magnetite nanoparticle surfaces. Through high-end spectroscopic and microscopic tools, we propose an abiotic transition pathway in which aqueous iron(II) ions in the presence of pure or preoxidized magnetite serve as an electron source to reduce rhenium(VII) to individual rhenium(IV) atoms or small polynuclear species on nanoparticle surfaces. Notably, iron(II) ions recharged preoxidized magnetite nanoparticles exhibit a maghemite core and a magnetite shell, challenging the traditional core-shell magnetite-maghemite model.

We measured the length of 134 wild clown anemonefish every month and monitored temperature at the scale of their anemone for five lunar months. Our results show that clown anemonefish shrink in response to heat stress and individuals that shrink also display relatively more catch-up growth. Further, shrinking is modulated by social rank and size, and individuals that shrink more often and in a coordinated fashion with their breeding partner have higher survival during the heat stress event. In conclusion, a plastic individual growth response to heat stress, constrained by the social environment, can lead to short-term survival benefits.

We support this view by considering the skill of predicted 20- and 50-year lead temperature changes under the Shared Economic Pathway (SSP)1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 emission scenarios in climates of different sensitivities. Using climate model simulations, we show that adjusting raw multimodel projections of future warming with the Kriging for Climate Change (KCC) method eliminates most biases and reduces the uncertainty of warming projections irrespective of the sensitivity of the climate being considered. Simpler methods, or using only the more recent part of the temperature record, provide less effective constraints.

We revealed that moderate naphthalene acetic acid treatment activates rice resistance to BPH, BPH infestation induces ROS accumulation, and increase in ROS content promotes BPH resistance. Underlying these phenomena, the auxin receptors OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 positively, whereas the posttranscriptional regulator OsmiR393 negatively, regulate BPH resistance.

Upon replication fork stalling, Brl2 undergoes phosphorylation at five serine residues by Cds1 Chk2 kinase, resulting in the loss of its ligase activity and a marked reduction in H2BK119ub1 levels. In the brl2-5D (the five serine residues are replaced with aspartic acid) and htb-K119R mutants, chromatin becomes highly compacted. Furthermore, the rates of stalled replication fork collapse, and dsDNA breaks are significantly reduced in brl2-5D cds1 Chk2 ∆ cells compared to cds1 Chk2 ∆ cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that nucleosomes are targeted by the intra-S phase checkpoint and highlights the checkpoint’s critical role in configuring compact chromatin structures at replication fork stalling sites.

Several neuron types in visual cortex neurons were identified with various responses to images and their omissions. A minority of cells in nonvisual areas, including the hippocampus, increased their firing rates at the omitted stimulus onset even when these neurons did not respond to the images. Our study elucidates the origin of omission responses in the visual cortex and sheds light on the role of hippocampal and subcortical circuits in omission detection.",

          "abstract": "The small interfering RNA pathway is the primary antiviral defense mechanism in invertebrates and plants. This systemic mechanism relies on the recognition, transport, and internalization of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our aim was to identify cell surface proteins that bind extracellular dsRNA and mediate its internalization in Drosophila cells. We used coimmunoprecipitation coupled with proteomics analysis and found that silencing heat shock cognate protein 70-4 (Hsc70-4), a constitutively expressed heat shock protein, impairs dsRNA internalization. Unexpectedly, despite lacking a predicted transmembrane domain, Hsc70-4 localizes to the cell membrane via lipid interactions. Antibody blocking experiments revealed an extracellular domain on Hsc70-4 that is essential for dsRNA internalization. Intriguingly, this dsRNA-specific binding capacity of Hsc70-4 functions independently of its chaperone activity. These findings not only highlight Hsc70-4 as a previously uncharacterized and essential component in the dsRNA internalization process but also offer promising insights for advancing RNA interference–based technologies to combat pests and vector-borne diseases.",

Using aerosol mass spectrometry over multiple years in LA illustrates the controlling dynamics of AN and their evolution over the past decades. These data suggest that much of the nitric acid (HNO 3 ) production required to produce AN in LA occurs during the nighttime via heterogeneous hydrolysis of N 2 O 5 . Further, we show that US Environmental Protection Agency–codified techniques for measuring total PM 2.5 fail to quantify the AN component, while low-cost optical sensors demonstrate good agreement. While previous studies suggest that declining NO x has reduced AN, we show that HNO 3 formation is still substantial and leads to the formation of many tens of micrograms per cubic meter of AN aerosol. Continued focus on reductions in NO x will help meet the PM 2.5 standards in the LA basin and many other regions.",

Here, we reveal a previously unidentified mechanism by which CD40L-expressing CD8 + T cells induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In murine models, up to 50% of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells expressed CD40L, and conditional CD40L ablation in CD8 + T cells alone led to tumor formation. Mechanistically, CD40L + CD8 + T cells can induce cell death in CD40-expressing cancer cells by triggering caspase-8 activation. We demonstrate that a gene signature for resistance to CD40 signaling–induced cell death strongly correlates with worse survival in different human cancer cohorts. Our results introduce CD40L as a rather counterintuitive, noncanonical cytotoxic factor that complements the capabilities of CD8 + T cells to combat cancers and has the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.",

This multidecadal sea level variability, largely arising from fluctuations in the buoyancy-driven Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), substantially modulates the frequency of flood occurrences along the USNEC and serves as a source of multiyear predictability. Using an initialized dynamical downscaling decadal prediction system with a 1 / 12 ° ocean resolution, we demonstrate that flood frequency along the USNEC can be predicted on multiyear to decadal timescales. The long-term increasing trend in flood frequency, mainly driven by increasing greenhouse gases and associated radiative forcing changes, can be predicted a decade ahead. Furthermore, detrended flood frequency along the USNEC exhibits prediction skill for up to 3 years, as verified by TG observation. This multiyear prediction skill is achieved using prediction models that are initialized from our best estimate of observed AMOC.",

Furthermore, by genetic or pharmacologic disruption, we identified a chemotactic effect of the astrocyte-derived chemokine CCL5 on mediating the infiltration of CCR5 + neutrophils and behavioral disorders in male depressed mice.

Transient photoreduction of the cryptochrome flavin chromophore initiated signaling via a poorly understood mechanism.

Using 19 time-resolved SFX snapshots between 10 nanoseconds and 233 milliseconds, we found that light-driven FAD •– /tyrosyl-373 radical pair (RP) formation primes α22 unfolding. Electron transfer–dependent protonation of aspartate-321 by tyrosine-373 is the epicenter of unfolding by disrupting salt bridges between α22 and the photolyase homology region. Before helix unfolding, another pathway opens transiently for FAD •– protonation and RP stabilization. This link between RP formation and conformational changes provides a structural basis for signaling by animal-like cryptochromes.",

Variations in the location of internal tide dissipation can modify the climatic state of oceanic circulation. Mesoscale eddies and internal tides are two prominent peaks in the ocean energy spectrum, which overlap in spatial scale despite contrasting temporal scales. How eddies affect the dissipation of internal tides remains unclear. Using high-resolution simulations and Argo observations, we show that strong oceanic eddies, such as Agulhas rings, can dissipate internal tides in regions where they intersect, making these eddies hotspots for internal tide dissipation. The Agulhas rings facilitate the transfer of internal tide energy from stable low wave numbers to less stable high wave numbers and subsequently trap these high wave numbers, thereby enhancing their dissipation. Observations from Argo floats reveal elevated dissipation in regions where Agulhas rings and internal tides converge, corroborating the simulations.",

However, nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions have been only partially elaborated, leaving key gaps in the prospects for potential ultrahigh-bandwidth magnonic signal processing.

          "abstract": "The Southern Ocean is an important CO 2 sink, mitigating climate change, but its future evolution is uncertain due to the confounding effects of stratospheric ozone recovery and climate change on ocean circulation. Using an Earth System Model, we quantify the relative influence of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gas emissions on this sink from 1950 to 2100. Ozone effects dominated changes in ocean circulation during 1950–2000, but not this century, implying that past trends cannot serve as proxies for future changes. Despite substantial future circulation changes induced by climate change, their effect on the CO 2 sink decreases over the 21st century because of compensating factors. Thus, the Southern Ocean is unlikely to be a major future source of amplifying carbon-climate feedbacks this century.",

Some of the reasons include overreliance on transcriptomic profiling and use of nonprimary cell systems. Here we report a network-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomic profiles able to identify master regulator (MR) proteins controlling SARS-CoV-2–mediated reprogramming in pathophysiologically relevant human ciliated, secretory, and basal cells. This underscored chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathways, as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR assays as components of the viral-host response in these cells. Large-scale drug perturbation screens revealed 11 candidate drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells represents an innovative approach to investigate pathogen-host interactions in multiple airway conditions for drug prioritization.",

By extending the EOn side-chain length, several experimental evaluations confirmed a decrease of the order-disorder transition temperature, while coarse-grained simulations revealed a structural evolution from a smectic phase to a columnar phase. Ionic conductivity of these molecules was achieved by adding Li salt, leading to a maximum conductivity of 1.1 × 10 −3  siemens per centimeter observed at 120°C. All-atom simulations were performed to examine the Li-ion solvation environment and to evaluate the intrachain and interchain Li-ion hopping mechanisms.

Benefiting from hierarchical reversible noncovalent interactions, the COMBIA hydrogel exhibits an optimal combination of mechanical and functional properties, particularly its integrated mechanical properties, including unprecedented stretchability, fracture toughness, and resilience. Furthermore, these hydrogels demonstrate superior conductivity, optical transparency, freezing tolerance, adhesion capability, and spontaneous mechanical and electrical self-healing. These unified functions render our hydrogel exceptional properties such as shape adaptability, skin-like perception, and energy harvesting capabilities.

In a macroevolutionary model system, we find that, despite losing ~60% of genera and ~20% of family-level diversity, marine bivalves lost only ~5% of their functional diversity, inconsistent with random extinction. Even with evolutionary opportunities presented by a disrupted ecosystem, low-diversity groups prior to the extinction or those originating in the Cenozoic rarely reach higher ranks today, implying long-term diversity ceilings to certain ecological roles. Clades that survived the extinction tend to dominate functions today, 66 million years post-extinction, but both relative richness and phylogenetic structure of those functional groups have been significantly shuffled. Thus, neither the composition of the pre-extinction biota nor the set of taxa that survived the extinction fully accounts for the functional and phylogenetic structure of today’s biota. The extinction disrupted Mesozoic biodiversity but did not fully determine the present-day configuration.",

We studied the effects of both Ppp1r3b overexpression and deletion in mice and cell models and found that both changes in Ppp1r3b expression result in dysregulated metabolism and liver damage, with overexpression increasing liver glycogen stores, while deletion resulted in higher liver lipid accumulation. These patterns were confirmed in humans where variants increasing PPP1R3B expression had lower liver fat and decreased plasma lipids, whereas putative loss-of-function variants were associated with increased liver fat and elevated plasma lipids. These findings support that PPP1R3B is a crucial regulator of hepatic metabolism beyond glycogen synthesis and that genetic variants affecting PPP1R3B expression levels influence if hepatic energy is stored as glycogen or triglycerides.",

Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely because of the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. Recently, group IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 μm, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 μm from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in single-mode lasing with an ultralow threshold of ~5.3 kilowatts per square centimeter. Our finding paves the way for all–group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum applications.",

Half of the operons in Escherichia coli have been reported to also contain internal promoters. We studied their role during genome-wide stresses targeting key transcription regulators, RNA polymerase (RNAP) and gyrase. Our results suggest that operons’ responses are influenced by stress-related changes in premature elongation terminations and internal promoters’ activity. Globally, this causes the responses of genes in the same operon to differ with the distance between them in a wave-like pattern. Meanwhile, premature terminations are affected by positive supercoiling buildup, collisions between elongating and promoter-bound RNAPs, and local regulatory elements. We report similar findings in E. coli under other stresses and in evolutionarily distant bacteria Bacillus subtilis , Corynebacterium glutamicum , and Helicobacter pylori . Our results suggest that the strength, number, and positioning of operons’ internal promoters might have evolved to compensate for premature terminations, providing distal genes similar response strengths.",

We use a systematic chimera approach to define the differential functionality of two closely related Medicago truncatula SCAR proteins in plant development. We show that SCAR/WAVE contribution to M. truncatula root hair or Arabidopsis thaliana trichome formation is dependent on two central intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Differential functionalities of M. truncatula SCAR proteins were furthermore associated with the presence/absence of a 42–amino acid sequence within the IDR that affected protein stability. Through uncovering a molecular basis for functional differences, we advance our understanding of plant SCAR/WAVE complexes.",

First-principles calculations reveal that the introduction of Sb not only triggers a topological phase transition but also changes the integral of the Berry curvature at the shifted Fermi level, which leads to the reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance polarity for Sb fractions x &gt; 0.67. Moreover, it also induces the opposite spin splitting of the valence bands compared to the Sb-free host, and the resulting clockwise/counterclockwise spin chirality gives rise to a tunable unidirectional second-harmonic anomalous Hall response.

These printable CPL materials, consisting of heavy metal-free CDs as emitters, and liquid crystals as host matrices, are produced using a helical coassembly strategy. Our CPL systems based on CDs achieve high PLQY (more than 80%) and g lum values (more than 1.4), with a figure of merit (a key performance indicator for CPL properties calculated by multiplying PLQY and glum) of 1.12, outperforming other CPL material systems.

PAX7 binds to UHRF1 and prevents its interaction with DNMT1, thus blocking activation of its enzyme activity. The ten-eleven translocation DNA dioxygenase (TET) DNA demethylases also contribute to the replication-dependent loss of DNA methylation. Thus, PAX7 hijacks UHRF1 to block activation of DNMT1 after replication, leading to loss of DNA methylation by dilution, and the process is assisted by the action of TET demethylases.",

Here, we address these challenges by engineering a “bridge” design into the Css DNA regulator. These bridges function as sequence-programmable switches to control gene expression, responding to endogenous molecular signals (such as ATP, APE1, and RNase H) and enabling trans-regulation within or between Css DNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of Css DNA regulator to construct the three-input three-output genetic circuits.

This method provides a convenient and effective strategy for late-stage peptide functionalization. The N═S bonds of the conjugates are reduced in the presence of glutathione, resulting the traceless releasing of corresponding peptides and amides. Practical applications are then demonstrated using precise reversible modifications of bioactive peptides, the stapling and linearization of peptides, peptide-drug conjugates, and split-and-pool synthesis.

Through ethnographic observations at three fertility clinics in the USA, I investigate how fertility providers spoke about the price of care with patients given the threat to professional authority and patient trust from appearing financially motivated. Rather than one moral value, I find variation in the field that cannot be explained by attending to either class or organizational structure alone, but instead depends on how the two combine to shape perceptions of providers’ pecuniary interests.
