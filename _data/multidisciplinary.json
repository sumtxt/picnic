          "abstract": "It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimensions 1–5 . In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside two dimensions, has been considered 6 but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons 7–9 . Here we show that non-trivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particle obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles that naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions, in which free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems and—more speculatively—the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle.",

          "abstract": "Tabular data, spreadsheets organized in rows and columns, are ubiquitous across scientific fields, from biomedicine to particle physics to economics and climate science 1,2 . The fundamental prediction task of filling in missing values of a label column based on the rest of the columns is essential for various applications as diverse as biomedical risk models, drug discovery and materials science. Although deep learning has revolutionized learning from raw data and led to numerous high-profile success stories 3–5 , gradient-boosted decision trees 6–9 have dominated tabular data for the past 20 years. Here we present the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time. In 2.8 s, TabPFN outperforms an ensemble of the strongest baselines tuned for 4 h in a classification setting. As a generative transformer-based foundation model, this model also allows fine-tuning, data generation, density estimation and learning reusable embeddings. TabPFN is a learning algorithm that is itself learned across millions of synthetic datasets, demonstrating the power of this approach for algorithm development. By improving modelling abilities across diverse fields, TabPFN has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and enhance important decision-making in various domains.",

          "abstract": "Histone H3 monoaminylations at Gln5 represent an important family of epigenetic marks in brain that have critical roles in permissive gene expression 1–3 . We previously demonstrated that serotonylation 4–10 and dopaminylation 9,11–13 of Gln5 of histone H3 (H3Q5ser and H3Q5dop, respectively) are catalysed by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and alter both local and global chromatin states. Here we found that TG2 additionally functions as an eraser and exchanger of H3 monoaminylations, including H3Q5 histaminylation (H3Q5his), which displays diurnally rhythmic expression in brain and contributes to circadian gene expression and behaviour. We found that H3Q5his, in contrast to H3Q5ser, inhibits the binding of WDR5, a core member of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, thereby antagonizing methyltransferase activities on H3K4. Taken together, these data elucidate a mechanism through which a single chromatin regulatory enzyme has the ability to sense chemical microenvironments to affect the epigenetic states of cells, the dynamics of which have critical roles in the regulation of neural rhythmicity.",

          "authors": "Peter M. Visscher, Christopher Gyngell, Loic Yengo, Julian Savulescu",
          "abstract": "Polygenic genome editing in human embryos and germ cells is predicted to become feasible in the next three decades. Several recent books and academic papers have outlined the ethical concerns raised by germline genome editing and the opportunities that it may present 1–3 . To date, no attempts have been made to predict the consequences of altering specific variants associated with polygenic diseases. In this Analysis, we show that polygenic genome editing could theoretically yield extreme reductions in disease susceptibility. For example, editing a relatively small number of genomic variants could make a substantial difference to an individual’s risk of developing coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and schizophrenia. Similarly, large changes in risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, could, in theory, be achieved by polygenic editing. Although heritable polygenic editing (HPE) is still speculative, we completed calculations to discuss the underlying ethical issues. Our modelling demonstrates how the putatively positive consequences of gene editing at an individual level may deepen health inequalities. Further, as single or multiple gene variants can increase the risk of some diseases while decreasing that of others, HPE raises ethical challenges related to pleiotropy and genetic diversity. We conclude by arguing for a collectivist perspective on the ethical issues raised by HPE, which accounts for its effects on individuals, their families, communities and society 4 .",

          "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are highly biodiverse 1 and important for livelihoods and economic development 2 , but are under substantial stress 3 . To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods 4,5 are used to guide environmental policy 6 and conservation prioritization 7 , whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors 8–13 . However, there is evidence 14–17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals 18,19 . Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales.",

          "abstract": "Missense variants that change the amino acid sequences of proteins cause one-third of human genetic diseases 1 . Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, and the vast majority of these have unknown functional consequences. Here we present a large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the effect of more than 500,000 variants on the abundance of more than 500 human protein domains. This dataset reveals that 60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We combine stability measurements with protein language models to annotate functional sites across proteins. Mutational effects on stability are largely conserved in homologous domains, enabling accurate stability prediction across entire protein families using energy models. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and training and benchmarking of computational methods.",

          "abstract": "Plants lack specialized and mobile immune cells. Consequently, any cell type that encounters pathogens must mount immune responses and communicate with surrounding cells for successful defence. However, the diversity, spatial organization and function of cellular immune states in pathogen-infected plants are poorly understood 1 . Here we infect Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with bacterial pathogens that trigger or supress immune responses and integrate time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data to identify cell states. We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis -regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants.",

          "abstract": "Mollusca is the second most species-rich animal phylum, but the pathways of early molluscan evolution have long been controversial 1–5 . Modern faunas retain only a fraction of the past forms in this hyperdiverse and long-lived group. Recent analyses 6–8 have consistently recovered a fundamental split into two sister clades, Conchifera (including gastropods, bivalves and cephalopods) and Aculifera 9 , comprising Polyplacophora (‘chitons’) and Aplacophora. Molluscan evolution in toto is characterized by plasticity in body-plan characters 10 , but historically aculiferans have been interpreted as more conservative 10,11 . The few completely preserved aculiferan or aculiferan-like fossils from the early Palaeozoic 12–19 have been largely regarded as transitional forms that inform questions of character polarity between the extant polyplacophoran and aplacophoran body forms 20,21 . The history of early aculiferans, and the morphological and ecological range that they occupied, remain inadequately sampled. Here we describe two new three-dimensionally preserved aculiferan species from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte 22,23 , which substantially extend the morphological and ecological range of the clade. Phylogenetic analyses indicate positions within a complex nexus of taxa and suggest reversals in the states of fundamental characters such as the presence of valves and the nature of the foot. In contrast to previous hypotheses of morphological conservatism, evolution in early aculiferans generated a profusion of unusual forms comparable to the diversification of other crown-group molluscs.",

          "abstract": "The biology underlying the connection between social relationships and health is largely unknown. Here, leveraging data from 42,062 participants across 2,920 plasma proteins in the UK Biobank, we characterized the proteomic signatures of social isolation and loneliness through proteome-wide association study and protein co-expression network analysis. Proteins linked to these constructs were implicated in inflammation, antiviral responses and complement systems. More than half of these proteins were prospectively linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and mortality during a 14 year follow-up. Moreover, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis suggested causal relationships from loneliness to five proteins, with two proteins (ADM and ASGR1) further supported by colocalization. These MR-identified proteins (GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1) exhibited broad associations with other blood biomarkers, as well as volumes in brain regions involved in interoception and emotional and social processes. Finally, the MR-identified proteins partly mediated the relationship between loneliness and cardiovascular diseases, stroke and mortality. The exploration of the peripheral physiology through which social relationships influence morbidity and mortality is timely and has potential implications for public health.",

          "abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) is a critical factor in determining health outcomes and is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, our understanding of the genetic structure of SES remains incomplete. Here, we conducted a large-scale exome study of SES markers (household income, occupational status, educational attainment, and social deprivation) in 350,770 individuals. For rare coding variants, we identified 56 significant associations by gene-based collapsing tests, unveiling 7 additional SES-associated genes ( NRN1 , CCDC36 , RHOB , EP400 , NCAM1, TPTEP2-CSNK1E , and LINC02881 ). Exome-wide single common variant analysis revealed nine lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with household income and 34 lead SNPs associated with EduYears, replicating previous GWAS findings. The gene–environment correlations had a substantial impact on the genetic associations with SES, as indicated by the significantly increased P values in several associations after controlling for geographic regions. Furthermore, we observed the pleiotropic effects of SES-associated genetic factors on a wide range of health outcomes, such as cognitive function, psychosocial status, and diabetes. This study highlights the contribution of coding variants to SES and their associations with health phenotypes.",

          "authors": "Adam B. Pollack, Sara Santamaria-Aguilar, Pravin Maduwantha, Casey Helgeson, Thomas Wahl, Klaus Keller",
          "abstract": "Many climate policies adopt improving equity as a key objective. A key challenge is that policies often conceive of equity in terms of individuals but introduce strategies that focus on spatially coarse administrative areas. For example, the Justice40 Initiative in the United States requires 518 diverse federal programs to prioritize funds for “disadvantaged” census tracts. This strategy is largely untested and contrasts with the federal government’s definition of equity as the “consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals (Executive Office of the President, Federal Register, 2021).” How well does the Justice40 approach improve equity in climate adaptation outcomes across individuals ? We analyze this question using a case study of a municipality that faces repetitive flooding and struggles to effectively manage these risks due to limited resources and public investment. We find that the way the Federal Emergency Management Agency implements the Justice40 Initiative can be an obstacle to promoting equity in household flood-risk outcomes. For example, in this case study, ensuring the majority of benefits accrue in “Justice40 Communities” does not reduce risk for the most burdened households, does not reduce risk-burden inequality, and produces net costs. In contrast, we design simple funding rules based on household risk burden that cost-effectively target the most burdened households, reduce risk-burden inequality, and accrue large net benefits. Our findings suggest that “disadvantaged community” indicators defined at coarse spatial scales face the risk of poorly capturing many climate risks and can be ineffective for meeting equity promises about climate-related investments.",

          "abstract": "The unsustainable use of wildlife is a primary driver of global biodiversity loss. No comprehensive global dataset exists on what species are in trade, their geographic origins, and trade’s ultimate impacts, which limits our ability to sustainably manage trade. The United States is one of the world’s largest importers of wildlife, with trade data compiled in the US Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). The LEMIS provides the most comprehensive publicly accessible wildlife trade database of non-the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) listed species. In total, 21,097 species and over 2.85 billion individuals were traded over the past 22 y (2000-2022). When LEMIS data are combined with CITES records, the United States imported over 29,445 wild species, including over 50% of all globally described species in some taxonomic groups. For most taxa, around half of the individuals are declared as sourced from the wild. Although the LEMIS provides the only means to assess trade volumes for many taxa, without any associated data on most wild populations, it is impossible to assess the impact on biodiversity, sustainability of trade, or any potential risk of pest or pathogen spread. These insights underscore the considerable underestimation of trade and the urgent need for other countries to adopt similar mechanisms to accurately record trade.",

There are, however, many questions still outstanding which cannot currently be answered—including the issue of whether there is, or was, life on Mars. The return of a cache of samples—including of the atmosphere—from separate locations in Jezero Crater and with differing petrogeneses will provide the international community with the opportunity to explore part of the evolutionary history of Mars in great detail. Specifically, measurements of the isotopic compositions of the light elements H, C, N, O, Cl, and S can be used to follow how volatile species cycle through the different martian volatile reservoirs (atmosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere). Measurement of isotopic fractionation enables inference of the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, water/rock ratio) under which fractionation occurred. Knowing the contextual relationship of the materials to their geological settings, coupled with precise compositional measurements will enable a more thorough understanding of martian volatile history and allow a picture to be constructed of water and climate on Mars as represented at Jezero Crater.",

          "abstract": "The TRAMP complex contains two enzymatic activities essential for RNA processing upstream of the nuclear exosome. Within TRAMP, RNA is 3′ polyadenylated by a subcomplex of Trf4/5 and Air1/2 and unwound 3′ to 5′ by Mtr4, a DExH helicase. The molecular mechanisms of TRAMP assembly and RNA shuffling between the two TRAMP catalytic sites are poorly understood. Here, we report solution hydrogen–deuterium exchange data with thermodynamic and functional assays to uncover these mechanisms for yeast TRAMP with Trf4 and Air2 homologs. We show that TRAMP assembly constrains RNA-recognition motifs that are peripheral to catalytic sites. These include the Mtr4 Arch and Air2 zinc knuckles 1, 2, and 3. While the Air2 Arch-interacting motif likely constrains the Mtr4 Arch via transient interactions, these do not fully account for the importance of the Mtr4 Arch in TRAMP assembly. We further show that tRNA binding by single active-site subunits, Mtr4 and Trf4-Air2, differs from the double active-site TRAMP. TRAMP has reduced tRNA binding on the Mtr4 Fist and RecA2 domains, offset by increased tRNA binding on Air2 zinc knuckles 2 and 3. Competition between these RNA-binding sites may drive tRNA transfer between TRAMP subunits. We identify dynamic changes upon TRAMP assembly and RNA-recognition motifs that transfer RNA between TRAMP catalytic sites.",

Yet, the perceptual role of this temporal fine structure (TFS) code is debated. This fundamental gap is attributable to our inability to experimentally manipulate TFS cues without altering other perceptually relevant cues. Here, we circumnavigated this limitation by leveraging individual differences across 200 participants to systematically compare variations in TFS sensitivity to performance in a range of speech perception tasks. TFS sensitivity was assessed through detection of interaural time/phase differences, while speech perception was evaluated by word identification under noise interference. Results suggest that greater TFS sensitivity is not associated with greater masking release from fundamental-frequency or spatial cues but appears to contribute to resilience against the effects of reverberation. We also found that greater TFS sensitivity is associated with faster response times, indicating reduced listening effort. These findings highlight the perceptual significance of TFS coding for everyday hearing.",

          "abstract": "Despite the broad catalytic relevance of metal–support interfaces, controlling their chemical nature, the interfacial contact perimeter (exposed to reactants), and consequently, their contributions to overall catalytic reactivity, remains challenging, as the nanoparticle and support characteristics are interdependent when catalysts are prepared by impregnation. Here, we decoupled both characteristics by using a raspberry-colloid-templating strategy that yields partially embedded PdAu nanoparticles within well-defined SiO 2 or TiO 2 supports, thereby increasing the metal–support interfacial contact compared to nonembedded catalysts that we prepared by attaching the same nanoparticles onto support surfaces. Between nonembedded PdAu/SiO 2 and PdAu/TiO 2 , we identified a support effect resulting in a 1.4-fold higher activity of PdAu/TiO 2 than PdAu/SiO 2 for benzaldehyde hydrogenation. Notably, partial nanoparticle embedding in the TiO 2 raspberry-colloid-templated support increased the metal–support interfacial perimeter and consequently, the number of Au/TiO 2 interfacial sites by 5.4-fold, which further enhanced the activity of PdAu/TiO 2 by an additional 4.1-fold. Theoretical calculations and in situ surface-sensitive desorption analyses reveal facile benzaldehyde binding at the Au/TiO 2 interface and at Pd ensembles on the nanoparticle surface, explaining the connection between the number of Au/TiO 2 interfacial sites (via the metal–support interfacial perimeter) and catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate partial nanoparticle embedding as a synthetic strategy to produce thermocatalytically stable catalysts and increase the number of catalytically active Au/TiO 2 interfacial sites to augment catalytic contributions arising from metal–support interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Microbial metabolism is impressively flexible, enabling growth even when available nutrients differ greatly from biomass in redox state. Escherichia coli , for example, rearranges its physiology to grow on reduced and oxidized carbon sources through several forms of fermentation and respiration. To understand the limits on and evolutionary consequences of this metabolic flexibility, we developed a coarse-grained mathematical framework coupling redox chemistry with principles of cellular resource allocation. Our models inherit key qualities from both of their antecedents: i) describing diverse metabolic chemistries and ii) enforcing the simultaneous balancing of atom (e.g., carbon), electron, and energy (adenosine triphosphate) flows, as in redox models, while iii) treating biomass as both the product and catalyst of the growth process, as in resource allocation models. Assembling integrated models of respiration, fermentation, and photosynthesis clarified key microbiological phenomena, including demonstrating that autotrophs grow more slowly than heterotrophs because of constraints imposed by the intracellular production of reduced carbon. Our model further predicted that heterotrophic growth is improved by matching the redox state of biomass to the nutrient environment. Through analysis of ≈ 60,000 genomes and diverse proteomic datasets, we found evidence that proteins indeed accumulate amino acid substitutions promoting redox matching. We therefore propose an unexpected mode of genome evolution where substitutions neutral or even deleterious to the individual biochemical or structural functions of proteins can nonetheless be selected due to a redox-chemical benefit to the population.",

          "abstract": "Monitoring subcellular organelle dynamics in real time and precisely assessing membrane heterogeneity in living cells are very important for studying fundamental biological mechanisms and gaining a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes. However, there remains a shortage of effective tools for these purposes. Herein, we propose a strategy to develop the exchangeable water-sensing probeAPBD for time-lapse imaging of dynamics in cellular membrane-bound organelle morphology with structured illumination microscopy at the nanoscale. In this work, our results reveal mitochondria as the first organelle to undergo morphological changes through swelling, fission, and fusion in cell necrosis, leading to the rupture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sheet adhered to the mitochondria. Meanwhile, the ER tubules are then reconstructed by stretching and fusion of autophagosomes. Moreover, APBD allows us to directly visualize spatially resolved distribution of biomembranes vs. water inside single mammalian cells. Our findings show that the renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) model results in the increased biomembrane to cytoplasmic water ratio in the tissue. This reveals intracellular water heterogeneity between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the IRI process. Overall, this study presents a strategy for development of the molecular tools for cellular water heterogeneity and organelle dynamics.",

Findings suggest air lead concentrations exceeded 150 ng/m 3 near metallurgical emission sources, with average enhancements of &gt;1.0 ng/m 3 over Europe during the Pax Romana apogee of the Roman Empire. The result was blood lead enhancements in young children of about 2.4 µg/dl above an estimated Neolithic background of 1.0 µg/dl, leading to widespread cognitive decline including a 2.5-to-3 point reduction in intelligence quotient throughout the Roman Empire.",

          "abstract": "From RNA interference to chromatin silencing, diverse genome defense pathways silence selfish genetic elements to safeguard genome integrity. Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via innovation of specificity factors. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to specificity factor innovations, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the genome defense capacity to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster . Through a targeted RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate —a recently evolved meiotic driver—we identified a defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to elevate Aub and AGO3 expression, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of piRNA pathway to tame expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.",

          "abstract": "How newly formed memories are preserved while brain plasticity is ongoing has been a source of debate. One idea is that synapses which experienced recent plasticity become resistant to further plasticity, a type of metaplasticity often referred to as saturation. Here, we probe the local dendritic mechanisms that limit plasticity at recently potentiated synapses. We show that recently potentiated individual synapses exhibit a synapse-specific refractory period for further potentiation. We further found that the refractory period is associated with reduced postsynaptic CaMKII signaling; however, stronger synaptic activation fully restored CaMKII signaling but only partially restored the ability for further plasticity. Importantly, the refractory period is released after one hour, a timing that coincides with the enrichment of several postsynaptic proteins to preplasticity levels. Notably, increasing the level of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, PSD95, but not of PSD93, overcomes the refractory period. Our results support a model in which potentiation at a single synapse is sufficient to initiate a synapse-specific refractory period that persists until key postsynaptic proteins regain their steady-state synaptic levels.",

          "abstract": "The tropical stratosphere is the gateway to the global stratosphere and a commonly proposed location for solar geoengineering. The dynamics of this remote and difficult to observe region are poorly understood, particularly at turbulent length scales. Existing observational estimates of turbulence frequency and strength vary widely. Furthermore, the sources of turbulence and the relationship between turbulence and the mean flow are largely unknown. We assembled a 21-y database of high vertical resolution (10 m) radiosonde data from four equatorial sites in two ocean basins to study tropical stratospheric turbulence frequency, variability, and sources. Turbulent layers thicker than 200 m are identified using subcritical Richardson number as a proxy for turbulence. We show that the turbulent fraction of the tropical stratosphere is strongly modulated by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Turbulence is enhanced during the QBO phase shifts, and the atmosphere is most turbulent right before the QBO phase switches from negative to positive, where turbulent instabilities typically occur within specific phases of Kelvin waves. Turbulence is less common when the QBO phase is well established, and the atmosphere is least turbulent during the negative phase of the QBO. The turbulent fraction of the equatorial lower stratosphere varies over a factor of ten depending on QBO phase. This relationship provides a robust observational constraint on the multiscale dynamics within this region, which is useful for evaluating atmospheric models, studying wave-mean flow interactions in the context of the QBO, and informing the operation of stratospheric aircraft and the injection of aerosol for geoengineering.",

Interactions of chaperoned MHC-I molecules with incoming peptides are transient in nature, and as a result, the precise antigen proofreading mechanism remains elusive. Here, we leverage a high-fidelity TAPBPR variant and conformationally stabilized MHC-I, to determine the solution structure of the human antigen editing complex bound to a peptide decoy by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at an average resolution of 3.0 Å. Antigen proofreading is mediated by transient interactions formed between the nascent peptide binding groove with the P2/P3 peptide anchors, where conserved MHC-I residues stabilize incoming peptides through backbone-focused contacts. Finally, using our high-fidelity chaperone, we demonstrate robust peptide exchange on the cell surface across multiple clinically relevant human MHC-I allomorphs.

In a cardiac transplant model, mtDNA B6 Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells supported long-term allograft survival, whereas mtDNA NZB Treg cells failed to suppress host T effector (Teff) cells, leading to acute rejection. When challenged with melanoma or colon cancer cells, the mtDNA NZB mice exhibited strikingly impaired tumor growth while mtDNA B6 mice showed Treg-dependent inhibition of Teff cells and allowed rapid tumor growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that activation of mtDNA NZB Teff cells increased mitochondrial gene expression while activation of mtDNA NZB Treg cells impaired mitochondrial gene expression and resulted in mtDNA NZB Treg cell exhaustion. Induction of the mitochondrially targeted catalytic antioxidant, mCAT, in hematopoietic cells normalized mtDNA NZB Treg function in both transplant and tumor models, indicating a key role for mROS in promoting Treg dysfunction. Anti-PD-L1 therapy did not modulate these effects, indicating that modulation of host mitochondrial function provides an independent approach for enhancing tumor cell destruction.",

          "abstract": "Many biological systems operate near the physical limits to their performance, suggesting that aspects of their behavior and underlying mechanisms could be derived from optimization principles. However, such principles have often been applied only in simplified models. Here, we explore a detailed mechanistic model of the gap gene network in the Drosophila embryo, optimizing its 50+ parameters to maximize the information that gene expression levels provide about nuclear positions. This optimization is conducted under realistic constraints, such as limits on the number of available molecules. Remarkably, the optimal networks we derive closely match the architecture and spatial gene expression profiles observed in the real organism. Our framework quantifies the tradeoffs involved in maximizing functional performance and allows for the exploration of alternative network configurations, addressing the question of which features are necessary and which are contingent. Our results suggest that multiple solutions to the optimization problem might exist across closely related organisms, offering insights into the evolution of gene regulatory networks.",

          "abstract": "Transgenic expression of a double-stranded RNA in plants can induce silencing of homologous mRNAs in fungal pathogens. Although such host-induced gene silencing is well documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly onto the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.",

          "abstract": "Crystallization of the lunar magma ocean yielded a chemically unique liquid residuum named KREEP. This component is expressed as a large patch on the near side of the Moon and a possible smaller patch in the northwest portion of the Moon’s South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side. Thermal models estimate that the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) could have spanned from 10 and 200 My, while studies of radioactive decay systems have yielded inconsistent ages for the completion of LMO crystallization covering over 160 My. Here, we show that the Moon achieved &gt;99% crystallization at 4,429 ± 76 Ma, indicating a lunar formation age of ~4,450 Ma or possibly older. Using the 176 Lu– 176 Hf decay system ( t 1/2 = 37 Gy), we found that the initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios of lunar zircons with varied U–Pb ages are consistent with their crystallization from a KREEP-rich reservoir with a consistently low 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio of 0.0167 that emerged ~140 My after solar system formation. The previously proposed younger model age of ~4.33 Ga for the source of mare basalts (240 My after solar system formation) might reflect the timing of a large impact. Our results demonstrate that lunar magma ocean crystallization took place while the Moon was still battered by planetary embryos and planetesimals leftover from the main stage of planetary accretion. The study of Lu–Hf model ages for samples brought back from the South Pole-Aitken basin will help to assess the lateral continuity of KREEP and further understand its significance in the early history of the Moon.",

          "abstract": "The organic carbon content of ancient rocks provides a fundamental record of the biosphere on early Earth. For over 50 y, the high organic content of Archean (&gt;2.5 Ga) mudrocks has puzzled geologists and evolutionary biologists, because high biological primary productivity was unexpected for the nascent biosphere before the rise of O 2 . Here, we took a different approach to resolve this apparent paradox, by studying the accumulation rates of Archean organic-rich mudrocks. We evaluated the sedimentation rates of three sections of the Mount McRae Shale and Jeerinah Formation (2.68 to 2.48 Ga, Pilbara Craton, Australia) with new and recently published U–Pb zircon ages from intraformational ash beds. For comparison, we compiled Phanerozoic (&lt;500 Ma) data from comparable depositional settings and developed an idealized model that considers the sedimentation rates for predicting rock organic content. We found that organic-rich Archean mudrocks were deposited under exceptionally low sedimentation rates (~1 m/Ma), in sharp contrast to organic-rich rocks from the Phanerozoic Eon (10 to 100 m/Ma). Constrained by observations, model results indicated that the Archean data reflect low primary productivity (~100-fold lower than during the Phanerozoic) and enhanced preservation under anoxic conditions, with the principal control on organic carbon content provided by dilution with inorganic sediment. Thus, the high organic carbon content which is typically attributed to high productivity instead reflects slow accumulation, high preservation, and minimal inorganic dilution—reconciling the geological evidence with a slow carbon cycle cadence during Archean time.",

Supported by multiple independent lines of geological evidence and examined through an iodine mass balance model, we find that elevated marine iodide content prevailed through most of Earth’s history. Since the rise of oxygen ~2.4 billion years ago, high marine iodide concentrations would have led to significant inorganic iodine emissions to the atmosphere, facilitating catalytic ozone destruction and resulting in atmospheric ozone instability with periodic or persistently lower ozone levels. At a global scale, unstable and low ozone levels likely persisted for about two billion years until the early Phanerozoic, roughly 0.5 billion years ago. The delayed stabilization of the Earth’s ozone layer holds significant implications for the tempo and direction of the evolution of life, in particular life on land.",

In coarsening models, this crossover patterning results from nascent recombination sites competing to accrue a limiting pro-crossover RING-domain protein (COR) that diffuses between synapsed chromosomes. Here, we delineate the localization dynamics of three mammalian CORs in the mouse and determine their interdependencies. RNF212, HEI10, and the newest member RNF212B show divergent spatiotemporal dynamics along synapsed chromosomes, including profound differences in spermatocytes and oocytes, that are not easily reconciled by elementary coarsening models. Contrasting mutant phenotypes and genetic requirements indicate that RNF212B, RNF212, and HEI10 play distinct but interdependent functions in regulating meiotic recombination and coordinating the events of meiotic prophase-I by integrating signals from DNA breaks, homolog synapsis, the cell-cycle, and incipient crossover sites.",

          "abstract": "High degree of fluorination for ether electrolytes has resulted in improved cycling stability of lithium metal batteries due to stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and good oxidative stability. However, the sluggish ion transport and environmental concerns of high fluorination degree drive the need to develop less fluorinated structures. Here, we depart from the traditional ether backbone and introduce bis(2-fluoroethoxy)methane (F2DEM), featuring monofluorination of the acetal backbone. High coulombic efficiency and stable long-term cycling in Li||Cu half cells can be achieved with F2DEM even under fast Li metal plating conditions. The performance of F2DEM is further compared with diethoxymethane (DEM) and 2-[2-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)ethoxy]-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (F5DEE). A significantly lower overpotential is observed with F2DEM, which improves energy efficiency and enables its application in high-rate conditions. Comparative studies of F2DEM with DEM and F5DEE in anode-free lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 ) LFP pouch cells and high-loading LFP coin cells further show improved capacity retention of F2DEM electrolyte, demonstrating its practical applicability. More importantly, we also extensively investigate the underlying mechanism for the superior performance of F2DEM through various techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy, focused ion beam, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and titration gas chromatography. Overall, F2DEM facilitates improved Li deposition morphology with reduced amount of dead Li. This enables F2DEM to show superior performance, especially under higher charging and slower discharging rate conditions.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the role of metabolic processes during inner ear development is essential for identifying targets for hair cell (HC) regeneration, as metabolic choices play a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Among the metabolic processes, growing evidence shows that glucose metabolism is closely related to organ development. However, the role of glucose metabolism in mammalian inner ear development and HC regeneration remains unclear. In this study, we found that glycolytic metabolism is highly active during mouse and human cochlear prosensory epithelium expansion. Using mouse cochlear organoids, we revealed that glycolytic activity in cochlear nonsensory epithelial cells was predominantly dominated by pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Deletion of PKM2 induced a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, impairing cochlear organoid formation. Furthermore, conditional loss of PKM2 in cochlear progenitors hindered sensory epithelium morphogenesis, as demonstrated in PKM2 knockout mice. Mechanistically, pyruvate is generated by PKM2 catalysis and then converted into lactate, which then lactylates histone H3, regulating the transcription of key genes for cochlear development. Specifically, accumulated lactate causes histone H3 lactylation at lysine 9 (H3K9la), upregulating the expression of Sox family transcription factors through epigenetic modification. Moreover, overexpression of PKM2 in supporting cells (SCs) triggered metabolism reprogramming and enhanced HC generation in cultured mouse and human cochlear explants. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism of sensory epithelium formation driven by glycolysis-lactate flow and suggest unique approaches for mammalian HC regeneration.",

While the internal pallidum serves as the primary target, recently, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been investigated. However, optimal targeting within this structure and its surroundings have not been studied in depth. Indeed, historical targets that have been used for surgical treatment of dystonia are directly adjacent to the STN. Further, multiple types of dystonia exist, and outcomes are variable, suggesting that not all types would profit maximally from the same target. Therefore, a thorough investigation of neural substrates underlying stimulation effects on dystonia signs and symptoms is warranted. Here, we analyze a multicenter cohort of isolated dystonia patients with subthalamic implantations ( N = 58) and relate their stimulation sites to improvements of appendicular and cervical symptoms as well as blepharospasm. Stimulation of the ventral oral posterior nucleus of thalamus and surrounding regions were associated with improvements in cervical dystonia, while stimulation of the dorsolateral STN was associated with improvements in limb dystonia and blepharospasm. This dissociation was matched by structural connectivity analysis, where the cerebellothalamic, corticospinal, and pallidosubthalamic tracts were associated with improvements of cervical dystonia, while hyperdirect and subthalamopallidal pathways with alleviation of limb dystonia and blepharospasm. On the level of functional networks, improvements of limb dystonia were associated with connectivity to the corresponding somatotopic regions in the primary motor cortex, while alleviation of cervical dystonia to the cingulo-opercular network. These findings shed light on the pathophysiology of dystonia and may guide DBS targeting and programming in the future.",

Understanding these complex mesoscopic systems requires probing the microscopic trajectories associated with irreversible processes, the role of fluctuations and entropy growth, and the timescales on which nonequilibrium responses are ultimately maintained. Approaches that illuminate these processes in model systems may enable a more general understanding of other heterogeneous nonequilibrium phenomena, and potentially define ultimate speed and energy cost limits for information processing technologies. Here, we apply ultrafast single-shot X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to resolve the nonequilibrium, heterogeneous, and irreversible mesoscale dynamics during a light-induced phase transition in a (PbTiO 3 ) 16 /(SrTiO 3 ) 16 superlattice. Such ferroelectric superlattice systems are a useful platform to study phase transitions and topological dynamics due to their high degree of tunability. This provides an approach for capturing the nucleation of the light-induced phase, the formation of transient mesoscale defects at the boundaries of the nuclei, and the eventual annihilation of these defects, even in systems with complex polarization topologies. We identify a nonequilibrium correlation response spanning &gt;10 orders of magnitude in timescales, with multistep behavior similar to the plateaus observed in supercooled liquids and glasses. We further show how the observed time-dependent long-time correlations can be understood in terms of stochastic and non-Markovian dynamics of domain walls, encoded in waiting-time distributions with power-law tails. This work defines possibilities for probing the nonequilibrium and correlated dynamics of disordered and heterogeneous media.",

Activation of BK channels is subunit specific, as paxilline but not iberiotoxin blocked mGluR-LTD. Also, 12(S)HPETE does not change the electrophysiological properties of the BK channel when the BKα subunit is expressed alone but increases the channel open probability when the BKα is coexpressed with the β4-subunit. Our findings reveal an interaction between 12(S)HPETE and BK channels to regulate synaptic strength at central synapses and increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mGluR-LTD in the neonatal hippocampus that likely contribute to circuit maturation necessary for learning.",

          "abstract": "Sleep spindles are cortical electrical oscillations considered critical for memory consolidation and sleep stability. The timing and pattern of sleep spindles are likely to be important in driving synaptic plasticity during sleep as well as preventing disruption of sleep by sensory and internal stimuli. However, the relative importance of factors such as sleep depth, cortical up/down-state, and temporal clustering in governing sleep spindle dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze sleep data from 1,025 participants, statistically modeling the simultaneous influences of multiple factors on moment-to-moment spindle production using a point process-generalized linear model framework. Results reveal fingerprint-like timing patterns, characterized by a refractory period followed by a period of increased spindle activity, which are highly individualized yet consistent night-to-night, with increased variability with age. Strikingly, short-term (&lt;15 s) temporal patterns of past spindle history are the main determinant of spindle timing, accounting for over 70% of the statistical deviance—surpassing the contribution of factors such as cortical up/down-state (slow oscillation phase), sleep depth, and long-term history (15 to 90 s, including ~50 s infraslow activity). Short-term history has a statistically significant influence in over 98% of the population, suggesting it is a near-universal feature of spindle activity. Short-term history and slow oscillation phase exert independent effects on spindle timing. Our results establish a robust statistical framework to examine abnormalities in sleep spindle timing observed in neurological disorders and aging, as well as the relationship between individualized sleep spindle timing, cognition, and sleep stability.",

          "abstract": "Physical materials from planetary bodies are crucial for understanding fundamental processes that constrain the evolution of the solar system, as samples can be analyzed at high precision and accuracy in Earth-based laboratories. Mars is the only planet outside of Earth from which we possess samples in the form of meteorites. Martian meteorites (n &gt; 350) have enabled constraints to be placed on various aspects of the red planet’s formation and evolution, notably: that Mars accreted and differentiated rapidly; that the planet has a complex volatile element evolution; and that it has always been volcanically active with a rich and diverse magmatic history. Meteorites have limitations, however, with lack of field context, restricted lithological diversity compared to the martian surface, and with no sampling of a major portion of Mars’ history between 4.1 and 2.4 billion years ago. Returned samples from Mars have the potential to fill these gaps and answer many open questions driven by the study of meteorites, as well as reveal new fundamental research questions. Key questions that Mars Sample Return is likely to answer regard the basic evolution of the martian interior and surface, its potential for habitability and the possibility of past life, and calibration of age dating of the martian surface. Samples of various lithologies and different ages collected at Jezero crater by the Perseverance rover will aid in better understanding our own planet and will answer outstanding questions regarding Mars’ future geological evolution and habitability.",

          "abstract": "The radiogenic isotopic compositions of basaltic Martian meteorites (shergottites) and clinopyroxene/olivine cumulate meteorites (nakhlite/chassignites) are used to define the global evolution of Mars. However, the two main groups of meteorites demonstrate that their sources underwent divergent styles of magmatic evolution. The shergottites portray a planet that differentiated ~4.52 billion years ago via solidification of a magma ocean, producing incompatible element-depleted and -enriched reservoirs that remained isolated until melt production. In contrast, the reservoir from which the nakhlite/chassignites derive may have formed earlier, produced melts that fractionated Sm/Nd and Hf/W differently, was compositionally less variable, and experienced a significantly more complex history following primordial differentiation than the shergottite sources. The disparate histories recorded by these two groups of meteorites elucidate important questions that could be addressed by acquiring additional samples. Obtaining samples that shared the isotopic systematics of the shergottites would provide confidence that extrapolating the primordial differentiation history of Mars from shergottite radiogenic isotope systematics is reasonable. Returned samples from Mars will also constrain the physical locations of the meteorite source regions, providing insights into the general structure of the Martian mantle. In addition, they will help constrain the phases present in the martian mantle during melting and the conditions under which they are stable. Finally, identifying an evolved lithology that satisfies the geochemical and isotopic constraints placed on the incompatible element-enriched endmember observed in the shergottites would define the nature of magmatic evolution on Mars and whether it is more akin to processes on the Earth or the Moon.",

          "abstract": "The strength−ductility trade-off exists ubiquitously, especially in brittle intermetallic-containing multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs), where the intermetallic phases often induce premature failure leading to severe ductility reduction. Hierarchical heterogeneities represent a promising microstructural solution to achieve simultaneous strength−ductility enhancement. However, it remains fundamentally challenging to tailor hierarchical heterostructures using conventional methods, which often rely on costly and time-consuming processing. Here, we report a multiscale microstructural inheritance and refinement strategy to process “structural hierarchy precursors” in as-cast heterogeneous Al 0.7 CoCrFeNi MPEAs, which lead directly to a hierarchical hetero-lamellar structure (HLS) after simple rolling and annealing. Interestingly, it takes only 10 min of annealing time, two orders of magnitude less than that required to render the state-of-the-art properties during conventional processing of Al 0.7 CoCrFeNi, for us to achieve record-high strength−ductility combinations via the hierarchical HLS design that sequentially stimulates multiple unusual deformation and reinforcement mechanisms. In particular, the HLS-enabled high hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) internal stress triggers profuse &lt;111&gt;-type dislocations on over five independent slip systems in the supposedly brittle intermetallic phase and activates extensive stacking faults (SFs) and nanotwinning in the adjoining soft phase with a rather high SF energy. These unexpected, dynamically reinforcing hetero-deformation mechanisms across multiple length scales facilitate high sustained HDI strain hardening, along with a salient microcrack-mediated extrinsic ductilization effect, suggesting that the proposed microstructural inheritance and refinement strategy provides an efficient, fast, and low-cost approach to overcome the strength−ductility trade-off in a broad range of structural materials.",

          "abstract": "To achieve replicative immortality, cancer cells must activate telomere maintenance mechanisms. In 10 to 15% of cancers, this is enabled by recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres pathways (ALT). ALT cells display several hallmarks including heterogeneous telomere length, extrachromosomal telomeric repeats, and ALT-associated PML bodies. ALT cells also have high telomeric replication stress (RS) enhanced by fork-stalling structures (R-loops and G4s) and altered chromatin states. In ALT cells, telomeric RS promotes telomere elongation but above a certain threshold becomes detrimental to cell survival. Manipulating RS at telomeres has thus been proposed as a therapeutic strategy against ALT cancers. Through analysis of genome-wide CRISPR fitness screens, we identified ALT-specific vulnerabilities and describe here our characterization of the roles of SUB1, a ssDNA-binding protein, in telomere stability. SUB1 depletion increases RS at ALT telomeres, profoundly impairing ALT cell growth without impacting telomerase-positive cells. During RS, SUB1 is recruited to stalled forks and ALT telomeres via its ssDNA-binding domain. This recruitment is potentiated by RPA depletion, suggesting that these factors may compete for ssDNA. The viability of ALT cells and their resilience toward RS also requires ssDNA binding by SUB1. SUB1 depletion accelerates cell death induced by FANCM depletion, triggering unsustainable levels of telomeric damage in ALT cells. Finally, combining SUB1 depletion with RS-inducing drugs rapidly induces replication catastrophe in ALT cells. Altogether, our work identifies SUB1 as an ALT susceptibility with roles in the mitigation of RS at ALT telomeres and suggests advanced therapeutic strategies for a host of still poorly managed cancers.",

Our investigation into the effects of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 on memory T cell formation in mice reveals that memory T cells generated by anti-CTLA-4 exhibit greater expansion, cytokine production, and antitumor activity than those from anti-PD-1. Notably, anti-CTLA-4 preserves more T cell factor-1 (TCF-1)+ T cells during priming, while anti-PD-1 leads to more thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box (TOX)+ T cells. Experiments using conditional Tcf7 - or Tox -knockout mice highlight that TCF-1 is essential for the memory response generated by anti-CTLA-4, whereas TOX deletion alone in T cells has no effect on the response to anti-PD-1. Deepening our understanding of how checkpoint inhibition affects memory response is crucial for advancing our understanding of the enduring impacts of these immunotherapies on the immune system.",

Here, we find that EGL-1, the BH3-only protein in Caenorhabditis elegans , promotes the cell-autonomous production of exophers in adult neurons. Exophers are large, micron-scale vesicles that are ejected from the cell and contain cellular components such as mitochondria. EGL-1 facilitates exopher production potentially through regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, an endogenous, low level of EGL-1 expression appears to benefit dendritic health. Our findings provide insights into the role of neuronal BH3-only protein in mitochondrial dynamics, downstream exopher production, and ultimately neuronal health.",

However, the existence of endogenous stem cells with multiple lineage potentials in the adult spinal cord remains a compelling area of research. In this study, we present a cross-species investigation that extends from development to injury. We used single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing and genetic lineage tracing to characterize neural cells in the spinal cord. Our findings show that ciliated ependymal cells lose neural progenitor gene signatures and proliferation ability following the differentiation of NPCs within the ventricular zone. By combining single-nucleus transcriptome datasets from the rhesus macaque spinal cord injury (SCI) model with developmental human spinal cord datasets, we revealed that ciliated ependymal cells respond minimally to injury and cannot revert to a developmental progenitor state. Intriguingly, we observed astrocytes transdifferentiating into mature oligodendrocytes postinjury through lineage tracing experiments. Further analysis identifies an intermediate-state glial cell population expressing both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte feature genes in adult spinal cords. The transition ratio from astrocytes into oligodendrocytes increased after remodeling injury microenvironment by functional scaffolds. Overall, our results highlight the remarkable multilineage potential of astrocytes in the adult spinal cord.",

          "abstract": "The sense of smell is a central sensory modality of most terrestrial species. However, our knowledge of olfaction is based on vertebrates and insects. In contrast, little is known about the chemosensory world of spiders and nothing about how they perform olfaction despite their important ecological role. The orb-weaving spider Argiope bruennichi lends itself to an in-depth study on olfaction as it is one of the few spider species whose volatile sex pheromone, emitted by females to attract males, is known. We combined ultrastructural and electrophysiological analyses and found that previously overlooked sensilla with wall pores are abundant on all walking legs of A. bruennichi males. We compared the ultrastructure of these wall-pore sensilla with those known to perform olfaction in insects, exploring similarities and differences. Electrophysiological single sensillum recordings demonstrated that the wall-pore sensilla in A. bruennichi respond highly sensitive and in a concentration-dependent manner to the sex pheromone. Our study demonstrates male-specific sensilla for detecting signaling females, whereas females and subadult males are devoid of wall pore sensilla. In a preliminary comparative morphological analysis using 19 species from 16 spider families, we found that wall-pore sensilla occur in male spiders from most, but not in basally branching clades or in Salticids, suggesting that wall-pore sensilla evolved at least once within spiders and were lost at least once. This research significantly expands our knowledge of the sensory ecology of spiders, will stimulate studies on the diversity and function of sensilla, as well as studies on the evolution of olfaction in arthropods.",

The style of modification or degradation of such organic structures indicates their agents of change, including oxidants, radiation, heating, water, and pressure.

In the three SRs, 185/4,662, 122/1,741, and 45/66 articles have been selected and considered for full-text screening by two independent reviewers. Due to technical variations and the inability of the LLMs to classify all records, the LLM’s considered sample sizes were smaller.

The OECN exhibits outstanding neuronal characteristics, capable of producing spikes with a widely calibratable state-of-the art firing frequency range of 0.130 to 147.1 Hz. Leveraging this capability, we develop a neuromorphic perception system that integrates mechanical sensors with the OECN and integrates them with an artificial synapse for tactile perception. The system successfully encodes tactile stimulations into frequency-dependent spikes, which are further converted into postsynaptic responses. This bioinspired design demonstrates significant potential to advance cyborg and neuromorphic systems, providing them with perceptual capabilities.",

          "abstract": "The bacterial type 6 secretion system (T6SS) is a toxin-injecting nanoweapon that mediates competition in plant- and animal-associated microbial communities. Bacteria can evolve de novo resistance against T6SS attacks, but resistance is far from universal in natural communities, suggesting key features of T6SS weaponry may act to limit its evolution. Here, we combine ecoevolutionary modeling and experimental evolution to examine how toxin type and multiplicity in Acinetobacter baylyi attackers shape resistance evolution in susceptible Escherichia coli competitors. In both our models and experiments, we find that combinations of multiple distinct toxins limit resistance evolution by creating genetic bottlenecks, driving resistant lineages extinct before they can reach high frequency. We also show that, paradoxically, single-toxin attackers can drive the evolution of cross-resistance, protecting bacteria against unfamiliar toxin combinations, even though such evolutionary pathways were inaccessible against multitoxin attackers. Our findings indicate that, comparable to antimicrobial and anticancer combination therapies, multitoxin T6SS arsenals function to limit resistance evolution in competing microbes. This helps us to understand why T6SSs remain widespread and effective weapons in microbial communities, and why many T6SS-armed bacteria encode functionally diverse anticompetitor toxins.",

          "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that intratumor bacteria exist as an active and specific tumor component in many tumor types beyond digestive and respiratory tumors. However, the biological impact and responsible molecules of such local bacteria–tumor direct interaction on cancer therapeutic response remain poorly understood. Trastuzumab is among the most commonly used drugs targeting the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ErbB2) in breast cancer, but its resistance is inevitable, severely limiting its clinical effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate that the quorum-sensing signaling molecule N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3oc), a chemical compound released by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ), one tumor-resident bacteria with a relative high abundance in breast cancer, promotes breast cancer cell resistance to trastuzumab. Mechanically, 3oc directly leads to spontaneous dimerization of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) type II serine/threonine kinase receptor on the cell membrane in a ligand-independent manner. The 3oc-induced TGF-β signaling subsequently triggers ErbB2 phosphorylation and its downstream target activation, overcoming the inhibition effect of trastuzumab on ErbB2. With specific real-time qPCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging, and liquid chromatography ionization tandem mass spectrometry analyses of clinical samples, we confirmed that P. aeruginosa and its signaling molecule 3oc exist in breast cancer tissues and there is a clinical correlation between P. aeruginosa colonization and trastuzumab resistance. This work expands the biological functions of intratumor bacteria in cancer treatment responsiveness and provides a unique perspective for overcoming trastuzumab resistance.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental topological principle is that the container always shapes the content. In neuroscience, this translates into how the brain anatomy shapes brain dynamics. From neuroanatomy, the topology of the mammalian brain can be approximated by local connectivity, accurately described by an exponential distance rule (EDR). The compact, folded geometry of the cortex is shaped by this local connectivity, and the geometric harmonic modes can reconstruct much of the functional dynamics. However, this ignores the fundamental role of the rare long-range (LR) cortical connections, crucial for improving information processing in the mammalian brain, but not captured by local cortical folding and geometry. Here, we show the superiority of harmonic modes combining rare LR connectivity with EDR (EDR+LR) in capturing functional dynamics (specifically LR functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity) compared to geometry and EDR representations. Importantly, the orchestration of dynamics is carried out by a more efficient manifold made up of a low number of fundamental EDR+LR modes. Our results show the importance of rare LR connectivity for capturing the complexity of functional brain activity through a low-dimensional manifold shaped by fundamental EDR+LR modes.",

          "abstract": "Wastewater receives per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from diverse consumer and industrial sources, and discharges are known to be a concern for drinking water quality. The PFAS family includes thousands of potential chemical structures containing organofluorine moieties. Exposures to a few well-studied PFAS, mainly perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA), have been associated with increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, prompting federal drinking water regulations for six compounds in 2024. Here, we find that the six regulated PFAS (mean = 7 to 8%) and 18 measured PFAA (mean = 11 to 21%) make up only a small fraction of the extractable organofluorine (EOF) in influent and effluent from eight large municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Most of the EOF in influent (75%) and effluent (62%) consists of mono- and polyfluorinated pharmaceuticals. The treatment technology and sizes of the treatment facilities in this study are similar to those serving 70% of the US population. Despite advanced treatment technologies, the maximum EOF removal efficiency among facilities in this work was &lt;25%. Extrapolating our measurements to other large facilities across the United States results in a nationwide EOF discharge estimate of 1.0 to 2.8 million moles F y −1 . Using a national model that simulates connections between wastewater discharges and downstream drinking water intakes, we estimate that the sources of drinking water for up to 23 million Americans could be contaminated above regulatory thresholds by wastewater-derived PFAS alone. These results emphasize the importance of further curbing ongoing PFAS sources and additional evaluations of the fate and toxicity of fluorinated pharmaceuticals.",

          "abstract": "Ataxia–telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic genome instability syndrome resulting from the loss of the homeostatic protein kinase ATM. The complex phenotype of A-T includes progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, gonadal atrophy, interstitial lung disease, cancer predisposition, endocrine abnormalities, chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and segmental premature aging. Cultured skin fibroblasts from A-T patients exhibit premature senescence, highlighting the association between genome instability, cellular senescence, and aging. We found that lung fibroblasts derived from ATM-deficient mice provide a versatile experimental system to explore the mechanisms driving the premature senescence of primary fibroblasts lacking ATM. Atm −/− fibroblasts failed to proliferate under ambient oxygen conditions (21%). Although they initially proliferated under physiological oxygen levels (3%), they rapidly entered senescence. In contrast, wild-type (WT) lung fibroblasts did not senesce under 3% oxygen and eventually underwent immortalization and neoplastic transformation. However, rapid senescence could be induced in WT cells either by Atm gene ablation or persistent chemical inhibition of ATM kinase activity, with senescence induced by ATM inhibition being reversible upon inhibitor removal. Moreover, the concomitant loss of ATM and p53 led to senescence evasion, vigorous growth, rampant genome instability, and subsequent immortalization and transformation. Our findings reveal that the rapid senescence of Atm −/− lung fibroblasts is driven by the collaborative action of the cGAS–STING, p38 MAPK, and p53 pathways in response to persistent DNA damage, ultimately leading to the induction of interferon-α1 and downstream interferon-stimulated genes. We propose that accelerated cellular senescence may exacerbate specific A-T symptoms, particularly contributing to the progressive, life-threatening interstitial lung disease often observed in A-T patients during adulthood.",

We found pervasive evidence of heritable genetic variation in mosquito heat tolerance, and phenotypic trade-offs in tolerance to prolonged versus acute heat exposure. Further, we found genomic variation associated with prolonged heat tolerance was clustered in several regions of the genome, suggesting the presence of larger structural variants such as chromosomal inversions. A simple evolutionary model based on our data estimates that the maximum rate of evolutionary adaptation in mosquito heat tolerance will exceed the projected rate of climate warming, implying the potential for mosquitoes to track warming via genetic adaptation.",

          "abstract": "CAG/CTG repeats are prone to expansion, causing several inherited human diseases. The initiating sources of DNA damage which lead to inaccurate repair of the repeat tract to cause expansions are not fully understood. Expansion-prone CAG/CTG repeats are actively transcribed and prone to forming stable R-loops with hairpin structures forming on the displaced single-stranded DNA (S-loops). We previously determined that damage by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytosine deaminase, Fcy1, was required for both fragility and instability of CAG/CTG tracts engaged in R-loops. To determine whether this mechanism is more universal, we expressed human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3A (A3A), APOBEC3B (A3B), or activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in our yeast system. We show that mutagenic activity of Apolipoprotein B messenger RNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptides causes CAG/CTG fragility and instability, with A3A having the greatest effect followed by A3B and least from AID. A3A-induced repeat fragility was exacerbated by enrichment of R-loops at the repeat site. A3A and A3B-induced instability was dependent on the MutLγ nuclease and to a lesser extent, base excision repair factors. Deaminase activity assays on hairpin substrates containing CTG and GTC triplet sequences revealed that A3A prefers cytidines within the hairpin loop, and bulges in the hairpin stem alter preferred locations. Analysis of RNA expression levels in human cortex samples revealed that A3A is expressed in brain tissue that exhibits CAG/CTG repeat expansions and its expression is elevated in Huntington’s disease (HD) patient samples. These results implicate cytidine deamination by A3A as a potential source of repeat expansions in HD and other CAG/CTG repeat expansion disorders.",

We report a set of simple iron porphyrins with pendant thiol group can catalyze the reduction of CO 2 to ethane (C 2 H 6 ) with H 2 O as the proton source with a Faradaic yield &gt;40% the rest being CO. The mechanism involves a CO 2 -derived methyl group transfer to the pendant thiol akin to the proposal forwarded for methyl transferases and a follow-up C–C bond formation of the thioether thus formed and a Fe(II)–CH 3 species generated by the reduction of a second molecule of CO 2 . The availability of a “parking space” in the molecular framework for the first reduced C 1 product from CO 2 reduction allows C–C bond formation resulting in a unique case where a component of natural gas can be generated from direct electrochemical reduction of CO 2 .",

          "abstract": "ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1) is one of the three most frequently mutated genes in age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH), alongside DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 ( TET2) . CH can progress to myeloid malignancies including chronic monomyelocytic leukemia (CMML) and is also strongly associated with inflammatory cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in humans. DNMT3A and TET2 regulate DNA methylation and demethylation pathways, respectively, and loss-of-function mutations in these genes reduce DNA methylation in heterochromatin, allowing derepression of silenced elements in heterochromatin. In contrast, the mechanisms that connect mutant ASXL1 and CH are not yet fully understood. CH/CMML-associated ASXL1 mutations encode C-terminally truncated proteins that enhance the deubiquitinase activity of the ASXL-BAP1 “PR-DUB” deubiquitinase complex, which removes monoubiquitin from H2AK119Ub. Here, we show that ASXL1 mutant proteins interact with the euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferases 1 and 2 (EHMT1–EHMT2) complex, which generates H3K9me1 and me2, the latter a repressive modification in constitutive heterochromatin. Compared to cells from age-matched wild-type mice, we found that expanded myeloid cells from old (≥18-mo-old) Asxl1tm/+ mice, a heterozygous knock-in mouse model of CH, display genome-wide decreases of H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H2AK119Ub as well as an associated increase in expression of transposable elements (TEs) and satellite repeats. Increased TE expression was also observed in monocytes from ASXL1 -mutant CMML patients compared to monocytes from healthy controls. Our data suggest that mutant ASXL1 proteins compromise the integrity of both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin in an age-dependent manner by reducing the levels of H3K9me2/3 and H2AK119Ub. This increase in TE expression correlated with increased expression of nearby genes, including many interferon-inducible (inflammation-associated) genes (ISGs).",

Fat accumulation in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is more common in men, is caused in part by mitochondrial dysfunction. EndoG expression is reduced in MASLD liver, and EndoG deficiency causes MASLD in an obesity-independent manner but only in males. EndoG promotes mitochondrial respiration by resolving mitochondrial tRNA/DNA hybrids formed during mtDNA transcription by recruiting RNA helicase DHX30 to unwind them. EndoG also cleaves off the 3′-end of the H-strand transcript that can prevent mt-tRNA Thr precursor cloverleaf-folding, and processing, which increases mt-tRNA Thr production and mitochondrial translation. Using fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy technology to visualize oxygen consumption at the individual mitochondrion level, we found that EndoG deficiency leads to the selective loss of a mitochondrial subpopulation with high-oxygen consumption. This defect was reversed with mt-tRNA Thr supplementation. Thus, EndoG promotes mitochondrial respiration by selectively regulating the production of mt-tRNA Thr in male mice.",

As the first return of samples from a habitable world, there are important challenges to overcome for the successful implementation of the MSR Campaign from the point of sample collection on Mars to the long-term curation of the samples on Earth. In particular, the successful execution of planetary protection protocols adds well-warranted complexity to every step of the process from the two MSR Program flight elements to the ground element at the sample receiving facility (SRF). In this contribution, we describe the architecture of the MSR Campaign, with a focus on infrastructure needs for the curation (i.e., the clean storage, processing, and allocation) of pristine Martian samples. Curation is a science-enabling and planetary protection-enabling activity, and the curation practices described in this contribution for the SRF and any long-term curation facility will enable the sample safety assessment, initial scientific investigations of the samples, and establish the MSR collection as a scientific resource that will enable generations of science and discovery through studies of the returned Mars samples. The planetary protection and curation processes established for MSR will provide critical insights into potential future sample return missions from other habitable worlds like Enceladus and Europa.",

It is critical to disentangle the mechanisms behind these earthquakes to better assess seismic risk. Here, a clustering methodology is applied to a catalog of 21,536 induced earthquakes detected during a 36-d hydraulic stimulation program in Western Canada. The results reveal that clustered events nucleate at short recurrence times generally less than 6 min. Notably, the clustered events are not characterized by short interevent distances as seen in regional-scale studies. Numerical modeling reveals that earthquakes cluster preferentially in regions of significantly lower pore pressure change ( Δ P ). Furthermore, clustered earthquakes exhibit significantly more chain-like topologies with decreasing Δ P , in agreement with laboratory studies showing that fault materials transition to rate-strengthening behavior with increasing Δ P . Proxy estimates for pore pressure change suggest these observations are consistent across Western Canada, and highlight the potential for significant temporal segmentation of induced earthquake processes.",

          "abstract": "One of the most surprising and important findings of the first human landings on the Moon was the discovery of a very fine layer of lunar dust covering the entire surface of Moon along with the negative impacts of this dust on the well-being and operational effectiveness of the astronauts, their equipment, and instrumentation. The United States is now planning for human missions to Mars, a planet where dust can also be expected to be ubiquitous for many or most landing sites. For these missions, the design and operations of key hardware systems must take this dust into account, especially when related to crew health and safety. Improved understanding of Martian dust characteristics can inform its potential to also perform transport of microorganisms, both those inadvertently brought to Mars by the astronauts, or, if Martian microorganisms exist, the potential for their inadvertent return to Earth with the astronauts. Careful planning and design are needed to assure that future missions do not violate the United Nations Outer Space Treaty (1967) signed by all spacefaring nations. In this paper, we review the impact of lunar dust on the Apollo missions and identify several questions about dust in the atmosphere of Mars that may be answered by the curated samples that would be returned by the planned Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign. These answers would not only provide an opportunity to better understand the history of Mars but could also reduce uncertainty in charting the future of humanity’s exploration of the planet.",

          "abstract": "Pesticide application is essential for stabilizing agricultural production. However, the effects of increasing pesticide diversity on soil microbial functions remain unclear, particularly under varying nitrogen (N) fertilizer management practices. In this study, we investigated the stochasticity of soil microbes and multitrophic networks through amplicon sequencing, assessed soil community functions related to carbon (C), N, phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycling, and characterized the dominant bacterial life history strategies via metagenomics along a gradient of increasing pesticide diversity under two N addition levels. Our findings show that higher pesticide diversity enriches the abundance of bacterial specialists and opportunists capable of degrading or resisting pesticides, reducing the proportion of bacterial generalists in the absence of N addition. These shifts can complicate multitrophic microbial networks. Under increased pesticide diversity, selective pressure may drive bacteria to streamline their average genome size to conserve energy while enhancing C, N, P, and S metabolic capacities, thus accelerating soil nutrient loss. In comparison, N addition was found to reduce bacterial niche differentiation at higher pesticide diversity, mitigating the impacts of network complexity and functional traits associated with pesticide diversity, ultimately alleviating soil nutrient loss. Our results reveal the contrasting impacts of pesticide diversity on microbial functions under different N input scenarios and emphasize that strategic N fertilizer management can mitigate the ecological effects of pesticide use in agricultural systems.",

          "abstract": "Among new antimalarials discovered over the past decade are multiple chemical scaffolds that target Plasmodium falciparum P-type ATPase ( Pf ATP4). This essential protein is a Na + pump responsible for the maintenance of Na + homeostasis. Pf ATP4 belongs to the type two-dimensional (2D) subfamily of P-type ATPases, for which no structures have been determined. To gain better insight into the structure/function relationship of this validated drug target, we generated a homology model of Pf ATP4 based on sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase, a P2A-type ATPase, and refined the model using molecular dynamics in its explicit membrane environment. This model predicted several residues in Pf ATP4 critical for its function, as well as those that impart resistance to various Pf ATP4 inhibitors. To validate our model, we developed a genetic system involving merodiploid states of Pf ATP4 in which the endogenous gene was conditionally expressed, and the second allele was mutated to assess its effect on the parasite. Our model predicted residues involved in Na + coordination as well as the phosphorylation cycle of Pf ATP4. Phenotypic characterization of these mutants involved assessment of parasite growth, localization of mutated Pf ATP4, response to treatment with known Pf ATP4 inhibitors, and evaluation of the downstream consequences of Na + influx. Our results were consistent with modeled predictions of the essentiality of the critical residues. Additionally, our approach confirmed the phenotypic consequences of resistance-associated mutations as well as a potential structural basis for the fitness cost associated with some mutations. Taken together, our approach provides a means to explore the structure/function relationship of essential genes in haploid organisms.",

          "abstract": "The course of evolution is strongly shaped by interaction between mutations. Such epistasis can yield rugged sequence–function maps and constrain the availability of adaptive paths. While theoretical intuition is often built on global statistics of large, homogeneous model landscapes, mutagenesis measurements necessarily probe a limited neighborhood of a reference genotype. It is unclear to what extent local topography of a real epistatic landscape represents its global shape. Here, we demonstrate that epistatic landscapes can be heterogeneously rugged and this heterogeneity may render biomolecules more evolvable. By characterizing a multipeaked fitness landscape of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody mutant library, we show that heterogeneous ruggedness arises from sparse epistatic hotspots, whose mutation impacts the fitness effect of numerous sequence sites. Surprisingly, mutating an epistatic hotspot may enhance, rather than reduce, the accessibility of the fittest genotype, while increasing the overall ruggedness. Further, migratory constraints in real space alleviate mutational constraints in sequence space, which not only diversify direct paths taken but may also turn a road-blocking fitness peak into a stepping stone leading toward the global optimum. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of epistatic hotspots may organize the fitness landscape in such a way that path-orienting ruggedness confers global smoothness.",

Yet, we know surprisingly little about this process, especially for endangered species, such as nonhuman great apes. Chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, are particularly notable because they inhabit diverse habitats, from rainforest to woodland-savannah. Whether genetic adaptation facilitates such habitat diversity remains unknown, despite it having wide implications for evolutionary biology and conservation. By using newly sequenced exomes from 828 wild chimpanzees (388 postfiltering), we found evidence of fine-scale genetic adaptation to habitat, with signatures of positive selection in forest chimpanzees in the same genes underlying adaptation to malaria in humans. This work demonstrates the power of noninvasive samples to reveal genetic adaptations in endangered populations and highlights the importance of adaptive genetic diversity for chimpanzees.",

          "abstract": "Accurately modeling the deformation of temperate glacier ice, which is at its pressure-melting temperature and contains liquid water at grain boundaries, is essential for predicting ice sheet discharge to the ocean and associated sea-level rise. Central to such modeling is Glen’s flow law, in which strain rate depends on stress raised to a power of n = 3 to 4. In sharp contrast to this nonlinearity, we found by conducting large-scale, shear-deformation experiments that temperate ice is linear-viscous ( n ≈ 1.0) over common ranges of liquid water content and stress expected near glacier beds and in ice-stream margins. This linearity is likely caused by diffusive pressure melting and refreezing at grain boundaries and could help to stabilize modeled responses of ice sheets to shrinkage-induced stress increases.",

In this study, we investigated the adaptation of two species of woodrats ( Neotoma lepida and N. bryanti ) to creosote bush ( Larrea tridentata ), a toxic shrub that expanded across the southwestern United States after the Last Glacial Maximum. We found that creosote-adapted woodrats have elevated gene dosage across multiple biotransformation enzyme families. These duplication events occurred independently across species and substantially increase expression of biotransformation genes, especially within the glucuronidation pathway. We propose that increased gene dosage resulting from duplication is an important mechanism by which animals initially adapt to novel environmental pressures.",

This is especially so in Australia, which lost 90% of its large species by 40,000 years ago, more than half of them kangaroos. Determining causation has been obstructed by a poor understanding of their ecology. Using dental microwear texture analysis, we show that most members of Australia’s richest Pleistocene kangaroo assemblage had diets that were much more generalized than their craniodental anatomy implies. Mixed feeding across most kangaroos pinpoints dietary breadth as a key behavioral adaptation to climate-driven fluctuations in vegetation structure, dispelling the likelihood that late Pleistocene climatic variation was a primary driver of their disappearance.",

Inhibiting conjugated BA synthesis in hepatocytes through deletion of the BA-conjugating enzyme bile acid–CoA:amino acid N -acyltransferase (BAAT) enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses, reduced tumor growth, and sensitized tumors to anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) immunotherapy. Furthermore, different BAs regulated CD8 + T cells differently; primary BAs induced oxidative stress, whereas the secondary BA lithocholic acid inhibited T cell function through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was countered by ursodeoxycholic acid.

Consequently, lipochondrocytes grew uniform lipid droplets that resisted systemic lipid surges and did not enlarge upon obesity.

Neurons often encoded the same hand and mouth actions differently in RCs and FMCs. Furthermore, in FMCs, we identified cells that selectively encoded actions untestable during RCs and others that displayed mixed selectivity for multiple actions, which is compatible with an organization based on cortical motor synergies at different levels of complexity. Cross-context decoding demonstrated that neural activity in FMCs is richer and more generalizable than in RCs, which suggests that neuroethological approaches are better suited to unveil the neural bases of behavior.",

In the context of the climate crisis, scientists worldwide are exploring adaptation measures to address the heightened fire risk driven by more frequent extreme climatic conditions such as droughts and heatwaves, as well as by non-native plant invasions that increased fuel loads and altered fire regimes. Although fire is intrinsic to grassy ecosystems , rising exposure to wildfire smoke harms human health and the environment. Here, we argue that grazing management in grassy ecosystems could help reduce wildfire risk and its consequences.",

We developed a series of fluorine-rich poly(arylene amine) polymer membranes that feature rigid polymer backbones with segregated perfluoroalkyl side chains. This combination imbues the polymers with resistance to dilation induced by hydrocarbon immersion without the loss of solution-based membrane fabrication techniques. These materials exhibit good separation of liquid-phase alkane isomers at ambient temperatures. The integration of these polymeric membranes into fuel and chemical feedstock separation processes was investigated in a series of experiments. Technoeconomic analyses based on these experiments indicate that the best-performing membrane materials can substantially reduce the energy costs and associated carbon emissions of hydrocarbon separations (two to 10 times, depending on product specifications).",

In males, VTA DA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate female preference, and those to the medial preoptic area mediate male preference. In females, firing-pattern (phasic-like versus tonic-like) alteration of the VTA DA -NAc projection determines sociosexual preferences.

These observations contrast with the senescence-focused paradigm of old age that has dominated the literature for more than a century yet are consistent with findings from behavioral ecology and life history theory. In this work, we review why the global loss of old individuals can be particularly detrimental to long-lived animals with indeterminate growth; those with increasing reproductive output with age; and those dependent on migration, sociality, and cultural transmission for survival. Longevity conservation is needed to protect the important ecological roles and ecosystem services provided by old animals.",

Male resource competition results in a feedback loop that magnifies the importance of early contingency and pushes individuals onto divergent, self-reinforcing life trajectories, while the same process appears absent in females. Our results indicate that the strength of sexual selection may be self-limiting, and they highlight the potential for contingency to lead to differences in life outcomes, even in the absence of any underlying differences in ability (“merit”).",

We discovered a sex-biased association between very large (&gt;1 megabase) germline chromosomal abnormalities and increased risk of solid tumors in male children. The overall impact of germline SVs was greatest in neuroblastoma, where we uncovered burdens of ultrarare SVs that cause loss of function of highly expressed, mutationally constrained genes, as well as noncoding SVs predicted to disrupt chromatin domain boundaries.

Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule that drives this response. Knocking out opn5m attenuated melanogenesis by reducing tyrosinase expression in the skin.

Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400°C. In films thinner than 5 nanometers, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microhm centimeters for 1.5-nanometer-thick NbP) is up to six times lower than the resistivity of our bulk NbP films, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically about 100 microhm centimeters). The NbP films are not crystalline but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is caused by conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics beyond the limitations of conventional metals.",

          "abstract": "Long-distance migration, common in passerine birds, is rare and poorly studied in bats. Piloting a 1.2-gram IoT (Internet of Things) tag with onboard processing, we tracked the daily location, temperature, and activity of female common noctules ( Nyctalus noctula ) during spring migration across central Europe up to 1116 kilometers. Over 3 years, 71 bats migrated tens to hundreds of kilometers per night, predominantly with incoming warm fronts, which provided them with wind support. Bats also showed unexpected flexibility in their ability to migrate across a wide range of conditions if needed. However, females leaving toward the end of the season showed higher total activity per distance traveled, a possible cost for their flexible migration timing.",

          "abstract": "Barocaloric (BC) materials offer the potential for highly energy-efficient refrigeration by generating heat absorption through the effect of pressure on a solid-solid phase transition. However, very few of the known materials have the required phase transition in the temperature regions necessary for domestic refrigeration or air conditioning. We introduce organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) as a new family of BC materials. OIPCs display subambient transition temperatures, so-called “colossal” entropy changes (92 to 240 joules per kilogram per kelvin), and a high sensitivity to pressure, up to 23.7 kelvin per kilobar. The BC responses achieved with these prototype OIPC-BCs are tunable through structural modification of the ions; this wide matrix of possible combinations of structure and function indicates the scope of OIPCs as a new class of material for efficient and sustainable cooling technologies.",

          "abstract": "Balanced mating type polymorphisms offer a distinct window into the forces shaping sexual reproduction strategies. Multiple hermaphroditic genera in Juglandaceae, including walnuts ( Juglans ) and hickories ( Carya ), show a 1:1 genetic dimorphism for male versus female flowering order (heterodichogamy). We map two distinct Mendelian inheritance mechanisms to ancient (&gt;37 million years old) genus-wide structural DNA polymorphisms. The dominant haplotype for female-first flowering in Juglans contains tandem repeats of the 3′ untranslated region of a gene putatively involved in trehalose-6-phosphate metabolism and is associated with increased cis gene expression in developing male flowers, possibly mediated by small RNAs. The Carya locus contains ~20 syntenic genes and shows molecular signatures of sex chromosome–like evolution. Inheritance mechanisms for heterodichogamy are deeply conserved, yet may occasionally turn over, as in sex determination.",

The mechanisms of resilience that foster remission and mitigate the adverse effects of stress remain unknown. We analyzed the evolution of hippocampal morphology between 2016/2017 and 2018/2019, as well as the memory control mechanisms crucial for trauma resilience. Participants were individuals exposed to the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks ( N = 100), including chronic ( N = 34) and remitted ( N = 19) PTSD, and nonexposed ( N = 72). We found that normalization of inhibitory control processes, which regulate the resurgence of intrusive memories in the hippocampus, not only predicted PTSD remission but also preceded a reduction in traumatic memories. Improvement in control mechanisms was associated with the interruption of stress-induced atrophy in a hippocampal region that includes the dentate gyrus. Human resilience to trauma is characterized by the plasticity of memory control circuits, which interacts with hippocampal neuroplasticity.",

The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus exudes both compound classes, which metabolic reconstructions suggest follows synchronous daily genome replication. Co-occurring heterotrophs differentiate into purine- and pyrimidine-using generalists or specialists that use compounds for different purposes. The most abundant heterotroph, SAR11, is a specialist that uses purines as sources of energy, carbon, and/or nitrogen, with subgroups differentiating along ocean-scale gradients in the supply of energy and nitrogen, in turn producing putative cryptic nitrogen cycles that link many microbes. Last, in an SAR11 subgroup that dominates where Prochlorococcus is abundant, adenine additions to cultures inhibit DNA synthesis, poising cells for replication. We argue that this subgroup uses inferred daily adenine pulses from Prochlorococcus to synchronize to the daily photosynthate supply from surrounding phytoplankton.",

Combined with a publicly available database on EC transcriptomic responses to drug treatments, this approach inferred a regulatory network controlling EC states and made several notable predictions. Particularly, inhibiting cell cycle–dependent kinase (CDK) 2 was predicted to initiate inward remodeling and promote atherogenesis. In vitro, PSS activated CDK2 and induced late G 1 cell cycle arrest. In mice, EC deletion of CDK2 triggered inward artery remodeling, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, and accelerated atherosclerosis.

Here, we further identified the B cell autoantigenic epitopes of SR-A. By a large-scale multicenter study including one training and three validation cohorts of 1954 participants, we showed that anticitrullinated SR-A peptide antibody (anti-CSP) was exclusively elevated in RA as a biomarker, particularly useful for seronegative RA. Combination of anti-CSP with anti-CCP demonstrated superior diagnostic value for RA, with sensitivity of 84.83% and specificity of 92.43%. Moreover, RA anti-CSP revealed distinct glycosylation patterns, capable of provoking inflammation in cartilage organoids and exacerbating disease progression in experimental arthritis. Together, these data identify anti-CSP as an RA autoantibody clinically applicable and actively involved in disease pathogenesis.",

However, complex electronic interactions resulting from chemical disorder prohibit the quantification of vacancy formation energy ( E f ) and migration barriers ( E b ). Herein, we propose an electronic descriptor χ S v (electronegativity χ and valence-electron number S v ) to quantify the bonding strength of constituents on the basis of the tight-binding model, which allows us to build analytical models to achieve the site-to-site quantification of E f and E b . The descriptor χ S v reflects the d-band occupation, indicating the dominant role of the electronic interactions in the vacancy formation and migration of HEAs. As a size effect, local lattice distortion plays a more important role in vacancy migration than in vacancy formation. Our model establishes a universal physical picture of vacancy formation and migration, which helps to understand the radiation resistance and mechanical properties of HEAs, thereby accelerating the design of high-performance HEAs.",

These DN3s are organized into 12 clusters with unusual gene expression features compared to the more well-studied clock neurons. We further show that previously uncharacterized DN3 subtypes promote sleep through a G protein–coupled receptor, TrissinR .

Observed deposition rates downwind of large-scale unconventional oil operations reached up to 100 tC hour −1 , with fluxes exceeding 0.1 gC m −2 hour −1 . The observed deposition lifetimes (τ dep ) were short enough (i.e., 4 ± 2 hours) to compete with chemical oxidation processes and affect the fate of atmospheric reactive carbon. Yet, much of this deposited organic carbon cannot be accounted for using traditional gas-phase deposition algorithms used in regional air quality models, signifying underrepresented, but influential, chemical-physical surface properties and processes. Furthermore, these fluxes represent a major unaccounted contribution of reactive carbon to downwind freshwater ecosystems that outweigh terrestrial sources, necessitating the inclusion of dry deposition in aquatic carbon balances and models.",

Germ cells express a member of the transforming growth factor–β family, Gonadless ( Gls ), that induces gonad morphogenesis. Loss of Gls resulted in animals lacking gonads but having nonproliferative germ cells. We propose that primary germ cells drive gonad development though Gls secretion. The germinal zone in the newly formed gonad provides positive feedback to induce secondary germ cells by activating Tfap2 in resident pluripotent stem cells. The contribution of germ cell signaling to the patterning of somatic gonadal tissue may be a general animal feature.",

Several recent reports have demonstrated the emergence of “electron-donating” hydrides in tailoring the structure, electronic structure, and reactivity of metal nanoclusters. However, the number of such hydrides included in each cluster kernel is limited to one or two. There is even no structure model, neither theoretical nor experimental, for encapsulating a third electron-donating hydride into one cluster entity. Here, we present a structurally precise superatomic nanocluster, PtH 3 Cu 23 (iso-propyl-PhS) 18 (PPh 3 ) 4 (PtH 3 Cu 23 ), which contains three interstitial electron-donating hydrides. The molecular structure of PtH 3 Cu 23 describes the encapsulation of a PtCu 12 core that contains three interstitial hydrides in a distorted anticuboctahedral architecture, in an outer sphere consisting of copper atoms and thiolate and phosphine ligands. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the three hydrides in PtH 3 Cu 23 contribute their valence electrons to the cluster superatomic electron count of eight. In this regard, the cluster represents a rare Pt-included copper-hydride superatom with eight free electrons.",

However, despite the merit, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the bandgap variation as a function of Sn/Pb ratio, mainly because the films are easy to segregate in terms of both composition and phase. Here, we report a fully stoichiometric synthesis of monocrystalline FAPb 1− x Sn x I 3 nanocrystals as well as their atomic-scale imaging. On the basis of the systematic measurements of the monocrystalline materials, strain and Coulomb interaction–induced atomic ordering was revealed to be responsible for the unusual discontinuous bandgap jumping near x = 0.5 from the expected bowing effect. As a result, both FAPb 0.6 Sn 0.4 I 3 and FAPb 0.4 Sn 0.6 I 3 have the lowest bandgaps of around 1.27 electron volts, while that of FAPb 0.5 Sn 0.5 I 3 is 1.33 electron volts.

With single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine embryonic knee joint primordia, we discovered that heightened expression of glycolysis genes characterized developing interzone cells when compared to flanking chondrocytes. Conditional deletion of the glucose transporters Glut1 and/or Glut3 , in either the incipient pre-skeletal mesenchyme with Prx1Cre or in chondrocytes with Col2Cre , disrupted interzone formation dose-dependently. In contrast, deletion of Glut1 / 3 in established interzone cells with Gdf5Cre did not have similar severe disruption of joint development. scRNA-seq revealed that Glut1/3 deletion by Prx1Cre impeded Tgfβ signaling in the developing interzone cells. Direct elimination of Tgfβ signaling with Prx1Cre partially phenocopied the deletion of Glut1/3 in impairing interzone formation. Tgfβ stimulated glycolysis in chondrocytes via activation of mTOR and Hif1α in vitro. The data support that the essential conversion of chondrocytes to interzone cells requires a transient elevation of glycolysis partly dependent on Tgfβ signaling.",

Here, we reveal that infection of Arabidopsis flowers by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A, a bacterial pathogen causing rice blight disease, suppresses ovule initiation and reduces seed number without causing visible disease symptoms. TleB, secreted by the type VI secretion system (T6SS), interacts with plant E3 ligase PUB14 and disrupts the function of the PUB14-BZR1 module, leading to decreased ovule initiation and seed yield. On the other site, PUB14 concurrently promotes TleB’s degradation. Our findings indicate that bacterial infections in nonhost plants directly repress offspring production. The regulatory mechanism by effectors PUB14-BZR1 is widely present, suggesting that plants may balance reproduction and defense and produce fewer offspring to conserve resources, thus enabling them to remain in a standby mode prepared for enhanced resistance.",

Although TR transcription is crucial in their life cycle, its regulation remains poorly understood. This study identifies the Mediator complex, E2F1-Dp, and Scalloped/dTEAD as key regulators of TR transcription. Reducing the activity of the Mediator or Sd/dTEAD increases TR expression and telomere length, while overexpressing E2F1-Dp or depleting Rbf1 stimulates TR transcription. The Mediator and Sd/dTEAD regulate this process through E2F1-Dp. CUT&amp;RUN (Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease) analysis shows direct binding of CDK8, Dp, and Sd/dTEAD to telomeric repeats, with motif enrichment revealing E2F- and TEAD-binding sites. These findings uncover the Mediator complex’s role in controlling TR transcription and telomere length through E2F1-Dp and Sd, coupling the transcriptional regulation of the TR life cycle with host cell-cycle machinery to protect chromosome ends in Drosophila .",

To obtain an overall picture of the structural changes associated to the collective transport, the large coherent x-ray beam generated by an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) source was used. The CDW phase can be retrieved over the entire sample from diffracted intensities using a genetic algorithm. For currents below threshold, increasing shear deformation is observed in the central part of the sample while longitudinal deformation appears above threshold when shear relaxes. Shear thus precedes longitudinal deformation, with relaxation of one leading to the appearance of the other. Moreover, strain accumulates on surface steps in the sliding regime, demonstrating the strong pinning character of these surface discontinuities.

In these settings, male mice spontaneously form social networks, with individuals occupying diverse positions. We show that a rewarded group member’s scent affects the ability of conspecifics to search for rewards in familiar and novel environments. The scent’s impact depends on the animal’s social position. Furthermore, disruption of neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex (PL) disrupts the social networks and animals’ interest in social information related to rewards; only the latter is blocked by the acute PL inhibition.

          "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant with substantial risks to human and ecosystem health. By upward transport in tropical regions, mercury enters into the stratosphere, but the contribution of the stratosphere to global mercury dispersion and deposition remains unknown. We find that between 5 and 50% (passing through the 400-kelvin isentropic surface and tropopause, respectively) of the mercury mass deposited on Earth’s surface is chemically processed in the lower stratosphere. Our results show the stratosphere as a unique chemical environment where elemental mercury is efficiently converted to long-lived oxidized species. Subsequent downward transport contributes substantially to the oxidized mercury burden in the troposphere. The results show that the stratosphere facilitates the global dispersion of large amounts of mercury from polluted source regions to Earth’s remote environments. We find that stratospheric transport is as important as tropospheric transport in interhemispheric mercury dispersion. Future projections suggest that expected changes in atmospheric circulation will increase the transport of mercury into the stratosphere.",

          "abstract": "In-plane anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have gained much interest due to their anisotropic properties, which opens avenues in designing functional electronics. Currently reported in-plane anisotropic semiconductors mainly rely on crystal lattice anisotropy. Herein, AgCrP 2 S 6 (ACPS) is introduced as a promising member to the anisotropic 2D semiconductors, in which, both crystal structure and ion-electron co-modulations are used to achieve tunable in-plane conductance anisotropy. Scanning tunneling electron microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy show the structural anisotropy of ACPS. Electrical transport measurements show that its tunable in-plane conductance anisotropy is related to the ion-electron co-modulations, where Ag ion migration is anisotropic along a axis and b axis. Electrical transport measurements show the semiconducting properties of ACPS, as also supported by photoluminescence results. Moreover, the transfer curves of ACPS showcase large V g -related hysteresis, which is directionally controlled by anisotropic Ag ion migration. This work offers a possibility of using anisotropic charge transport in functional electronics by ion-electron co-modulations.",

MPI is unique in that signal is generated entirely by synthetic nanoparticle tracers, motivating precise engineering of magnetic nanoparticle properties including size, shape, composition, and coating to address the needs of specific applications. However, success in many applications and in clinical transition requires development of high-sensitivity and high-resolution tracers, for which there is considerable room for improvement. This review summarizes recent advancements in MPI tracer synthesis and compares reported tracers in terms of sensitivity and resolution. In making these comparisons, we point out inconsistencies in reporting of MPI tracer properties. To overcome this challenge, we propose a list of properties to standardize characterization and reporting of new MPI tracers and improve communication within the field.",

The MXene fiber artificial muscles are called MFAMs. We obtained MFAMs that have high modulus in both the radial and axial directions by spinning a solution containing MXene nanosheets dispersed in an aqueous cellulose solution. We observed a highly reversible muscle contraction of 21.0% for a temperature increase from 25° to 125°C. The tensile actuation of MFAMs mainly results from reversible hydrogen bond orientation change during heating, which decreases intra-sheet spacing. The MFAMs exhibited fast, stable actuation to multiple temperature-generating stimuli, which increases their applications in smart textiles, robotic arms, and robotic grippers.",

The DOECN can synergistically promote the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), consumption of glutathione, and creation of an acidic environment, thereby amplifying the Fenton-type reaction and producing abundant reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), for augmenting the CDT outcome. The DOECN is decorated with targeting groups to achieve efficient cellular uptake and efficiently induce tumor cell apoptosis, ferroptosis, and immunogenetic cell death, thus realizing potent anticancer therapeutic effects. Intravenous injection of the DOECN effectively promoted the maturation of dendritic cells, triggered adaptive T cell responses, and suppressed tumor growth in a murine cancer model. The DOECN provides a programmable platform for the integration of multiple therapeutic components, showing great potential for combined cancer therapy.",

Temperature fluctuations, abundant in daily life, offer tremendous potential for practical thermocatalytic applications. As proof of concept, MOF materials coated onto carbon fiber fabric (MOF@CFF) created a thermocatalytic antibacterial filter.

ZIF-8 demonstrated superior H 2 O 2 generation under low-temperature differences, achieving 96% antibacterial activity through temperature variation cycles. This work advances potential in thermoelectric applications of MOFs, enabling real-time purification and disinfection through H 2 O 2 generation.

A folic acid (FA)–modified ultrasound-responsive gene/drug delivery system, assembled from DOTAP, DSPE-PEG2000-FA, cholesterol, and perfluorohexane (PFH)—termed FA-PNBs—was developed to codeliver small interfering RNA of STAT1 (siSTAT1) and the small-molecule nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO 2 ) into CD86-positive macrophages. Upon irradiation with low-intensity focused ultrasound, FA-PNBs release siSTAT1 and OA-NO 2 at the ischemic injury zone.

Following pH-induced conformational changes, they perforate the target membrane like a syringe to translocate toxic enzymes into a cell. Although this complex transformation has been structurally well studied, the reaction pathway and the resulting temporal evolution have remained elusive. We used an integrated biophysical approach to monitor prepore-to-pore transition and found a reaction time of ~30 hours for a complete transition. We show two asynchronous general steps of the process, shell opening and channel ejection, with the overall reaction pathway being a slow multistep process involving three intermediates. Liposomes, an increasingly high pH, or receptors facilitate shell opening, which is directly correlated with an increased rate of the prepore-to-pore transition. Channel ejection is a near-instantaneous process which occurs with a transition time of &lt;60 milliseconds. Understanding the mechanism of action of Tc toxins and unveiling modulators of the kinetics are key steps toward their application as biomedical devices or biopesticides.",

HCN channel activation contributes to pain perception, and propofol, a widely used anesthetic, acts as an analgesic by inhibiting the voltage-dependent activity of HCN channels. However, the molecular determinants of propofol action on HCN channels remain unknown. Here, we use a propofol-analog photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify propofol binding sites in the human HCN1 isoform. Mass spectrometry analyses combined with molecular dynamics simulations show that a binding pocket is formed by extracellularly facing residues in the S3 and S4 transmembrane segments in the resting voltage-sensor conformation. Mutations of residues within the putative binding pocket mitigate or eliminate voltage-dependent modulation of HCN1 currents by propofol. Together, these findings reveal a conformation-specific propofol binding site that underlies voltage-dependent inhibition of HCN currents and provides a framework for identifying highly specific modulators of HCN channel gating.",

However, scarce studies have investigated polaron formation in low-dimensional materials with phonon polarity and electronic structure transitions. In this work, we studied polarons of tellurene, composed of chiral Te chains. The frequency and linewidth of the A 1 phonon, which becomes increasingly polar for thinner tellurene, change abruptly for thickness below 10 nanometers, where field-effect mobility drops rapidly. These phonon and transport signatures, combined with phonon polarity and band structure, suggest a crossover from large polarons in bulk tellurium to small polarons in few-layer tellurene. Effective field theory considering phonon renormalization in the small-polaron regime semiquantitatively reproduces the phonon hardening and broadening effects. This polaron crossover stems from the quasi–one-dimensional nature of tellurene, where modulation of interchain distance reduces dielectric screening and promotes electron-phonon coupling. Our work provides valuable insights into the influence of polarons on phononic, electronic, and structural properties in low-dimensional materials.",

Combining ribosome profiling and CRISPR screening in intestinal organoids, we identify the nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) as a key mediator of this process. Our findings suggest that NAC is responsible for relocalizing ribosomes to the mitochondria and regulating ISC metabolism. Upon NAC inhibition, intestinal cells show decreased import of mitochondrial proteins, which are needed for oxidative phosphorylation, and, consequently, enable the cell to maintain a stem cell identity. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of NACα is sufficient to drive mitochondrial respiration and promote ISC identity. Ultimately, our results reveal the pivotal role of NAC in regulating ribosome localization, mitochondrial metabolism, and ISC function, providing insights into the potential mechanism behind it.",

Growth is influenced by both substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction.

Deletion of IRF2BP2 in human adipocytes increases lipolysis without affecting glucose uptake, whereas IRF2BP2 overexpression decreases lipolysis. RNA sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses show that IRF2BP2 represses lipolysis-related genes, including LIPE , which encodes hormone sensitive lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Adipocyte-selective deletion of Irf2bp2 in mice increases Lipe expression and free fatty acid levels, resulting in adipose tissue inflammation and glucose intolerance.

          "abstract": "The computational search for new stable inorganic compounds is faster than ever, thanks to high-throughput density functional theory (DFT). However, stable compound searches remain highly expensive because of the enormous search space and the cost of DFT calculations. To aid these searches, recommendation engines have been developed. We conduct a systematic comparison of the performance of previously developed recommendation engines, specifically ones based on elemental substitution, data mining, and neural network prediction of formation enthalpy. After identifying ways to improve the recommendation engines, we find the neural network to be superior at recommending stable Heusler compounds. Armed with improved recommendation engines, we identify tens of thousands of compounds that are stable at zero temperature and pressure, now available in the Open Quantum Materials Database. We summarize this diverse pool of compounds, including the elusive mixed anion compounds, and two of their many applications: thermoelectricity and solar thermochemical fuel production.",

          "abstract": "Microtubule assembly takes place at the centrosome and noncentrosomal microtubule–organizing centers (MTOCs). However, the mechanisms controlling the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs are poorly understood. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism, we demonstrate that the kinesin-14 motor Klp2 interacts with the J-domain Hsp70/Ssa1 cochaperone Rsp1, an inhibitory factor of microtubule assembly, and that Klp2 is required for the proper localization of Rsp1 to microtubules. In addition, we demonstrate that Klp2 is not required for the localization of Mto1, a factor promoting microtubule assembly, to microtubules. Moreover, Rsp1-Ssa1 inhibits the interaction of Mto1-Mto2 with the gamma-tubulin small complex. The absence of Klp2 reduces the colocalization of Rsp1 and Mto1 foci on preexisting microtubules, resulting in an increased microtubule-dependent microtubule assembly. Our results suggest that Klp2 regulates the activity of noncentrosomal MTOCs by targeting Rsp1 to the sites of Mto1 activity and reveal a mechanism for the inhibition of noncentrosomal microtubule assembly by a kinesin-14 motor.",

We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin chirality of the condensate induces the spin Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronic phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.",

To separate their contributions, we generated in the mouse auditory cortex optogenetically driven activity patterns differing exclusively along their temporal or spatial dimensions. Mice could rapidly learn to behaviorally discriminate spatial but not temporal patterns. Moreover, large-scale neuronal recordings across the auditory system revealed that the auditory cortex is the first region in which spatial patterns efficiently represent temporal cues on the timescale of several hundred milliseconds. This feature is shared by the deep layers of neural networks categorizing time-varying sounds. Therefore, the emergence of a spatial code for temporal sensory cues is a necessary condition to efficiently associate temporally structured stimuli with decisions.",

We identify P. sojae IRK1 (isoflavone-insensitive receptor kinase 1) as a receptor for genistein, with PsIRK2 functioning as a coreceptor that enhances the binding affinity of PsIRK1 to genistein and regulates chemotaxis by phosphorylating G protein α subunit. Last, we identify an antagonist, esculetin, which disrupts the PsIRK1-genistein interaction, thereby preventing P. sojae infection by repelling zoospores. Our findings reveal the mechanism by which P. sojae senses host genistein and demonstrate a strategy for disease prevention by targeting the chemoreceptor.",

After a one-time training, the virtual Gram staining model processes an axial stack of dark-field microscopy images of label-free bacteria (never seen before) to rapidly generate Gram staining, bypassing several chemical steps involved in the conventional staining process. We demonstrated the success of virtual Gram staining on label-free bacteria samples containing Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua by quantifying the staining accuracy of the model and comparing the chromatic and morphological features of the virtually stained bacteria against their chemically stained counterparts.

Here, we use a goal-oriented adaptive sampling strategy in molecular dynamics simulations followed by Markov state modeling to capture an energetically stable putative open state of the receptor. The model conducts chloride ions with comparable conductance as in electrophysiology measurements. Relative to experimental structures, our open model is relatively expanded at both the cytoplasmic (−2′) and central (9′) gates, coordinated with distinctive rearrangements at the transmembrane αβ subunit interface. Consistent with previous experiments, targeted substitutions disrupting interactions at this interface slowed the open-to-desensitized transition rate.

OsCSN5 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the E3 ligase OsPUB45. Overexpression of OsPUB45 increased resistance against M. oryzae and Xoo , while dysfunction of OsPUB45 decreased resistance. In addition, OsCSN5 stabilized OsCUL3a to promote the degradation of a positive regulator OsNPR1. Overexpression of OsPUB45 compromised accumulation of OsCUL3a, leading to stabilization of OsNPR1, whereas mutations in OsPUB45 destabilized OsNPR1. These findings suggest that OsCSN5 stabilizes OsCUL3a to facilitate the degradation of OsNPR1, preventing its constitutive activation without infection.

CL synthase (ClsA) flips its catalytic cytoplasmic domain upon depletion of PE to supply nonbilayer-prone CL in the periplasmic leaflet of the IM for cell viability. In the presence of a physiological amount of PE, osmotic down-shock induces a topological inversion of ClsA, establishing the biological relevance of membrane protein reorientations in wild-type cells.

          "abstract": "High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) requires costly 200- to 300-keV cryo–transmission electron microscopes (cryo-TEMs) with field emission gun (FEG) sources, stable columns, constant-powered lenses, autoloader, and direct electron detectors (DED). Recent advances in 100-keV imaging with the emergence of sub–200-keV optimized DED technology promises the development of more affordable cryo-TEMs. So far, 100-keV imaging has required microscopes with FEG sources. We here explored whether a standard 120-keV TEMs with thermionic lanthanum hexaboride (LaB 6 ) source can be upgraded with a sub–200-keV DED for high-resolution cryo-EM. Using this imaging configuration, we successfully obtained a 2.65 Å reconstruction for apoferritin, 4.33 Å for 64-kDa hemoglobin, and 4.4 Å for an asymmetric 153kDa membrane protein GPCR. All results were achieved using standard automated data collection with SerialEM, demonstrating the feasibility to collect large cryo-EM datasets with a side-entry cryo-holder. These results showcase a widely accessible solution to obtaining interpretable cryo-EM structures at low cost and contribute to the “democratization” of cryo-EM.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and emerging quantum technologies rely on the spin transfer in electron-nuclear hybrid quantum systems. Spin transfers might be suppressed by larger couplings, e.g., hyperfine couplings suppressing nuclear dipolar flip-flops (”spin diffusion barrier”). We apply the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to a two-electron two-nucleus spin system involving dipolar and hyperfine couplings in their tensorial form and study possible polarization-transfer processes. Among the different effective Hamiltonian matrix elements investigated is an energy-conserving electron-nuclear four-spin flip-flop, which combines an electronic with a nuclear dipolar flip-flop. The relevance of this electron-nuclear four-spin flip-flop for nuclear spin diffusion close to electrons is supported by model fits of HypRes-on experimental data. We connect the closely related fields of magnetic resonance and quantum information and provide a model that explains how all nuclear spins can contribute to the hyperpolarization of the bulk without a spin diffusion barrier in DNP.",

          "abstract": "The transition from simple to complex multicellularity involves division of labor and specialization of cell types. In animals, complex sensory-motor systems are primarily built around specialized cells of muscles and neurons, though the evolutionary origins of these and their integration remain unclear. Here, to investigate sensory-behavior coupling in the closest relatives of animals, we established a line of the choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca rosetta, which stably expresses the calcium indicator RGECO1. Using this, we identify a previously unknown cellular behavior associated with electrical signaling, in which ciliary arrest is coupled with apical-basal contraction of the cell. This behavior and the associated calcium transients are synchronized in the multicellular state and result in coordinated ciliary arrest and colony-wide contraction, suggesting that information is spread among the cells. Our work reveals fundamental insights into how choanoflagellates sense and respond to their environment and enhances our understanding of the integration of cellular and organism-wide behavior in the closest protistan relatives of animals.",

          "abstract": "Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of many viral infections, leading to substantial accumulation of lactate. However, the regulatory roles of lactate during viral infections remain poorly understood. Here, we report that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection leverages lactate to induce widespread protein lactylation and promote viral spread. We establish that lactyllysine is enriched in intrinsically disordered regions, regulating viral protein condensates and immune signaling transduction. Dynamic lactylation of immune factors suppresses immunity, a feature we show to be shared for HCMV and herpes simplex virus 1 infections, through regulation of RNA binding protein 14 and interferon-γ–inducible protein 16 (IFI16). K90 lactylation of the viral DNA sensor IFI16 inhibits recruitment of the DNA damage response kinase DNA-PK, preventing IFI16-driven virus gene repression and cytokine induction. Together, we characterize global protein lactylation dynamics during virus infection, finding that virus-induced lactate contributes to its immune evasion through direct inhibition of immune signaling pathways.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is commonly used to study the brain or as a treatment for neurological disorders, but the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms it affects remain unclear. To determine the molecular mechanisms of rTMS and the brain regions they occur in, we used spatial transcriptomics to map changes to gene expression across the mouse brain in response to two commonly used rTMS protocols. Our results revealed that rTMS alters the expression of genes related to several cellular processes and neural plasticity mechanisms across the brain, which was both brain region– and rTMS protocol–dependent. In the cortex, the effect of rTMS was dependent not only on the cortical region but also on each cortical layer. These findings uncover the diverse molecular mechanisms induced by rTMS, which will be useful in interpreting its effects on cortical and subcortical circuits.",

          "abstract": "Neuromuscular abnormality is the leading cause of disability in adults. Understanding the complex interplay between muscle structure and function is crucial for effective treatment and rehabilitation. However, the substantial deformation of muscles during movement (up to 40%) poses challenges for accurate assessment. To address this, we developed a wearable structural-functional sensing patch (WSFP) that enables synchronous analysis of muscle structure and function. The WSFP incorporates a soft, stretchable electrode array for high-performance electrophysiological monitoring with low contact impedance and high stability. Its innovative design absorbs skin deformation stress, ensuring stable adhesion of a flexible ultrasound transducer array, offering higher-fidelity imaging. With dynamic tissue imaging, it allows real-time visualization of muscle structure. The WSFP achieves superior accuracy in dynamic action recognition and disease assessment compared to single-modal methods, maintaining stable operation during motion for up to 72 hours. This study advances neuromuscular system analysis and improves diagnostic precision.",

          "abstract": "Microbial rhodopsin–derived genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are powerful tools for mapping bioelectrical dynamics in cell culture and in live animals. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)–opsin GEVIs use voltage-dependent quenching of an attached fluorophore, achieving high brightness, speed, and voltage sensitivity. However, the voltage sensitivity of most FRET-opsin GEVIs has been reported to decrease or vanish under two-photon (2P) excitation. Here, we investigated the photophysics of the FRET-opsin GEVIs Voltron1 and Voltron2. We found that the previously reported negative-going voltage sensitivities of both GEVIs came from photocycle intermediates, not from the opsin ground states. The voltage sensitivities of both GEVIs were nonlinear functions of illumination intensity; for Voltron1, the sensitivity reversed the sign under low-intensity illumination. Using photocycle-optimized 2P illumination protocols, we demonstrate 2P voltage imaging with Voltron2 in the barrel cortex of a live mouse. These results open the door to high-speed 2P voltage imaging of FRET-opsin GEVIs in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Animals requiring purposeful movement for survival are endowed with mechanoreceptors, called proprioceptors, that provide essential sensory feedback from muscles and joints to spinal cord circuits, which modulates motor output. Despite the essential nature of proprioceptive signaling in daily life, the mechanisms governing proprioceptor activity are poorly understood. Here, we identified nonredundant roles for two voltage-gated sodium channels (Na V s), Na V 1.1 and Na V 1.6, in mammalian proprioception. Deletion of Na V 1.6 in somatosensory neurons (Na V 1.6 cKO mice) causes severe motor deficits accompanied by loss of proprioceptive transmission, which contrasts with our previous findings using similar mouse models to target Na V 1.1 (Na V 1.1 cKO ). In Na V 1.6 cKO animals, we observed impairments in proprioceptor end-organ structure and a marked reduction in skeletal muscle myofiber size that were absent in Na V 1.1 cKO mice. We attribute the differential contributions of Na V 1.1 and Na V 1.6 to distinct cellular localization patterns. Collectively, we provide evidence that Na V s uniquely shape neural signaling within a somatosensory modality.",

          "abstract": "How much economic support governments offered to households during the Covid-19 pandemic differed considerably across rich democracies. What explains this variation? We argue that institutional structures of welfare and credit regimes shape households’ abilities to address income shortfalls and, as a result, governments’ policy repertoire during crises. In countries with permissive credit regimes, economic support policies were more comprehensive when social policies were limited. Governments not only provided income support but also debt relief to shield households from default risks due to high pre-crisis debt leverage. Yet those countries ceased income support sooner as credit resumed its substitutive role vis-à-vis the welfare state. We provide evidence for our argument by examining pandemic policies from five OECD countries that vary in their social policies, credit access and household indebtedness. Our findings suggest that the privatization of risks imposes financial burdens on households that constrain governments’ policy responses in times of crisis.",

By acknowledging the importance of fictional expectations in the creation of economic value, this study addresses the question: How is the value of crypto imagined? Through quantitative and qualitative coding of 1921 YouTube video transcripts, combined with Exploratory Factor Analysis, this article maps out the sociotechnical imaginaries that attribute value to crypto, that are being disseminated on YouTube. This study identifies four distinct imaginaries that project a value on cryptocurrency: investment, utility, digital metallism, and infrastructural mutualism imaginary.

We ask when and why advanced capitalist democracies make such change, testing functionalist, power resource and institutional explanations. The article looks at the cases of UK and Germany (which introduced a national minimum wage) and Italy (which have started discussing it), against the background of Sweden, which, like other countries, refuse to do so. In doing so, we identify some conditions and contributing factors that allow to better understand how institutional legacies affect shifts in regulatory approaches to wage setting, and draw some implications for labour market policies, especially in the particularly open Italian case.",
