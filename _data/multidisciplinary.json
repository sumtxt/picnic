          "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the association of lockdowns with adverse birth and pregnancy outcomes (ABPOs) and related inequalities, in high-income countries (HICs). Databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science) were searched from 1 January 2019 to 22 June 2023 for original observational studies based in HICs that compared the rates of ABPOs, before and during lockdowns. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa tool for cohort studies. We ran random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses per region, lockdown period, ethnicity group and deprivation level and adjusted for underlying temporal trends. A total of 132 studies were meta-analysed from 28 HICs. Reduced rates of preterm birth (reported by 26 studies) were associated with the first lockdown (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.93–0.99), 11 studies adjusted for long-term trends and the association remained (0.97, 0.95–0.99), and subgroup analysis found that this association varied by continental region. Ten studies reported positive screening rates for possible depression antenatally, and lockdown was associated with increases in positive screening rates (1.37, 1.06–1.78). No other ABPOs were associated with lockdowns. Investigation of inequalities was limited due to data availability and heterogeneity; further research is warranted on the effect of lockdowns on health inequalities. This study was funded by the National Institute of Health Research, School of Primary Care Research and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022327448).",

          "abstract": "Increasing educational attainment is one of the most important and effective strategies for health and economic improvements. The extent to which extreme climate events disrupt education, resulting in reduced educational attainment, remains understudied. Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be uniquely vulnerable to losing schooling after disasters due to the poor physical condition of schools and the lack of resources to mitigate unexpected household shocks. Our analysis assesses this overlooked social cost of tropical cyclones on schooling attainment. We study the education records of nearly 5.4 million individuals living in 13 LMICs that experienced tropical cyclones between 1954 and 2010. By comparing individuals living in the same locations but with different exposure levels, we estimate the change in the likelihood that a preschool-age child exposed to tropical cyclone received no schooling. We find that exposure during preschool age is associated with a 0.5 percentage point increase in the likelihood of never attending schooling (2.5% above baseline), with larger effects (up to 8.8% increase) from stronger storms. These effects are more pronounced among girls and are greater in areas less adapted to tropical cyclones. Between 2000 and 2020, we estimate that 79,000 children in the 13 study countries did not start school due to tropical cyclones, and, across all affected students, tropical cyclones resulted in a total loss of 1.1 My of school. These impacts, identified among some of the world’s poorest populations, may grow in importance as exposure to severe tropical cyclones is projected to increase with climate change.",

          "authors": "Alon Burns, Sharon Toker, Yair Berson, Ilanit Gordon",
          "abstract": "In a world where teams serve as the backbone of collaboration and innovation, women must feel safe when contributing to teamwork. Unfortunately, an increasing number of women report experiencing sexual harassment in workplaces and other collective settings. This research included an examination of how exposure to sexist insults affects collaborative efforts. We argue that in addition to its well-documented effects on individuals, sexism within teams undermines team performance. Hence, emotional synchrony—temporally coordinated emotional facial expressions between individuals—loses its ability to enhance collaboration when team members are exposed to sexism. Under the threat of sexist comments, emotional synchrony signals social bonding rather than focusing team members on performance goals. To test this theory, 177 woman dyads interacting on a video-conferencing platform received instructions for a cooperative task with/without sexist comments from an actor-experimenter in sexism/control conditions. Emotional synchrony was assessed through temporal alignment in facial expressions between dyad members and was correlated with team performance. Our findings revealed a significant increase in facial expressive synchrony among teams in the sexism condition. Whereas facial expressive synchrony predicted better performance in the control condition, its classic positive effects on team performance vanished under sexism. These results suggest that exposure to sexism, while enhancing social cohesion, eliminates the benefits of emotional synchrony, which is considered the social glue of collective action. These findings suggest that zero-tolerance policies for sexual harassment are not only more ethical but can also promote effective teamwork.",

Our estimates closely match high-quality measures of migration where available but can be produced nearly worldwide and with less delay than alternative methods. We estimate that 39.1 million people migrated internationally in 2022 (0.63% of the population of the countries in our sample). Migration flows significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing by 64% before rebounding in 2022 to a pace 24% above the precrisis rate.

In nature, selection produces not only divergence but also convergence when organisms experience similar selective pressures. Whether artificial selection during domestication also produces convergence has received little attention. Three-dimensional shape analysis of domestic cat and dog skulls demonstrated convergence at multiple levels. Most broadly, cats and dogs have both diversified greatly: equaling or exceeding the morphological disparity among all modern-day species of their respective families. Moreover, as a result of artificial selection, some breeds of these two phenotypically distinct species, evolutionarily separated for 50 My, have converged to such an extreme extent that they are more similar to each other than they are to many members of their own species or their ancestors, a phenomenon never previously observed in domesticated species. Remarkably, this convergence evolved not only between dogs and cats but also multiple times within each taxon.",

Systematic characterization of nonchiral donor–acceptor systems (TP-BPEA, TP-Fluo, etc.) reveals the absence of ground-state chiral centers ( g CD ≈ 0) and orientation artifacts ( LD &lt; 10 −7 ), confirming the key role of cholesteric liquid crystal polymer in chirality induction.

          "abstract": "Homeostatic regulation ensures stable neural circuit output under changing conditions. We find that in Drosophila larvae, either presynaptic weakening due to perturbation of transmitter release or postsynaptic weakening due to perturbation of glutamate receptors at synapses between motor neuron (MN) and muscle has little impact on locomotion, suggesting a nonsynaptic compensatory mechanism. In vivo imaging shows that five different forms of synaptic weakening increase the duration of activity bouts in type I MNs. Strikingly, this compensation is input selective: occurring only in the tonic type Ib MN, not the phasic type Is MN that innervates the same muscle. Moreover, an inhibitory class of central pre-MNs that innervates the tonic—but not phasic—input decreases in activity. The adjustment in activity occurs remarkably quickly: within minutes of synapse perturbation. We propose that MN firing is dynamically regulated by two coordinated mechanisms: a cell-autonomous adjustment of MN excitability and a circuit adjustment of inhibitory central drive. The input selectivity of this process suggests homeostatic adjustment to maintain tonic drive but hold constant the phasic drive that organizes locomotory wave patterns.",

          "abstract": "Carbonaceous particles are widespread in combustion, atmospheric, extraterrestrial, and nanomaterials environments. Resonance-stabilized radicals (RSRs) are commonly identified in fuel combustion and pyrolysis processes and play an essential role in carbonaceous particle formation. Despite their importance, comprehensive experimental and mechanistic understanding of particle inception through RSR reactions is lacking. This work investigated particle size distribution, chemical composition, and thermal behavior of soot particles generated by the flow reactor pyrolysis reactions of typical RSRs, in particular, 1-indenyl, 1-methylnaphthyl, and 2-methylnaphthyl radicals, and by the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons with a variety of structures. Particle size distributions show soot particles with mobility diameters in an incipient-particle range of 1.3 to 1.6 nm. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry results suggest that soot products consist of much larger covalently bound clusters (CBCs) than those observed in the gas phase. Under our experimental conditions, the CBCs exhibit a phase transition for particles with calculated molecular diameters of around 1.5 nm. Evaporation experiments and thermogravimetric analysis of the soot products reveal distinct thermal characteristics for small and large CBCs. These results implicate CBCs as bridges between gas-phase species and soot particles. The present work provides a soot-inception mechanism called RSR clustering (RSRC) that is characterized by the reactive clustering of RSRs. The RSRC mechanism contrasts with conventional soot formation models that attribute soot inception primarily to the aggregation of large-size polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

We also describe a coupling mechanism that links pi-helical transition and pore opening to the Ca 2+ -induced conformational changes in TMEM16A. Furthermore, we designed a pi-helix-stabilizing mutation (I551P) that facilitates TMEM16A activation, revealing atomistic details of the ion-conduction mechanism.

End-to-end aggregation then assembles these duplexes into columns and columnar phases are stabilized, in spite of breaks in the double helix every four bases. But the new degrees of freedom introduced by such breaks also enable opportunities for a more diverse palette of self-assembly modes, producing striking self-assemblies of DNA that would not be achievable with contiguous polymers. These include recently reported three-dimensional (3D) periodic low-density nanoscale networks of GCCG, and the twist grain boundary (TGB) phase presented here. In the TGB, columns of GTAC pairs assemble into monolayer sheets in which the duplex columns are mutually parallel. However, unlike in the columnar crystals, these sheets stack in helical fashion into lamellar arrays in which the column axis of each layer is rotated through a 60° angle with respect to the columns in neighboring layers. This assembly of DNA is unique in that it the fills a 3D volume wherein the major grooves of columns in each layer mutually enter and interlock with the major grooves of columns in neighboring layers. This locking is optimized by small adjustments in structure enabled by the breaks in the duplex backbones.",

By using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice as a model system, we observed that DC progenitors skewed away from pDC and toward cDC development during in vivo viral infection. Subsequent characterization of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 + (Flt3 + ) DC progenitors and follow-up studies revealed increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation in different individual DC-progenitors as well as a profound type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent ablation of pre-pDCs, but not pre-DC precursors, after both acute and chronic LCMV infections. In addition, integrated genomic analysis identified altered activity of 34 transcription factors in Flt3 + DC progenitors from infected mice, including two regulators of Glucocorticoid (GC) responses. Subsequent studies demonstrated that addition of GCs to DC progenitors led to downregulated pDC-primed-genes while upregulating cDC-primed-genes, and that endogenous GCs selectively decreased pDC, but not cDC, numbers upon in vivo LCMV infection. These findings demonstrate a significant ablation of pre-pDCs in infected mice and identify GCs as suppressors of pDC generation from early progenitors. This provides a potential explanation for the impaired pDC development following viral infection and links pDC numbers to the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.",

Recent studies have revealed that in addition to its role as a negative regulator of G-protein signaling through its GAP enzymatic activity, SYNGAP1 plays an important structural role through its interaction with postsynaptic density proteins. Here, we reveal that intrinsic excitability deficits and seizure phenotypes in heterozygous Syngap1 knockout (KO) mice are differentially dependent on Syngap1 GAP activity. Cortical excitatory neurons in heterozygous KO mice displayed reduced intrinsic excitability, including lower input resistance, and increased rheobase, a phenotype recapitulated in GAP-deficient Syngap1 mutants. However, seizure severity and susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures were significantly elevated in heterozygous KO mice but unaffected in GAP-deficient mutants, implicating the structural rather than enzymatic role of Syngap1 in seizure regulation.

Yet, convergent evolution means that evolutionary distinct lineages can share similar characteristics when subjected to similar environmental conditions. The ecological convergence of distinct regions has been demonstrated in terrestrial communities, but it remains uncertain if marine systems exhibit similar patterns, given the greater ease of dispersal in the ocean. Using information on the dietary preferences of marine vertebrates, we develop an ocean regionalization that groups regions with similar trophic communities, describing how species are organized into trophic guilds and how guilds overlap with one another. Six types of trophic communities emerge globally, largely explained by temperature, productivity, and depth. Regions with analogous environments support similar numbers of species with analogous feeding strategies, even if the species do not share the same evolutionary origins. These findings support the notion that independently evolving sets of marine species can converge into functionally analogous trophic communities when exposed to similar environmental conditions.

This large-scale shale gas development is challenged by constraints on water supply. It requires over 6,000 new wells to be drilled within the Yangtze River Basin in South China—one of China’s most populated regions with sensitive ecological and geological conditions, posing significant environmental threats to the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. Hydraulic fracturing-induced seismicity also adds to the existing earthquake risk for the Sichuan/Chongqing region. These potential negative impacts challenge both China’s and the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. We explore China’s current shale gas operations in the Yangtze River Basin and their interaction with the environment from these multiple perspectives. We then suggest future improvements to practice that will promote sustainable development to jointly satisfy China’s burgeoning energy needs. We conclude that China’s shale gas industry would benefit from an innovation ecosystem that involves companies and research institutions, and that there is an urgent need to implement environmental regulations for shale gas extraction.",

          "abstract": "Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a pregnancy-related condition characterized by a complex etiology. While placental trophoblast dysfunction is strongly associated with the development and progression of RSA, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of MYB Proto-Oncogene Like 2 (MYBL2) in the villous tissue of patients with RSA and the placentas of abortion-prone (AP) mice. Utilizing human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs), we identified MYBL2 as a critical regulator of hTSCs stemness maintenance, promoting the expression of the stemness-associated genes Tumor protein p63 (TP63) and TEA Domain Transcription Factor 4 (TEAD4). Furthermore, MYBL2 facilitates the differentiation of hTSCs into extravillous trophoblast (EVT) by positively regulating Ajuba LIM Protein (AJUBA) expression. Using HTR-8/SVneo cell line, an immortalized EVT-like model, we found that MYBL2 positively regulates AJUBA expression by binding to the distal region of the AJUBA promoter. Additionally, the MYBL2–AJUBA axis enhances the migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells by suppressing the Hippo signaling pathway. Our study indicates that the dysregulation of MYBL2 expression in placental trophoblasts is associated with the pathogenesis of RSA, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this condition.",

          "abstract": "The transient excitonic condensate is a nonequilibrium electron–hole Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer state in a photoexcited semiconductor and semimetal, where electron–hole pairs undergo a phase transition and condense into a single coherent quantum state. Despite numerous experimental works to realize the predicted excitonic condensation phase, experimental evidence still remains elusive. This is largely due to the absence of direct measurements of a material’s transient momentum-dependent electronic structure and the excitonic state in the condensation regime. Here, using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find direct evidence of a transient excitonic condensate in the spin-polarized spatially indirect excitonic topological states in Bi 2 Te 3 . Accompanying the formation of the excitonic topological states by photoexcitation, we reveal a splitting of the hole’s and electron’s quasi-equilibrium chemical potential followed by the band flattening and backbending of the transient topological surface state. Moreover, within the same momentum range, we report a reshaping of the bulk valence band in the form of a Mexican-hat-like Bogoliubov dispersion—hallmarks of the excitonic condensation, followed by the opening of an energy gap at the Fermi level. The fluence and temperature dependence of these renormalization effects are reminiscent of excitonic condensation within Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS)-like behavior. These results, together with theoretical simulation, point to the possible formation of a transient excitonic condensate and provide opportunities to manipulate topologically protected Bose condensates with light.",

          "abstract": "For over four decades, our understanding of cellular actin dynamics has been guided by the concept of treadmilling. However, this paradigm has been challenged by the evidence that twinfilin can uncap and promote depolymerization of filament barbed ends, though its precise mechanism remains debated. Using single-molecule microscopy and microfluidics-assisted TIRF imaging, we demonstrate that twinfilin transiently associates with barbed ends for ~0.2 to 0.5 s, acting as a nonprocessive depolymerase that likely removes one or both terminal actin subunits. Furthermore, we show that twinfilin’s barbed-end residence time and its ability to uncap CP-capped filaments (both alone and with formin mDia1) are significantly influenced by filament age. The synergistic enhancement in uncapping by twinfilin and mDia1 ranges from 11-fold for newly assembled to ~318-fold for aged actin filaments. These represent the fastest uncapping rates measured in vitro and approach CP turnover rates in vivo. Our study thus reinforces twinfilin’s central role as a multifunctional barbed-end regulator which nonprocessively depolymerizes actin filaments, transiently caps barbed ends, and synergizes with formin to destabilize CP, thereby facilitating rapid actin turnover that depends on filament age.",

          "abstract": "Animals often exhibit increased aggression in response to starvation, while parasites often manipulate host behavior. In contrast, underlying molecular mechanisms for these behavioral changes are mostly unknown. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella , is an agricultural pest that feeds on cruciferous plants as larvae, while Cotesia vestalis is a parasitoid wasp that parasitizes diamondback moth larvae. In this study, we determined that unparasitized diamondback moth larvae exhibit increased aggression and cannibalism when starved, while starved larvae parasitized by C. vestalis were more aggressive than unparasitized larvae. C. vestalis harbors a domesticated endogenized virus named Cotesia vestalis bracovirus (CvBV) that wasps inject into parasitized hosts. Starvation increased octopamine (OA) levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of diamondback moth larvae while a series of experiments identified a CvBV-encoded gene product named Assailant that further increased aggression in starved diamondback moth larvae. We determined that Assailant increases OA levels by activating tyramine beta-hydroxylase ( PxTβh ), which is a key enzyme in the OA biosynthesis pathway. Ectopic expression of assailant in Drosophila melanogaster likewise upregulated expression of DmTβh and OA, which increased aggressive behavior in male flies as measured by a well-established assay. While parasitized hosts are often thought to be at a competitive disadvantage to nonparasitized individuals, our results uncover how a parasitoid uses an endogenized virus to increase host aggression and enhance survival of offspring when competing against unparasitized hosts.",

          "abstract": "The extinction of conditioned fear responses is crucial for adaptive behavior, and its impairment is a hallmark of anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Fear extinction takes place when animals form a new memory that suppresses the original fear memory. In the case of context-dependent fear memory, the new memory is formed within the reward-responding posterior subset of basolateral amygdala (BLA) that is genetically marked by Ppp1r1b + neurons. These memory engram cells suppress the activity of the original fear-responding Rspo2 + engram cells present in the anterior BLA, hence fear extinction. However, the neurological nature of the teaching signal that instructs the formation of fear extinction memory in the Ppp1r1b + neurons is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic signaling drives fear extinction in distinct BLA neuronal populations. We show that BLA fear and extinction neuronal populations receive topographically divergent inputs from VTA dopaminergic neurons via differentially expressed dopamine receptors. Fiber photometry recordings of dopaminergic activity in the BLA reveal that dopamine (DA) activity is time-locked to freezing cessation in BLA fear extinction neurons, but not BLA fear neurons. Furthermore, this dopaminergic activity in BLA fear extinction neurons correlates with extinction learning. Finally, using projection-specific optogenetic manipulation, we find that activation of the VTA DA projections to BLA reward and fear neurons accelerated or impaired fear extinction, respectively. Together, this work demonstrates that dopaminergic activity bidirectionally controls fear extinction by distinct patterns of activity at BLA fear and extinction neurons.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic elastography uses an imaging system to visualize the propagation of elastic waves, the speed of which is directly related to the elasticity felt by palpation. Very few studies have focused on X-ray elastography because of the technical challenges it poses: a planar image of an integration volume at a very slow sampling rate. We demonstrate that tracking a slow elastic wave guided along a one-dimensional structure could provide a possible solution. The recently discovered flexural pulse wave, which is naturally generated by heartbeats and propagates along arteries, is the perfect candidate for X-ray elastography. As it reflects the cardiovascular health of patients, arterial elasticity is a biomarker of high clinical interest. We first validate the method by measuring the elasticity in artery phantoms using X-ray. We then move on to data obtained in vivo on coronary arteries during a routine angiography examination. During coronary angiography, a catheter is used to inject an X-ray contrast dye into the patient’s aorta. X-rays are then taken as the dye spreads through the coronary arteries. It shows the movement of the coronary arteries for a few seconds and provides an opportunity to follow the natural flexural pulse waves. The obtained Young’s moduli for two patients are E = 38 ± 30 kPa and E = 38 ± 28 kPa, respectively. These preliminary results are expected to pave the way for X-ray elastography.",

Interestingly, we observe a simplex compression phenomenon in NC, where the geometric size of the simplex ETF reduces under adversarial training, with the degree of compression increasing as the perturbation radius grows.

          "abstract": "Tau forms fibrillar aggregates that are pathological hallmarks of a family of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. The synthetic replication of disease-specific fibril structures is a critical gap for developing diagnostic and therapeutic tools. This study debuts a strategy of identifying a critical and minimal folding motif in fibrils characteristic of tauopathies and generating seeding-competent fibrils from the isolated tau peptides. The 19-residue jR2R3 peptide (295 to 313) which spans the R2/R3 splice junction of tau, and includes the P301L mutation, is one such peptide that forms prion-competent fibrils. This tau fragment contains the hydrophobic VQIVYK hexapeptide that is part of the core of all known pathological tau fibril structures and an intramolecular counterstrand that stabilizes the strand–loop–strand (SLS) motif observed in 4R tauopathy fibrils. This study shows that P301L exhibits a duality of effects: it lowers the barrier for the peptide to adopt aggregation-prone conformations and enhances the local structuring of water around the mutation site to facilitate site-directed pinning and dewetting around sites 300-301 to achieve in-register stacking of tau to cross β-sheets. We solved a 3 Å cryo-EM structure of jR2R3-P301L fibrils in which each protofilament layer contains two jR2R3-P301L copies, of which one adopts a SLS fold found in 4R tauopathies and the other wraps around the SLS fold to stabilize it, reminiscent of the three- and fourfold structures observed in 4R tauopathies. These jR2R3-P301L fibrils are competent to template full-length 4R tau in a prion-like manner.",

          "abstract": "In eukaryotes, the expression of specific genes is regulated by a combination of transcription factors (TFs) bound on regulatory regions of the genomic DNA (promoters and enhancers). Recent advances in genomic sequencing technology have enabled the measurements of TFs’ footprints and binding affinities on DNA at the single-molecule level, facilitating the probing of binding cooperativity among adjacent TFs. This necessitates quantitative descriptions of TFs’ binding cooperativity and understanding of its potential functional relevance. In this study, we show that the binding cooperativities between two adjacent TFs can be quantified by the γ coefficient, which can be experimentally determined. Under thermodynamic equilibrium, the binding affinities of two TFs can either increase together (positive cooperativity) or decrease together (negative cooperativity), but not in opposing directions (one increases while the other decreases). Within the framework of thermodynamics, we investigate the functional relevance of cooperativity. The functional relevance of positive cooperativity, which has been extensively discussed in the literature, is the sigmoidal binding curve around a TF concentration threshold (analogous to oxygen binding to hemoglobin), whereas the functional relevance of negative cooperativity is twofold. First, mutual exclusion of the two TFs enables bidirectional gene switching, akin to the CI-Cro system in phage λ . Second, while TFs often exhibit intranuclear concentration fluctuations, negative binding cooperativity assures fast TF dissociation from DNA and hence rapid response for gene expression regulation. Furthermore, the nonequilibrium steady states of living cells can lead to either positive or negative cooperativity, which can also be quantified by the γ coefficient.",

Currently, to limit these effects, frequent replacements of these devices are necessary, resulting in a significant reduction in patients’ quality of life and an increase in healthcare costs. To address these challenges, by leveraging recent advancements in robotics and microfluidic technologies, we envision a self-cleaning system for indwelling medical devices equipped with bioinspired ultrasound-activated cilia. These cilia could be regularly activated transcutaneously by ultrasound, generating steady streaming, which can be used to remove encrusted deposits. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the generated streaming can efficiently remove encrustations and biofilm from surfaces. To this end, we developed a microfluidic model featuring ultrasound-activated cilia on its wall. We showed that upon ultrasound activation, the cilia generated intense, steady streaming, reaching fluid velocity up to 10 mm/s. In all our experiments, this mechanism was able to efficiently clean typical encrustation (calcium carbonate and oxalate) and biofilm found in urological devices. The generated shear forces released, broke apart, and flushed away encrusted deposits. These findings suggest a broad potential for ultrasound-activated cilia in the maintenance of various medical devices. Compared to existing methods, our approach could reduce the need for invasive procedures, potentially lowering infection risks and enhancing patient comfort.",

In this study, we use live-cell fluorescence microscopy to investigate the propagation of the broad host range RP4 conjugative plasmid in Escherichia coli populations exhibiting varying levels of spatial organization. In high-density, two-dimensional cell monolayers, direct and tight contact between donors and recipients is not only necessary but also sufficient to trigger RP4 plasmid transfer, ensuring optimal plasmid propagation. In three-dimensional mature biofilms, the emergent community architecture limits the ability of donor cells to enter regions with high cell density, which hinders the establishment of direct contacts with recipients and impedes plasmid transfer in biofilms. In contrast, microcolonies, early-stage biofilms, and biofilms with a lower surface coverage leave open access points for donor cells in regions that later emerge as high-cell-density regions in mature biofilms, which facilitates plasmid transfer.

Genetically inherited defects in motile cilia cause PCD, a debilitating respiratory disease for which there is no approved therapy. The dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1) protein is a key structural element of the ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) critical for normal ciliary activity and subsequent clearance of mucus from the conducting airways in humans. Loss-of-function mutations in DNAI1 account for up to 10% of all PCD cases, with functional abnormalities in patients presenting at or near birth and leading to a life-long course of disability, including progressive loss of lung function and bronchiectasis by adulthood. This underscores the significant unmet need for disease-modifying treatments that restore ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance in PCD patients. In this work, we demonstrate that lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated human DNAI1 mRNA can be delivered as an aerosol to primary human bronchial epithelial cell models and to nonhuman primate (NHP) lungs. Additionally, we show that delivery of aerosolized LNP- DNAI1 mRNA to NHPs leads to detectable levels of newly translated human DNAI1 protein, at doses that overlap with exposures in an in vitro cell-based PCD model enabling rescue of ciliary function. Therefore, these data support further development of the inhaled DNAI1 mRNA therapy in clinical studies as a potential disease-modifying treatment for PCD.",

          "abstract": "Site-one protease (S1P) carries out the first proteolytic step to activate membrane-bound effector proteins in the Golgi. S1P matures through an autocatalytic process that begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and culminates with the displacement of its inhibitory pro-domain by its cofactor, sterol regulatory element binding protein-regulating gene (SPRING). Spatial control of S1P activity and substrate localization underpins signaling pathways governing, among others, lipogenesis, ER stress, and lysosome biogenesis. The factors governing these pathways are activated by S1P-mediated proteolysis upon their regulated transport from the ER to the Golgi. S1P cleaves substrates with the recognition sequence RX(L/I/V)Z, where X is any residue other than Cys or Pro and Z is preferably Leu or Lys. However, the structural basis for substrate recognition by S1P has remained unknown. Here, we used the small molecule PF-429242, a competitive inhibitor of S1P, to investigate substrate recognition by the S1P/SPRING complex. We determined the structure of S1P/SPRING bound to PF-429242 and found that PF-429242 binds S1P in the same pocket that recognizes the substrate’s conserved P 4 Arg. Further structural analysis suggests that S1P requires a conformation change to accommodate the substrate’s P 2 (L/I/V) residue. We designed an S1P mutation (I308A) to reduce the steric clash at the P 2 position and generated an S1P that was resistant to PF-429242 in biochemical and cell culture assays. Our findings reveal selectivity in the recognition of substrates by S1P and provide a roadmap for the rational design of improved S1P inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "Clownfishes (Amphiprioninae) are a fascinating example of a marine radiation. From a central Pacific ancestor, they quickly colonized the coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific and diversified independently on each side of the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Their association with sea anemones has been proposed to be a key innovation that enabled the clownfish radiation. However, this intuition has little empirical or theoretical support given our current knowledge of the group. To date, no ecological variable has been identified to explain clownfish niche partitioning, phenotypic evolution, species co-occurrence, and thus, the adaptive aspect of the group’s radiation. Our study solves this long-standing mystery by testing the influence of sea anemone host use on phenotypic divergence. We provide a major revision of the known clownfish-sea anemone host associations, accounting for the biologically relevant aspects of host associations. We gathered whole-genome data for all 28 clownfish species and reconstructed a fully supported species tree for the Amphiprioninae. Integrating this data into comparative genomic approaches, we demonstrate that the host sea anemones are the drivers of convergent evolution in clownfish color pattern and morphology. During the diversification of this group, clownfishes in different regions that associate with the same hosts have evolved similar phenotypes. Comparative genomics also reveals several genes under convergent positive selection linked to host specialization events. Our findings reveal that the sea anemone host plays a crucial role in driving clownfish diversification. This highlights how a strong mutualistic interaction can promote the diversification of entire clades by influencing their phenotypes, defining their geographic distribution, and ultimately contributing to their evolutionary and ecological success.",

          "abstract": "Efficient behavior is supported by humans’ ability to rapidly recognize acoustically distinct sounds as members of a common category. Within the auditory cortex, critical unanswered questions remain regarding the organization and dynamics of sound categorization. We performed intracerebral recordings during epilepsy surgery evaluation as 20 patient-participants listened to natural sounds. We then built encoding models to predict neural responses using sound representations extracted from different layers within a deep neural network (DNN) pretrained to categorize sounds from acoustics. This approach yielded accurate models of neural responses throughout the auditory cortex. The complexity of a cortical site’s representation (measured by the depth of the DNN layer that produced the best model) was closely related to its anatomical location, with shallow, middle, and deep layers associated with core (primary auditory cortex), lateral belt, and parabelt regions, respectively. Smoothly varying gradients of representational complexity existed within these regions, with complexity increasing along a posteromedial-to-anterolateral direction in core and lateral belt and along posterior-to-anterior and dorsal-to-ventral dimensions in parabelt. We then characterized the time (relative to sound onset) when feature representations emerged; this measure of temporal dynamics increased across the auditory hierarchy. Finally, we found separable effects of region and temporal dynamics on representational complexity: sites that took longer to begin encoding stimulus features had higher representational complexity independent of region, and downstream regions encoded more complex features independent of temporal dynamics. These findings suggest that hierarchies of timescales and complexity represent a functional organizational principle of the auditory stream underlying our ability to rapidly categorize sounds.",

The process by which TEs become coopted remains obscure because most cases involve ancient, transpositionally inactive elements. Reports of active TEs serving beneficial functions are scarce and often contentious due to difficulties in manipulating repetitive sequences. Here, we show that recently active TEs in zebrafish encode products critical for embryonic development. Knockdown and rescue experiments demonstrate that the endogenous retrovirus family BHIKHARI-1 (Bik-1) encodes a Gag protein essential for mesoderm development. Mechanistically, Bik-1 Gag associates with the cell membrane, and its ectopic expression in chicken embryos alters cell migration. Similarly, depletion of BHIKHARI-2 Gag, a relative of Bik-1, causes defects in neural crest development in zebrafish. We propose an “addiction” model to explain how active TEs can be integrated into conserved developmental processes.",

The five-body recombination rate coefficient is quantified using a semiclassical description in conjunction with an analysis of the lowest five-body hyperspherical adiabatic potential curves in a scattering length regime with no universal weakly bound tetramers, trimers, or dimers. A comparison is made between these results and the only existing experimental measurement of five-body loss in an ultracold gas of bosonic cesium atoms and with the lone theoretical estimation of the loss rate. The recombination rate for the process B + B + B + B + B → B 4 + B is also computed in a different regime of scattering lengths where there is one universal bound tetramer by implementing a few-channel quantum scattering calculation based on five-body hyperspherical potential curves and nonadiabatic couplings. Our calculations predict regions where five-body recombination can cause decay of the atom cloud in an ultracold gas that is even faster than 3-body and 4-body recombination, which can ideally be tested by using the current generation of box traps having nearly uniform density.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by bacteria contain many bacterial-derived molecules, which play an important role in host interactions and as mediators of bacterial communication. However, the role of EVs in interspecies interactions and their physiological and ecological significance are not well understood. In this study, we found that Escherichia coli EVs inhibit the growth of group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes ) by inducing defective cell division via the following processes. E. coli EVs first attach to the cell surface of GAS. In EV-attached GAS cells, multiple septa and Z-rings form in close proximity, which clearly differs from the typical cell division process. This is due to inhibition of peptidoglycan (PG) remodeling in the process after septum formation, in which the next cell division is initiated without completion of peripheral PG synthesis. Therefore, cell division proceeds while inducing cell elongation and cell separation failure, leading to growth inhibition. Furthermore, EV alters the expression of approximately 10% of all genes encoded on the GAS genome, and the diverse functions of these gene sets, which include replication, division, and metabolism, suggest that EVs have a variety of biological effects on the targeted bacterial cells. Notably, E. coli EVs significantly decreased the expression of genes involved in representative GAS virulence, such as slo , nga , and hasA , and also markedly attenuated the pathogenicity of GAS in mice. Our findings provide insight into the competitive functions of EVs between different bacterial species, expanding current knowledge on EV-mediated interspecies interactions.",

Previous attempts to convert blood cells into induced neurons have presented several challenges, necessitating a less invasive, efficient, rapid, and convenient approach. The current study introduces an optimized method for converting somatic cells into neurons using a nonsurgical approach that employs peripheral blood cells as an alternative source to fibroblasts. We have demonstrated the efficacy of a unique combination of transcription factors, including NEUROD1, and four Yamanaka reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), in generating glutamatergic neurons within 3 wk. This approach, which requires only five pivotal factors (NEUROD1, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), has the potential to create functional neurons and circumvents the need for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) intermediates, as evidenced by single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, along with lineage-tracing experiments using Cre-LoxP system. While fibroblasts have been widely used for neuronal reprogramming, our findings suggest that peripheral blood cells offer a potential alternative, particularly in contexts where minimally invasive sampling and procedures convenient for patients are emphasized. This method provides a rapid strategy for modeling neuronal diseases and contributes to advancements in drug discovery and personalized medicine.",

          "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process underlying the origination of newly evolved genes. However, rapid cell type–specific transcriptomic divergence of the Drosophila germline has posed a significant technical barrier for comparative single-cell RNA-sequencing studies. By quantifying a surprisingly strong correlation between species- and cell type–specific divergence in three closely related Drosophila species, we apply a statistical procedure to identify a core set of 198 genes that are highly predictive of cell type identity while remaining robust to species-specific differences that span over 25 to 30 My of evolution. We then utilize cell type classifications based on the 198-gene set to show how transcriptional divergence in cell type increases throughout spermatogenic developmental time. After validating these cross-species cell type classifications using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and imaging, we then investigate the influence of genome organization on the molecular evolution of spermatogenesis vis-a-vis transcriptional bursting. We first show altering transcriptional burst size contributes to premeiotic transcription and altering bursting frequency contributes to postmeiotic expression. We then report global differences in autosomal vs. X chromosomal transcription may arise in a developmental stage preceding full testis organogenesis by showing evolutionarily conserved decreases in X-linked transcription bursting kinetics in all examined somatic and germline cell types. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the cultivator model of de novo gene origination by demonstrating how the appearance of newly evolved testis-specific transcripts potentially provides short-range regulation of neighboring genes’ transcriptional bursting properties during key stages of spermatogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Tight regulation of gene expression is achieved through the coordinated action of transcription factors and cofactors that often can act as both repressors and activators in response to regulatory signals, with their activity modulated by context-specific signal transduction pathways that also impinge on their transient and cyclical recruitment to chromatin. However, the mechanisms underlying the intricate interplay between the regulatory strategies controlling cofactors’ activity and localization across subcellar domains remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of G-Protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GPS2), a transcriptional cofactor critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis via regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, stress response, lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammation, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. By integration of biochemical assays with genome-wide RNA sequencing and Chromatin immunoprecipitation-Seq analyses, we show that nuclear GPS2 is required for licensing histone deacetylase 3 recruitment to chromatin via restricted ubiquitination by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously shown to regulate the switch from repressive to activating functions of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complex and here unexpectedly found to translocate to the nucleus in response to IL-1β stimulation. Nuclear TRAF6 is recruited to chromatin via direct interaction with the corepressors NCoR/SMRT, and TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 2 (TAB2), a facultative component of the NCoR/SMRT complex, contributes to corepressor clearance from target regulatory regions. Together, these results reveal an exquisite mechanism for coordinating the local regulation of cofactor activity with proinflammatory signaling pathways.",

          "abstract": "Serine protease cascades regulate key innate immune responses. Their activation cleaves a series of inactive protease zymogens, which then activate downstream effector enzymes, ensuring a rapid response. In mosquitoes, these cascades involve clip-domain serine proteases and their noncatalytic homologs (CLIPs), whose make-up and structural organization are not fully understood. Here, we systematically assessed the contribution of individual CLIPs to humoral immunity in Anopheles gambiae , by performing gene knockdown of 85 of the 110 CLIPs in adult females and assessing their individual contribution to humoral immunity regulation. By coupling RNAi with assays measuring antimicrobial activity and melanization, we identified 27 immunoregulatory CLIPs. Only one CLIP contributed to both immune responses, thus providing evidence for largely distinct protease subnetworks controlling melanization and antimicrobial activity. CLIPs regulating antimicrobial activity were found to contribute to antimicrobial peptide expression and to control infection resistance, as knockdowns reduced bacterial load and improved survival. Furthermore, our analysis of CLIP gene expression unveiled a immunoregulatory mechanism reliant on protease baseline coexpression rather than infection-induced upregulation. Together, results from this study improve our understanding of immune system regulation by proteolysis and identify a layer of regulation that could be manipulated for mosquito control purposes.",

Farm air poses direct ARG exposure to workers, but the health risks of air resistomes remain unclear. We evaluated the human exposure and health risks of air resistomes in pig and chicken farms and compared air resistomes in Chinese farms to those in European farms given their long-term restrictions on use of antibiotics in livestock. We found that livestock air was highly enriched in ARGs, with each cell harboring seven times more ARGs than urban air. The daily ARG inhalation of farm workers was equivalent to several years of ARG inhalation by urban residents. ARGs encoding resistance to last-resort antibiotics such as mcr-1 and tetX were detected in farm air, and tetX variants were prevalent in both Chinese and European farms. ARGs in livestock air were highly associated with mobile genetic elements, and conjugation experiments confirmed their cross-phyla transferability. The projected resistome risk of farm air was significantly higher than well-recognized ARG hotspots like air from hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and from animal manures. The diversity, abundance, and risk score of air resistomes in Chinese farms were significantly higher than those in European farms, suggesting that long-term restriction of antibiotic use mitigates antibiotic resistance in the livestock environment. Our results underscore the high exposure of farm workers to ARGs via farm air and highlight its role in ARG dissemination, supporting the importance of antibiotic stewardship practices in combating antibiotic resistance.",

However, while such deviations are considered a key factor controlling earthquake propagation and, hence, its intensity and magnitude, direct experimental evidence of how bends affect earthquake ruptures is nearly nonexistent. Here, we present direct experimental observations of the interaction of dynamic frictional ruptures with fault (double-) bends of different angles. Using ultrahigh-speed photography, we capture highly detailed full-field images of the complex rupture dynamics that evolve as lab earthquakes in an analog material [poly(methylmethacrylate)] propagate through fault bends, as well as the resulting near-field ground motions. Releasing bends, which extend as the fault slips, intensify the rupture by promoting a transition to supershear propagation speeds (i.e., above the medium shear wave velocities) and a crack-like rupture style with spread-out slip, while restraining bends, which contract as the fault slips, slow or arrest the rupture. Surprisingly, we find that secondary back-propagating supershear ruptures are spontaneously triggered at intermediate-angle restraining bends. These constraints on the effect of natural fault geometry on the behavior and extent of earthquake ruptures have significant implications for earthquake source physics, seismic hazards, and the interpretation of seismic data.",

Mechanistically, ZIP4 modulates microglial plasticity through tumor-derived extracellular vesicles carrying triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1), a process regulated by the zinc-dependent transcription factor Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1 in GBM cells. TREM1 enhances microglial plasticity through the spleen associated tyrosine kinase-Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (SYK-PDK-STAT3) signaling axis, ultimately promoting an immune environment favorable to tumor progression. ZIP4 depletion or TREM1 inhibition attenuates tumor growth and behavioral effects in vivo by disrupting the tumor–microglia interaction. These findings establish ZIP4 as a key modulator of the GBM immune landscape and suggest a promising therapeutic target to counteract microglia-mediated tumor progression.",

          "abstract": "Regional high-resolution climate projections are crucial for many applications, such as agriculture, hydrology, and natural hazard risk assessment. Dynamical downscaling, the state-of-the-art method to produce localized future climate information, involves running a regional climate model (RCM) driven by an Earth System Model (ESM), but it is too computationally expensive to apply to large climate projection ensembles. We propose an approach combining dynamical downscaling with generative AI to reduce the cost and improve the uncertainty estimates of downscaled climate projections. In our framework, an RCM dynamically downscales ESM output to an intermediate resolution, followed by a generative diffusion model that further refines the resolution to the target scale. This approach leverages the generalizability of physics-based models and the sampling efficiency of diffusion models, enabling the downscaling of large multimodel ensembles. We evaluate our method against dynamically downscaled climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) ensemble. Our results demonstrate its ability to provide more accurate uncertainty bounds on future regional climate than alternatives such as dynamical downscaling of smaller ensembles, or traditional empirical statistical downscaling methods. We also show that dynamical-generative downscaling results in significantly lower errors than popular statistical downscaling techniques, and captures more accurately the spectra, tail dependence, and multivariate correlations of meteorological fields. These characteristics make the dynamical-generative framework a flexible, accurate, and efficient way to downscale large ensembles of climate projections, currently out of reach for pure dynamical downscaling.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria are known to allocate their proteomes according to how fast they grow, and the allocation strategies employed strongly affect bacterial adaptation to different environments. Much of what is currently known about proteome allocation is based on extensive studies of the model organism Escherichia coli . It is not clear how much of E. coli ’s proteome allocation strategy is applicable to other species, particularly since different species can grow at vastly different rates even in the same growth condition. In this study, we investigate differences in nutrient-dependent proteome allocation programs adopted by several distantly related bacterial species, including Vibrio natriegens , one of the fastest-growing bacteria known. Extensive quantitative proteome characterization across conditions reveals an invariant allocation program in response to changing nutrients despite systemic, species-specific differences in enzyme kinetics. This invariant program is not organized according to the growth rate but is based on a common internal metric of nutrient quality after scaling away species-specific differences in enzyme kinetics, with the faster species behaving as if it is growing under a higher temperature. The flexibility of enzyme kinetics and the rigidity of proteome allocation programs across species defy common notions of evolvability and resource optimization. Our results suggest the existence of a blueprint of proteome allocation shared by diverse bacterial species, with implications on common underlying regulatory strategies. Further knowledge on the existence and organization of such phylogeny-transcending relations also promises to simplify the bottom–up description and understanding of bacterial behaviors in ecological communities.",

          "abstract": "Contrary to all terrestrial rocks, planets and meteorites exhibit oxygen isotope variations decorrelated with the mass difference of their atomic nuclei. It has been proposed that, in the protosolar nebula (PSN), these variations could result from mass independent isotopic fractionation (MIF) either during specific chemical reactions similar to those responsible for the formation of ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere or during ultraviolet (UV)-photolysis of carbon monoxide (CO) gas in the PSN. However, these potential chemical MIF reactions (Chem-MIFs) are not identified in conditions close to the PSN, and there is no experimental demonstration that large MIF signature can be transferred to solids forming in the PSN. Here, we show that MIFs, up to 60‰ depletion in 16 O, are produced by high-temperature reactions in a plasma during the condensation of carbonaceous solids from a gas containing two of the most abundant PSN molecular species (H 2 O and CH 4 ). This effect is attributed to the formation in the plasma of the activated complex H 2 O 2 * followed by its stabilization by reactions with CH x • radicals. Although it is premature to assert that this reaction represents the main process resulting in MIF of oxygen isotopes in the solar system, our result demonstrates the potential importance of a Chem-MIF effect in a PSN where plasma zones develop.",

Samples were deployed on the Materials International Space Station Experiment–Flight Facility platform for approximately 6 mo in zenith- and wake-facing orientations. Postflight analyses comparing flight-exposed samples to Earth controls revealed composition- and orientation-dependent differences in mass loss, optical properties, and surface morphology. Notably, fungal melanin reduced mass loss and surface wrinkle formation, indicating a protective effect against PLA degradation in LEO. Biocomposites also demonstrated shielding effects by protecting an underlying polyvinyl chloride backing layer from damage. These findings demonstrate PLA’s performance in space and highlight fungal melanin as a bioderived additive to enhance PLA resilience under LEO conditions, advancing the development of sustainable materials for future space missions.",

Using high-resolution structure determination by cryogenic electron microscopy together with mutagenesis and electrophysiology, we delineated the drug binding pocket for DHP-103 within the water-filled central cavity of the K Ca 3.1 channel pore, where bound drug directly impedes ion permeation. DHP-103 inhibited gain-of-function mutant K Ca 3.1 channels that cause hereditary xerocytosis, suggesting its potential use as a therapeutic for this hemolytic anemia.

          "abstract": "Climate-driven sea-level rise is increasing the frequency of coastal flooding worldwide, exacerbated locally by factors like land subsidence from groundwater and resource extraction. However, a process rarely considered in future sea-level rise scenarios is sudden (over minutes) land subsidence associated with great (&gt;M8) earthquakes, which can exceed 1 m. Along the Washington, Oregon, and northern California coasts, the next great Cascadia subduction zone earthquake could cause up to 2 m of sudden coastal subsidence, dramatically raising sea level, expanding floodplains, and increasing the flood risk to local communities. Here, we quantify the potential expansion of the 1% floodplain (i.e., the area with an annual flood risk of 1%) under low (~0.5 m), medium (~1 m), and high (~2 m) earthquake-driven subsidence scenarios at 24 Cascadia estuaries. If a great earthquake occurred today, floodplains could expand by 90 km 2 (low), 160 km 2 (medium), or 300 km 2 (high subsidence), more than doubling the flooding exposure of residents, structures, and roads under the high subsidence scenario. By 2100, when climate-driven sea-level rise will compound the hazard, a great earthquake could expand floodplains by 170 km 2 (low), 240 km 2 (medium), or 370 km 2 (high subsidence), more than tripling the flooding exposure of residents, structures, and roads under the high subsidence scenario compared to the 2023 floodplain. Our findings can support decision-makers and coastal communities along the Cascadia subduction zone as they prepare for compound hazards from the earthquake cycle and climate-driven sea-level rise and provide critical insights for tectonically active coastlines globally.",

          "abstract": "The platypus and four echidna species are the only living egg-laying mammals and the sole extant representatives of Order Monotremata. The platypus and echidnas are very disparate both morphologically and ecologically: The platypus is a specialized semiaquatic burrowing form that forages for freshwater invertebrates, whereas echidnas are fully terrestrial and adapted for feeding on social insects and earthworms. It has been proposed that echidnas evolved from a semiaquatic, platypus-like ancestor, but fossil evidence for such a profound evolutionary transformation has been lacking, and this hypothesis remains controversial. Here, we present original data about the Early Cretaceous (108 to 103 Ma) Australian mammal Kryoryctes cadburyi , currently only known from a single humerus, that provides key information relating to this question. Phylogenetic analysis of a 536-character morphological matrix of mammaliaforms places Kryoryctes as a stem-monotreme. Three-dimensional whole bone comparisons show that the overall shape of the humerus is more similar to that of echidnas than the platypus, but analysis of microstructure reveals specializations found in semiaquatic mammals, including a particularly thick cortex and a highly reduced medullary cavity, present in the platypus but absent in echidnas. The evidence suggests Kryoryctes was a semiaquatic burrower, indicating that monotremes first evolved an amphibious lifestyle in the Mesozoic, and providing support for the hypothesis that this is ancestral for living monotremes as a whole. The lineage leading to the modern platypus appears to have been characterized by extremely long term (&gt;100 My) niche conservatism, with echidnas representing a much later reversion to a fully terrestrial lifestyle.",

Stiffness gradient, as a special feature evolved in reptilian adhesion systems, offers significant advantages in enhancing adhesion adaptation and stability. However, it remains a challenge to accurately replicate the geometrical morphology and soft-rigid composite properties of stiffness gradient structures, which limits the engineering applications of bioinspired adhesives. Here, a stiffness gradient adhesive structure with mushroom-shaped morphology via electrically activated one-step growth is proposed. Under the action of electric field, the liquid-phase polymer grows rheologically to realize the mushroom-shaped structural morphology, and the nanoparticles inside the polymer are aggregated toward the top by dielectrophoresis to realize the stiffness gradient distribution of rigid top and soft bottom. Due to the adaptation of the soft part to the interfacial contact and the effective inhibition of peeling by the rigid part, the proposed stiffness gradient structure improves the adhesion strength by 3 times in the parallel state and by 5 times in the nonparallel state compared to the conventional homogeneous structure. In addition, the application of adhesive structures in wall-climbing robots was demonstrated, opening an avenue for the development of dry adhesive-based devices and systems.",

Although it last erupted 250 ± 5 ka ago, Uturuncu remains active with observable deformation and seismicity. To assess its current state, we have determined high-resolution isotropic and anisotropic seismic velocity structures of the volcanic system in the upper crust using local seismic networks. Combining our seismic analysis with previous geophysical imaging results and rock physics modeling, we delineate pathways of migrating fluids traveling toward the surface and a shallow gas accumulation zone beneath the crater. This fluid migration and accumulation explains why Uturuncu volcano still shows signs of activity.

          "abstract": "In the common cellular space, hundreds of binding reactions occur reliably and simultaneously without disruptive mutual interference. The design principles that enable this remarkable compatibility have not yet been adequately elucidated. In order to delineate these principles, we consider the intracellular sensing of transition metals in bacteria—an integral part of cellular metal homeostasis. Protein cytosolic sensors typically interact with metals through three types of lateral chain residues, containing oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The very existence of complete sets of mutually compatible sensors is a nontrivial problem solved by evolution, since each metal sensor has to bind to its cognate metal without being “mismetallated” by noncognate competitors. Here, based solely on theoretical considerations and limited information about binding constants for metal-amino acid interactions, we are able to predict possible “sensor compositions,” i.e., the residues forming the binding sites. We find that complete transition-metal sensor sets are severely limited in their number by compatibility requirements, leaving only a handful of possible sensor compositions for each transition metal. Our theoretical results turn out to be broadly consistent with experimental data on known bacterial sensors. If applicable to other cytosolic binding interactions, the results generated by our approach imply that compatibility requirements may play a crucial role in the organization and functioning of intracellular processes.",

          "abstract": "The origins of novel behaviors are poorly understood, despite behavior’s hypothesized roles in evolution. One model, “genetic accommodation,” proposes that selection on ancestral phenotypic plasticity may precede the evolution of novel traits. A critical assumption of genetic accommodation is that ancestral lineages possess heritable genetic variation for trait plasticity that is revealed in novel environments, thereby providing the raw materials for subsequent refinement of the novel trait in derived lineages. Here, we use a combination of behavioral and RNA-seq approaches to test this assumption in the context of a novel tadpole behavior: predatory cannibalism. Cannibalism evolved in the spadefoot genus Spea , where an invertebrate diet induces a carnivorous tadpole morph capable of consuming live conspecific tadpoles. In contrast, closely related Scaphiopus tadpoles do not induce this carnivorous phenotype. Through species comparisons, we found that ancestral Spea likely expressed behavioral plasticity and harbored latent (i.e., “cryptic”) genetic variation in brain gene expression plasticity associated with cannibalism-inducing cues. Further, we found that this cryptic genetic variation includes genes specifically associated with a dietary response and cannibalism in derived Spea . Our results suggest that novel behaviors, alongside novel morphologies, can evolve via the process of genetic accommodation. More generally, our results provide key evidence for the plausibility of genetic accommodation, revealing that cryptic genetic variation—the raw material for the evolution of novel traits—exists in natural populations at the level of gene expression.",

Whereas cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we reveal a bacterial antiphage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine triphosphates (dITPs) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates a downstream effector to mediate depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular deoxyadenosine monophosphate, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification–based antiphage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.",

          "abstract": "Temperature is the key variable in the study of climate changes in the past and future. Most previous studies on past temperature reconstructions, however, have focused on the mean annual temperature (MAT). Here, focusing on the seasonal temperature reconstructions in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics during the Holocene period, we show that the change in seasonal cycle of temperature reconstructions is severely underestimated in comparison with the expectation from present observations. Our study highlights the current uncertainty in seasonal temperature reconstructions in the Holocene, with an implication that the MAT simulation in current climate models may not be much biased.",

This inspired hypotheses for how Milankovitch cycles, ice-ocean interactions, and greenhouse gases influence ice volume. Mass balance controls for marine and terrestrial ice sheets differ, and proxy data collected far from Antarctica provide valuable but limited insight into regional processes. We evaluate clast abundance data from Antarctic marine sedimentary records, observing a strong signal of eccentricity and precession coincident with a terrestrial ice sheet and a clear obliquity signal at the margins of a marine ice sheet. These analyses are integrated with a synthesis of proxy data, and we argue that high variance in obliquity forcing (mediated and enhanced by the ocean and atmosphere) can inhibit ice sheet growth, even when insolation forcing is conducive to glaciation. This “obliquity disruption” explains cryosphere variability before the existence of large northern hemisphere ice sheets.",

However, translating these circuits into living cells remains challenging because of instability and cellular interference. We introduce an allosteric strand exchange (ASE) strategy for complex intracellular computing. Leveraging conformational cooperativity to regulate strand exchange, ASE offers a modular platform for designing intracellular circuits with flexible programmability. We engineer a scalable circuit architecture based on ASE that can execute AND and OR logic and scale to an eight-input expression. We demonstrate ASE-based circuits can detect messenger RNAs with high specificity in mammalian cells via AND logic computation. The capacity of ASE-based circuits to accept messenger RNAs as inputs enables integration of endogenous cellular information for efficient multi-input information processing, demonstrated by a multi-input molecular classifier monitoring key cell reprogramming events. Reprogramming ASE-based circuit to interface with CRISPR-Cas9 enables programmable control of Cas9-targeting activity for gene editing, highlighting their potential for advancing intracellular biocomputation.",

While objects have become an intuitive framework for studying neurons in many parts of cortex, it is possible that neurons follow a more expressive organizational principle, such as encoding generic features present across textures, places, and objects. In this study, we used multielectrode arrays to record from neurons in the early (V1/V2), middle (V4), and later [posterior inferotemporal (PIT) cortex] areas across the visual hierarchy, estimating each neuron’s local operation across natural scene via “heatmaps.” We found that, while populations of neurons with foveal receptive fields across V1/V2, V4, and PIT responded over the full scene, they focused on salient subregions within object outlines. Notably, neurons preferentially encoded animal features rather than general objects, with this trend strengthening along the visual hierarchy. These results show that the monkey ventral stream is partially organized to encode local animal features over objects, even as early as primary visual cortex.",

          "abstract": "The origin of hot ocean-continent back-arc regions with very thin mantle lithosphere and very high surface heat flow in both extensional and contractional ocean-continent subduction systems is highly enigmatic and unresolved. These first-order characteristics have often been explained with either convective mantle lithosphere removal or by back-arc extension. However, it is unclear what may cause the proposed convective thinning and/or delamination of eclogitic lower crust over very wide regions, whereas back-arc extension is either not observed or insufficient to explain the observed very thin mantle lithosphere. Notably, many of these ocean-continent systems have a long history of terrane accretion. Here, we show, using thermomechanical model experiments, that terrane accretion provides a consistent explanation for the observed key characteristics and naturally leads to rheologically weak back-arcs with continental crust directly on top of the hot sublithospheric mantle.",

          "abstract": "High-precision measurements are crucial for testing the fundamental laws of nature and advancing the technological frontier. Clock interferometry, where particles with an internal clock are coherently split and recombined along two spatial paths, has sparked interest due to its fundamental implications, especially at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here, we demonstrate that a clock interferometer provides metrological improvement compared to its technical noise–limited counterpart using a single internal quantum state. This enhancement around a critical working point can be interpreted as a geometric phase–induced signal-to-noise ratio gain. In our experimental setup, we infer a sensitivity enhancement of 8.8 decibels when measuring a small difference between external fields. We estimate that tens of decibels of sensitivity enhancement could be attained for measurements with a higher atom flux. This opens the door to developing a superior probe for fundamental physics and a high-performance sensor for various technological applications.",

However, they are also complex and hard to model because they cannot be described by the standard tools in equilibrium statistical mechanics. Probing nonequilibrium critical phenomena in pristine setups can illuminate fresh perspectives on these systems. Here, we use an ensemble of cold 88 Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse cavity to study the cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, a classic driven-dissipative model describing coherently driven dipoles superradiantly emitting light. We observe its nonequilibrium phase diagram characterized by a second-order phase transition. Below a critical drive strength, the atoms quickly reach the so-called superradiant steady state featuring a macroscopic dipole moment; above the critical point, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations. At longer times, spontaneous emission transforms the second-order transition into a discontinuous first-order transition. Our observations pave the way for harnessing robust entangled states and exploring boundary time crystals in driven-dissipative systems.",

Ideally mixed PbS quantum dots and Ag nanocrystals in the same medium are exploited as nanoseeds to simultaneously promote independent optical and electrical randomness. The number of secured keys that can be generated on-demand by combining the optical and electrical features in parallel using shuffling method is almost infinite (&gt;10 58741 per square millimeter). The proposed PUF achieves a near-ideal Hamming distance in uniqueness and randomness tests, validating its cryptographic efficacy. Last, storage-free and on-demand PUF with the shuffling method are demonstrated using smartphones, realizing manufacturer-/user-friendly cryptography system.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in two-dimensional semiconductor hetero-bilayers have revealed that the stacking angle between adjacent layers provides an additional degree of freedom to tune exciton states, enabling fascinating twist-angle–dependent photoluminescence. To control exciton emission properties, hetero-bilayers are usually integrated with photonic nanostructures, however, in which the contact interfaces can result in substantial luminescence suppression. To overcome this fundamental issue, we herein directly pattern photonic crystal (PhC) nanostructures in free-standing WS 2 /WSe 2 hetero-bilayers to avoid the involvement of contact interfaces. Such PhC nanostructured WS 2 /WSe 2 hetero-bilayers not only provide new exciton states but also offer guided mode resonances that can self-couple to excitons to enable light manipulation at the atomic thickness scale. Moreover, leveraging the unique momentum dispersion of guided mode resonances, exciton emissions are selectively excited and separated in the energy-momentum space. Our results may provide an important direction to unfold the prospects of emerging exciton states in the moiré heterostructures.",

          "abstract": "Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, reveals context-dependent phenotypes across multiple biological length scales. Despite its mechanistic importance, identifying and characterizing senescence across cell populations is challenging. Using primary dermal fibroblasts, we combined single-cell imaging, machine learning, several induced senescence conditions, and multiple protein biomarkers to define functional senescence subtypes. Single-cell morphology analysis revealed 11 distinct morphology clusters. Among these, we identified three as bona fide senescence subtypes (C7, C10, and C11), with C10 exhibiting the strongest age dependence within an aging cohort. In addition, we observed that a donor’s senescence burden and subtype composition were indicative of susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced senescence. Functional analysis revealed subtype-dependent responses to senotherapies, with C7 being most responsive to the combination of dasatinib and quercetin. Our single-cell analysis framework, SenSCOUT, enables robust identification and classification of senescence subtypes, offering applications in next-generation senotherapy screens, with potential toward explaining heterogeneous senescence phenotypes based on the presence of senescence subtypes.",

Being impervious to most traditional condensed matter probes, the exact origin and nature of TLS remain elusive. Recent advances toward realizing stable high-coherence quantum computing platforms have increased the importance of studying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source of decoherence and instability. Here, performing scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting NbN resonator at millikelvin temperatures, we locate individual TLS, directly revealing their microscopic nature. Mapping and visualizing the most detrimental TLS in the bath pinpoints the dominant sources of ubiquitous 1/ f dielectric noise and energy relaxation. We also deduce the three-dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Combining these insights with structural information of the underlying materials can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing targeted strategies for their eventual mitigation.",

Despite being exhaustively studied, we found that a substantial part of the knowledge on their cranial musculature was mistaken. Eleven previously reported coelacanth “muscles” are nonexistent, while three previously unknown muscle subdivisions and connections are found. These findings markedly affect our understanding of the deep-time cranial evolution of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). Only 13% of the previously identified myological evolutionary novelties for the major gnathostome lineages proved to be accurate, but several new ones are proposed. We show that low, moderate, and high levels of cranial muscle innovation characterized the emergence of lobe-finned (sarcopterygian), cartilaginous (chondrichthyan), and ray-finned (actinopterygian) fishes, respectively. The novelties in the latter group resulted in the evolution of a second active mechanism for the expansion of the oropharyngeal cavity, which was probably crucial for the predominance of suction feeding versus bite feeding in extant actinopterygians.",

Yet, centrosomes are membraneless organelles, raising the question of how centrosomes withstand mechanical forces. Here, we discover that centrosomes can deform and even fracture. We reveal that centrosomes experience deformations during navigational pathfinding within motile cells. Coherence of the centrosome is maintained by Dyrk3 and cNAP1, preventing fracturing by forces. While cells can compensate for the depletion of centriolar-based centrosomes, the fracturing of centrosomes impedes cellular function by generating coexisting microtubule organizing centers that compete during path navigation and thereby cause cellular entanglement in the microenvironment. Our findings show that cells actively maintain the integrity of the centrosome to withstand mechanical forces. These results suggest that centrosome stability preservation is fundamental, given that almost all cells in multicellular organisms experience forces.",

Deleting Max across multiple mouse neuroendocrine tissues, we find that Max inactivation alone produces pituitary adenomas, while Max inactivation cooperates with Rb1 / Trp53 loss to accelerate medullary thyroid C cell and pituitary adenoma development. In the thyroid tumor cell lines, MAX loss triggers a marked shift in genomic occupancy by other members of the MYC network (MNT, MLX, MondoA) supporting metabolism, survival, and proliferation of neoplastic neuroendocrine cells.

We developed a methodological pipeline that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to rigorously quantify astrocyte morphological features and spatial organization across the brain, leveraging expression of cytoskeletal markers. Application of this pipeline reveals that morphological characteristics of individual astrocytes predict their location within the NAc. Our analysis also indicates that after heroin use, astrocyte structural plasticity is impaired in portions of the NAc associated with the extinction of conditioned responses and is uniquely engaged in the dorsomedial portion of the NAc shell, an undercharacterized subdivision of the structure.",

An empty closed box, for example, is stiffer and more stable than when it is open. The presence of an opening makes it less constrained, more deformable, and easier to morph, as demonstrated by several studies on open-surface morphing across patterns, materials, and scales. Here, we present a platform to morph closed surfaces with bistability that harnesses a balanced integration of origami and kirigami principles. By harmonizing panel rotation around creases nearly tangent to the closed surface and panel rotation around hinges nearly perpendicular to the closed surface, we show that origami-kirigami assemblages can shape-morph between a cube and a sphere, scale between spheres of dissimilar size, and change topology between a sphere and a torus, with programmed bistability. The framework offers a promising strategy for designing bistable reconfigurable structures and metamaterials with enclosed configurations.",

Furthermore, the dynamics of silica behavior under higher pressure need to be investigated, particularly during nonequilibrium superheating before melting. This study examines the time-dependent response of coesite, using laser-driven shock coupled with fast XRD and molecular dynamics simulations with our recently developed machine learning interatomic potential. Our results reveal a transient dense supercooled liquid crystallizes into a semi-disordered d-NiAs-type silica, followed by transforming into either seifertite or stishovite, depending on the pressure. Instead of thermodynamically stable quartz, a back-transformation to coesite phase is identified after release.

Fat pad implantation or systemic leptin restoration in LD mice reintroduced structural OA and pain, whereas implantation of leptin-deficient fat pad did not change OA susceptibility. Isochronic parabiosis and spatial transcriptomics confirmed that a fat-joint cross-talk likely occurred via soluble mediators. Global unsupervised multiomics of conditioned media from fat implants revealed that leptin exerts a regulatory effect on adipsin (or complement factor D), the activity of which modulates the contrastive OA structural and pain phenotype.

The collapse of this species in the rocky intertidal revealed an unexpected relationship between two keystone predators. In this study, we show how the loss of Pisaster along the Monterey Peninsula, CA, USA led to an increase in mussel ( Mytilus californianus ) size and expansion into lower tidal zones. Before the sea star wasting event, the local sea otter population fluctuated around a near equilibrium. However, in the absence of Pisaster , sea otters increased their dietary intake on mussels, which contributed in part to a local population-level rise.

We show that CD39 + regulatory T cell (T reg )–like and CD26 hi T H 22–like cells undergo T cell receptor (TCR)–independent activation by cytokines during Ag stimulation, leading to nonspecific up-regulation of AIM readouts. Transcriptional analysis enabled discrimination of bona fide Ag-specific T cells from cytokine-activated T reg and T H 22 cells. CXCR4 down-regulation emerged as a hallmark of clonotypic expansion and TCR-dependent activation in memory CD4 + T cells and cTfh. By tracking tetramer-binding cells upon Ag restimulation, we demonstrated that CXCR4−CD137 + cells provided a more accurate measure of Ag-specificity than standard AIM readouts.

Readily available aryl iodides, alkyl/aryl bromides, and propargyl esters are used as the distinct electrophilic coupling partners, leading to the synthesis of a diverse array of tetrasubstituted allenes. In particular, the challenging asymmetric formal triple XEC has also been realized through palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis, which uses the sterically hindered 2,6-disubstituted aryl bromides as the arylating reagents to prepare tetrasubstituted allenes bearing an axially chiral biaryl unit. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the selection of propargyl esters as electrophilic terminating reagents is key to the success of this reaction because it enables a thermodynamically favored pathway for reaction termination involving alkyne insertion followed by β-O elimination.",

Once Pacific oscillations are properly accounted for, averaged surface warming appears &gt;60% faster, and a deep reshaping of the seascape is revealed.

Notably, the dimethylamino group–decorated catalyst demonstrated stable and nearly 100% CO 2 -to-CO reduction selectivity over a wide potential range and high CO partial current densities up to 300 milliamperes per square centimeter. Theoretical and in situ spectroscopic analyses revealed the critical role of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in activating the metal center, which can be facilitated by the decoration of electron-withdrawing groups. Conversely, electron-donating groups, although requiring higher energy for protonation, enhance the synergy between metal centers and protonated sites, favoring the formation of key *COOH intermediates and improving CO selectivity at higher bias. This study underscores the importance of dynamic protonation of ligand sites in optimizing functionalized molecular catalysts for enhanced CO 2 RR activity.",

          "abstract": "The regeneration of the enthesis remains a formidable challenge in regenerative medicine. However, key regulators underlying unsatisfactory regeneration remain poorly understood. This study reveals that the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R)/Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome axis suppresses enthesis regeneration by amplifying IL-1β–mediated inflammatory cross-talk and suppressing docosatrienoic acid (DTA) metabolic cross-talk. NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated in macrophages following enthesis injury, thereby impairing the histological and functional recovery of the injured enthesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) indicated that Nlrp3 knockout attenuated pathological inflammation and ameliorated the detrimental effects of IL-1β signaling cross-talk. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasomes suppressed the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-13) and DTA. The NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated secretome reduced differentiation and migration of stem cells. Neutralizing IL-1β or replenishing docosatrienoic acid accelerated enthesis regeneration. Moreover, conditional knockout of P2rx7 in myeloid cells attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and facilitated enthesis regeneration. This study demonstrates that the P2X7R/NLRP3 inflammasome axis represents a promising therapeutic target for enthesis repair.",

Using the 5xFAD mouse model, we discovered early, sex-dependent alterations in parvalbumin-interneuron transcriptomic profiles. This corresponded with impaired parvalbumin-interneuron activity, which was sufficient to induce cognitive impairments and dysregulate retrosplenial functional connectivity. In fMRI scans from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, we observed a similar sex-dependent dysregulation of retrosplenial cortex functional connectivity and, in postmortem tissue from subjects with Alzheimer’s disease, a loss of parvalbumin interneurons.

Mechanistic insight is limited by asynchronous model systems and failure to connect context-specific, transient mechanisms to function. To address this gap, we developed STAMP (synchronized temporal-spatial analysis via microscopy and phosphoproteomics) to track changes in cellular landscape occurring throughout G 0 transition and ciliogenesis. We synchronized ciliogenesis and G 0 transition in two cell models and combined microscopy with phosphoproteomics to order signals for further targeted analyses.

Volcanic plume gas measurements are often interpreted assuming that magmatic gases are chemically inert on emission and near-source dilution in air. Conversely, many volcanic plumes contain high levels of bromine monoxide (BrO), which is produced by atmospheric oxidation of magmatic hydrogen bromide (HBr) emissions. We investigate the chemical kinetics of hot magmatic gases mixing with air. Our model reproduces and explains observations of volcanic plume BrO at Mt. Etna, evidencing that reduced gases [HBr, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2 )] can oxidize at the hot magma–air interface.

Here, the inhalable, myofibroblast-targeted, and pH-responsive liposomes (FL-NI) were developed for effective codelivery of nintedanib, a mainstream antifibrotic drug in clinic, and siIL11, a small interfering RNA that silences the key profibrosis cytokine IL-11. Notably, FL-NI achieved a 117.8% increase in pulmonary drug delivery by noninvasive inhalation and a 71.5% increase in delivery specifically to fibroblast activation protein–positive myofibroblasts while reducing nonspecific immune cell and epithelial uptake by 29.8 and 55.8%, respectively. The accurate inhalation codelivery of nintedanib and siIL11 into myofibroblasts achieved synergistic effects, effectively enhanced myofibroblast deactivation, reduced pathological collagen deposition by 50.8%, and promoted epithelial tissue repair. FL-NI remodeled the aberrant immune microenvironment without inducing systemic toxicities. Therefore, this work demonstrated the notable potential for this pluripotent strategy for improving PF outcomes and its promising clinical translation.",

Previous research has shown that the surface texture needs to break the spatial symmetry to enable self-propulsion. Here, we demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking in the gas-liquid flow above the texture generates substantial self-propulsion forces, driving drops on symmetric textured surfaces. Using a model of hydrodynamically coupled driven oscillators and computational fluid dynamic simulations, we show that drops are propelled by the pressure field of the vapor. We analyze the influence of drop size, temperature, and structural parameters of the substrate on the propulsion velocity. Furthermore, we observe similar self-propulsion in liquid nitrogen, ethanol, and liquid rings, indicating broad applicability. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic symmetry breaking of the gas-liquid interface in driving large-scale liquid motion and provide a potential path for efficient thermal-mechanical energy conversion.",

Using this plastic-based PET, we determined the distribution of the relative angle between polarization planes of photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and parapositronium annihilations are maximally entangled.

When triggered by ROS in the lesions, burst exposure of Cur and polymer-linked CeO 2 (PCeO 2 ) is achieved. The concentrated Cur switches amyloid-β (Aβ)–activated microglia into normal for mobilizing phagocytosis, and CeO 2 has sustainable antioxidant capacity to prevent microglial mitochondrial damage after phagocytosis of PCeO 2 -captured Aβ. After administration, our findings reveal microglia-mediated Aβ clearance, neuroprotection, and ROS elimination in AD mice.

Disrupting the methylarginine reader function of BRD9 suppresses AKT activation and tumorigenesis. RNA sequencing data show that BRD9 and AKT coregulate a hallmark transcriptional program in part through enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)–mediated methylation of histone-3 lysine-27. We also find that inhibitors of BRD9 and EZH2 display synergistic effects on suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth.

Guided by these observations, we proposed to activate an unprecedented triplet energy transfer relay to simultaneously harness the singlet and triplet energy. Consequently, an upconverted afterglow material was constructed with amazing luminescence performance albeit its moderate fluorescence emission property. The generality of this strategy was evidenced by the adaptation to similar emitters with varied emission wavelengths.

We further establish that this growth-coupled sensitivity (GCS) allows bacteria to implement concentration-dependent sugar preferences, in which a new carbon source is used only if its concentration is sufficient to improve upon the current growth rate. Using microfluidics in combination with time-lapse microscopy, we validate this prediction at the single-cell level using mixtures of glucose and lactose.

Using these properties, we demonstrated photon echoes in our waveguide structures, revealing a coherence time of 2.6 ± 0.6 microseconds at zero magnetic field, closely matching that of bulk crystals. These characteristics make the bound state in the continuum platform a promising candidate for realizing integrated optical memories for quantum network applications.",

          "authors": "Hankyeol Jeong, Elaine A. Ostrander, Jaemin Kim",
          "abstract": "Herding dogs exhibit a distinct constellation of behaviors marked by inherent instinct and motor skills that manipulate and guide livestock in response to instructive commands and cues. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of herding and nonherding breeds reveals signatures of positive selection associated with pathways underlying social interaction and cognitive functions. Of the strong selective sweep signals, haplotypes within ephrin type-B receptor 1 ( EPHB1 ), which is linked to locomotor hyperactivity and spatial memory, show evidence of segregation within breed lineages for the conformation versus working lines of border collies and introgression with a genetically and geographically distant herding breed of Entlebucher mountain dogs. We show that a working line–specific haplotype of EPHB1 is associated with elevated levels of chase-bite motor patterns based on a well-validated behavior survey. These findings indicate that functional selection has shaped the genetic architecture of herding breeds, which may relate to their proficiency in addressing diverse tasks and challenges in maintaining control over the herd.",

          "abstract": "In vitro models play a major role in studying airway physiology and disease. However, the native lung’s complex tissue architecture and nonepithelial cell lineages are not preserved in these models. Ex vivo tissue models could overcome in vitro limitations, but methods for long-term maintenance of ex vivo tissue have not been established. Here, we describe methods to culture human large airway explants, small airway explants, and precision-cut lung slices for at least 14 days. Human airway explants recapitulate genotype-specific electrophysiology; characteristic epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and immune cell populations; and model viral infection after 14 days in culture. These methods also maintain mouse, rabbit, and pig tracheal explants. Notably, intact airway tissue can be cryopreserved, thawed, and used to generate viable explants with recovery of function 14 days postthaw. These studies highlight the broad applications of airway tissue explants and their use as translational intermediates between in vitro and in vivo studies.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that can kill bacteria, thereby editing and shaping microbial communities. The telomere phages are a curious form using telomere-like structures to replicate their genomes as linear extrachromosomal elements. Here, we find that telomere phages are widely distributed in bacteria, being highly prevalent in Klebsiella species. We establish a model system to investigate telomere phage biology by isolating the virions of telomere phages and infecting naïve strains to create isogenic lines with and without a phage. We find that only a small set of telomere phage proteins is expressed in phage-host cells, including a toxin—the telocin—that kills other Klebsiella strains. We identify and validate a set of telocins in the genomes of other prevalent Klebsiella telomere phages. Thus, telomere phages are widespread elements encoding diverse antibacterial weapons and we discuss the prospect of using telocins for precision editing of microbial populations.",

          "abstract": "Increasing efforts have been devoted to developing biobased and biodegradable plastics and composites from lignocellulosic biomass. Current bioplastic production entails multiple challenging steps including monomer production from biomass as well as polymer synthesis and modification. Here, we report a practical recombination strategy to transform agricultural residues into moldable cellulose-reinforced lignin (CRL) composites. The strategy involves deconstruction of biomass particles followed by thermo-compression molding of cellulose fibers and lignin mixtures. The resulting CRL composites demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal properties as well as water, abrasive, and flame resistance. Mechanistic studies reveal that small particle size, removal of water-soluble fractions, as well as reservation of lignin and its cross-linking reactivity have considerably positive effects on preparation of high-quality composite items. These insights offer a versatile strategy for transforming various types of low-grade biomass, such as corn stover, into eco-friendly and potentially biodegradable or compostable composites that can serve as sustainable alternatives to traditional duroplast materials.",
