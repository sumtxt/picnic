          "abstract": "During classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) encapsulates free DNA ends, forming a recruitment platform for downstream end-joining factors including ligase 4 (LIG4) 1 . DNA-PK can also bind telomeres and regulate their resection 2–4 , but does not initiate cNHEJ at this position. How the end-joining process is regulated in this context-specific manner is currently unclear. Here we show that the shelterin components TRF2 and RAP1 form a complex with DNA-PK that directly represses its end-joining function at telomeres. Biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that when bound to TRF2, RAP1 establishes a network of interactions with KU and DNA that prevents DNA-PK from recruiting LIG4. In mouse and human cells, RAP1 is redundant with the Apollo nuclease in repressing cNHEJ at chromosome ends, demonstrating that the inhibition of DNA-PK prevents telomere fusions in parallel with overhang-dependent mechanisms. Our experiments show that the end-joining function of DNA-PK is directly and specifically repressed at telomeres, establishing a molecular mechanism for how individual linear chromosomes are maintained in mammalian cells.",

          "abstract": "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the enzyme responsible for nearly all biologically generated methane 1 . Its active site comprises coenzyme F 430 , a porphyrin-based cofactor with a central nickel ion that is active exclusively in the Ni(I) state 2,3 . How methanogenic archaea perform the reductive activation of F 430 represents a major gap in our understanding of one of the most ancient bioenergetic systems in nature. Here we purified and characterized the MCR activation complex from Methanococcus maripaludis . McrC, a small subunit encoded in the mcr operon, co-purifies with the methanogenic marker proteins Mmp7, Mmp17, Mmp3 and the A2 component. We demonstrated that this complex can activate MCR in vitro in a strictly ATP-dependent manner, enabling the formation of methane. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the MCR activation complex exhibiting different functional states with local resolutions reaching 1.8–2.1 Å. Our data revealed three complex iron–sulfur clusters that formed an electron transfer pathway towards F 430 . Topology and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses indicate that these clusters are similar to the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster, a maturation intermediate of the catalytic cofactor in nitrogenase. Altogether, our findings offer insights into the activation mechanism of MCR and prospects on the early evolution of nitrogenase.",

          "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, little is known about the metabolism of therapeutic RNAs. Here we use nanopore sequencing 1–3 to analyse individual therapeutic mRNA molecules, focusing on their poly(A) tails. We show that the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine 4 has a poly(A) tail of around 100 nucleotides, followed by an mΨCmΨAG sequence. In cell lines, mRNA-1273 undergoes rapid degradation initiated by mΨCmΨAG removal, followed by CCR4–NOT-mediated deadenylation. However, in medically relevant preclinical models, particularly in macrophages, mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails are extended to up to 200 nucleotides by the TENT5A poly(A) polymerase 5–7 , which is induced by the vaccine. Re-adenylation, which stabilizes target mRNAs, is consistently observed in synthetic mRNAs that encode proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, such as ovalbumin or antigens from Zika virus 8 or the malaria parasite 9 . The extent of re-adenylation varies: the BioNTech–Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine 10 shows less potent re-adenylation than mRNA-1273, which correlates with a smaller proportion of membrane-associated BNT162b2. This highlights the crucial role of spatial accessibility to ER-resident TENT5A in determining re-adenylation efficiency. In vivo, TENT5A is expressed in immune cells that take up mRNA vaccine, and TENT5A deficiency reduces specific immunoglobulin production for mRNA vaccines after immunization in mice. Overall, our findings reveal a principle for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic mRNAs, paving the way for improvement.",

          "abstract": "Protein misfolding diseases, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), pose substantial health challenges, with their cellular progression still poorly understood 1–3 . We use spatial proteomics by mass spectrometry and machine learning to map AATD in human liver tissue. Combining Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) with single-cell analysis 4,5 , we probe intact patient biopsies to resolve molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across fibrosis stages. We achieve proteome depth of up to 4,300 proteins from one-third of a single cell in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This dataset reveals a potentially clinically actionable peroxisomal upregulation that precedes the canonical unfolded protein response. Our single-cell proteomics data show α1-antitrypsin accumulation is largely cell-intrinsic, with minimal stress propagation between hepatocytes. We integrated proteomic data with artificial intelligence-guided image-based phenotyping across several disease stages, revealing a late-stage hepatocyte phenotype characterized by globular protein aggregates and distinct proteomic signatures, notably including elevated TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL) amounts. This phenotype may represent a critical disease progression stage. Our study offers new insights into AATD pathogenesis and introduces a powerful methodology for high-resolution, in situ proteomic analysis of complex tissues. This approach holds potential to unravel molecular mechanisms in various protein misfolding disorders, setting a new standard for understanding disease progression at the single-cell level in human tissue.",

          "abstract": "Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century 1,2 . Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world 3 . However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then 4–7 . Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato ‘Russet Burbank’) using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.",

          "abstract": "Ocean submesoscale (1–100 km) processes and their substantial impact on Earth’s climate system have been increasingly emphasized in recent decades by high-resolution numerical models and regional observations 1–11 . However, the dynamics and energy associated with these processes, including submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal waves, have never been observed from a global perspective. Where, when and how much do these submesoscale processes contribute to the large-scale ocean circulation and climate system? Here we show data from the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite 12 that not only confirm the characteristics of submesoscale eddies and waves but also suggest that their potential impacts on ocean energetics, the marine ecosystem, atmospheric weather and Earth’s climate system are much larger than anticipated. SWOT ushers in a new era of global ocean observing, placing submesoscale ocean dynamics as a critical element of the Earth’s climate system.",

          "abstract": "Impaired differentiation is a hallmark of myeloid malignancies 1,2 . Therapies that enable cells to circumvent the differentiation block, such as all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), are by and large curative in acute promyelocytic leukaemia 3 , but whether ‘differentiation therapy’ is a generalizable therapeutic approach for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and beyond remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of the histone demethylase LSD1 (LSD1i) and the WNT pathway antagonist GSK3 kinase 4 (GSK3i) robustly promotes therapeutic differentiation of established AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, as well as reducing tumour burden and significantly extending survival in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, this combination promotes differentiation by activating genes in the type I interferon pathway via inducing expression of transcription factors such as IRF7 (LSD1i) and the co-activator β-catenin (GSK3i), and their selective co-occupancy at targets such as STAT1, which is necessary for combination-induced differentiation. Combination treatment also suppresses the canonical, pro-oncogenic WNT pathway and cell cycle genes. Analysis of datasets from patients with AML suggests a correlation between the combination-induced transcription signature and better prognosis, highlighting clinical potential of this strategy. Collectively, this combination strategy rewires transcriptional programs to suppress stemness and to promote differentiation, which may have important therapeutic implications for AML and WNT-driven cancers beyond AML.",

We investigate whether these divisions are associated with differences in researchers’ cognitive traits such as tolerance for ambiguity. These differences may guide researchers to prefer different problems, tackle identical problems in different ways, and even reach different conclusions when studying the same problems in the same way. We surveyed 7,973 researchers in psychological sciences and investigated links between what they research, their stances on open questions in the field, and their cognitive traits and dispositions. Our results show that researchers’ stances on scientific questions are associated with what they research and with their cognitive traits. Further, these associations are detectable in their publication histories. These findings support the idea that divisions in scientific fields reflect differences in the researchers themselves, hinting that some divisions may be more difficult to bridge than suggested by a traditional view of data-driven scientific consensus.",

          "abstract": "Translational research suggests that the basolateral part of the amygdala (BLA) computes some of the core processes underlying social preferences, but its precise role in prosocial choice remains unclear. We hypothesize that the human BLA is not necessary for prosocial behavior per se, but fine-tunes the degree of prosociality as a function of the social distance between actor and recipient of a prosocial act. We tested five participants with Urbach–Wiethe disease (UWD) who had isolated, bilateral damage to BLA and compared their behavior in a modified dictator game to that of 16 healthy control participants matched for (neuro-) psychological traits and cultural and socioeconomic background. In this game, participants selected eight people from their social environment and assigned them to variable social distance levels ranging from 1 (emotionally closest person) to 100 (random stranger on the street). They decided how much of a monetary endowment they would share with each person at each social distance. Compared to controls, UWD participants were less generous overall and showed steeper social discounting, that is, their willingness to share declined more sharply with increasing social distance. This difference in social discounting could not be explained by empathy, personality, or social network size. Our data suggest that BLA is critical for resolving the conflict between selfish and altruistic motives during social discounting. This finding underlines the BLA’s role in model-based social cognition, calibrating prosocial behavior based on the social-emotional distance between individuals.",

          "abstract": "Researchers are key contributors to innovation. Their migration results in talent circulation and recombination of ideas. Due to data shortage, little is known about subnational mobility of scientists and the interrelationships between their internal and international migration patterns. We used data on 30+ million Scopus publications of 19+ million authors to infer migration from changes in affiliations. Our publicly shared database of global subnational estimates of migration reveals relevant disparities in the attractiveness of subnational regions. While, at the country level, some countries have acted as a global hub that attracts scholars from throughout the world, at the subnational level, some of their regions have negative net migration rates, with implications for scientific output and regional development, as well as the perpetuation of migration corridors. On average, subnational inequalities in attracting and sending scholars have increased for international but decreased for internal migration. In most countries, there is no single trend such that all subnational regions have been sending or receiving more scholars. Instead, a mix of patterns has been simultaneously at work, on the backdrop of globalization of migration, which is an asymmetric process where specific regions and subpopulations have higher access to international migration. For most subnational regions, when they are attractive for international migrants, they are also attractive for internal migrants, which is not always the case for emigration. Our results have implications for the global circulation of academic talent by adding the dimension of internal migration to “brain drain” and “brain circulation” in international migration.",

Yet, for the most part, these universal deterministic frameworks have been constructed from historical or ethnographic snapshots in time and afford little systematic attention to human institutions or agency. Here, we leverage quantitative, temporally defined archaeological, and ethnographic data from a suite of global regions, most of which transitioned through the process of urbanism and complex hierarchy formation, to examine shifts in degrees of inequality over time. Although broad temporal patterns are evidenced, the regional trends in inequality are neither linear, uniform, nor triggered immediately or mechanically by Malthusian dynamics or scalar increases.",

          "abstract": "There is broad consensus that AI presents risks, but considerable disagreement about the nature of those risks. These differing viewpoints can be understood as distinct narratives, each offering a specific interpretation of AI’s potential dangers. One narrative focuses on doomsday predictions of AI posing long-term existential risks for humanity. Another narrative prioritizes immediate concerns that AI brings to society today, such as the reproduction of biases embedded into AI systems. A significant point of contention is that the “existential risk” narrative, which is largely speculative, may distract from the less dramatic but real and present dangers of AI. We address this “distraction hypothesis” by examining whether a focus on existential threats diverts attention from the immediate risks AI poses today. In three preregistered, online survey experiments (N = 10,800), participants were exposed to news headlines that either depicted AI as a catastrophic risk, highlighted its immediate societal impacts, or emphasized its potential benefits. Results show that i) respondents are much more concerned with the immediate, rather than existential, risks of AI, and ii) existential risk narratives increase concerns for catastrophic risks without diminishing the significant worries respondents express for immediate harms. These findings provide important empirical evidence to inform ongoing scientific and political debates on the societal implications of AI.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between inequality and economic growth is a critical science problem that hinders sustainable development. In 1955, Simon Kuznets hypothesized that rising economic growth raises inequality, which levels off as that growth continues. Kuznets’ “curve,” which is a cornerstone of development economics, was based on data from a small sample of rich capitalist economies. Here, we draw on the GINI database, which includes area measurements of 53,464 residences from 1,176 settlements dating from 21,000 BC to the present, and published data from the Spatial Analysis in Maya Studies (SAMS) group, to radically reevaluate Kuznets’ curve. We use Gini coefficients of residential disparity, a proxy of inequality, and mean residence area, a proxy of productivity, to investigate past sustainable development in the Bronze Age Interaction Zone (BAIZ), the Mundo Maya, and Britain prior to, over the course of, and after the Roman conquest. We interpolate spatial patterns across each zone to statistically evaluate changes in inequality and economic growth. We find a recurring pattern in which phases of sustainable development, a rise in productivity without a rise in inequality, gave way to increasing inequality. These patterns resemble those Branko Milanovic termed “Kuznets’ waves,” albeit at timescales better described as “tides,” which began after the introduction of weight metrology, an early form of economic governance associated with long-distance exchange. We posit that past sustainable development was predicated on balancing reciprocity from the bottom–up with mechanisms like early weight metrology but was repeatedly forestalled as inchoate elites co-opted these mechanisms.",

Second, we examine the degree to which the size and productivity of human networks is systematically related to inequality. Finally, we investigate relationships between productivity and productivity growth distributions for patterns of inequality and development across preindustrial societies. We find that across preindustrial societies residence size distributions provide a reasonable proxy for the distribution of productivity (income, a flow of physical and social resources to the group) and a minimum estimator for the distribution of wealth (a stock of such resources accumulated over time); that scale and productivity affect levels of inequality but account for only a small fraction of the observed variance across societies; and that inequality growth is independent of productivity growth, on average and over time.

          "abstract": "Humans often live in neighborhoods, nested socio-spatial clusters within settlements of varying size and population density. In today’s cities, neighborhoods are often characterized as relatively homogenous and may exhibit segregation along various socioeconomic dimensions. However, even within neighborhoods of similar social or economic status, there is often residential disparity, which in turn impacts perceived inequality. Drawing on the Global Dynamics of Inequality (GINI) project database, we study housing inequality within a sample of neighborhoods using the Gini coefficient of residential unit area and related measures of inequality. We examine patterns of intracommunity inequality within more than 80 settlements from diverse spatiotemporal contexts including some of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia, the Roman Empire, the Classic Maya region, the Central Andes, and the Indus River Basin. Residential disparity differs within and among sectors of these settlements; some neighborhoods exhibit more similarity in residence size, resulting in lower degrees of housing inequality, while other sectors display greater variations in residence size with higher degrees of housing inequality. We observe a meaningful relationship between neighborhood inequality and population size, but not date of foundation or longevity of occupation. The macro-level structural processes associated with varying forms of governance seem to trickle down to the scale of the neighborhood. These findings may help explain why more unequal systems are not necessarily more unstable, as the inequality people experienced in their neighborhoods may generally have been less than that present in the overall settlement.",

          "abstract": "Scholars are divided over the long-term effects that war has had on inequality. Some have argued that conflict grows the gap between rich and poor. Others counter that violence levels out wealth differences. The GINI Project Database is a large global sample of archaeological data on house sizes created to investigate what factors influenced economic inequality over long periods of time, including warfare. Over 39,000 individual residential units were coded as having fortifications present or absent, with about a third in fortified settlements (n = 13,372) and two-thirds in unfortified settlements (n = 25,897). We compared residential disparity (differences in residential unit sizes within a settlement) at sites around the world (n = 770) dating as far back as 10,000 y ago. We found strong support for the expectation that conflict was linked with increasing residential disparity (i.e., wealth inequality), specifically when governance was less collective and the main factor limiting agricultural production was available land. However, we also found long periods, especially in the earliest eras represented in the database, when fortified settlements had residential disparity less than or equal to unfortified settlements. These early societies tended to be more collective with available labor limiting agricultural production. We speculate that in these communities, the relative value of coalition building was higher, whereas in cases where conflict was associated with rising residential disparity, elites found a way to leverage their wealth to protect property. These contradictory models help explain why war co-occurs with increasing inequality in some cases and decreasing inequality in others.",

          "abstract": "The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure commonly used to characterize distributions of socioeconomic quantities. Archaeologists and social scientists have recently adopted this method to analyze ancient inequality by targeting specific proxy variables (e.g., residential unit size, burial data, etc.). Variations in the Gini are then examined in relation to key factors such as time, geography, and subsistence. Yet, Gini coefficients could be obtained across different scales of aggregation, from small neighborhoods within a larger settlement to an ensemble of multiple settlements that are part of the same polity. These different scales of aggregation represent considerable methodological and theoretical challenges, as larger scales might, for example, imply greater social and economic variation within groups and thus affect the Gini coefficients. Furthermore, these issues can also be exacerbated by the idiosyncrasies and limitations of historical and archaeological datasets. This paper discusses the potential and challenges of measuring Gini coefficients at and above the scale of individual archaeological sites, contrasting different approaches and discussing how each can reveal insights into different patterns of past wealth inequality, addressing methodological, empirical, and theoretical implications arising from the multiscalar nature of human interactions.",

In a sample of &gt;1,100 sites and &gt; 47,000 residential units spanning &gt;10,000 y, persistent wealth inequality typically lags the onset of plant cultivation by more than a millennium. It accompanies landscape modifications and subsistence practices in which land (rather than labor) limits production, and growth of hierarchies of settlement size. Gini coefficients are markedly higher through time in settlements at or near the top of such hierarchies; settlements not enmeshed in these systems remain relatively egalitarian even long after plant and animal domestication. We infer that some households in top-ranked settlements were able to exploit the network effects, agglomeration opportunities, and (eventually) political leverage provided by these hierarchies more effectively than others, likely boosted by efficient intergenerational transmission of material resources after increased sedentism made that more common. Since population growth is associated with increased sedentism, more land-limited production, and the appearance and growth of settlement hierarchies, it is deeply implicated in the postdomestication rise of wealth inequality. Governance practices mediate the degree of wealth inequality, as do technical innovations such as the use of animals for portage, horseback riding, and the development of iron smelting.",

          "abstract": "From Rousseau onward, scholars have identified the transition to sedentary agriculture as crucial to the history of wealth inequality. Here, using the GINI project’s global database on disparities in residential size, we examine the effects of important innovations in plant cultivation, animal husbandry, and traction on wealth inequality. Over a series of regional case studies, we find no evidence of major changes in residential disparity before or after these technological innovations became widespread, and where the effects of systemic change are recognizable, they are ambiguous. The introduction of horticulture/farming is accompanied by a slight general increase in inequality, while subsequent innovations tend to have a leveling effect. Although increasing productivity and surplus are critical to generating wealth inequality, nothing in our data suggests that rising productivity alone led to greater wealth inequality.",

          "abstract": "Here, we assess the extent to which land use relating to food acquisition (farming, herding, foraging) and associated value regimes shaped past economic inequality. We consider the hypothesis that land-use systems in which production was limited by heritable material wealth (such as land) sustained higher levels of inequality than those limited by (free) human labor. We address this hypothesis using the Global Dynamics of InequalIty (GINI) project database, estimating economic inequalities based on disparities in residential unit area and storage capacity within sites in different world regions and through time. We find that inequality was significantly greater in land-limited than labor-limited regimes, whether based on residence area or storage capacity, though governance could moderate these differences. Increasing inequality with larger residence and/or site size is associated with underlying shifts from labor- to land-limited economies. Transitions from labor- to land-limited regimes also appear to underlie the development of extended political hierarchies. Increases in inequality after cultivation became common in each hemisphere similarly reflect shifts from labor- to land-limited systems. Land-limited systems in the eastern hemisphere, incorporating animal traction, exhibit an upward trend in inequality over time, while a downward trend in the western hemisphere reflects the lower persistence of land-limited regimes based solely on human labor.",

          "abstract": "Awareness of the threats of climate change is causing distress in increasingly documented ways, with youth particularly affected. Experiences such as climate distress and eco-anxiety have implications for the health and well-being of societies and economies, including individuals’ mental health and future planning, as well as their agency beliefs. Here, we show in a large sample of US youth (n = 2,834, ages 16 to 24) that the majority of US youth experience moderate climate distress and some functional interference from climate-related thoughts and feelings and a neutral to slightly positive sense of agency. They feel concern, interest, disappointment, frustration, sadness, anxiousness, and anger as affective responses to the crisis, and a majority report that their climate awareness may influence their plans for education, travel, and family planning. The key takeaway of this study is that the psychological impacts of climate change in US youth can have either impairing or strengthening effects, especially in the face of increased perceived direct exposure. Results show that self-reported direct experience of climate-related events is associated with increased eco-anxiety, climate distress, and impact of climate change on future planning, but also fortifying responses such as psychological adaptation and agency. These findings highlight the need for health systems and communities to prepare to address increased climate distress and related concerns in US youth as perceived exposure to climate-related hazards increases, in ways that strengthen healthy coping and agency to act. These findings have implications for the mental health of populations, climate behaviors, and life choices of young people experiencing these threats.",

          "authors": "Kenji Itao, Kunihiko Kaneko",
          "abstract": "Social institutions are systems of shared norms and rules that regulate people’s behaviors, often emerging without external enforcement. They provide criteria to distinguish cooperation from defection and establish rules to sustain cooperation, shaped through long-term trial and error. While principles for successful institutions have been proposed, the mechanisms underlying their emergence remain poorly understood. To address this, we introduce the evolutionary dynamical-systems game theory that couples game actions with environmental dynamics and explores the evolution of cognitive frameworks for decision-making. We analyze a minimal model of common-pool resource management, where resources grow naturally and are harvested. Players use decision-making functions to determine whether to harvest at each step, based on environmental and peer monitoring. After evolution, decision-making functions enable players to detect selfish harvesting and punish it by overharvesting, which degrades the environment. This process leads to the self-organization of norms that classify harvesting actions as cooperative, defective, or punitive. The emergent norms for “cooperativeness” and rules of punishment serve as institutions. The environmental and players’ states converge to distinct modes characterized by limit-cycle attractors, representing temporal regularities in socio-ecological systems. These modes remain stable despite slight variations in individual decision-making, illustrating the stability of institutions. We measure evolutionary robustness of decision-making functions, defined as the capacity to keep dominance against invasion. It is revealed that plasticity, the ability to adjust actions to cope with diverse opponents, allows for such robustness. This work introduces foundational concepts in evolutionary dynamical-systems games and elucidates the mechanisms underlying the self-organization of social institutions.",

          "abstract": "Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used extensively to control some major crop pests, but their benefits decrease when pests evolve resistance. Better understanding of the genetic basis of resistance is needed to effectively monitor, manage, and counter pest resistance to Bt crops. Resistance to Bt proteins in at least 11 species of Lepidoptera, including many important crop pests, is associated with naturally occurring mutations that disrupt one or more of three larval midgut proteins: cadherin and ATP-binding cassette proteins ABCC2 and ABCC3. Here, we determined how CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations disrupting cadherin, ABCC2, and ABCC3 singly and in pairs affect resistance to Bt proteins Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa in the Asian corn borer ( Ostrinia furnacalis ), which is the most damaging pest of corn in Asia and is closely related to the European corn borer ( Ostrinia nubilalis ), a major pest in Europe and North America. The results from bioassays of six knockout strains and their parent susceptible strain support a model in which Cry1Ab can kill larvae via one path requiring ABCC2 or another path requiring cadherin and ABCC3, whereas Cry1Fa uses only the first path. The model’s predictions are generally supported by results from genetic linkage analyses and responses to Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa of Sf9 cells and Xenopus oocytes modified to produce cadherin, ABCC2, and ABCC3 singly or in pairs. The functional redundancy identified here for Cry1Ab could sustain its efficacy against O. furnacalis and may exemplify a widespread natural strategy for delaying resistance.",

Accumulating evidence, including data presented here, suggests that the interaction between CXCL9/CXCL10 and CXCR3 not only attracts CXCR3+ T cells but also promotes the induction of IFNγ- high effector/cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, establishing a CXCL9/10-CXCR3-IFNγ self-amplifying cycle that promotes efficient cancer cell killing. One of the homeostatic mechanisms that may limit this cycle is the cleavage of the two N-terminal amino acids of these chemokines by Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP-4). The modified chemokines retain their ability to bind CXCR3 but no longer activate it, becoming competitive antagonists to native CXCL9/CXCL10. To develop a DPP-4-resistant variant, we combined biochemical analysis with computational modeling, demonstrating that the addition of N-terminal glutamine (Q) to CXCL9-Fc and CXCL10-Fc rendered them fully active CXCR3 agonists, yet resistant to DPP-4 cleavage. Preclinical evaluations imply that they offer significant therapeutic potential in cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "The view that words are arbitrary is a foundational assumption about language, used to set human languages apart from nonhuman communication. We present here a study of the alignment between the semantic and phonological structure (systematicity) of American Sign Language (ASL), and for comparison, two spoken languages—English and Spanish. Across all three languages, words that are semantically related are more likely to be phonologically related, highlighting systematic alignment between word form and word meaning. Critically, there is a significant effect of iconicity (a perceived physical resemblance between word form and word meaning) on this alignment: words are most likely to be phonologically related when they are semantically related and iconic. This phenomenon is particularly widespread in ASL: half of the signs in the ASL lexicon are iconically related to other signs, i.e., there is a nonarbitrary relationship between form and meaning that is shared across signs. Taken together, the results reveal that iconicity can act as a driving force behind the alignment between the semantic and phonological structure of spoken and signed languages, but languages may differ in the extent that iconicity structures the lexicon. Theories of language must account for iconicity as a possible organizing principle of the lexicon.",

          "abstract": "TonB-dependent signal transduction is a versatile mechanism observed in gram-negative bacteria that integrates energy-dependent substrate transport with signal relay. In Escherichia coli , the TonB–ExbBD motor complex energizes the TonB-dependent outer membrane transporter FecA, facilitating ferric citrate import. FecA also acts as a sensor, transmitting signals to the cytoplasmic membrane protein FecR, which eventually activates the cytoplasmic sigma factor FecI, driving transcription of the fec operon. Building on our previous finding that FecR undergoes functional maturation through a three-step cleavage process [T. Yokoyama et al., J. Biol. Chem. 296 , 100673 (2021)], we here describe the complete mechanism of FecR-mediated ferric citrate signaling involving FecA and TonB. The cleavage cascade begins with FecR autoproteolysis prior to membrane integration. The soluble C-terminal domain (CTD) fragment of FecR is cotranslocated with the N-terminal domain (NTD) fragment through a twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system–mediated process. In the periplasm, the interaction between the CTD and NTD fragments prevents further cleavage. Binding of ferric citrate induces a conformational change in FecA, exposing its TonB box to the periplasmic space. This structural alteration is transmitted to the interacting FecR CTD via the motor function of TonB, resulting in the release of the CTD blockage from the NTD. Consequently, the successive cleavage of FecR’s NTD is initiated, culminating in the ferric citrate signal–induced activation of fec gene expression. Our findings reveal that the regulation of FecR cleavage, controlled by the TonB–FecA axis, plays a central role in the bacterial response to ferric citrate signals.",

          "abstract": "Crop pathogens often lack exclusive access to their host and must interact with plants concurrently engaged with numerous other symbionts. Here, we demonstrate that the colonization of hosts by plant–mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi can indirectly induce transcriptional responses of a major plant parasite, the nematode Globodera pallida , via a modified host resource profile. A shift in the resource profile of the root, where the parasite feeds, is perceived and responded to by the parasite through transcriptional changes, potentially to optimize resource intake. Specifically, G. pallida react to reduced host-photosynthate influx due to concurrent mycorrhizal-host symbiosis by upregulating the expression of a sugar transporter ( SWEET3 ) in the nematode intestine. We identify this gene’s role in parasite growth and development, regulated by the putative diet-responsive transcription factor Gp-HBL1. Overall, our data unveil a mechanism by which a parasitic animal responds to fluctuations in host plant quality that is induced by a plant–mutualistic fungus, to enhance parasitism and reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Elevated brain levels of the essential metals manganese (Mn), copper, or iron induce motor disease. However, mechanisms of metal-induced motor disease are unclear and treatments are lacking. Elucidating the mechanisms of Mn-induced motor disease is particularly important because occupational and environmental Mn overexposure is a global public health problem. To address this, here we combined unbiased transcriptomics and metabolomics with functional studies in a mouse model of human environmental Mn exposure. Transcriptomics unexpectedly revealed that Mn exposure up-regulated expression of metabolic pathways in the brain and liver. Notably, genes in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, which produces neuroactive metabolites that impact neurological function, were up-regulated by Mn. Subsequent unbiased metabolomics revealed that Mn treatment altered kynurenine pathway metabolites in the brain and liver. Functional experiments then demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway fully rescued Mn-induced motor deficits. Finally, elevated Mn directly activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors, and additional mechanistic assays identified a role for HIF1, but not HIF2, in regulating expression of hepatic kynurenine pathway genes under physiological or Mn exposure conditions, suggesting that Mn-induced HIF1 activation may contribute to the dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in Mn toxicity. These findings (1) identify the upregulation of the kynurenine pathway by elevated Mn as a fundamental mechanism of Mn-induced motor deficits; (2) provide a pharmacological approach to treat Mn-induced motor disease; and (3) should broadly advance understanding of the general principles underlying neuromotor deficits caused by metal toxicity.",

          "authors": "Suman G. Das, Muhittin Mungan, Joachim Krug",
          "abstract": "The evolutionary adaptation of an organism to a stressful environment often comes at the cost of reduced fitness. For example, resistance to antimicrobial drugs frequently reduces growth rate in the drug-free environment. This cost can be compensated without loss in resistance by mutations at secondary sites when the organism evolves again in the stress-free environment. Here, we analytically and numerically study evolution on a simple model fitness landscape to show that compensatory evolution can occur even in the presence of the stress and without the need for mutations at secondary sites. Fitness in the model depends on two phenotypes—the null-fitness defined as the fitness in the absence of stress, and the resistance level to the stress. Mutations universally exhibit antagonistic pleiotropy between the two phenotypes, that is they increase resistance while decreasing the null-fitness. Initial adaptation in this model occurs in a smooth region of the landscape with a rapid accumulation of stress resistance mutations and a concurrent decrease in the null-fitness. This is followed by a second, slower phase exhibiting partial recovery of the null-fitness. The second phase occurs on the rugged part of the landscape and involves the exchange of high-cost resistance mutations for low-cost ones. This process, which we call exchange compensation, is the result of changing epistatic interactions in the genotype as evolution progresses. The model provides general lessons about the tempo and mode of evolution under universal antagonistic pleiotropy with specific implications for drug resistance evolution.",

An understanding of sex chromosome evolution should explain the causes and consequences of such regions in both diploids and haploids. However, haploids have been little studied, even though differences from sex chromosomes in diploids carry implications concerning the evolution of suppressed recombination in diploid organisms, and make predictions about genome evolution in the sex-linked regions of haploids that can now be tested by approaches using genome sequences. I review these ideas, and the current empirical evidence concerning them, in more detail than recent reviews focusing on progress in understanding the mechanisms involved in sex determination. I also discuss evidence that one specific prediction, that genetic degeneration should be minor in haploids, is not upheld. I suggest that this prediction does not take account of all processes leading to gene loss from sex-linked regions and that profound degeneration may evolve if sex-linked genes become duplicated to autosomes, a process that also appears to occur in diploids. I emphasize types of data that are needed to make progress in testing several of the ideas described.",

Here, we used cryoelectron tomography to visualize influenza virions bound to a sialic acid receptor mimic. Overall, receptor binding did not result in significant changes in viral morphology; however, we observed rearrangements of HA trimer organization and orientation. Compared to the even interglycoprotein spacing of unliganded HA trimers, receptor binding promotes HA trimer clustering and the formation of a triplet of trimers. Subtomogram averaging and refinement yielded 8 to 10 Å reconstructions that allowed us to visualize specific contacts between HAs from neighboring trimers and identify molecular features that mediate clustering. Taken together, we present structural evidence that receptor binding triggers clustering of HA trimers, revealing an additional layer of HA dynamics and plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Insights into the molecular processes that drive early development of the human placenta is crucial for our understanding of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, since defects in maturation of its epithelial cell, the trophoblast, have been detected in the severe forms of these diseases. However, key regulators specifying the differentiated trophoblast subtypes of the placenta are only slowly emerging. By using diverse trophoblast cell models, we herein show that the transcriptional coactivator of HIPPO signaling, TAZ, plays a pivotal role in the development of invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), cells that are essential for decidual vessel remodeling and adaption of maternal blood flow to the placenta. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) or protein analyses upon TAZ gene silencing or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout in differentiating trophoblast stem cells, organoids, primary EVTs, choriocarcinoma cells, or villous explant cultures unraveled that the coactivator promoted expression of genes associated with EVT identity, motility, and survival. Accordingly, depletion or chemical inhibition of TAZ, interacting with TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1), impaired EVT differentiation, invasion, and migration and triggered apoptosis in the different trophoblast models. Notably, the coactivator also suppressed cell cycle genes and regulators of trophoblast self-renewal and prevented EVTs from cell fusion in organoids and primary cultures. Moreover, TAZ promoted human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) surface expression and increased NUAK1 kinase in EVTs thereby maintaining its own expression. In summary, the transcriptional coactivator TAZ plays a multifaceted role in the development of the EVT cell lineage by controlling different biological processes that initiate and preserve differentiation.",

In this paper, we use AI to explore the landscape of possible amyloid protofilament structures composed of a single stack of peptides aligned in a parallel, in-register manner. This perspective enables a practical method for predicting protofilament structures of arbitrary sequences: RibbonFold. RibbonFold is adapted from AlphaFold2, incorporating parallel in-register constraints within AlphaFold2’s template module, along with an appropriate polymorphism loss function to address the structural diversity of folds. RibbonFold outperforms AlphaFold2/3 on independent test sets, achieving a mean TM-score of 0.5. RibbonFold proves well-suited to study the polymorphic landscapes of widely studied sequences with documented polymorphisms. The resulting landscapes capture these observed polymorphisms effectively. We show that while well-known amyloid-forming sequences exhibit a limited number of plausible polymorphs on their “solubility” landscape, randomly shuffled sequences with the same composition appear to be negatively selected in terms of their relative solubility. RibbonFold is a valuable framework for structurally characterizing amyloid polymorphism landscapes.",

          "abstract": "In Drosophila ovaries, germ cells differentiate through several stages of cyst development before entering meiosis. This early differentiation program depends on both the stepwise deployment of specific regulatory mechanisms and on maintenance of germline sexual identity. The study of female sterile mutations that result in formation of germ cell tumors has been invaluable in identifying the mechanisms that control these developmental events. Here, we characterize the germ cell–enriched gene bourbon (bbn), null mutants of which cause the formation of a mixture of agametic ovarioles and cystic germ cell tumors. We performed proteomic analysis and found Bbn forms a complex with Ovarian tumor (Otu), a protein previously linked with regulation of the sex determination factor Sex lethal ( Sxl ), and the Drosophila ortholog of c-Myc binding protein (Mycbp). Loss of Mycbp also results in the formation of cystic germ cell tumors. Bbn promotes the stability of Otu and fosters interactions between Otu and Mycbp. Germ cells from bbn and Mycbp mutants display a loss of Sxl expression specifically in the germline. Transgenic rescue experiments show the bbn sterile phenotype is independent from Sxl splicing defects. Further evidence suggests Otu physically interacts with and promotes Sxl protein stability. This function does not depend on Otu’s deubiquitinase activity. Last, we find the human orthologs of Otu and Mycbp, OTUD4, and MYCBP, also physically interact, suggesting conservation of function. Together these data provide insights into how a conserved complex promotes the germline expression of Sxl protein and the differentiation of Drosophila germ cells.",

Its expression pattern makes it an attractive therapeutic target for different B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Despite the clinical success of CD20-targeting antibodies, the biology of the CD20 protein is still not well understood. We investigated CD20 binding partners in the membrane of human B cells using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We identified a molecular interaction between CD70 and CD20, and confirmed this using proximity ligation assays. CD20–CD70 spatiotemporal colocalization was validated at the plasma membrane of B cells using high-resolution microscopy. Cell surface expression of CD70 was found to be enhanced upon CD20 overexpression, suggesting a role for CD20 in stabilizing CD70 at the B cell membrane. Moreover, we observed impaired B-T cell synapse formation and defective recruitment of CD70 to the immunological synapse in the absence of CD20. Impaired synapse formation was confirmed by deleting CD20 in primary B cells, and analysis of B cells from a CD20-deficient patient. Finally, CD20-deletion resulted in diminished T cell activation and cytokine secretion. Together, this study demonstrates that CD20 interacts with CD70 at the B cell membrane, and that CD20 is required for immune synapse formation between B and T cells and consequent T cell activation.",

          "abstract": "Montane ecosystems are crucial for maintaining global biodiversity and function that sustain life on our planet. Yet, these ecosystems are highly vulnerable to changing temperatures and may undergo critical transitions under ongoing climate change. What we do not know is to what extent montane biodiversity and ecosystem services will respond to local temperature variations in a gradual versus abrupt manner across global environments. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a global synthesis, including 4,462 observations from 290 elevation gradients, to investigate how biodiversity (spanning animals and plants) and ecosystem services (including plant production, soil carbon, and fertility) respond to local temperature variations along elevation gradients. We found that nearly one-third of these gradients exhibited abrupt shifts in multiple biodiversity and ecosystem services in response to local variations in temperature along elevation gradients. More specifically, we showed that once a particular local temperature level (~10 °C for mean annual temperature) was reached, even small increases in temperature resulted in dramatic variations in biodiversity and ecosystem services. We further showed that those abrupt shifts in response to local temperature increases were commonly positive for plant and animal diversity, as well as plant production, while soil carbon and fertility more commonly exhibit negative abrupt trends. Our work, based on the most comprehensive empirical evidence available so far, reveals the pervasive abrupt responses of biodiversity and ecosystem services to local temperature variations in montane ecosystems worldwide, highlighting the highly sensitive nature of montane ecosystems in the context of climate change.",

Low levels of SNX10 attenuated HER2 recycling and promoted HER2 trafficking into lysosomes. Furthermore, we found the underlying mechanism of SNX10 in HER2 traffic by regulating the endosomal RAB11A.

          "abstract": "Enchondromas are common bone tumors composed of chondrocytes originating from growth plate cells which can progress to malignant chondrosarcoma. Mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2) are identified in a large proportion of these tumors. IDH enzymes convert isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), an essential component of the citric acid cycle. While mutant IDH enzymes produce 2-hydroxyglutarate, which has epigenetic effects important in tumor initiation, cell maintenance and growth rely on additional factors. Prior work shows that intracellular cholesterol and glycogen are upregulated in mutant IDH chondrocytes. Here, we show that Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3C (PPP1R3C, previously termed Protein Targeting to Glycogen or PTG) is highly expressed in chondrocytes harboring a mutant IDH. Furthermore, Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), transcriptional regulators of sterol biosynthesis, regulate PPP1R3C expression. We found that PPP1R3C regulates glycolysis and glycolytic capacity in chondrocytes. Depletion of PPP1R3C in mouse chondrocytes in vivo suppresses the neoplastic phenotype. The growth plate phenotype associated with the genetic inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis is partially rescued by PPP1R3C overexpression. Taken together, our data show that PPP1R3C integrates cholesterol metabolism and isocitrate dehydrogenase in growth plate and neoplastic chondrocyte metabolism by regulating intracellular glycogen levels.",

Slow waves in the cortex not only characterize SWS but are also used as biological markers for sleep homeostasis, given their rebound after sleep deprivation (SD). Recently, it has been reported that the Australian dragon Pogona vitticeps exhibits a two-stage sleep pattern in the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which includes a homologue of the mammalian claustrum (CLA). It remains unclear whether reptilian e-sleep, which has been characterized by activity outside the cortex, compensates for sleep loss, as observed in mammals. We here report a significant rebound in the local field potential (LFP) after 7 h of SD. Meanwhile, the mean bout length of each sleep state remained unaffected. We further investigated a possible role of the cortex in e-sleep regulation and homeostasis in Pogona and found that although a corticotomy had no obvious effect on the LFP features of baseline sleep, it abolished LFP power rebound in the CLA/DVR after SD. These findings suggest that e-sleep homeostasis is a common feature in amniotes and that the cortex is involved in regulating activity rebounds in reptiles and mammals.",

          "abstract": "Preparing to rapidly respond to emerging infectious diseases is critical. SpillOver: Viral Risk Ranking is an open-source tool developed to assess the risk of novel wildlife-origin viruses spilling over from animals to humans and spreading in human populations. Several risk factors used by the tool depend on evidence of previous zoonotic spillover itself or sustained transmission in humans. Therefore, we reanalyzed the Ranking Comparison after removing eight of the 31 risk factors that require postspillover knowledge and compared the adjusted risk rankings to the originals. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve deteriorated from 0.94 for the original risk scores to 0.73 for the adjusted ones for predicting the classification as a human virus. We also compared the mean and SD of the risk scores for the human and non-human viruses at the risk factor level. Most excluded spillover-dependent risk factors had dissimilar means between the human and non-human virus classifications, but nonspillover-dependent risk factors frequently showed similar means between the two classifications. The original formulation of the tool depended on the inclusion of spillover-dependent risk factors to quantitatively assess the risk of zoonotic spillover for a novel virus. Future iterations of the tool should omit such risk factors and consider other nonspillover-dependent risk factors to ensure that the tool is fit for risk prediction of novel viruses.",

          "abstract": "Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocyte population that play critical roles in neuroinflammation following central nervous system (CNS) injury. CD177, a glycoprotein on neutrophils, is emerging as an important immune regulator which can fundamentally affect multiple human inflammatory diseases. However, the role and regulatory mechanism of CD177 glycobiology of neutrophils in neuroinflammation remain elusive. Here, we show that CD177 + neutrophils expand significantly and infiltrate the injured brain following CNS injury both in the human and mouse. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic approaches, we find CD177 + neutrophils as an anti-inflammatory subset that is critical for modulating neuroinflammation after CNS injury. We further identify St3gal5, a sialyltransferase (ST), that can mediate the sialylation and cell surface presentation of glyco-CD177 on neutrophils. Glycoproteomics reveal downregulated sialylation levels in St3gal5-deficient neutrophils. Neutrophil-specific depletion of St3gal5 prevents the cell surface presentation of CD177 on brain-infiltrated neutrophils and exacerbates neuroinflammation. Administration of the FDA-approved anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA), an St3gal5 upregulator, promotes the glycosylation of neutrophils and attenuates neuroinflammation following CNS injury. Our study reveals a glycoimmuno-regulatory effect of neutrophils and suggests VPA as a neutrophil glycobiology targeting approach to combat neuroinflammation following CNS injury.",

MtCLE16 is expressed in root cells colonized by AM fungi (AMF) and its overexpression within colonized tissues increases arbuscule abundance by finetuning their growth and lifespan. Functional and transcriptomic analyses reveal that MtCLE16 acts via the M. truncatula pseudokinase CORYNE (MtCRN) and suppresses the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in roots, thereby attenuating immune responses and promoting root colonization by mutualistic AM fungi. Notably, AMF also express MtCLE16-like peptides. We show that the Rhizophagus irregularis MtCLE16-like peptide, RiCLE1, also attenuates ROS and promotes AMF colonization via MtCRN. This finding suggests that RiCLE1 can interfere with the MtCLE16-MtCRN signaling module of host roots to benefit the fungus.

Here, we studied the effects of point mutations in the RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli over a 15,000-generation adaptive trajectory. Fitness effects of both beneficial and deleterious mutations were attenuated in fitter backgrounds. In contrast, pleiotropic effects became more severe and widespread with greater adaptation. These results show that trade-offs between robustness and fragility can evolve in regulatory networks, regardless of whether driven by adaptive or nonadaptive processes.

Here, we focused on an isogenic pair of reoviruses that have opposing infection outcomes after microbiota depletion. Microbiota depletion reduces infection by reovirus strain T3SA+ but increases infection by strain T3SA−. These strains differ by a single amino acid polymorphism in the σ1 attachment protein, which confers sialic acid binding to T3SA+. Sialic acid binding facilitates T3SA+ infection of intestinal endothelial cells, while T3SA− inefficiently infects intestinal epithelial cells due to restriction by microbiota-driven, host-derived type III interferon responses.

          "abstract": "Most bioorthogonal photouncaging reactions preferentially occur in polar environments to accommodate biological applications in the aqueous cellular milieu. However, they are not precisely designed to chemically adapt to the diverse microenvironments of the cell. Herein, we report a hydrophobic photouncaging reaction with tailored photolytic kinetics toward solvent polarity. Structural modulations of the aminobenzoquinone-based photocage reveal the impact of cyclic ring size, steric substituent, and electronic substituent on the individual uncaging kinetics ( k H2O and k dioxane ) and polarity preference ( k dioxane / k H2O ). Rational incorporation of optimized moieties leads to up to 20.2-fold nonpolar kinetic selectivity ( k dioxane / k H2O ). Further photochemical spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations together uncover the mechanism underlying the polarity-dependent uncaging kinetics. The uncaged ortho-quinone methide product bears covalent reactivity toward diverse nucleophiles of a protein revealed by tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, we demonstrate the application of such lipophilic photouncaging chemistry toward selective labeling and profiling of proteins in proximity to lipid droplets inside human fatty liver tissues. Together, this work studies the solvent polarity effects of a photouncaging reaction and chemically adapts it toward suborganelle-targeted protein proximity labeling and profiling.",

          "abstract": "Trait regression and loss have occurred repeatedly in numerous lineages in response to environmental changes. In parasitoid wasps, a megadiverse group of hymenopteran insects, yolk protein reduction or loss has been observed in many species, likely linked to the transition from ectoparasitism to endoparasitism. However, the genetic basis of this trait and the impact of its loss on genome evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 64 hymenopteran insects. The conserved insect yolk protein gene vitellogenin ( Vg ) underwent five independent loss events in four families, involving 23 of the analyzed endoparasitoid species. Whole-genome alignment suggested that Vg loss occurred during genome rearrangement events. Analysis of Vg receptor gene ( VgR ) loss, selection, and structural variation in lineages lacking Vg demonstrated functional biases in the patterns of gene loss. The ectoparasitism to endoparasitism transition did not appear to be the primary driver of Vg loss or the subsequent VgR evolution. Together, these findings reveal the genomic changes underlying a unique trait loss in parasitoid wasps. More broadly, this study enhances our understanding of yolk protein loss evolution outside the class Mammalia, highlighting a potential evolutionary trend arising from the availability of an alternative nutrient source for embryonic development.",

          "abstract": "Maternal separation (MS), a chronic stress event in early life, impairs myelination in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and leads to PFC cognitive disorders. It remains largely unclear how such deficits are mediated. Here, we show that peripheral CD4 + T cells play an essential role in mediating the destructive effects of MS on medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) myelination and cognitive functions in mice. Offspring mice with MS experience (MS mice) exhibited an increase in CD4 + T cells and xanthine levels in peripheral blood and a severe deficit in mPFC-dependent cognitive functions such as working memory, social interaction, and anxiety/depression emotion regulation, along with a decrease in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the mPFC. These phenotypes were rescued upon treatment with the antibody neutralizing peripheral CD4 + T cells. Rag1 −/− immunodeficient mice receiving transplantation of CD4 + T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of MS mice showed similar phenotypes as observed in MS mice. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a rich expression of adenosine receptor A1 (A1) in OPCs in the mPFC, and the A1-expressing OPCs decreased in the Rag1 −/− mice receiving CD4 + T cell transplantation. The present study demonstrates a causal link between peripheral CD4 + T cells and MS-induced prefrontal cortical hypomyelination and cognitive dysfunction, and such a link is probably mediated via xanthine–adenosine receptor A1 signaling in OPCs.",

          "abstract": "Cellular signaling processes can elicit powerful responses and may need to be amplified to be efficient or dampened to prevent overstimulation. Therefore, they often involve autoregulatory feedbacks. Receptor kinase signaling pathways are abundant in plants, where they convey the presence of both exogenous and endogenous ligands. Among them, endogenous CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide signaling acts in an inherently quantitative manner to determine the size of stem cell pools and direct tissue formation. The plant-specific MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED KINASE REGULATOR (MAKR) family proteins act downstream of receptor kinases. Among the seven family members in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), MAKR5 conveys CLE45 signaling downstream of the receptor kinase BARELY ANY MERISTEM 3 (BAM3). Here, we show that the distinct MAKR5 mode of action can only be fully mimicked by MAKR3, suggesting functional diversification of MAKR proteins. Moreover, we find that CLE45-stimulated and BAM3-dependent MAKR5 recruitment to the plasma membrane can be triggered independent of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases that act downstream of BAM3 and depends on membrane charge. The CLE45-BAM3-triggered enhancement of MAKR5 production and plasma membrane association is mediated by autoregulatory feedback on MAKR5 mRNA translation, for which the 5′ UTR is required. At the same time, this signal amplification is dampened through CLE45-stimulated MAKR5 phosphorylation, which inactivates MAKR5, enhances its turnover, and impinges on MAKR5 mRNA levels. In summary, our results reveal a nontranscriptional incoherent feedforward loop in which receptor kinase signaling is amplified via ligand-triggered translation of a signal enhancer’s mRNA yet also balanced via ligand-triggered inactivation of the signal enhancer protein.",

          "abstract": "Unraveling the relationship between structural information and the dynamic properties of supercooled liquids is one of the great challenges of physics. Dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by the propensity of particles, is often used as a proxy for dynamic slowing. Over the years, significant efforts have been made to capture the structural variations linked to dynamic heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. In this work, we present an innovative unsupervised machine learning protocol based on time-lagged canonical correlation analysis or time-lagged autoencoder to autonomously identify a key order parameter (OP) for the amorphous structures of the Kob-Andersen glass former. The OP is constructed by integrating numerous classical structural descriptors and represents the component with the strongest short-term correlation on a timescale thousands of times shorter than the relaxation time. Strikingly, this OP demonstrates a remarkable correlation with the propensity at long times, significantly outperforming traditional unsupervised models and rivaling supervised models. This demonstrates that fluctuations of structural descriptors contain sufficient information about the long-time dynamic heterogeneity. The most important structural features are the density distributions at mid-range. As a consequence, the OP also exhibits excellent transferability in capturing dynamic heterogeneity across a wide temperature range and greatly facilitates the evaluation of descriptor importance, highlighting its potential for broader application to other glassy systems.",

          "abstract": "Various pathological characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) stem from abnormalities in brain resident immune cells, specifically microglia, to prune unnecessary synapses or neural connections during early development. Animal models of ASD exhibit an abundance of synapses in different brain regions, which is strongly linked to the appearance of ASD behaviors. Overexpression of CD47 on neurons acts as a “don’t eat me” signal, safeguarding synapses from inappropriate pruning by microglia. Indeed, CD47 overexpression occurs in 16p11.2 deletion carriers, causing decreased synaptic phagocytosis and the manifestation of ASD characteristics. However, the role of CD47 in synaptic pruning impairment leading to ASD phenotypes in the 16p11.2 deletion mouse model is unclear. Moreover, whether blocking CD47 can alleviate ASD mice’s behavioral deficits remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a strong link between increased CD47 expression, decreased microglia phagocytosis capacity, and increased impairment in social novelty preference in the 16p11.2 deletion mice. The reduction in microglia phagocytosis caused a rise in excitatory synapses and transmission in the prefrontal cortex of 16p11.2 deletion mice. Importantly, blocking CD47 using a specific CD47 antibody or reducing CD47 expression using a specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) enhanced the microglia phagocytosis and reduced excitatory transmission. Reduction in CD47 expression improved social novelty preference deficits in 16p11.2 mice. These findings demonstrate that CD47 is associated with the ASD phenotypes in the 16p11.2 deletion mice and could be a promising target for the development of treatment for ASD.",

          "abstract": "Specialized metabolism plays a central role in how plants cope with both biotic and abiotic stresses in order to survive and reproduce within dynamic and challenging environments. One recently described class of plant-specific, ribosomally synthesized, and posttranslationally modified peptides are the burpitides, which are characterized by the installation of distinct sidechain macrocycles by enzymes known as burpitide cyclases. While they are found across many plant families and exhibit diverse bioactivities, little is known about their evolution or how new variants arise. Here, we present the identification of a burpitide cyclase, resurrected from a defunct pseudogene from the model organism Nicotiana attenuata , the coyote tobacco. By repairing the pseudogene ΨNatBURP2 and expressing it heterologously in Nicotiana benthamiana , we successfully reconstituted its original enzymatic activity. As an autocatalytic peptide cyclase, it installs a unique C–C bond between the tyrosine side chain and a specific backbone α-carbon of a heptapeptide core motif, resulting in burpitides dubbed “nanamins.” Despite its pseudogenization in N. attenuata , we found that the closely related species, Nicotiana clevelandii , retains the wild-type gene and produces nanamins. Phylogenetic analyses and targeted mutagenesis experiments reveal that this chemotype must have evolved from the duplication and neofunctionalization of a more promiscuous ancestral gene. This work highlights how novel peptide chemotypes may rapidly emerge and disappear in plants, while expanding the molecular toolkit for engineering novel peptides with applications in agriculture and drug discovery.",

The virus distinguishes itself by the ability to replicate to high titers and transmit efficiently in a wide variety of hosts in diverse climatic environments. Fortunately, transmission to and between humans is scarce. Yet, if such an event were to occur, it could spark a pandemic as humans are immunologically naïve to H5 viruses. A significant determinant of transmission to and between humans is the ability of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein to shift from an avian-type to a human-type receptor specificity. Here, we demonstrate that a 2016 2.3.4.4e virus HA can convert to human-type receptor binding via a single Q226L mutation, in contrast to a cleavage-modified 2016 2.3.4.4b virus HA. Using glycan arrays, X-ray structural analyses, tissue- and direct glycan binding, we show that L133a Δ and 227Q are vital for this phenotype. Thus, whereas the 2.3.4.4e virus HA only needs a single amino acid mutation, the modified 2016 2.3.4.4b HA was not easily converted to human-type receptor specificity.",

The impact of RRM2B deficiency on dNTP pools in nondividing tissues remains unclear. Using a mouse knockout model, we demonstrate that RRM2B deficiency selectively depletes dATP and dGTP, while dCTP and dTTP levels remain stable or increase. This depletion pattern resembles the effects of hydroxyurea, an inhibitor that reduces overall RNR activity. Mechanistically, we propose that the depletion of dATP and dGTP arises from their preferred degradation by the dNTPase SAMHD1 and the lower production rate of dATP by RNR. Identifying dATP and dGTP depletion as a hallmark of RRM2B deficiency provides insights for developing nucleoside bypass therapies to alleviate the effects of RRM2B mutations.",

          "abstract": "Although cochlear implants (CIs) provide valuable auditory information to more than one million profoundly deaf patients, these devices remain inadequate in conveying fine timing cues. Early deaf patients in particular struggle to use interaural time differences (ITDs) for spatial hearing and auditory scene analysis. Why CI patients experience these limitations remains controversial. One possible explanation, which we investigate here, is that the stimulation by clinical CIs is inappropriate, as it encodes temporal features of sounds only in the envelope of electrical pulse trains, not the pulse timing. We have recently demonstrated that early deaf, adult implanted rats fitted with bilateral CIs that deliver carefully timed pulses routinely develop sensitivity to very small ITDs. Here we show that, while the early deafened mammalian auditory pathway can innately easily resolve pulse timing ITDs as small as 80 µs, it is many times less sensitive to the ITDs of pulse train envelopes. Our results indicate that the stimulation strategies in current clinical use do not present ITD cues in a manner that the inexperienced auditory pathway is highly sensitive to. This may deprive early deaf CI patients of the opportunity to hone their submillisecond temporal processing skills as they learn to hear through their prosthetic devices.",

To do so, we construct a counterfactual version of observed global sea surface temperatures since 1940, corresponding to a stationary climate without the effect of long-term increasing global temperatures, and use it to calculate the contribution of global air temperature rise on the intensity and persistence of marine heatwaves. We determine that global warming is responsible for nearly half of these extreme events and that, on a global average, it has led to a three-fold increase in the number of days per year that the oceans experience extreme surface heat conditions. We also show that global warming is responsible for an increase of 1 ° C in the maximum intensity of the events.

This bias in the visual scene is associated with a bias in visual sensitivity in adults. Although infants must learn to function in this biased environment, their immature motor control prevents them from consistently orienting themselves, relative to gravity. This study therefore asked whether cardinal orientations dominate human visual experience from early infancy or only from later in development, as motor control improves. We analyze video clips from head-mounted cameras, showing the egocentric perspective of 75 infants (1 to 12 mo) in their home environments in two communities (Indiana, USA vs. Tamil Nadu, India). We measured the distribution of orientations in each frame of these videos and found that horizontal and vertical orientations were overrepresented in infants from both countries. A cardinal orientation bias was evident even in the egocentric view of the youngest infants (3 wk) and became more prominent during the subsequent weeks of development. The early presence of a cardinal orientation bias in infants’ visual input may serve as a consistent cue to gravity and ground planes, potentially influencing motor development and contributing to the formation of sensory, perceptual, and cognitive biases.",

Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteinase (MASP)-2 is essential for activation of the complement lectin pathway, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal IRI and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target. We developed a new, affinity-enhanced MASP-2 inhibitor, EVO24, by directed evolution of the D2 domain of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor. EVO24 was fused with a human IgG1-Fc to create the homodimer EVO24L, which potently and selectively inhibited the lectin pathway in human and mouse serum in vitro. EVO24L was tested in a mouse model of unilateral warm renal IRI. EVO24L administered before and after ischemia significantly protected against IRI, with improved renal function as well as reduced tubular injury and inflammatory cell infiltration at 24 h compared to vehicle-treated mice. Immunofluorescence analyses showed reduced deposition of complement components (C3d, C4d, and C9) and reduced expression of VCAM-1, indicating a decrease in complement activation and endothelial cell activation. Additionally, EVO24L treatment lowered plasma levels of complement C5a, hyaluronan (a marker of endothelial glycocalyx shedding), and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. Our findings indicate that EVO24L inhibits acute inflammatory responses in renal IRI by blocking the lectin pathway, confirming the important role of this pathway in acute ischemic kidney injury and warranting further investigation of EVO24L in clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "Conjugation, the major driver of the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes, relies on a conjugation pilus for DNA transfer. Conjugative pili, such as the F-pilus, are dynamic tubular structures, composed of a polymerized pilin, that mediate the initial donor–recipient interactions, a process known as mating pair formation (MPF). IncH are low-copy-number plasmids, traditionally considered broad host range, which are found in bacteria infecting both humans and animals. The reference IncHI1 plasmid R27, isolated from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, encodes the conjugative H-pilus subunit TrhA containing 74 residues after cleavage of the signal sequence. Here, we show that the H-pilus forms long filamentous structures that mediate MPF and describe its cryoelectron-microscopic (cryo-EM) structure at 2.2 Å resolution. Like the F pilus, the H-pilin subunits form helical assemblies with phospholipid molecules at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. While there were previous reports that the T-pilus from Agrobacterium tumefaciens was composed of cyclic subunits, three recent cryo-EM structures of the T-pilus found no such cyclization. Here, we report that the H-pilin is cyclic, with a covalent bond connecting the peptide backbone between the N and C termini. Both the cryo-EM map and mass spectrometry revealed cleavage of the last five residues of the pilin, followed by cyclization via condensation of the amine and carboxyl residues. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that loss of cyclization abolished pilus biogenesis and efficient plasmid transfer. The cyclic nature of the pilin could stabilize the pilus and may explain the high incidence of IncH plasmid dissemination.",

However, the mechanism by which a vessel splits into two is poorly understood. Particularly vexing is formation of the hallmark transluminal endothelial cell bridge. How an endothelial cell comes to cross a flowing lumen rather than line it is enigmatic. To elucidate this, we used a microvessel-on-a-chip strategy, creating a microconduit coherently lined with flow-sensitive endothelial cells but in which transluminal bridges also formed. Bridge morphologies ranged from filamentous strand to multicellular columns with a central extracellular matrix-containing core. These bridge architectures were found to recapitulate those in microvessels in embryos, tumors, diseased organs, and the dermis of patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Time-lapse, multiplane, three-dimensional (3D) microscopy of the microphysiologic conduit revealed that bridges arose from endothelial cells oriented orthogonal to flow that partially released from the wall while retaining attachments at the ends. This delamination process was blocked by hyperactivation of Rho and augmented by interventions that weaken cell–substrate interactions, including inhibiting nonmuscle myosin II and blocking α5ß1 integrin. Thus, endothelial cells can leave their monolayer and transect a flowing lumen through controlled delamination. This previously unrecognized lumen entry program could explain the launch of intussusceptive angiogenesis and opens a framework for intervening.",

          "abstract": "Natural transformation (NT) represents one of the major modes of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial species. During NT, cells can take up free DNA from the environment and integrate it into their genome by homologous recombination. While NT has been studied for &gt;90 y, the molecular details underlying this recombination remain poorly understood. Recent work has demonstrated that ComM is an NT-specific hexameric helicase that promotes recombinational branch migration in Gram-negative bacteria. How ComM is loaded onto the postsynaptic recombination intermediate during NT, however, remains unclear. Another NT-specific recombination mediator protein that is ubiquitously conserved in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is DprA. Here, we uncover that DprA homologs in Gram-negative species contain a C-terminal winged helix domain that is predicted to interact with ComM by AlphaFold. Using Helicobacter pylori and Vibrio cholerae as model systems, we demonstrate that ComM directly interacts with the DprA winged-helix domain, and that this interaction is critical for DprA to recruit ComM to the recombination site to promote branch migration during NT. These results advance our molecular understanding of recombination during this conserved mode of horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, they demonstrate how structural modeling can help uncover unexpected interactions between well-studied proteins to provide deep mechanistic insight into the molecular coordination required for their activity.",

          "abstract": "Microbial ecosystems are commonly modeled by fixed interactions between species in steady exponential growth states. However, microbes in exponential growth often modify their environments so strongly that they are forced out of the growth state into stressed, nongrowing states. Such dynamics are typical of ecological succession in nature and serial-dilution cycles in the laboratory. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model, the Community State Model, to gain insight into the dynamic coexistence of microbes due to changes in their physiological states during cyclic succession. Our model specifies the growth preference of each species along a global ecological coordinate, taken to be the biomass density of the community, but is otherwise agnostic to specific interactions (e.g., nutrient starvation, stress, aggregation), in order to focus on self-consistency conditions on combinations of physiological states, “community states,” in a stable ecosystem. We identify three key features of such dynamical communities that contrast starkly with steady-state communities: enhanced community stability through staggered dominance of different species in different community states, increased tolerance of community diversity to fast growing species dominating distinct community states, and increased requirement of growth dominance by late-growing species. These features, derived explicitly for simplified models, are proposed here as principles aiding the understanding of complex dynamical communities. Our model shifts the focus of ecosystem dynamics from bottom–up studies based on fixed, idealized interspecies interaction to top–down studies based on accessible macroscopic observables such as growth rates and total biomass density, enabling quantitative examination of community-wide characteristics.",

In grasslands, mean aboveground plant biomass is closely related to MAP, but how this relationship changes after enrichment with multiple nutrients remains unclear. We hypothesized the global biomass–MAP relationship becomes steeper with an increasing number of added nutrients, with increases in steepness corresponding to the form of interaction among added nutrients and with increased mediation by changes in plant community diversity. We measured aboveground plant biomass production and species diversity in 71 grasslands on six continents representing the global span of grassland MAP, diversity, management, and soils. We fertilized all sites with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium with micronutrients in all combinations to identify which nutrients limited biomass at each site. As hypothesized, fertilizing with one, two, or three nutrients progressively steepened the global biomass–MAP relationship. The magnitude of the increase in steepness corresponded to whether sites were not limited by nitrogen or phosphorus, were limited by either one, or were colimited by both in additive, or synergistic forms. Unexpectedly, we found only weak evidence for mediation of biomass–MAP relationships by plant community diversity because relationships of species richness, evenness, and beta diversity to MAP and to biomass were weak or opposing. Site-level properties including baseline biomass production, soils, and management explained little variation in biomass–MAP relationships. These findings reveal multiple nutrient colimitation as a defining feature of the global grassland biomass–MAP relationship.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly change morphology. What controls mitochondrial morphology however remains unresolved. Using actively respiring yeast cells growing in distinct carbon sources, we find that mitochondrial morphology and activity are unrelated. Cells can exhibit fragmented or networked mitochondrial morphology in different nutrient environments independent of mitochondrial activity. Instead, mitochondrial morphology is controlled by the intracellular redox state, which itself depends on the nature of electron entry into the electron transport chain (ETC)—through complex I/II or directly to coenzyme Q/cytochrome c. In metabolic conditions where direct electron entry is high, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, resulting in an oxidized cytosolic environment and rapid mitochondrial fragmentation. Decreasing direct electron entry into the ETC by genetic or chemical means, or reducing the cytosolic environment rapidly restores networked morphologies. Using controlled disruptions of electron flow to alter ROS and redox state, we demonstrate minute-scale, reversible control between networked and fragmented forms in an activity-independent manner. Mechanistically, the fission machinery through Dnm1 responds in minute-scale to redox state changes, preceding the change in mitochondrial form. Thus, the metabolic state of the cell and its consequent cellular redox state actively control mitochondrial form.",

In the last decade, the problem of understanding its performance cost with respect to standard GD has received remarkable attention from the research community, which has led to upper bounds on the excess population risk R P in different learning settings. However, such bounds typically degrade with overparameterization, i.e., as the number of parameters p gets larger than the number of training samples n —a regime which is ubiquitous in current deep-learning practice. As a result, the lack of theoretical insights leaves practitioners without clear guidance, leading some to reduce the effective number of trainable parameters to improve performance, while others use larger models to achieve better results through scale. In this work, we show that in the popular random features model with quadratic loss, for any sufficiently large p , privacy can be obtained for free, i.e., R P = o ( 1 ) , not only when the privacy parameter ε has constant order but also in the strongly private setting ε = o ( 1 ) . This challenges the common wisdom that overparameterization inherently hinders performance in private learning.",

How premotor circuits regulate locomotor statistics is not clear. Here, we analyze and model locomotor statistics and their modulation by attractive food odor in walking Drosophila . Food odor evokes three motor regimes in flies: baseline walking, upwind running during odor, and search behavior following odor loss. During search, we find that flies adopt higher angular velocities and slower ground speeds and turn for longer periods in the same direction. We further find that flies adopt periods of different mean ground speed and that these state changes influence the length of odor-evoked runs. We next developed a simple model of neural locomotor control that suggests that contralateral inhibition plays a key role in regulating the statistical features of locomotion. As the fly connectome predicts decussating inhibitory neurons in the premotor lateral accessory lobe (LAL), we gained genetic access to a subset of these neurons and tested their effects on behavior. We identified one population whose activation induces all three signature of local search and that regulates angular velocity at odor offset. We identified a second population, including a single LAL neuron pair, that bidirectionally regulates ground speed. Together, our work develops a biologically plausible computational architecture that captures the statistical features of fly locomotion across behavioral states and identifies neural substrates of these computations.",

However, its clinical use is threatened by the emergence of bedaquiline-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Bedaquiline targets mycobacterial ATP synthase but the predominant route to clinical bedaquiline resistance is via upregulation of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump due to mutations that inactivate the transcriptional repressor Rv0678 . Here, we show that the MmpS5L5 efflux pump reduces susceptibility to bedaquiline as well as its new, more potent derivative TBAJ-876 and other antimicrobial substrates, including clofazimine and the DprE1 inhibitors PBTZ-169 and OPC-167832. Furthermore, the increased resistance of Rv0678 mutants stems entirely from increased MmpS5L5 expression. These results highlight the potential of a pharmacological MmpS5L5 inhibitor to increase drug efficacy. Verapamil, primarily used as a calcium channel inhibitor, is known to inhibit diverse efflux pumps and to potentiate bedaquiline and clofazimine activity in M. tuberculosis . Here, we show that verapamil potentiates the activity of multiple diverse MmpS5L5 substrates. Using biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that verapamil does not exert this effect by acting as a disruptor of the protonmotive force used to power MmpS5L5, as previously proposed, suggesting that verapamil inhibits the function of the MmpS5L5 pump. Finally, norverapamil, the major verapamil metabolite, which has greatly reduced calcium channel activity, has equal potency in reducing resistance to MmpS5L5 substrates. Our findings highlight verapamil’s potential for enhancing bedaquiline TB treatment, for preventing acquired resistance to bedaquiline and other MmpS5L5 substrates, while also providing the impetus to identify additional MmpS5L5 inhibitors.",

Using a genetic approach in female mice, we deposited uropathogenic Escherichia coli into the distal urethra to establish a model of ascending urinary tract infection that progresses to the bladder within 4 h. We show that urethral neuroendocrine cells (UNECs), and the serotonin they synthesize, protect the bladder from bacterial colonization. We tested the hypothesis that serotonin initiates urethral contraction to expel ascending bacteria. We identified transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1, a noncanonical lipopolysaccharide receptor, in human and mouse UNECs and localized the serotonin receptors (HTR) 2B and 3, as well as the calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1) to the pacemaker cells of the human and mouse urethra, the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). HTR2B or ANO1 activation is sufficient for urethral contraction and is required for serotonin-induced mouse urethral contraction. Our results support the hypothesis that the urethra actively surveils its environment and responds to an ascending pathogen by evoking UNECs and ICC to induce urethral contraction and pathogen expulsion.",

          "abstract": "Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the core vector control interventions available to malaria control programs. Normative and scientific guidance has long held that very high IRS coverage (at least 80 to 85% houses sprayed) is necessary to provide community protection, but there is little evidence backing these recommendations, in large part due to the operational and ethical concerns that conducting appropriate trials of differing IRS coverage levels would raise. The present study leverages data from four years of targeted IRS implementation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, to estimate a dose–response curve of IRS coverage. Due to the observational nature of the data, a double robust causal inference technique was utilized. The results suggest that at all spatial scales examined a threshold providing community protection was reached at much lower coverage levels than previously assumed (30 to 50%). Sensitivity analysis corroborated this result across multiple methods, but there was less agreement on whether extremely high coverage ( ≥ 85%) has additional benefit. A secondary analysis of the impact of changing operational coverage targets found that significantly reducing coverage targets (to 30 to 60%) could provide nearly the same protection as maintaining the existing 80% target in Bioko. While these findings are limited in strength by the observational nature of the data and may be specific to the context of Bioko Island, they raise important questions for further research on how IRS coverage impacts epidemiological outcomes and on how malaria control programs should set programmatic IRS coverage targets.",

Mutational analyses of HSV-2 UL13 Tyr-162 suggested that phosphorylation of UL13 Tyr-162 reduced the phosphorylation of all UL13 substrates tested in HSV-2-infected cells. These findings suggested that HSV-2 UL13 mimicked the regulatory mechanism of CDKs and that this CHPK has regulatory and functional mimicry with CDKs. Furthermore, phosphorylation of HSV-2 UL13 Tyr-162 was suggested to be required for the downregulation of viral replication and pathogenicity, specifically in the brains of mice, and for efficient viral recurrence in guinea pigs.

Integrated transcriptome, lipidomic, metabolomic, and functional analyses demonstrated that MICs depend on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) fueled by fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the lipid-rich LN microenvironment. Mechanistically, the NRF2-SLC7A11 axis promotes glutathione synthesis to mitigate oxidative stress, thereby enhancing stress resistance and metastatic potential of MICs. Inhibition of NRF2-SLC7A11 reduced LN metastasis and sensitized tumors to cisplatin. Clinically, elevated NRF2-SLC7A11 expression was observed in tumors, with high expression correlating with LN metastasis, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

Here, through a combination of experiments and simulations, we show how nonreciprocal forces propel and fission dislocations formed in hydrodynamically driven Wigner crystals. We explain how dislocation motility results in the continuous reshaping of grain-boundary networks, and how their fission reaction melts driven crystals from their interfaces.

In contrast to regular snapping, countersnapping manifests itself in a sudden shortening transition under increasing tension or a sudden increase in tensile force under increasing extension. We design these structures by combining basic flexible building blocks that leverage geometric nonlinearities. We demonstrate experimentally that countersnapping can be employed to obtain new exotic properties, such as unidirectional stick–slip motion, switchable stiffness that does not otherwise affect the state of the system, and passive resonance avoidance. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining multiple countersnapping elements allows sequential stiffness switching for elements coupled in parallel, or instantaneous collective switching for elements in series. By expanding the repertoire of realizable elastic instabilities, our work opens routes to principles for mechanical sensing, computation, and actuation.",

          "abstract": "Forming and forgetting memories shape our self-awareness and help us face future challenges. Therefore, understanding how memories are formed and how different memories interact in the brain is important. Previous studies have shown that thirsty flies sense humidity through ionotropic receptors, which help them locate water sources. Here, we showed that thirsty flies can be trained to associate specific odors with humidity to form a humidity memory that lasts for 30 min after association. Humidity memory formation requires the Ir93a and Ir40a ionotropic receptors, which are essential for environmental humidity sensing. Water memory takes precedence, leading to the forgetting of humidity memory by activating a small subset of dopaminergic neurons called protocerebral anterior medial (PAM)-γ4, that project to the restricted region of the mushroom body (MB) γ lobes. Adult-stage-specific silencing of Dop2R dopaminergic receptors in MB γ neurons prolongs humidity memory for 3 h. Live-brain calcium imaging and dopamine sensor studies revealed significantly increased PAM-γ4 neural activity after odor/humidity association, suggesting its role in forgetting the humidity memory. Our results suggest that overlapping neural circuits are responsible for the acquisition of water memory and forgetting humidity memory in thirsty flies.",

          "abstract": "Definitions of sustainability commonly stress both systemic continuity and equality over time. However, the degree to which these two sides of sustainability might be related has not been systematically investigated. Recent theoretical and methodological insights have provided archaeologists with new tools for investigating sustainability in premodern societies. Here, we use Gini coefficients on residence size measurements as an estimate of material inequality and information on the persistence of settlements as a measure of continuity. Persistence is derived from the length of time a settlement endured in a particular state, and we assume that higher levels of persistence indicate greater adaptive capacity and resilience. We articulate an approach which allows us to combine these proxies to investigate the relationship between these two sides of sustainability and apply this to a global dataset of settlements from the last 10,000 y. We find that persistence is weakly correlated with material inequality, rather than equality, overall. We also find that this relationship grows stronger as settlement systems increase in scale and is strongest for larger sites in larger systems. This pattern may be the result of both increased functional diversity at a site level and network effects whereby residents of larger settlements were able to claim a larger share of the surplus produced by the settlement system.",

          "abstract": "Ischemic retinal diseases are major causes of blindness worldwide and are characterized by pathological angiogenesis. Epigenetic alterations in response to metabolic shifts in endothelial cells (ECs) suffice to underlie excessive angiogenesis. Lactate accumulation and its subsequent histone lactylation in ECs contribute to vascular disorders. However, the regulatory mechanism of establishing and sustaining lactylation modification remains elusive. Here, we showed that lactate accumulation induced histone lactylations on H3K9 and H3K18 in neovascular ECs in the proliferative stage of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Joint CUT&amp;Tag and scRNA-seq analyses identified Prmt5 as a target of H3K9la and H3K18la in isolated retinal ECs. EC-specific deletion of Prmt5 since the early stage of revascularization suppressed a positive feedback loop of lactate production and histone lactylation, thus inhibiting neovascular tuft formation. Mechanistically, the C-terminal intrinsically disorder region (IDR) of the transmembrane semaphorin 6A (SEMA6A) forms liquid–liquid phase separation condensates to recruit RHOA and P300, facilitating P300 phosphorylation and histone lactylation cycle. Deletion of endothelial Sema6A reduced H3K9la and H3K18la at the promoter of PRMT5 and diminished its expression. The induction of histone lactylation by SEMA6A-IDR and its pro-angiogenic effect were abrogated by deletion of Prmt5 . Our study illustrates a sustainable histone lactylation machinery driven by phase separation-dependent lactyltransferase activation in dysregulated vascularization.",

          "abstract": "Human ClpP protease contributes to mitochondrial protein quality control by degrading misfolded proteins. ClpP is overexpressed in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its inhibition leads to the accumulation of damaged respiratory chain subunits and cell death. Conversely, hyperactivating ClpP with small-molecule activators, such as the recently discovered ONC201, disrupts mitochondrial protein degradation and impairs respiration in cancer cells. Despite its critical role in human health, the mechanism underlying the structural and functional properties of human ClpP remains elusive. Notably, human ClpP is paradoxically activated by active-site inhibitors. All available structures of human ClpP published to date are in the inactive compact or compressed states, surprisingly even when ClpP is bound to an activator molecule such as ONC201. Here, we present structures of human mitochondrial ClpP in the active extended state, including a pair of structures where ClpP is bound to an active-site inhibitor. We demonstrate that amino acid substitutions in the handle region (A192E and E196R) recreate a conserved salt bridge found in bacterial ClpP, stabilizing the extended active state and significantly enhancing ClpP activity. We elucidate the ClpP activation mechanism, highlighting a hormetic effect where substoichiometric inhibitor binding triggers an allosteric transition that drives ClpP into its active extended state. Our findings link the conformational dynamics of ClpP to its catalytic function and provide high-resolution structures for the rational design of potent and specific ClpP inhibitors, with implications for targeting AML and other disorders with ClpP involvement.",

In this work, we show that the strong interlayer excitonic correlation at equal electron and hole densities in MoSe 2 /WSe 2 double layers separated by a 2-nanometer barrier yields perfect Coulomb drag under zero magnetic field: A charge current in one layer induces an equal but opposite drag current in the other layer at low temperatures. The drag current ratio remains above 0.9 up to about 20 kelvin. As exciton density increases above the Mott density, the excitons dissociate into an electron-hole plasma abruptly, and only frictional drag is observed.

          "abstract": "The extracellular space (apoplast) in plants is a key battleground during microbial infections. To avoid recognition, the bacterial model phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 produces glycosyrin. Glycosyrin inhibits the plant-secreted β-galactosidase BGAL1, which would otherwise initiate the release of immunogenic peptides from bacterial flagellin. Here, we report the structure, biosynthesis, and multifunctional roles of glycosyrin. High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy and chemical synthesis revealed that glycosyrin is an iminosugar with a five-membered pyrrolidine ring and a hydrated aldehyde that mimics monosaccharides. Glycosyrin biosynthesis was controlled by virulence regulators, and its production is common in bacteria and prevents flagellin recognition and alters the extracellular glycoproteome and metabolome of infected plants. These findings highlight a potentially wider role for glycobiology manipulation by plant pathogens across the plant kingdom.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity underlies learning by modifying specific synaptic inputs to reshape neural activity and behavior. However, the rules governing which synapses will undergo different forms of plasticity in vivo during learning and whether these rules are uniform within individual neurons remain unclear. Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without affecting apical plasticity. Thus, individual neurons use multiple activity-dependent plasticity rules in a compartment-specific manner in vivo during learning.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning has advanced unprecedentedly, exemplified by GPT-4 and SORA. However, they cannot parallel human brains in efficiency and adaptability due to differences in signal representation, optimization, runtime reconfigurability, and hardware architecture. To address these challenges, we introduce pruning optimization for input-aware dynamic memristive spiking neural network (PRIME). PRIME uses spiking neurons to emulate brain’s spiking mechanisms and optimizes the topology of random memristive SNNs inspired by structural plasticity, effectively mitigating memristor programming stochasticity. It also uses the input-aware early-stop policy to reduce latency and leverages memristive in-memory computing to mitigate von Neumann bottleneck. Validated on a 40-nm, 256-K memristor-based macro, PRIME achieves comparable classification accuracy and inception score to software baselines, with energy efficiency improvements of 37.8× and 62.5×. In addition, it reduces computational loads by 77 and 12.5% with minimal performance degradation and demonstrates robustness to stochastic memristor noise. PRIME paves the way for brain-inspired neuromorphic computing.",

In a warming climate, the subtropical high is projected to strengthen and expand west, but there remains uncertainty regarding its variability and linkages to natural drivers. Here, we use a tree-ring network across the Southeast United States to reconstruct the relative intensity of the pressure gradient across the subtropical high’s western flank over the past 870 years. Variations in the flank’s position and the pressure gradient have been a major driver of the hydroclimate—including creating a Southeast-Caribbean moisture dipole—since 1140 CE. We document a significant increase in flank positional variability since 1900 CE, with westward migrations becoming more extreme. Likewise, major volcanic eruptions cause a multiyear period of westward positioning, leading to distinct regional moisture gradients. Our record highlights important changes in flank behavior, which has important implications for water resource management in a warming world.",

However, no petrologic records supporting this hypothesis have been reported yet. Here, we report sulfide replacement textures of melilite and olivine in Ornans-like chondrites, whose occurrences are correlated with the degree of thermal metamorphism of the host chondrites. The mineral assemblages of the replacement textures and the correlation with petrologic subtype are best explained with high-temperature reactions between silicate phases and S-rich vapors, which degassed from a solidifying Fe–Ni–S core. The sulfide replacement texture in Ornans-like chondrites could be the first petrologic record supporting the partial differentiation hypothesis. Given the widespread presence of sulfide replacement textures in different meteorites, we propose that core sulfur degassing could be an endemic process in differentiated planetesimals.",

To investigate the efficacy of targeting either methionine metabolism or the TDP for healthspan improvement in advanced age, we initiated dietary MetR or TDP inhibition in 18-month-old C57BL/6J mice. MetR significantly improved neuromuscular function, metabolic health, lung function, and frailty. In addition, we confirmed improved neuromuscular function from dietary MetR in 5XFAD mice, whose weight was not affected by MetR. We did not observe benefits with TDP inhibition. Single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing of muscle revealed cell type–specific responses to MetR, although MetR did not significantly affect mouse aging epigenetic clock markers. Similarly, an 8-week MetR intervention in a human trial (NCT04701346) showed no significant impact on epigenetic clocks. The observed benefits from late-life MetR provide translational rationale to develop MetR mimetics as an antiaging intervention.",

          "abstract": "Three-dimensional molecular generation is critical in drug design. However, current methods often rely on point clouds or oversimplified interaction models, limiting their ability to accurately represent molecular structures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the multiscale graph equivariant diffusion model for 3D molecule design (MD3MD). MD3MD partitions molecular conformations into multiscale graphs, assigning different weights to capture atomic interactions across scales. This framework guides the diffusion process, enabling high-quality 3D molecular generation. Experimental results demonstrate that MD3MD excels in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks, producing diverse, stable, and innovative molecules that meet specified conditions. Visualization highlights MD3MD’s ability to learn domain-specific patterns and generate molecules distinct from existing datasets while maintaining distributional consistency. By effectively exploring chemical space, MD3MD surpasses previous methods in generating innovative and chemically diverse molecules, offering a notable advancement in the field of molecular design.",

          "abstract": "Marsupial neonates are born with immature immune systems, making them vulnerable to pathogens. While neonates receive maternal protection, they can also independently combat pathogens, although the mechanisms remain unknown. Using the sugar glider ( Petaurus breviceps ) as a model, we investigated immunological defense strategies of marsupial neonates. Cathelicidins—a family of antimicrobial peptides expanded in the genomes of marsupials—are highly expressed in developing neutrophils. Sugar glider cathelicidins reside in two genomic clusters, and their coordinated expression is achieved by enhancer sharing within clusters and long-range physical interactions between clusters. Functionally, cathelicidins modulate immune responses and have potent antibacterial effects, sufficient to provide protection in a mouse model of sepsis. Evolutionarily, cathelicidins have a complex history, with marsupials and monotremes uniquely retaining both clusters among tetrapods. Thus, cathelicidins are critical mediators of marsupial immunity, and their evolution may reflect the life history–specific immunological needs of these animals.",

We report the role of astrocyte-specific, ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived astrocytes, neurons and cocultures and exposed them to small soluble alpha-synuclein aggregates. Oligomeric alpha-synuclein triggered an inflammatory glial state associated with Toll-like receptor activation, viral responses, and cytokine secretion. This reactive state resulted in loss of neurosupportive functions and the induction of neuronal toxicity. Notably, interferon response pathways were activated leading to up-regulation and isoform switching of the RNA deaminase enzyme, ADAR1. ADAR1 mediates A-to-I RNA editing, and increases in RNA editing were observed in inflammatory pathways in cells, as well as in postmortem human PD brain. Aberrant, or dysregulated, ADAR1 responses and RNA editing may lead to sustained inflammatory reactive states in astrocytes triggered by alpha-synuclein aggregation, and this may drive the neuroinflammatory cascade in Parkinson’s.",

Here, we report the identification of a synthetic small molecule with drug-like properties, C26, which suppresses the secretion of effector proteins and consequently hinders bacterial invasion of eukaryotic cells. C26 binds to and inhibits HilD, the transcriptional regulator of the major secretion systems. Although sharing the same binding pocket as the previously described long-chain fatty acid ligands, C26 inhibits HilD with a unique binding mode and a distinct mechanism.

These landscapes serve as weathering reactors whereby particles eroded from mountains undergo chemical and physical alteration before being exported to oceans. The time a particle spends in floodplain reservoirs regulates the style and extent of continental chemical weathering and the fate of terrestrial organic carbon. Despite its importance for the global carbon cycle, we still lack a quantitative understanding of floodplain storage timescales. Using a combination of geomorphic mapping, radiocarbon and luminescence dating, and numerical simulations of meander dynamics, we identify well-conserved scaling laws that describe floodplain storage times. Our results reveal that, to first order, floodplain storage durations are set by the ratio of river width to migration rate. The fact that most rivers erode about 1% of their width per year leads to a typical floodplain storage duration of ~5 thousand years.",

On one hand, macromolecular architectures must be engineered to yield durable products that, on the other hand, rapidly deconstruct to recyclable monomers under pre-determined conditions. Polymer deconstruction is a chemical process that requires deep understanding of molecular reactivity in heterogeneous media, where porous material architectures evolve in both space and time. To build this understanding, we develop herein experimental and analytical methods describing sets of diffusive eigenmodes that exist within time-varying, non-Euclidean boundary conditions, a situation commonly encountered in the reactive deconstruction of polymers where chain fragments splay, alter their local dynamics, and evolve in their confinement of reacting media. Diffusion power spectra, discerned experimentally by NMR, yield polymer and solvent frequency-domain velocity autocorrelation functions that are analyzed in the context of physical models for chemical reactions parameterized with fractal mathematics. The results connect local motion in polymers to chemical reactivity during acidolysis of circular elastomers.",

Here, we demonstrate that the morphology of radiation-induced Frank loops can unveil their nature in face-centered cubic (fcc) structure: Circular loops are interstitial-type in all fcc materials, while segmented loops are vacancy-type in high stacking fault energy (SFE) alloys but varied-type in low SFE and high-entropy alloys. The polygonal shape is attributed to the dissociation of an a 0 /3&lt;111&gt; dislocation into an a 0 /6&lt;112&gt; Shockley partial and an a 0 /6&lt;110&gt; stair-rod dislocation. The dissociation of vacancy loops is energetically favorable, whereas interstitial loops require external stimuli to promote dislocation propagation.

Here, we present the first ab initio high-resolution kinetic simulations of relativistic plasmas undergoing synchrotron cooling in a highly magnetized medium. Our results demonstrate that these plasmas spontaneously generate coherent linearly polarized radiation in a wide range of parameters via the electron cyclotron maser instability, with radiative losses altering the saturation mechanism. Thus, the plasma continuously amplify coherent radiation for substantially longer durations of time. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the behavior of relativistic plasmas in strongly magnetized environments and align with astronomical phenomena, such as pulsar emission and fast radio bursts.",

Model simulation of two ambitious policy scenarios show a peak in land to sea transport of total plastics of 23 Tg per year around 2045 and a decrease thereafter.

This effect of hypoxia is mediated by erythropoiesis and is a direct result of the rising hematocrit, which could be due to erythrocytes acting as carriers of glucose units in the blood. Glucose lowering by the red cell mass is evidenced by a prompt decrease in glycemia in mice receiving a blood transfusion. Furthermore, life under hypoxia as well as treatment with erythropoietin reduce glycemia also in mice expressing the erythropoietin receptor exclusively in hematopoietic cells, which contrasts with previous assumptions attributing metabolic actions of erythropoietin to direct action on nonhematopoietic tissues.

Because blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability increases in ALS-FTD, we postulated that reduced nuclear TDP-43 in ECs might contribute. Here, we show that nuclear TDP-43 is reduced in ECs of mice with an ALS-FTD–associated mutation in TDP-43 ( Tardbp G348C ) and that this leads to cell-autonomous loss of junctional complexes and BBB integrity. Targeted excision of TDP-43 in brain ECs recapitulates BBB defects and loss of junctional complexes and ultimately leads to fibrin deposition, gliosis, phospho-Tau accumulation, and impaired memory and social interaction.

C. elegans hermaphrodites release fertilized eggs into food-rich environments but retain them in the absence of food. Here, we report the discovery of a neural circuit required for the modulation of reproductive behavior by food sensing. A mutation that electrically silences the AVK interneurons uncouples egg laying from detection of environmental food cues. We find that AVK activity inhibits egg laying, and AVKs themselves are inhibited by dopamine released from food-sensing neurons. AVKs express a large number of structurally and functionally diverse neuropeptides. Coordination of food-sensing and reproductive behavior requires a subset of AVK neuropeptides that converge on a small ensemble of premotor neurons that coexpress their cognate receptors. Modulation of C. elegans reproductive behavior, therefore, requires a cascade of neuromodulatory signals that uses disinhibition and combinatorial neuropeptide signals to activate reproductive behavior when food is sensed.",

The adverse effect of female sex hormones was specific to diseased retinal neurons, and depletion of these hormones ameliorated this phenotypic effect, while reintroduction worsened rates of disease in females. Transcriptional analysis of retinas showed significant differences between genes involved in pyroptosis, inflammatory responses, and endoplasmic reticulum stress–induced apoptosis between males and females with retinal degeneration.

Herein, a robust, heterogeneous single-metal-site catalyst was prepared and shown to achieve methanol hydrocarboxylation rates superior to nanoparticle catalysts (up to 18.3 ± 0.6 mmol hour −1 g cat − 1 ) while maintaining very high selectivity to MF (≥95%). Characterization reveals isolated, monodisperse Ru-nitrosyl complexes bound to three O-atoms of the zeolite framework, and the robust catalyst formed achieves a cumulative turnover number of more than 3500 over eight cycles. This work pushes the boundaries of supported single-site catalysts in CO 2 utilization.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of histone H3 copper reductase activity provides a novel metabolic framework for understanding the functions of core histone residues, which, unlike N-terminal residues, have remained largely unexplored. We previously demonstrated that histone H3 cysteine 110 (H3C110) contributes to cupric (Cu 2+ ) ion binding and its reduction to the cuprous (Cu 1+ ) form. However, this residue is absent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , raising questions about its evolutionary and functional significance. Here, we report that H3C110 has been lost in many fungal lineages despite near-universal conservation across eukaryotes. Introduction of H3C110 into S. cerevisiae increased intracellular Cu 1+ levels and ameliorated the iron homeostasis defects caused by inactivation of the Cup1 metallothionein or glutathione depletion. Enhanced histone copper reductase activity also extended replicative life span under oxidative growth conditions but reduced it under fermentative conditions. Our findings suggest that a trade-off between histone copper reductase activity, iron metabolism, and life span may underlie the loss or retention of H3C110 across eukaryotes.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the hypothesis that mineral/water interfaces played a crucial catalytic role in peptide formation by promoting the self-assembly of amino acids. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the α-alumina(0001) surface exhibits an affinity of 4 k B T for individual glycine or GG dipeptide molecules due to hydrogen bonds. In simulations with multiple glycine molecules, surface-bound glycine enhances further adsorption, leading to the formation of long chains connected by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl and amine groups of glycine molecules. We find that the likelihood of observing chains longer than 10 glycine units increases by at least five orders of magnitude at the surface compared to the bulk. This surface-driven assembly is primarily due to local high density and alignment with the alumina surface pattern. Together, these results propose a model for how mineral surfaces can induce configuration-specific assembly of amino acids, thereby promoting condensation reactions.",

Mechanistically, Ara-C can suppress tumor growth through DNA damage, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. An investigator-initiated clinical trial involving four patients showed benefits in three cases. In addition, a subset of cells exhibited senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype post–Ara-C treatment, accompanied by several immune checkpoint ligands’ up-regulation and more immune cell infiltration. Combining Ara-C with dual Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and TIGIT blockade emerged as a promising strategy to disrupt immune evasion by senescent cells, enhancing antitumor responses.

This study presents oscillating microbubble array–based metamaterials (OMAMs) for enabling the rapid isolation of high-purity exosomes and their subpopulations from biofluids without labeling or preprocessing. Particularly, leveraging acoustically excited microbubble oscillation, OMAMs can generate numerous acoustofluidic traps for filtering in-fluid micro/nanoparticles, thus allowing for removing bioparticles larger than exosomes to obtain high-purity (93%) exosomes from undiluted whole blood in ~3 minutes. Moreover, exosome subpopulations in different size ranges can be isolated by tuning the microbubble oscillation amplitude. Additionally, as each oscillating microbubble functions as an ultradeep subwavelength (~λ/186) acoustic amplifier and a nonlinear source, OMAMs can generate high-resolution complex acoustic energy patterns and tune the patterns by activating different-sized microbubbles at their distinct resonance frequencies.",

The excursion lasted ~2000 years, with dipole strength reduction and tilting spanning 300 years. During this period, the geomagnetic field’s multipolarity resembled outer planets, causing rapid magnetospheric changes. To our knowledge, this study presents the first space plasma analysis of the excursion, linking the geomagnetic field, magnetospheric system, and upper atmosphere in sequence using feedback channels for distinct temporal epochs. A three-dimensional reconstruction of Earth’s geospace system shows that these shifts affected auroral regions and open magnetic field lines, causing them to expand and wander toward lower latitudes. These changes likely altered the upper atmosphere’s composition and influenced anthropological progress during that era.

The CC-chemokine ligand 1 released by infiltrating macrophages directly activated neurons or indirectly activated neurons by enhancing the astrocyte activity, ultimately leading to the earlier onset of BTZ-induced neuropathic pain in females.

A structural switch comprising the Thr-Val-Gly- Gly (TVGG) motif either assumes a disordered coil or a 3 10 helix conformation to regulate hexamer or pentamer assembly, respectively. The cellular polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6 ) binds to a positively charged pore of CA capsomers rich in arginine and lysine residues mediated by electrostatic interactions. Both IP 6 binding and TVGG coil-to-helix transition are essential for pentamer formation. However, the connection between IP 6 binding and TVGG conformational switch remains unclear. Using extensive atomistic simulations, we show that IP 6 imparts structural order at the central ring, which results in multiple kinetically controlled events leading to the coil-to-helix conformational change of the TVGG motif. IP 6 facilitates the helix-to-coil transition by allowing the formation of intermediate conformations. Our results suggest a key kinetic role of IP 6 in HIV-1 pentamer formation.",

Increased interleukin-6 level transcriptionally activates the USP24 expression, which leads to PD-1 stabilization. Furthermore, USP24 deficiency reduces PD-1 levels in CD8 + T cells and attenuates Egfr L858R -driven lung tumorigenesis in Usp24 C1695A catalytic deficient mice. Targeting PD-1 stability with the USP24-specific inhibitor USP24-i-101 boosts cytotoxic T cell activity, restrains lung tumor growth, and achieves superior therapeutic effects when combined with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy. Clinically, patients with lung cancer exhibiting high USP24 expression in tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells display exhausted features and show unfavorable responses to immunotherapy.

During this year, each donor received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Notwithstanding these vaccinations, the concentrations of the most abundant IgG1 clones remained constant. Given the 2- to 3-week half-life of IgG1 molecules in blood, our data suggest that these clones are associated with long-term immunity and do not undergo somatic hypermutation which would imply short-lived plasma cells.

Upon radiation, YTHDF1 is phosphorylated at serine-182 in an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related–dependent manner. This phosphorylation inhibits exportin 1–mediated nuclear export of YTHDF1, resulting in its accumulation within the nucleus. Nuclear YTHDF1 enhances the binding capacity of serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 2 to a group of m 6 A-modified exons, leading to increased exon inclusion. Specifically, YTHDF1 promotes splicing and expression of DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1 and TP53BP1 , thereby mitigating excessive DNA damage. Depletion of YTHDF1 sensitizes cancer cells to radiation treatment.

Here, we systematically investigate the fatigue performance of ultrathin bismuth ferrite BiFeO 3 (BFO)–based FTJs integrated with various semiconductors. Notably, the BFO/gallium arsenide FTJ exhibits superior fatigue resistance characteristics (&gt;10 8 cycles), surpassing the BFO/silicon FTJ (&gt;10 6 cycles) and even approaching epitaxial oxide FTJs (&gt;10 9 cycles). The atomic-scale fatigue mechanism is revealed as lattice structure collapse caused by oxygen vacancy accumulation in BFO near semiconductors after repeated switching. The enhanced fatigue-resistant behavior in BFO/gallium arsenide FTJ is due to gallium arsenide’s weak oxygen affinity, resulting in fewer oxygen vacancies. These findings provide deeper insights into the atomic-scale fatigue mechanism of semiconductor-integrated FTJs and pave the way for fabricating fatigue-resistant oxide FTJs for practical applications.",

After decades of studies, Rayleigh scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency, Γ ∝ ω d + 1 , became generally accepted. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. It is unclear how to define glass defects. Here, we use a particle level contribution to sound damping to determine areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas, which allows us to define defects. Over a range of stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultrastable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine forces that arise after macroscopic deformation. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses, one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a different paradigm of sound damping in glasses.",

We show that such an adiabatic deformation of topology is associated with the accumulation of a Gouy phase factor, which, in turn, perturbs the propagation constant (spatial frequency) of the beam. The spatial structure of optical rotatum follows a logarithmic spiral—a signature that is commonly seen in the pattern formation of seashells and galaxies.

The sensor amplifies the drug’s fluorescence, enabling successful tracking of doxorubicin through the skin in live mice following intravenous injection. When paired with a reusable electronic patch, the biosensor facilitates seamless data collection and wireless transmission. A 3-month biocompatibility study, including systemic toxicity assessments, histological and blood analyses, confirms complete biodegradation with no observed toxicity. By directly measuring chemotherapeutic drug levels in tissues over time, our sensor enhances traditional monitoring methods, enabling clinicians to optimize dosing during cancer treatment and reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence following tumor removal.",

Considerable efforts have thus been directed at understanding this process. However, the recently discovered condensation pathway, which involves the formation of phase-separated liquid intermediate states, has added further complexity. In parallel, it has been reported that different αSyn splice isoforms may be implicated in aggregate formation in disease. In this study, we compare the phase behavior of four αSyn isoforms (αSyn-140, αSyn-126, αSyn-112, and αSyn-98). Using different biophysical tools including confocal microscopy, kinetic assays and microfluidic-based approaches, we find stark differences between the four systems in their propensities to undergo phase separation and aggregation. Furthermore, we show that even small amounts of αSyn-112, one of the predominant isoforms after αSyn-140, can affect the phase separation of αSyn-140. These results highlight the importance of conducting further investigations to elucidate the role of alternative splicing in synucleinopathies.",

By studying conditional mutants of genes encoding DivIB, DivIC, and FtsL, an essential trimeric complex central to cell division in bacteria, we demonstrate that FtsL and DivIB play independent, hierarchical roles coordinating peptidoglycan synthesis across specific septal developmental checkpoints. They are required for the localization of downstream divisome components and the redistribution of peptidoglycan synthesis from the cell periphery to the septum. This is achieved by positive regulation of septum production and negative regulation of peripheral cell wall synthesis. Our analysis has led to a model for the coordination of cell division in Staphylococcus aureus , forming a framework for understanding how protein localization and function are integrated with cell wall structural dynamics across the bacteria.",

There are, so far, only 16 known circumbinary exoplanets, all of which lie in the same orbital plane as the host binary. Suggestions indicate that circumbinary planets could also exist on orbits highly inclined to the binary, close to 90°, polar orbits. No such planets have been found yet, but polar circumbinary gas and debris discs have been observed, and if these were to form planets, then those would be left on a polar orbit. We report strong evidence for a polar circumbinary exoplanet, which orbits a close pair of brown dwarfs that are on an eccentric orbit. We use radial velocities to measure a retrograde apsidal precession for the binary and show that this can only be attributed to the presence of a polar planet.",

Pds5A distributes on the spindle fibers in oocytes at both metaphase I and metaphase II stages. Morpholino-based depletion or genetic ablation of Pds5A all lead to defects in spindle organization, chromosome euploidy and meiotic progression in oocytes and thus compromising the female fertility. Mechanistically, Pds5A recruits deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 14 to the spindle apparatus for stabilization of kinesin family member 5B, regulating the spindle elongation. Collectively, our findings unveil that cohesin-associated protein Pds5A can be used as a spindle regulator during oocyte meiosis.",

We further developed a hybrid lipid NP (HNP) by hybridizing a pH-dependent charge-inverting lipid film with apoptotic T cell membranes to enhance endosomal escape and trigger macrophage production of hepatocyte growth factor for lung repair. We demonstrated that the hydrogen flow–induced shear stresses disrupt the NP-mucus interaction, enhancing the deposition of aerosolized HNPs/ TGF β 1 siRNA within fibrotic lung lesions, effectively blocking fibrogenic signaling pathways and offering a clinically viable strategy for combating PF.",

To address this outstanding problem, we developed a technique to map the crystal orientations of these sulfates in situ at two stratigraphically similar locations in the Shenandoah formation, allowing us to constrain the burial depth and paleoenvironment at the time of their precipitation. Our crystal orientation mapping results and outcrop-scale fracture analyses reveal two different generations of Ca-sulfates: one likely precipitated in the shallow subsurface and a second one that formed at a burial depth below 80 meters.

In existing stretchable battery designs, increasing the active material to yield higher capacity often leads to thicker and stiffer solid electrodes with poor mechanical properties. Here, we present a concept that transfers the physical property of a battery electrode from a conventional solid into a fluid state. The mechanical and electrochemical properties of the electrode rely on the viscosity of fluids rather than Young’s modulus of solids. Fluids conform easily into any shape with minimal force, making them intrinsically deformable. This decouples the electrochemical and mechanical property of the redox-active electrofluid, leading to higher capacities with more active material loading without stiffening the cell. The cell showed excellent capacity retention over 500 charge-discharge cycles and mechanical robustness up to 100% strain. Our work provides a technological solution for stretchable batteries that balances capacity and mechanical performance.",

Two general types of synaptic plasticity, associative plasticity to change synaptic weights and homeostatic plasticity to maintain an excitatory balance, are so far thought to be expressed at individual canonical sites in principal neurons of the cortex. Here, we report two separate types of transmission sites, termed silenceable and idle-able, each participating distinctly in evoked or miniature transmission in the mouse visual cortex. Both sites operated with a postsynaptic binary mode with different unitary sizes and mechanisms. During postnatal development, silenceable sites were unsilenced by associative plasticity with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-receptor incorporation, increasing evoked transmission. Concurrently, miniature transmission remained constant, where AMPA-receptor state changes balanced unsilencing with increased idling at idle-able sites. Thus, individual cortical spine synapses mediated two parallel, interacting types of transmission, which predominantly contributed to either associative or homeostatic plasticity.",

We first applied a molecular dynamics simulation–based goal-oriented adaptive sampling method to identify possible open-pocket conformations, followed by Boltzmann docking that combines traditional docking with Markov state modeling. Clustering and analysis of stability and accessibility of docked poses supported a preferred binding site; we further validated this site by mutagenesis and electrophysiology, suggesting a mechanism of potentiation by stabilizing intersubunit contacts.

With a transform-limited excitation pulse in 25 femtoseconds, we observed the excited-state wave packet dynamics in ET reactions with a dephasing time within 1 ps. By modulating the phase of the excitation pulses, the ultrafast ET dynamics was found to change from 100 to 300 fs due to the different wave packets prepared by chirped pulses. We further found that the coherent control through the modulated wave packets can propagate into the subsequent back ET reactions resulting in the dynamics varying from 500 to 800 fs.

Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, initiating a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, resulting in abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we show that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA.

The crows exhibited a geometric regularity effect, showing better performance with shapes featuring right angles, parallel lines, or symmetry over more irregular shapes.
