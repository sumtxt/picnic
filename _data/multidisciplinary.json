          "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits 1 . More than 300 mutations in POLG , the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists 2 . Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA.",

          "abstract": "At subduction zones, lithospheric material descends through the upper mantle to the mantle transition zone (MTZ), where it may continue to sink into the lower mantle or stagnate 1,2 . Several factors may be important in influencing this flow, including chemical heterogeneity 3–5 . However, tight constraints on these mantle flows and the exact factors that affect them have proved challenging. We use P-to-S receiver functions to image the subducting slab and the MTZ beneath the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. We image a singular, superdeep (&gt;700 km) 660-km discontinuity over a 200-km-wide zone within the slab, accompanied by nearby double 660 discontinuity phases (normal and superdeep). Combined geodynamic and waveform modelling shows that this observation cannot be explained by temperature effects in typical mantle compositions but requires a large basalt-rich chemical anomaly, strongest in the location of the singular, deep 660. The inferred basalt signature is near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge 6,7 , where basalt is probably present in greater proportions. Our finding suggests that past tectonic events impart chemical heterogeneity into slabs, and the heterogeneities, in turn, may affect the inherent tendency of the slab to sink.",

          "abstract": "Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement-learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires substantial human expertise and experimentation 1,2 . Here we present the third generation of Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world 3 . Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.",

          "abstract": "Four-wave mixing is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that can be used for wideband low-noise optical amplification and wavelength conversion. It has been extensively investigated for applications in communications 1 , computing 2 , metrology 3 , imaging 4 and quantum optics 5 . With its advantages of small footprint, large nonlinearity and dispersion-engineering capability, optical integrated waveguides are excellent candidates for realizing high-gain and large-bandwidth four-wave mixing for which anomalous dispersion is a key condition. Various waveguides based on, for example, silicon, aluminium gallium arsenide and nonlinear glass have been studied 6–10 , but suffer from considerable gain and bandwidth reductions, as conventional design approaches for anomalous dispersion result in multi-mode operation. We present a methodology for fabricating nonlinear waveguides with simultaneous single-mode operation and anomalous dispersion for ultra-broadband operation and high-efficiency four-wave mixing. Although we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, the design approach can be used with other platforms as well. By using higher-order dispersion, we achieved unprecedented amplification bandwidths of more than 300 nm in these ultra-low-loss integrated waveguides. Penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit s −1 data in a single optical channel of over 200 nm was realized. These single-mode dispersion-engineered nonlinear waveguides could become practical building blocks in various nonlinear photonics applications.",

          "abstract": "Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch 1 . DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara’s genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco 2 , associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch.",

          "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is the third most rapidly growing health condition associated with disability, after dementia and diabetes 1 . By 2050, the total number of patients with osteoarthritis is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide 2 . As no disease-modifying treatments exist for osteoarthritis, a better understanding of disease aetiopathology is urgently needed. Here we perform a genome-wide association study meta-analyses across up to 489,975 cases and 1,472,094 controls, establishing 962 independent associations, 513 of which have not been previously reported. Using single-cell multiomics data, we identify signal enrichment in embryonic skeletal development pathways. We integrate orthogonal lines of evidence, including transcriptome, proteome and epigenome profiles of primary joint tissues, and implicate 700 effector genes. Within these, we find rare coding-variant burden associations with effect sizes that are consistently higher than common frequency variant associations. We highlight eight biological processes in which we find convergent involvement of multiple effector genes, including the circadian clock, glial-cell-related processes and pathways with an established role in osteoarthritis (TGFβ, FGF, WNT, BMP and retinoic acid signalling, and extracellular matrix organization). We find that 10% of the effector genes express a protein that is the target of approved drugs, offering repurposing opportunities, which can accelerate translation.",

          "abstract": "Human cells consist of a complex hierarchy of components, many of which remain unexplored 1,2 . Here we construct a global map of human subcellular architecture through joint measurement of biophysical interactions and immunofluorescence images for over 5,100 proteins in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Self-supervised multimodal data integration resolves 275 molecular assemblies spanning the range of 10 −8 to 10 −5 m, which we validate systematically using whole-cell size-exclusion chromatography and annotate using large language models 3 . We explore key applications in structural biology, yielding structures for 111 heterodimeric complexes and an expanded Rag–Ragulator assembly. The map assigns unexpected functions to 975 proteins, including roles for C18orf21 in RNA processing and DPP9 in interferon signalling, and identifies assemblies with multiple localizations or cell type specificity. It decodes paediatric cancer genomes 4 , identifying 21 recurrently mutated assemblies and implicating 102 validated new cancer proteins. The associated Cell Visualization Portal and Mapping Toolkit provide a reference platform for structural and functional cell biology.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian neocortex contains a highly diverse set of cell types. These cell types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches 1–4 . Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell-type specialization. Cellular-scale electron microscopy provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective on the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometre-scale morphology. In data that contain tens of thousands of neurons, most of which have incomplete reconstructions, identifying cell types becomes a clear challenge for analysis 5 . Here, to address this challenge, we present a systematic survey of the somatic region of all cells in a cubic millimetre of cortex using quantitative features obtained from electron microscopy. This analysis demonstrates that the perisomatic region is sufficient to identify cell types, including types defined primarily on the basis of their connectivity patterns. We then describe how this classification facilitates cell-type-specific connectivity characterization and locating cells with rare connectivity patterns in the dataset.",

          "abstract": "The complexity of neural circuits makes it challenging to decipher the brain’s algorithms of intelligence. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have produced models that accurately simulate brain activity, enhancing our understanding of the brain’s computational objectives and neural coding. However, it is difficult for such models to generalize beyond their training distribution, limiting their utility. The emergence of foundation models 1 trained on vast datasets has introduced a new artificial intelligence paradigm with remarkable generalization capabilities. Here we collected large amounts of neural activity from visual cortices of multiple mice and trained a foundation model to accurately predict neuronal responses to arbitrary natural videos. This model generalized to new mice with minimal training and successfully predicted responses across various new stimulus domains, such as coherent motion and noise patterns. Beyond neural response prediction, the model also accurately predicted anatomical cell types, dendritic features and neuronal connectivity within the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset 2 . Our work is a crucial step towards building foundation models of the brain. As neuroscience accumulates larger, multimodal datasets, foundation models will reveal statistical regularities, enable rapid adaptation to new tasks and accelerate research.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These clusters can be found at the centre of all galaxy types but tend to favour galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 10 9 M ⊙ (refs. 1,2 ). At present, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in situ star formation from gas infall 3 and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction 4 . Studies 5–9 of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, whereas the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, until now, no ongoing merger of GCs has been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N -body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need for large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps.",

Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis 1,2 . Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types 3–6 , a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column 4 , and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data 4,7 . Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space 8 , characterize novel types of neuronal invariances 9 and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas 10,11 .",

We captured known interactions and discovered myriad new connections that are available online. We defined the molecular mechanism of two of the strongest interactions. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain PCNA degradation in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM directly unwind TA-rich DNA cruciforms, preventing catastrophic chromosome breakage by the ERCC1–ERCC4 complex. Our data yield fundamental insights into genome maintenance, provide a springboard for mechanistic investigations into new connections between DDR factors and pinpoint synthetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "In the same way that the mRNA-binding specificities of transfer RNAs define the genetic code, the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) form the molecular basis of the gene regulatory code 1,2 . The human gene regulatory code is much more complex than the genetic code, in particular because there are more than 1,600 TFs that commonly interact with each other. TF–TF interactions are required for specifying cell fate and executing cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. Despite this, the landscape of interactions between DNA-bound TFs is poorly defined. Here we map the biochemical interactions between DNA-bound TFs using CAP-SELEX, a method that can simultaneously identify individual TF binding preferences, TF–TF interactions and the DNA sequences that are bound by the interacting complexes. A screen of more than 58,000 TF–TF pairs identified 2,198 interacting TF pairs, 1,329 of which preferentially bound to their motifs arranged in a distinct spacing and/or orientation. We also discovered 1,131 TF–TF composite motifs that were markedly different from the motifs of the individual TFs. In total, we estimate that the screen identified between 18% and 47% of all human TF–TF motifs. The novel composite motifs we found were enriched in cell-type-specific elements, active in vivo and more likely to be formed between developmentally co-expressed TFs. Furthermore, TFs that define embryonic axes commonly interacted with different TFs and bound to distinct motifs, explaining how TFs with a similar specificity can define distinct cell types along developmental axes.",

          "abstract": "Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin 1 . Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing 2,3 . However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 4 of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release 5,6 . Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin 7 . These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement.",

          "abstract": "Mutation of some genes drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) provided the very first such genetic link to cancer 1,2 . However, little is known about the trajectory to CML, the rate of BCR::ABL1 clonal expansion and how this affects disease. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 haematopoietic colonies from nine patients with CML aged 22 to 81 years, we reconstruct phylogenetic trees of haematopoiesis. Intronic breaks in BCR and ABL1 were not always observed, and out-of-frame exonic breakpoints in BCR , requiring exon skipping to derive BCR::ABL1 , were also noted. Apart from ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, extra myeloid gene mutations were mostly present in wild-type cells. We inferred explosive growth attributed to BCR::ABL1 commencing 3–14 years (confidence interval 2–16 years) before diagnosis, with annual growth rates exceeding 70,000% per year. Mutation accumulation was higher in BCR::ABL1 cells with shorter telomere lengths, reflecting their excessive cell divisions. Clonal expansion rates inversely correlated with the time to diagnosis. BCR::ABL1 in the general population mirrored CML incidence, and advanced and/or blast phase CML was characterized by subsequent genomic evolution. These data highlight the oncogenic potency of BCR::ABL1 fusion and contrast with the slow and sequential clonal trajectories of most cancers.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive differential diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical care that is often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process 1 . Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar’s test: 45.7, P &lt; 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar’s test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians’ diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients’ access to specialist-level expertise.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors 1 . Frequency differences between overtone modes—large separations—probe stellar density 2 , whereas differences between low-degree modes—small separations—probe the sound-speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main-sequence Sun-like stars 3 , and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterized by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and become proportional to large separations 4,5 . Here we present evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolutions, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between circuit connectivity and function is crucial for uncovering how the brain computes. In mouse primary visual cortex, excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected 1–8 ; however, broader connectivity rules remain unknown. Here we leverage the millimetre-scale MICrONS dataset to analyse synaptic connectivity and functional properties of neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar response properties are preferentially connected within and across layers and areas—including feedback connections—supporting the universality of ‘like-to-like’ connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections beyond what could be explained by the proximity of axons and dendrites. We also discovered a higher-order rule whereby postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Recurrent neural networks trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns that mirror both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitudes similar to those in MICrONS data. Ablation studies in these recurrent neural networks reveal that disrupting like-to-like connections impairs performance more than disrupting random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may have a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems.",

          "abstract": "At the heart of medicine lies physician–patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust 1,2 . Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians’ expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based 3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE’s performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination 4,5 . The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM–patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.",

          "abstract": "The Saharo-Arabian Desert is one of the largest biogeographical barriers on Earth, impeding dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, including movements of past hominins. Recent research suggests that this barrier has been in place since at least 11 million years ago 1 . In contrast, fossil evidence from the late Miocene epoch and the Pleistocene epoch suggests the episodic presence within the Saharo-Arabian Desert interior of water-dependent fauna (for example, crocodiles, equids, hippopotamids and proboscideans) 2–6 , sustained by rivers and lakes 7,8 that are largely absent from today’s arid landscape. Although numerous humid phases occurred in southern Arabia during the past 1.1 million years 9 , little is known about Arabia’s palaeoclimate before this time. Here, based on a climatic record from desert speleothems, we show recurrent humid intervals in the central Arabian interior over the past 8 million years. Precipitation during humid intervals decreased and became more variable over time, as the monsoon’s influence weakened, coinciding with enhanced Northern Hemisphere polar ice cover during the Pleistocene. Wetter conditions likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, with Arabia acting as a key crossroads for continental-scale biogeographic exchanges.",

          "abstract": "The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from comparative studies 1–3 . Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (&lt;1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives.",

          "abstract": "Radio-frequency (RF) accelerators providing high-quality relativistic electron beams are an important resource enabling many areas of science, as well as industrial and medical applications. Two decades ago, laser-plasma accelerators 1 that support orders of magnitude higher electric fields than those provided by modern RF cavities produced quasi-monoenergetic electron beams for the first time 2–4 . Since then, high-brightness electron beams at gigaelectronvolt (GeV) beam energy and competitive beam properties have been demonstrated from only centimetre-long plasmas 5–9 , a substantial advantage over the hundreds of metres required by RF-cavity-based accelerators. However, despite the considerable progress, the comparably large energy spread and the fluctuation (jitter) in beam energy still effectively prevent laser-plasma accelerators from driving real-world applications. Here we report the generation of a laser-plasma electron beam using active energy compression, resulting in a performance so far only associated with modern RF-based accelerators. Using a magnetic chicane, the electron bunch is first stretched longitudinally to imprint an energy correlation, which is then removed with an active RF cavity. The resulting energy spread and energy jitter are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to below the permille level, meeting the acceptance criteria of a modern synchrotron, thereby opening the path to a compact storage ring injector and other applications.",

          "abstract": "Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia 1–5 . Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects 6–9 . Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system 10 . Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.",

          "abstract": "Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic 1–10 and preferences to those that are nutritious 11–13 . However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel 14,15 , but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.",

          "abstract": "The Maltese archipelago is a small island chain that is among the most remote in the Mediterranean. Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka) 1 . In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys 2–4 . Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta’s geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region.",

          "abstract": "Claims about lexical elaboration (e.g. Mongolian has many horse-related terms) are widespread in the scholarly and popular literature. Here, we show that computational analyses of bilingual dictionaries can be used to test claims about lexical elaboration at scale. We validate our approach by introducing BILA, a dataset including 1,574 bilingual dictionaries, and showing that it confirms 147 out of 163 previous claims from the literature. We then identify previously unreported examples of lexical elaboration, and analyze how lexical elaboration is influenced by ecological and cultural variables. Claims about lexical elaboration are sometimes dismissed as either obvious or fanciful, but our work suggests that large-scale computational approaches to the topic can produce nonobvious and well-grounded insights into language and culture.",

          "abstract": "While Indigenous Knowledge (IK) contains a wealth of information on the behavior and habitat use of species, it is rarely included in the species–habitat models frequently used by Western species management authorities. As decisions from these authorities can limit access to species that are important culturally and for subsistence, exclusion of IK in conservation and management frameworks can negatively impact both species and Indigenous communities. In partnership with Iñupiat hunters, we developed methods to statistically characterize IK of species–habitat relationships and developed models that rely solely on IK to identify species habitat use and important areas. We provide methods for different types of IK documentation and for dynamic habitat types (e.g., ice concentration). We apply the method to ringed seals (natchiq in Iñupiaq) in Alaskan waters, a stock for which the designated critical habitat has been debated in part due to minimal inclusion of IK. Our work demonstrates that IK of species–habitat relationships, with the inclusion of dynamic habitat types, expands on existing mapping approaches and provides another method to identify species habitat use and important areas. The results of this work provide a straightforward and meaningful approach to include IK in species management, especially through comanagement processes.",

          "abstract": "We provide national-scale experimental evidence from China showing that transparency by local governments improves the management of air pollution. Governments that perform better have more reasons to be transparent, making the causal relationship between transparency and policy outcomes difficult to disentangle. In 2015, we randomly assigned municipal governments in China to a high-visibility, public rating of their adherence to national requirements for transparency about their regulation of pollution. By 2016, this treatment significantly boosted transparency in treated cities relative to control cities, allowing us to observe the effect of randomly increasing transparency in the years that followed. Subsequently, high-polluting firms in treated cities cut their violations by 37% compared to similar firms in control cities. Inspections by local governments increased by about 90% in treated cities relative to control cities. Ambient air pollution decreased between 8 and 10% in treated cities relative to control cities, which likely generated significant health benefits. This study provides strong evidence that governmental transparency causes improved environmental quality, at least in a setting where the public and higher governments want to hold local governments accountable.",

We designed an experimental framework using repeated asymmetric Battle of the Sexes and Hawk–Dove games, to explore how cognitive and social skills related to academic success influence behavior. A total of 132 students participated, divided into groups of high and low academic achievers based on their performance at school. Our results show that, on average, high achievers coordinate better on equilibrium outcomes with simple but effective strategies and obtain higher payoffs compared to low achievers. However, we notice also substantial heterogeneity within groups. Finally, performance in pairs with one high and one low achiever is intermediate but closer to the level of high achievers, suggesting potential peer learning effects and the educational value of mixed groups to promote guidance and joint improvements. These findings suggest that academic success may reflect broader cognitive abilities–such as strategic thinking, anticipation of others’ choices, and cooperation–crucial for navigating real-world interactions in complex environments.",

Black, Hispanic, and female students have historically been underrepresented in AP Computer Science (CS). A new, broadly focused course—AP CS Principles—launched nationally in 2016–17 with the goal of increasing student participation and diversity. We examine its effects on AP CS participation. Combining publicly available sources, we assemble a panel dataset of annual AP exam-taking and course offerings from 2006–07 to 2020–21 at Massachusetts high schools. Using synthetic difference-in-differences, we estimate that offering the new course led to 16 additional yearly AP Computer Science exams per school, more than tripling baseline exam counts for the average adopting school. Exam counts among female and Black or Hispanic students more than quadrupled. The new exams were concentrated in AP Computer Science Principles, with no statistically significant reduction in exam counts for the preexisting AP CS course. We also estimate that offering the new course increased schools’ probability of having any AP CS exam participation by 29 percentage points, with larger gains for female and Black or Hispanic students. We find some evidence of positive spillover effects on several other AP courses. The results suggest the promise of course design and availability in promoting engagement and diversity in advanced STEM education.",

          "abstract": "Recent sero-epidemiological studies have strengthened the hypothesis that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) may be a causal factor in multiple sclerosis (MS). Given the complexity of the EBV–host interaction, various mechanisms may be responsible for the disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether this is a disease-specific process. Here, we showed that genes encoding EBV interactors are enriched in loci associated with MS but not with other diseases and in prioritized therapeutic targets. Analyses of MS blood and brain transcriptomes confirmed a dysregulation of MS-associated EBV interactors affecting the CD40 pathway. Such interactors were strongly enriched in binding sites for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) viral transcriptional regulator, often in colocalization with CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and RNA Polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A). EBNA2 was expressed in the MS brain. The 1.2 EBNA2 allele downregulated the expression of the CD40 MS-associated gene analogously to the CD40 MS-risk variant. Finally, we showed that the 1.2 EBNA2 allele associates with the risk of MS. This study delineates how host and viral genetic variability converge in MS-specific pathogenetic mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers rearrange allele combinations and create offspring diversity. Crossovers occur nonrandomly along chromosomes, predominantly in distal euchromatin and less in pericentromeric heterochromatin marked with histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and the H2A variant H2A.W in Arabidopsis thaliana . Loss of H3K9me2 increases heterochromatic crossovers, but how H2A.W affects crossover formation in pericentromeric regions is unknown. Here, we report that H2A.W is required to restrict heterochromatic crossovers in Arabidopsis . Using meiosis-specific microRNA-induced gene silencing (meiMIGS) and fluorescence-tagged recombination reporters, we show that meiotic knockdown of H2A.W.6 , H2A.W.7 , and H2A.W.12 ( meiMIGS-H2A.W.6/7/12 ) increases pericentromeric crossovers. High-resolution genomic maps of crossovers show that meiMIGS-H2A.W.6/7/12 enhances heterochromatic crossovers, similar to meiMIGS plants silencing the H3K9me2 pathway. Consistently, genome-wide crossover maps show that the mutants h2a.w.6 , h2a.w.7 , h2a.w.6 h2a.w.7 , and h2a.w.6 h2a.w.7 h2a.w.12, but not h2a.w.12, exhibit a similar increase in heterochromatic crossovers to meiMIGS-H2A.W.6/7/12 , demonstrating that H2A.W.6 and H2A.W.7 limit heterochromatic crossovers. Profiling of genome-wide nucleosome density using micrococcal nuclease sequencing reveals that h2a.w mutants with increased heterochromatic crossovers have increased heterochromatin accessibility, with lower H3K9me2 levels during meiosis. Our findings shed light on the role of H2A.W variants as heterochromatin compaction factors that suppress meiotic crossovers within the pericentromeric regions.",

          "abstract": "Microbial colony development hinges upon a myriad of factors, including mechanical, biochemical, and environmental niches, which collectively shape spatial patterns governed by intricate gene regulatory networks. The inherent complexity of this phenomenon necessitates innovative approaches to comprehend and compare the mechanisms driving pattern formation. Here, we unveil the multistability of bacterial colony patterns, where bacterial colony patterns can stabilize into multiple distinct types including ring-like patterns and sector-like patterns on hard agar, orchestrated by a simple synthetic bistable switch. Utilizing quantitative imaging and spatially resolved transcriptome approaches, we explore the deterministic process of a ring-like colony pattern formation from a single cell. This process is primarily driven by bifurcation events programmed by the gene regulatory network and microenvironmental cues. Additionally, we observe a noise-induced process amplified by the founder effect, leading to patterns of symmetry-break during range expansion. The degrees of asymmetry are profoundly influenced by the initial conditions of single progenitor cells during the nascent stages of colony development. These findings underscore how the process of range expansion enables individual cells, exposed to a uniform growth-promoting environment, to exhibit inherent capabilities in generating emergent, self-organized behavior.",

          "abstract": "The interaction of mRNA and regulatory proteins is critical for posttranscriptional control. For proper function, these interactions, as well as the involved protein and RNA structures, are highly dynamic, and thus, mechanistic insights from structural biology are challenging to obtain. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach combining single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) with NMR spectroscopy to analyze the concerted interaction of the two RNA-binding interfaces (A-site and B-site) of the immunoregulatory protein Roquin’s ROQ domain with the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of the Ox40 mRNA. This 3’UTR contains two specific hairpin structures termed constitutive and alternative decay elements (CDE, ADE), which mediate mRNA degradation through Roquin binding. Our single-molecule experiments reveal that the CDE folds cooperatively, while ADE folding involves at least three on-pathway and three off-pathway intermediates. Using an integrated microfluidics setup, we extract binding kinetics to Roquin in real time. Supported by NMR data, we find opposing effects of the two Roquin subdomains on distinct regions of the ADE: While the A-site interacts strongly with the folded apical stem-loop, we find that the B-site has a distinct destabilizing effect on the central stem of the ADE owed to single-strand RNA binding. We propose that RNA-motif nature and Roquin A- and B-sites jointly steer mRNA decay with context-encoded specificity, and we suggest plasticity of stem structures as key determinant for Roquin–RNA complex formation. The unique combination of NMR and SMFS uncovers a mechanism of a dual-function RNA-binding domain, offering a model for target RNA recognition by Roquin.",

Yet, neither the regulatory function of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the embryo nor the embryonic O-GlcNAc proteome have been documented. Here, we devised a strategy to enzymatically remove O-GlcNAc from preimplantation embryonic nuclei, where this modification accumulates coincidently with embryonic genome activation (EGA). Unexpectedly, the depletion of nuclear O-GlcNAc to undetectable levels has no impact on EGA, but dampens the transcriptional upregulation of the translational machinery, and triggers a spindle checkpoint response. These molecular alterations were phenotypically associated with a developmental delay starting from early cleavage stages and persisting after embryo implantation, establishing a link between nuclear glycosylation and the pace of embryonic development.",

          "abstract": "The brain criticality hypothesis postulates that brain dynamics are set at a phase transition where information processing is optimized. Long-range temporal correlations (TCs) characterizing the dissipation of information within a signal have been shown to be a hallmark of brain criticality. However, the experimental link between cognitive performance, criticality, and thus TCs has remained elusive due to limitations in recording length and spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we investigate multiday invasive EEG recordings of 104 persons with epilepsy (PwE) together with an extensive cognitive test battery. We show that short TCs predict cognitive impairment. Further, we show that heterogeneous factors, including interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), antiseizure medications (ASMs), and intermittent periods with slow-wave activity (SWSs), all act directly to perturb critical dynamics and thus cognition. Our work suggests critical dynamics to be the setpoint to measure optimal network function, thereby providing a unifying framework for the heterogeneous mechanisms impacting cognition in conditions like epilepsy.",

We introduce adaptive surface doping (ASD), an innovative strategy to overcome this dichotomy in OSCs. ASD's adaptive mechanism accommodates a broad range of dopant concentrations, optimally passivating trap states as needed. This approach significantly lowers the trap energy level from 84 meV to 14 meV above the valence band edge, promoting a transition from hopping to band-like transport mechanisms. ASD boosts carrier mobility by over 60%, reaching up to 30.7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , while extending the extrapolated operational lifetime of treated devices beyond 57.5 y. This breakthrough sets a standard in organic electronics, positioning ASD as a powerful method for simultaneously enhancing performance and stability in OSC devices.",

This behavior is driven by myogenic plateau potentials, long-lasting depolarizations of the pharyngeal muscle, which are timed by neuronal input from a dedicated pharyngeal nervous system. While the timing of these plateaus’ initiation has received significant attention, their mechanisms of termination remain incompletely understood. In particular, it is unclear how plateaus resist early termination by hyperpolarizing current noise. Here, we present a computational model of pharyngeal plateaus against a noisy background. We propose that an unusual, rapidly inactivating potassium conductance confers exceptional noise robustness on the system. We further investigate the possibility that a similar mechanism in other systems permits switching between plateau and spiking behavior under noisy conditions.",

However, the neuronal populations mediating beneficial effects remain largely unknown. Using a combination therapy in a mouse model of complete SCI, we show that virally delivered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (AAV-BDNF) activates hindlimb stepping and causes hyperreflexia, whereas submotor threshold epidural stimulation (ES) reduces BDNF-induced hyperreflexia. Given their role in gating proprioceptive afferents and as a potential convergence point of BDNF and ES, we hypothesized that an enhanced excitability of inhibitory RORβ neurons would be associated with locomotor improvements. Ex vivo spinal slice recordings from mice with a range of locomotor and hyperreflexia scores revealed that the excitability of RORβ neurons was related to functional outcome post-SCI. Mice with poor locomotor function after SCI had less excitable RORβ neurons, but the excitability of RORβ neurons was similar between the uninjured and “best stepping” SCI groups. Further, chemogenetic activation of RORβ neurons reduced BDNF-induced hyperreflexia and improved stepping, similar to ES. Our findings identify inhibitory RORβ neurons as a target population to limit hyperreflexia and enhance locomotor function after SCI.",

Here, we removed the C-terminal tail of five alpha- and four beta-tubulin genes in the C. elegans genome. Sensory cilia typically exhibit an axoneme that longitudinally differentiates into a middle segment with doublet MTs and a distal segment with singlet MTs. However, the excision of the alpha-tubulin tail, but not the beta-tubulin tail, resulted in the ectopic formation of doublet MTs in the distal segments. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the alpha-tubulin tail could prevent the B-tubule from docking on the surface of A-tubule. Using recombinant tubulins, we demonstrated that removing the alpha-tubulin tail efficiently promoted doublet MTs formation in vitro. These results reveal the vital and unique contributions of tubulin tails to the structural integrity and accuracy of axoneme MT organization.",

Since it is not possible to directly target a TSG, no treatment options are available for these patients. Here, we identify SRP19 and the protein secretion machinery as a unique vulnerability in cancers with heterozygous APC loss. SRP19 is located 15 kb from APC and is almost always codeleted in these tumors. Heterozygous APC/SRP19 loss leads to lower levels of SRP19 mRNA and protein. Consequently, cells with APC/SRP19 loss are vulnerable to partial suppression of SRP19 . Moreover, we show that SRP19 is rate limiting for the formation of the Signal Recognition Particle, a complex that mediates ER-protein translocation, and thus, heterozygous SRP19 loss leads to less protein secretion and higher levels of ER-stress. As a result, low-dose arsenic trioxide induces ER-stress and inhibits proliferation in cultured cell lines and animal models. Our work identifies a strategy to treat cancers with APC deletion and provides a framework for identifying and translating vulnerabilities associated with loss of a TSG.",

However, effective genetic tools for lineage tracing and functional assessments of NMPs in vivo are currently lacking. Here, we developed a dual recombinase–mediated genetic system to specifically trace and ablate Brachyury + Sox2 + NMPs. Our genetic tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that NMPs consist of three distinct unipotent and bipotent progenitor populations that progressively differentiate into neural and mesodermal fates. Genetic depletion of NMPs demonstrated their critical role in trunk and tail formation. This study provides in vivo genetic evidence supporting the heterogeneity of NMPs in terms of cell fate determination and their functional roles in the developing embryo.",

We show that SIVmus is not resistant to ZAP inhibition. Instead, these Cercopithecus monkey hosts differ from other primate species by a splice site mutation and express the poorly active extralarge XL rather than the highly active L isoform of ZAP. Similarly, higher CpG levels in endogenous prosimian lentiviruses were associated with low activity of the corresponding host lemur ZAPs.

This study examines white matter differences across adolescents from diverse environments, evaluating both their extent throughout the brain and their contribution to cognitive outcomes. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (N = 9,082, female = 4,327), we found extensive cross-sectional associations with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and streamline count in the brains of 9- and 10-y-old children exposed to a range of experiences, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, and neighborhood adversity. Lower values of FA were associated with later difficulties with mental arithmetic and receptive language. Furthermore, white matter FA partially mediated the detrimental relationship between adversity and cognition later in adolescence. These findings advance a white matter-based account of the neural and cognitive effects of adversity, which supports leading developmental theories that place interregional connectivity prior to gray matter maturation.",

Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as desirable platforms for photocatalytic applications by virtue of their structural diversity and functional adjustability. Herein, we report that we have synthesized a stable and photosensitive zirconium-based MOF (Zr-MOF) with a photoactive tetrathienylethene-based organic linker, Zr-TSS-1. Compared with all-carbocyclic Zr-MOF counterparts, Zr-TSS-1 shows a substantial improvement in visible-light harvesting and free-carrier generation, enabling it to be a promising candidate for photocatalytic antibacterial applications. In order to validate the advantages of this framework as an antibacterial protective material, a composite was fabricated by incorporating robust Zr-TSS-1 onto sustainably accessible bacterial cellulose (BC) using an in situ growth method. This composite exhibits near-complete lethality toward typical Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus within 1 h under mild irradiation and preserves outstanding antibacterial capability after five cycles of reutilization. In addition, the high biocompatibility is confirmed by the low cytotoxicity toward human skin fibroblast, suggesting its potential for biomedical and healthcare applications. This research demonstrates the efficacious integration of a purposely designed photosensitive porous framework onto a sustainable substrate for synergistic functionality, paving a practical way for the development of the next-generation high-efficiency antimicrobial technology.",

RIN and FUL1 are silenced in dml2 mutant plants, and the defective ripening phenotype of dml2 is mimicked by the rin/ful1 double mutant. Restoration of RIN expression in dml2 partially rescues its ripening defects. DNA methylation controls ripening not only by regulating the expression of RIN and FUL1 but also by interfering with the genomic binding of RIN. In dml2 mutant plants, RIN cannot bind to some of its targets in vivo even though DNA methylation does not interfere with RIN binding in vitro; this inhibited binding in vivo is correlated with increased DNA methylation and histone H3 enrichment within 100 bp of the binding site.

When surfaces become active, however, the governing laws of wetting remain elusive. Here, we propose chemically active wetting as a class of active systems where the surface is active due to a binding process that is maintained away from equilibrium. We derive the corresponding nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory and show that active binding fundamentally changes the wetting behavior, leading to steady, nonequilibrium states with droplet shapes reminiscent of a pancake or a mushroom. The origin of such anomalous shapes can be explained by mapping to electrostatics, where pairs of binding sinks and sources correspond to electrostatic dipoles along the triple line. This is an example of a more general analogy, where localized chemical activity gives rise to a multipole field of the chemical potential. The underlying physics is relevant for cells, where droplet-forming proteins can bind to membranes accompanied by the turnover of biological fuels.",

RAD52 oligomerizes to rings that are thought to promote annealing. However, rings have only been observed at micromolar concentrations at which annealing activity is impaired. Thus, it is unclear which oligomeric form is responsible for annealing. We combined single-molecule mass photometry with biochemical assays to determine the in vitro oligomeric states of human RAD52. We found that RAD52 was mostly monomeric at lower nanomolar concentrations. With increasing concentration, RAD52 oligomerized and formed rings with a variable stoichiometry from heptamers to tridecamers consistent with an oligomerization model of noncooperative assembly coupled with preferential cyclization. Under conditions where hardly any rings were present, RAD52 already promoted single-strand annealing in vitro. Our findings indicate that in vitro single-strand annealing can be mediated by monomers and short oligomers of RAD52. The oligomerization model suggests that ring formation is similar to a phase transition whereby rings are a reservoir to replenish the monomer and short oligomer pool. This pool has a nearly constant concentration which may be optimal for annealing and would be independent, for example, of the amount of DNA damage, protein upregulation, or the cell cycle.",

In this study, we identified HEATR3, an LC3-interacting region (LIR)-containing protein, as a factor involved in this defense mechanism using quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. HEATR3 localizes intracellularly invading Salmonella , and HEATR3 deficiency promotes Salmonella proliferation in the cytoplasm. HEATR3 also localizes to lysosomes damaged by chemical treatment, suggesting that Salmonella recognition is facilitated by damage to the host cell membrane. HEATR3 deficiency impairs LC3 recruitment to damaged membranes and blocks the delivery of the target to the lysosome. These phenotypes were rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type HEATR3 but not by the LIR mutant, indicating the crucial role of the HEATR3–LC3 interaction in the receptor for selective autophagy. HEATR3 is delivered to lysosomes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Although HEATR3 recruitment to the damaged membrane was unaffected by ATG5 or FIP200 deficiency, it was markedly impaired by treatment with a calcium chelator, suggesting involvement upstream of the autophagic pathway. These findings suggest that HEATR3 serves as a receptor for selective autophagy and is able to identify damaged membranes, facilitate the removal of damaged lysosomes, and target invading bacteria within cells.",

          "abstract": "Historical trends suggest the decline in the importance of land as a production factor, as evidenced by the decline in the employment and gross domestic product (GDP) shares of land-intensive industries. However, land continues to be a prominent store of value, as over half of household wealth in major countries is real estate. To explain this apparent disconnection between land output and land value, in a plausible economic model with land and aggregate risk, we theoretically study the long-run behavior of land prices and identify economic conditions under which land becomes overvalued relative to the fundamentals defined by the present value of land rents. Unbalanced growth together with the elasticity of substitution between production factors plays a critical role. We establish the Land Overvaluation Theorem: When the elasticity of substitution between land and nonland factors exceeds 1 (which is natural because we can create more space by constructing taller buildings with fixed land) and technological progress is faster in nonland sectors, land overvaluation necessarily emerges. As applications of the Theorem, we present three examples: i) land overvaluation emerges along the long-run transition from the Malthusian agricultural economy to the modern knowledge- and service-based economy; ii) with aggregate uncertainty, land prices exhibit recurrent stochastic fluctuations around the trend, with expansions and contractions in the size of land overvaluation; and iii) in modern economies, land use is also changing and urban land has high value. We present a model of urban land prices and show that land overvaluation emerges in the process of urban formation characterized by unbalanced growth.",

          "abstract": "The mature mammalian auditory sensory organ, the organ of Corti (OC), lacks the capacity for regenerating hair cells, leading to permanent hearing impairment. In contrast, the vestibular system has a limited capacity for hair cell regeneration, which we have shown to be further enhanced by inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Here, we demonstrate that, despite similar transcriptional responses, only vestibular and not auditory supporting cells proliferate as a result of Yap activation following Hippo inhibition. Mechanistically, we identify p27 Kip1 , a cell cycle kinase inhibitor encoded by Cdkn1b , as an additional barrier preventing cell cycle reentry specifically in the OC. We show that while in both systems Yap stimulates p27 Kip1 degradation through activation of its direct target gene Skp2 , this protein-level control is antagonized by an unusually high level of Cdkn1b transcription in the cochlea. Consequently, p27 Kip1 activity is maintained in the OC even in the presence of constitutively active Yap5SA, counteracting its mitogenic effects. Supporting this model, inactivation of the Hippo pathway in the Cdkn1b -deficient background is sufficient to induce adult auditory supporting cell proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the synergistic interaction between Hippo and p27 Kip1 is conserved in the retina where inhibition of both pathways potently induces Müller glia proliferation and initiates neuronal regeneration. Our work uncovers the molecular mechanism preventing quiescent adult sensory progenitor cells, supporting cells in the ear and Müller glia in the eye, from reentering the cell cycle after damage—the key step toward sensory receptor regeneration blocked in mammals.",

          "abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a commensal in the human oral cavity, is overrepresented in the colon microbiota of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and is linked to tumor chemoresistance, metastasis, and a poor therapeutic prognosis. Fn produces numerous adhesins that mediate tumor colonization and downregulation of the host’s antitumor immune response. One of these, the trimeric autotransporter adhesin (TAA) CEACAM binding protein of Fusobacterium (CbpF), targets CEACAM1 on T-cells and has been associated with immune evasion of Fn-colonized tumors. Whereas the role of CEACAM1 in homophilic and heterophilic cell interactions and immune evasion is well described, the mechanistic details of its interaction with fusobacterial CbpF remain unknown due to the lack of a high-resolution structure of the adhesin–receptor complex. Here, we present two structures of CbpF alone and in complex with CEACAM1, obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy and single particle analysis. They reveal that CbpF forms a stable homotrimeric complex whose N-terminal part of the extracellular domain comprises a 64 Å long β roll domain with a unique lateral loop extension. CEACAM1 binds to this loop with high affinity via its N-terminal IgV-like domain with a nanomolar dissociation constant as determined by surface plasmon resonance. This study provides a comprehensive structural description of a fusobacterial TAA, illustrates a yet undescribed CEACAM1 binding mode, and paves the way for rational drug design targeting Fn in CRC.",

          "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently causes about one million infections and 240,000 deaths worldwide each year. To reach the goal set by the World Health Organization of global HCV elimination by 2030, it is critical to develop a prophylactic vaccine. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) target the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface, can neutralize a broad range of the highly diverse circulating HCV strains, and are essential tools to inform vaccine design. However, bNAbs targeting a single E1E2 epitope might be limited in neutralization breadth, which can be enhanced by using combinations of bNAbs that target different envelope epitopes. We have generated 60 immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that can simultaneously target two distinct epitopes on E1E2. We combine non- or partially overlapping E1E2 specificities into three types of bsAbs, each containing a different hinge length. The majority of bsAbs shows retained or increased potency and breadth against a diverse panel of HCV pseudoparticles and HCV produced in cell culture compared to monospecific and cocktail controls. Additionally, we demonstrate that changes in the hinge length of bsAbs can alter the binding stoichiometry to E1E2. These results provide insights into the binding modes and the role of avidity in bivalent targeting of diverse E1E2 epitopes.This study illustrates how potential cooperative effects of HCV bNAbs can be utilized by strategically designing bispecific constructs. These HCV bsAbs can guide vaccine development and unlock novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against HCV and other (flavi)viruses.",

          "abstract": "Seismic fault slip and rupture propagation often occur at crustal depths in the presence of hot and pressurized aqueous fluids (i.e., hydrothermal conditions). Previous experiments investigated fault frictional properties under hydrothermal conditions, but at imposed subseismic fault slip velocities ( V ~μm/s). Here, using a rotary-shear apparatus equipped with a hydrothermal pressure vessel, we study friction at seismic slip velocities ( V = 1.5 m/s) of gabbro- and marble-built faults under temperatures of 40 to 400 °C and pore water pressure of 30 MPa. We find that with increasing initial water temperature ( T amb ), the dynamic friction during initial slip acceleration and subsequent high-velocity sliding decreases for both gabbro- and marble-built faults, while the slip-weakening distance decreases for gabbro but increases for marble. Then, during rapid deceleration at the end of sliding, frictional strength recovery decreases for gabbro with increasing T amb and increases for marble independently of T amb . As in previous experiments performed at room T amb , the mechanical and microstructural data, plus numerical modeling, suggest that the seismic fault weakening mechanisms shift from flash heating to bulk melting for gabbro, and from flash heating to grain boundary sliding accommodated by diffusion creep for marble, with their activation processes depending on T amb . Our results demonstrate the effects of ambient temperature on seismic fault friction, which contribute to changes in fault strength and dynamic weakening processes at crustal depths and should be considered in earthquake rupture modeling.",

By varying pyridyl-substituted alkyl carboxylic acids, the spatial positioning of the N atom in pyridine group relative to adjacent Co(salen) can be precisely controlled. Notably, the 3-(pyridin-4-yl)propionic acid, with para -position pyridine N atom, maximally improves the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction performance of Co(salen) unit, far superior to other counterparts. Mechanism investigations reveal that the pyridine unit of 3-(pyridin-4-yl)propionic acid is optimally positioned relative to Co(salen) and undergoes in situ reduction to pyridinyl radical under working potentials.

Arf1 can physically associate with Sqh and Vibrator, a type I PITP that stimulates phospholipid PI4K activity for PI(4)P production.

Yet, much remains unknown about how art is subjectively interpreted. In this study, we sought to elucidate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the subjective interpretation of art. Using brain imaging and written descriptions, we quantified individual variability in responses to paintings by the same artists, contrasting figurative and abstract paintings. Our findings revealed that abstract art elicited greater interindividual variability in activity within higher-order, associative brain areas, particularly those comprising the default-mode network. By contrast, no such differences were found in early visual areas, suggesting that subjective variability arises from higher cognitive processes rather than differences in sensory processing.

In this study, we assessed the morphology and crystallinity of individually dispersed microfibrils isolated from the cell walls of wood, cotton, and ramie celluloses. It is well known that microfibrils in higher plants exhibit structural diversity, and these three plants, in particular, have distinct differences in the morphology and crystallinity of microfibrils. Our structural analyses combining atomic force microscopy (AFM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the uniformity in the cross-sectional dimensions and crystallinity of the dispersed microfibrils, irrespective of the plant species. The majority of the microfibrils were dispersed as structural units with widths of approximately 2 to 3 nm, and their crystallite sizes and crystallinity degrees were approximately 2 nm and 20%, respectively. These structural profiles were in agreement with the simulation results; here, the model assumed that a single microfibril consisted of 18 cellulose molecules. These results from the direct dimensional assessments support a recent hypothesis in biophysics that a single biosynthesis system of cellulose, referred to as the terminal complex (TC), consisted of 18 synthases. Some of the dispersed microfibrils had bundled sizes of two or three microfibrils. We also demonstrated that this bundling was stabilized by the fusion of several crystallites.",

          "abstract": "The solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This structurally complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of metal anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution—the reverse reaction of deposition—in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a transient SEI (T-SEI) that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is “relaxable” upon removal of the enforced dissolution current; that is, the T-SEI dissolves back into the electrolyte when rested. The formation of T-SEI plays an unexpected critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate-discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests that the deposition occurs via growth of the original grains; this is in stark contrast to the isolated, new nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Using 3D profilometry, we observe a 42% reduction in surface roughness due to T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the kinetics at ion-producing electrochemical interfaces, and suggest a new dimension for engineering next generation batteries.",

We tested the hypothesis that juvenile susceptibility is maintained by high costs of resistance by quantifying the genetic correlation between host fitness and age-specific innate resistance to a fungal pathogen in a wild plant. We separately measured the resistance of 45 genetic families of the wild plant, Silene latifolia, to its endemic fungal pathogen, Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae, at four ages in a controlled inoculation experiment. We then grew these same families in a field common garden and tracked survival and fecundity over a 2-y period and quantified the correlation between age-specific resistance and fitness in the field. We found significant fitness costs associated with disease resistance at juvenile but not at adult host stages. We then used an age-structured compartmental model to show that the magnitude of these costs is sufficient to prevent the evolution of higher juvenile resistance in models, allowing the disease to persist.

          "abstract": "Humans and other animals are adept at learning to perform cognitively demanding behavioral tasks. Neurophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates during such tasks find that the requisite cognitive variables are encoded strongly in core oculomotor brain regions. Here, we assembled a large dataset—11 monkeys performing an abstract visual categorization task, surveyed across more than 1,000 neural recording sessions—to reveal that this produces a robust but uninstructed behavioral “tell,” observed in all subjects and experiments: small, cognitively modulated eye movements. We find that these eye movements are causally linked to activity in SC but not LIP, and that they occur following transient alignment of cognitive and saccadic population coding subspaces in SC. This behavioral signature of oculomotor engagement is absent during a similar task that does not require rule-based categorization, suggesting that abstract task behaviors recruit primate oculomotor networks more strongly than previously understood.",

Here, we first employ simulations of micromagnetic energy function in few-layer easy-plane antiferromagnetic systems with a weak additional uniaxial anisotropy and unveil an intriguing even–odd effect closely linked to low-field spin–flop behaviors. We further perform tunneling magneto-conductance measurements on a model 2D antiferromagnetic insulator, CrCl 3 , exhibiting near-ideal easy-plane anisotropy. The magnetic field-controlled tunneling current at low temperature aligns well with simulated in-plane anisotropic spin-configuration, providing direct experimental evidence for detecting magnetic anisotropy field around 1 mT. Our work creates opportunities for finely characterizing magnetic structures and behaviors in 2D antiferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic systems, with potential applications in spintronics such as data storage and magnetic sensing.",

We also assessed multivariate morphological terms that capture brain size, shape, and folding processes. The sample consisted of 345 typically developing infants, 73 preterm infants, and 107 infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) who underwent brain MRI. Our results show that typically developing neonates and those with CHD follow the cortical folding scaling law obtained from mammalian brains, children, and adults which captures the relationship between exposed SA, total SA, and CT. Cortical folding scaling was not affected by gestational age at birth, postmenstrual age at scan, sex, or multiple birth in these populations. CHD was characterized by a unique reduction in the multivariate morphological term capturing size, suggesting that CHD affects cortical growth overall but not cortical folding processes. In contrast, preterm birth was characterized by altered cortical folding scaling and altered shape, suggesting that the developmentally programmed processes of cortical folding are disrupted in this population. The degree of altered shape was associated with cognitive abilities in early childhood in preterm infants.",

          "abstract": "The inhibitor of DNA binding protein ID3 has been associated with the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite its significance, its specific role in the immune evasion strategies utilized by CRC remains unclear. RNA-seq analysis revealed that ID3 was positively associated with the PD-L1 immune checkpoint. We further demonstrated that tumor cell–expressed ID3 enhanced PD-L1 expression, suppressed the infiltration and activation of CD8 + T cells, and facilitated the immune evasion of CRC cells. Additionally, we found that knockdown of ID3 significantly enhanced the effectiveness of PD-L1 antibody blockade treatment in combating CRC, reduced the upregulation of PD-L1 induced by the antibody, and altered the immune microenvironment within CRC. Mechanistically, ID3 interacted with the transcription factor MYC and reconstructed the four-dimensional structure of MYC, thereby enhancing its binding affinity to the PD-L1 promoter and augmenting PD-L1 transcriptional activity. By integrating analysis of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and ImmPort gene sets, we found that ID3’s DNA-assisted binding function was widespread and could either enhance or suppress gene transcription, not only affecting tumor immune escape through immune checkpoints but also regulating various cytokines and immune cells involved in tumor immunity. In conclusion, our study uncovers a mechanism by which ID3 promotes immune evasion in CRC and implicates that targeting ID3 may improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.",

The Hodge decomposition theorem establishes a profound link between the geometry of varieties and their cohomology groups, helping to understand their underlying properties. Moreover, Hodge theory was crucial at the inception of the field of mirror symmetry, revealing deep connections among seemingly disparate algebraic varieties. It also sheds light on studying algebraic cycles and motives, crucial objects in algebraic geometry. This article explores Hodge polynomials and their properties, specifically focusing on non-Kähler complex manifolds. We investigate a diverse range of such manifolds, including (quasi-)Hopf, (quasi-)Calabi–Eckmann, and LVM manifolds, alongside a class of definable complex manifolds encompassing both algebraic varieties and the aforementioned special cases. Our research establishes the preservation of the motivic nature of Hodge polynomials inside this broader context. Through explicit calculations and thorough analyses, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of complex manifold geometry beyond the realm of algebraic varieties. The outcomes of this study have potential applications in various areas of mathematics and physics where complex manifolds play a significant role.",

This recycling endocytic receptor of the plasma membrane determines the concentrations of hundreds of circulating glycoproteins in the blood and plays important roles in host responses to and outcomes of infection. The compositional and topological determinants of a physiological AMR ligand have remained unclear with contradictory findings reported. Previous studies established that the AMR binds multivalent galactose on desialylated triantennary or higher-branched N-glycans with little to no binding to galactose on biantennary forms. However, the vast majority of circulating blood glycoproteins are modified by biantennary N-glycans, rendering them unlikely to be ligands bound and eliminated by the AMR. Separately, other studies reported that AMR ligands include sialylated N-glycans, and specifically α2-6, but not α2-3, sialic acid linkages. Herein, we investigated the composition and topology of AMR ligands using a known physiological AMR ligand, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Recombinant active IAP was produced in glycoengineered cells with either biantennary or higher valency triantennary and tetra-antennary N-glycan structures, and further with and without either α2-6 or α2-3 sialic acid linkages. These closely homogenous IAP monomer glycoforms assemble as dimers with similar enzymatic activity and were compared in AMR binding and clearance assays. Our results indicate that the AMR does not significantly bind IAP when its N-glycans are predominantly sialylated with either α2-6 or α2-3 sialic acid linkages. Multivalent desialylated AMR ligands may, however, appear when IAP monomers dimerize, resulting in the close proximation of biantennary N-glycans.",

Proper regulation of LC3B homeostasis is essential for its function. Although LC3B is modulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), the impact of these modifications on LC3B protein homeostasis remains unclear. Neddylation, a recently identified ubiquitin-like modification, plays diverse biological roles. Here, we identify LC3B as a specific target for neddylation. This modification weakens LC3B’s interaction with the ubiquitin E3 ligases VHL and BIRC6, thereby reducing LC3B ubiquitination. Depletion of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2M (UBE2M), the primary E2 enzyme in the neddylation pathway, destabilizes LC3B and suppresses autophagy activity. Heterozygous Ube2m knockout ( Ube2m +/− ) mice exhibit pronounced aging-like phenotypes, with reduced LC3B expression and impaired autophagy in skin tissues. Our findings demonstrate that LC3B neddylation is vital for maintaining its stability and regulating autophagy flux, offering a potential therapeutic avenue to mitigate aging-related processes.",

          "abstract": "Cellular structure maintenance and function regulation critically depend on the composition and spatial distribution of numerous membrane proteins. However, current methods face limitations in spatial coverage and data scalability, hindering the comprehensive analysis of protein interactions in complex cellular nanoenvironment. Herein, we introduce p roximity- a ctivated D NA s canning e ncoded sequencing (PADSE-seq), an innovative technique that utilizes flexible DNA probes with adjustable lengths. These dynamic probes are anchored at a single end, enabling free swings within a nanoscale range to perform global scanning, recording, and accumulating of information on diverse proximal proteins in random directions along unrestricted paths. PADSE-seq leverages the autonomous cyclic cleavage of single-stranded DNA to sequentially activate encoded probes distributed throughout the local area. This process triggers strand displacement amplification and bidirectional extension reactions, linking proteins barcodes with molecular barcodes in tandem and further generating millions to billions of amplicons embedded with the combinatorial identifiers for next-generation sequencing analysis. As a proof of concept, we validated PADSE-seq for mapping the distribution of over a dozen kinds of proteins, including HER1, EpCAM, and PDL1, in proximity to HER2 in breast cancer cell lines, demonstrating its ability to decode multiplexed protein proximities at the nanoscale. Notably, we observed that the spatial distribution of proximal proteins around low-abundance target proteins exhibited greater diversity across regions with variable proximity ranges.

          "abstract": "Stomata, which are essential for the exchange of CO 2 and water vapor between plant leaves and the atmosphere, are regulated by a variety of environmental and internal factors. In this study, we identified and characterized two genes, Guard Cell Turgor Maintaining 1 ( GCT1 ) and its closest homolog GCT2 , which encode rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)-like protein kinases that play a critical role in maintaining guard cell turgor in Zea mays . We found that overexpression of ZmGCT1 and ZmGCT2 confers resistance to abscisic acid (ABA)-promoted stomatal closure, whereas the zmgct1 zmgct2 double loss-of-function mutants exhibit a loss of guard cell turgor, resulting in nearly closed stomata even under favorable growth conditions. A dominant mutation, zmgct1-9D , which lacks nine amino acids including T80, retains its kinase activity and plasma membrane localization but displays insensitive to ABA-, CO 2 -, Ca 2+ -, or H 2 O 2 -promoted stomatal closure. ABA-activated ZmSnRK2.8/9 phosphorylates ZmGCT1 at T80, reducing its plasma membrane localization. Intriguingly, the ZmSnRK2.10 or ZmSLAC1 mutant can suppress the reduced turgor phenotype in guard cells of the zmgct1 mutant. Furthermore, ZmGCT1 phosphorylates the penultimate threonine residue (T573) of ZmSLAC1, inhibiting both the constitutively active ZmSLAC1 and ZmSnRK2.8-activated ZmSLAC1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes, a process dependent on ZmGCT1 kinase activity. These findings suggest that ZmGCT1 and ZmGCT2 directly inhibit ZmSLAC1 to maintain guard cell turgor under favorable growth conditions, while ABA treatment alleviates this inhibition primarily by reducing ZmGCT1’s plasma membrane localization. This study provides mechanistic insights into the regulation of stomatal movement by ZmGCT1/2 kinases under both favorable and stress conditions.",

When iPS cells were generated from patients with CCD and Runx2-deficient iPS cells were generated using gene-editing techniques, abnormal laminopathy-like nuclei were observed. Runx2-deficient cells showed reduced Lamin A/C expression, but not protein levels. However, in Runx2-deficient cells, both the gene expression and protein levels of Nesprin1 were reduced, perinuclear actin fibers were sparser, and nuclear stiffness was reduced. Forced expression of Lamin A/C increased nuclear stiffness but did not improve nuclear morphology. In contrast, the induction of Nesprin1 expression alone normalized nuclear stiffness and restored nuclear morphology and perinuclear actin distribution. In Runx2-null cells, mechanical stress-induced phosphorylation of emerin was not observed. In contrast, forced expression of Nesprin1 in Runx2-null cells resulted in phosphorylation of emerin, indicating the restoration of intracellular tension. These observations were confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Therefore, the intracellular tension was inferred to pull the nuclear membrane into its normal shape. CUT&amp;RUN assay and single RNA-seq analysis showed that an aberrant nuclear membrane caused loss of nuclear lamina gene regulation machinery, making the progression of normal osteogenic differentiation impossible; however, supplementation with Nesprin1 restored gene regulation mechanisms and promoted preosteoblast formation with normal nuclear morphology. Nesprin1 expression induced by Runx2 is essential for epigenetic regulation of the nuclear lamina. We propose CCD as a type of laminopathy involving defective expression of Nesprin1 regulated by Runx2.",

We show that Orc6, the smallest subunit of ORC, utilizes its transcription factor II B-B domain to orchestrate the sequential binding of ORC to origin DNA. In addition, Orc6 plays the role of a scaffold by stabilizing the basic patch (BP) of Orc5 for ORC to capture and bend origin DNA. Importantly, disrupting DNA bending through mutating three key residues in Orc5-BP impairs ORC’s ability to promote replication initiation at two points during the pre-RC assembly process. This study dissects the multifaceted role of Orc6 in orchestrating ORC’s activities on DNA and underscores the vital role of DNA bending by ORC in replication licensing.",

Here, we inoculated a symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) model cnidarian ( Exaiptasia diaphana : “Aiptasia”) with either its native symbiont Breviolum minutum or one of three non-native symbionts: Symbiodinium microadriaticum , Cladocopium goreaui, and Durusdinium trenchii . We then measured and compared host AP, host AU, symbiont EX, and symbiont cell-cycle phase for up to a year with these different symbionts and used these discrete measurements to inform comparative models of symbiont population regulation. Our models showed a general pattern, where regulation through AP and AU is reduced after onset, followed by an overshoot of the symbiont population that requires a strong regulatory response, dealt with by strong CC and increased EX. As colonization progresses into symbiosis maintenance, CC remains crucial for achieving steady-state symbiont populations, with our models estimating that CC regulates 10-fold more cells (60 to 90%) relative to the other mechanisms. Notably though, our models also revealed that D. trenchii is less tightly regulated than B. minutum , consistent with D. trenchii’s reputation as a suboptimal partner for this cnidarian. Overall, our models suggest that single regulatory mechanisms do not accurately replicate observed symbiont colonization patterns, reflecting the importance of all mechanisms working concomitantly. This ultimately sheds light on the cell biology underpinning the stability of this ecologically significant symbiosis.",

Initially, we focus on remotely directing the walking paths of fruit flies in an experimental arena. We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies’ optomotor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of attraction-inducing mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight-carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Last, we demonstrate multiagent formation control, with flies alternating between distinct spatial patterns. Beyond expanding tools available for microrobotics, these behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.",

Depending on the number of flavors F and the pattern of Higgsing, both classes can coexist among SQCD k walls interpolating between the vacua n and n + k . We prove that the overall multiplicity of the domain walls obtained after accounting for both classes is ν N , k walls = N ! / [ ( N − k ) ! k ! ] , as was discovered previously in limiting cases.

We show here that the expression of a cell-surface receptor, Ryk, is induced in astrocytes after injury in both rodent and human spinal cords. Astrocyte-specific knockout of Ryk dramatically elongated the reactive astrocytes, accelerated the formation of the border, and reduced the size of the scar. Astrocyte-specific knockout of Ryk also accelerated the injury responses of multiple cell types. Single-cell transcriptomics analyses revealed a broad range of changes in cell signaling among astrocytes, microglia, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells after astrocyte-specific Ryk knockout, suggesting that Ryk not only regulates injury responses of astrocytes but may also regulate signals emanating from astrocytes and coordinate the responses of these cell types. The elongation of astrocyte processes is mediated by NrCAM, a cell adhesion molecule induced by astrocyte-specific conditional knockout of Ryk after spinal cord injury. Our findings suggest that Ryk is a promising therapeutic target to accelerate wound healing, promote neuronal survival, and enhance functional recovery.",

Next generation sequencing has improved our ability to identify underlying molecular causes, though over half of all cases lack a clear etiology. Here, we began with clinical evaluation combined with exome sequencing across independent families to identify bi-allelic candidate genetic variants in the Programmed Cell Death 2 (PDCD2) gene in multiple fetuses with nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF). PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with no prior association with monogenic disorders. PDCD2 is known to act as a molecular chaperone for the ribosomal protein uS5, and this complex formation is important for incorporation of uS5 into the 40S subunit, a crucial step in ribosome biogenesis. Primary fibroblasts from an affected fetus and cell lines expressing PDCD2 patient variants demonstrated reduced levels of PDCD2, reduced PDCD2 binding to uS5, and altered ribosomal RNA processing. Xenopus tadpoles with Pdcd2 knockdown demonstrated developmental defects and edema, reminiscent of the NIHF seen in affected fetuses, and showed altered ribosomal RNA processing. Through genetic, biochemical, and in vivo approaches, we provide evidence that bi-allelic PDCD2 variants cause an autosomal recessive ribosomal biogenesis disorder resulting in pregnancy loss.",

          "abstract": "Interest in the biological actions of alcohols, ethanol in particular, dates back to the earliest historical texts. Alcohol research is now a highly active field with roots in physiology, pharmacology, toxicology, and neuroscience. But at what point did interest and speculation evolve into bona fide science? Here, we set out to identify the earliest systematic empirical investigations into the biological actions of alcohols and unearthed a surprisingly rigorous literature which included a fundamental insight with significant implications for modern research and policy. Through manual backward citation mapping of archived texts, much of which was digitally inaccessible, we outline the origins of alcohol research beginning with a transcribed lecture from Benjamin Ward Richardson in 1869. In the years immediately following, the field of alcohol research was legitimized around what came to be briefly known as “Richardson’s law.” Richardson’s law states that the acute toxicity of straight-chain monohydroxy alcohols is directly proportional to the carbon chain length of the molecule. This law was recognized only briefly not because it was disproven, but rather because it was simply forgotten during the decades that passed between its inception and the advent of systematic bibliographic databases which paved the way for digital archiving. Quantitative analysis of studies spanning a century revealed that across monohydroxy alcohols with one (methanol) to thirteen (tridecanol) carbons, there is a near-deterministic relationship between chain-length and lethal dose (R 2 = 0.96). Richardson’s law of alcohol potency has silently stood the test of time and is among functional biology’s oldest and least challenged scientific laws.",

          "abstract": "Most members of the dynamin superfamily of large guanosine triphophatases (GTPases) have an ability to remodel membranes in response to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Ring Finger Protein 112 (RNF112) (ZNF179/neurolastin) is a recently identified brain-specific dynamin-like protein possessing a really interesting new gene (RING) finger domain. Despite its essential role as an E3 ligase in neuron development, the architecture of RNF112 and the exact role of its GTPase activity remain unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of truncated RNF112 (RNF112 T ) containing a GTPase domain (GD) and three-helical middle domain (MD) at different nucleotide-loading states. In the nucleotide-free (apo) state, the monomeric RNF112 T remained in a unique self-restraint conformation characterized by docking of the proximal end of the MD to a groove in the GD. At the transition state of GTP hydrolysis, the MD was released from the GD and stretched aside to form an intertwined RNF112 T homodimer. Engineered RNF112 equipped with the C-terminal elements of ATL1 or the two transmembrane domains of yeast Sac1p relocated to the endoplasmic reticulum and was capable of mediating membrane remodeling. Taken together, our results offer necessary understandings of RNF112 as a dynamin-like large GTPase in its cellular function and provide insights into the functional mechanisms of dynamin superfamily proteins.",

          "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) is a central signaling network that enables eukaryotic cells to respond to a variety of different environmental stresses. Such stresses cause ribosome collisions that lead to activation of the kinase Gcn2, resulting in the phosphorylation and inactivation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 and thereby promoting selective translation of mRNAs to restore homeostasis. Despite the importance of the ISR and intensive study over the past decades, structural insight into how Gcn2 interacts with ribosomal particles has been lacking. Using ex vivo affinity purification approaches, we have obtained a cryoelectron microscopy structure of a yeast Gcn2 dimer in complex with the ribosomal 60S subunit. The Gcn2 dimer is formed by dimerization of the histidine tRNA synthetase-like domains, which establish extensive interactions with the stalk-base and sarcin–ricin loop of the 60S subunit. The C-terminal domain of Gcn2 is also dimerized and occupies the A- and P-site tRNA binding sites at the peptidyl-transferase center of the 60S subunit. Complementary functional studies indicate that binding of Gcn2 to the 60S subunit does not require the coactivators Gcn1 or Gcn20, nor does it lead to phosphorylation of eIF2α. Instead, upon stress, we observe a shift of Gcn2 from the 60S subunit into the colliding ribosome fraction, suggesting that the Gcn2–60S complex represents an inactive stand-by state to enable a rapid redistribution to collided ribosomes, and thereby facilitating a quick and efficient response to stress.",

Conventional space-variant polarization manipulation in optical systems only results in broadband geometric phases. Recently emerged nonlocal metasurfaces show an ability to compress the operating bandwidth through modulations of wavelength-dependent amplitudes. However, their geometric phases are still broadband and not linear, posing severe challenges to realize ultra narrowband metadevices. Here, we propose and demonstrate the generation of ultra narrowband and spatially variable geometric phases in resonant metasurfaces. We find that an array of perturbed Mie resonators is able to simultaneously preserve its global symmetry and local transformation. Local transformation provides a pixel-level geometric phase, whereas global symmetry yields an ultranarrow operation bandwidth. We further reveal that this geometric phase can be well pinned to the resonant mode by introducing additional perturbations to individually define the phase at nonresonant wavelengths. Consequently, we realize experimentally pixelated phase-gradient metasurfaces and metalenses with record-breaking Q factors and high confidentiality. We believe that our general approach and demonstrated results will open a paradigm of multiplexed metasurfaces and information encryption.",

In contrast, basal expression at uninduced promoters is considered to be a dynamically inert mode of nonfunctional “promoter leakiness,” merely a byproduct of transcriptional regulation. Here, we investigate the basal expression mode of the mar operon, the main regulator of intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli , and link its dynamic properties to the noncanonical, yet highly conserved start codon of marR across Enterobacteriaceae . Real-time, single-cell measurements across tens of generations reveal that basal expression consists of rare stochastic gene expression pulses, which maximize variability in wildtype and, surprisingly, transiently accelerate cellular elongation rates. Competition experiments show that basal expression confers fitness advantages to wildtype across several transitions between exponential and stationary growth by shortening lag times. The dynamically rich basal expression of the mar operon has likely been evolutionarily maintained for its role in growth homeostasis of Enterobacteria within the gut environment, thereby allowing other ancillary gene regulatory roles to evolve, e.g., control of costly-to-induce multidrug efflux pumps. Understanding the complex selection forces governing genetic systems involved in intrinsic multidrug resistance is crucial for effective public health measures.",

          "abstract": "Influenza remains a significant public health threat. Both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors can target the influenza surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) for prevention and treatment of influenza. Here, we combine the strengths of anti-influenza antibodies and small molecules by site-specific conjugation of the NA inhibitor zanamivir to MEDI8852, an HA-specific fully human monoclonal antibody. MEDI8852 targets the conserved stem region of HA and inhibits HA-mediated fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Elimination of virus-infected cells involves Fcγ receptor–mediated effector functions. The efficacy of MEDI8852 is limited to influenza A viruses. Zanamivir, on the other hand, binds to the active site of NA in both influenza A and B viruses to inhibit NA activity and virus release. However, because of its small size, zanamivir has a short half-life and requires repeated dosing at high concentrations. We produced a MEDI8852–zanamivir antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) that engages Fc-mediated effector functions and benefits from neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling. The MEDI8852–zanamivir conjugate extends the circulatory half-life of zanamivir, targets both influenza HA and NA, and shows enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared to MEDI8852 alone. The MEDI8852–zanamivir conjugate protected mice from a lethal (10 × LD 50 ) challenge with influenza A and B viruses at a dose similar to that required for broadly neutralizing anti-NA antibodies, with the added advantage of simultaneously targeting NA (influenza A and B) and HA (influenza A).",

Ubiquitination of the microtubule-associated tau protein, an intrinsically disordered biomolecule, has been proposed to influence the formation of filamentous deposits in neurodegenerative conditions. Given the reported link between aggregation propensity and intrinsic structural preferences (e.g., transient extended structural motifs or tertiary contacts) in disordered proteins, we sought to explore the conformational landscape of ubiquitinated tau. Exploiting selective conjugation reactions, we produced single- and double-monoubiquitinated protein samples. Next, we examined the ubiquitinated species from different standpoints using NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering experiments, and native ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IM–MS). Moreover, we obtained atomistic representations of the conformational ensembles via scaled MD calculations, consistent with the experimental data. Modifying the repeat domain of tau with ubiquitin had a limited effect on secondary structure propensities and local mobility of distal regions. Instead, ubiquitination enhanced the compaction of the conformational ensemble, with the effect modulated by the site and the number of modifications. Native IM–MS patterns pinpointed similarities and differences between distinct tau proteoforms. It emerges that ubiquitination exerts a position-specific influence on the conformational distribution of tau molecules. This study reveals the unique conformational features of ubiquitinated forms of tau and points to their potential impact on aggregation and phase separation propensities, offering clues for a better understanding of disease-related structural alterations.",

However, the relevance of MDA5 ISGylation for antiviral immunity in an infected organism has been elusive. Here, we generated knock-in mice (MDA5 K23R/K43R ) in which the two major ISGylation sites, K23 and K43, in MDA5, were mutated. Primary cells derived from MDA5 K23R/K43R mice exhibited abrogated endogenous MDA5 ISGylation and an impaired ability of MDA5 to form oligomeric assemblies, leading to blunted cytokine responses to MDA5 RNA-agonist stimulation or infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or West Nile virus. Phenocopying MDA5 −/− mice, the MDA5 K23R/K43R mice infected with EMCV displayed increased myocardial injury and mortality, elevated viral titers, and an ablated induction of cytokines and chemokines compared to WT mice. Molecular studies identified human HERC5 (and its functional murine homolog HERC6) as the primary E3 ligases responsible for MDA5 ISGylation and activation.

Coherent motion of cell collectives requires large-scale coordination of motion and force generation and is influenced by mechanical properties of the underlying substrate. While tissue viscoelasticity is a ubiquitous feature of biological tissues, its role in mediating collective cell migration is unclear. Here, we have investigated the impact of substrate stress relaxation on the migration of micropatterned epithelial monolayers. Epithelial monolayers exhibit faster collective migration on viscoelastic alginate substrates with slower relaxation timescales, which are more elastic, relative to substrates with faster stress relaxation, which exhibit more viscous loss. Faster migration on slow-relaxing substrates is associated with reduced substrate deformation, greater monolayer fluidity, and enhanced leader cell formation. In contrast, monolayers on fast-relaxing substrates generate substantial substrate deformations and are more jammed within the bulk, with reduced formation of transient lamellipodial protrusions past the monolayer edge leading to slower overall expansion. This work reveals features of collective epithelial dynamics on soft, viscoelastic materials and adds to our understanding of cell–substrate interactions at the tissue scale.",

While the details of kDNA structure and this type of RNA editing are well established, our knowledge mostly relies on a narrow foray of intensely studied human parasites of the genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma . Here, we analyzed kDNA, its expression, and RNA editing of two members of the poorly characterized genus Vickermania with very different cultivation histories. In both Vickermania species, the gRNA-containing heterogeneous large (HL)-circles are atypically large with multiple gRNAs each. Examination of Vickermania spadyakhi HL-circle loci revealed a massive redundancy of gRNAs relative to the editing needs. In comparison, the HL-circle repertoire of extensively cultivated Vickermania ingenoplastis is greatly reduced. It correlates with V. ingenoplastis -specific loss of productive editing of transcripts encoding subunits of respiratory chain complex I and corresponding lack of complex I activity. This loss in a parasite already lacking genes for subunits of complexes III and IV suggests an apparent requirement for its mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase to work in reverse to maintain membrane potential. In contrast, V. spadyakhi retains a functional complex I that allows ATP synthase to work in its standard direction.",

Here, we adopted explicit-solvent all-atom simulations based on a combination of enhanced sampling approaches to investigate how the conformational ensemble of an RNA hairpin is reshaped in a highly concentrated peptide solution that mimics the interior of a biomolecular condensate. Our simulations indicate that RNA structure is greatly perturbed by this distinctive physico-chemical environment, which weakens RNA secondary structure and promotes extended nonnative conformations. The resulting high-resolution picture reveals that RNA unfolding is driven by the effective solvation of nucleobases through hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions with surrounding peptides.

          "abstract": "NARROW LEAF 1 ( NAL1 ), originally identified for its role in shaping leaf morphology, plant architecture, and various agronomic traits in rice, has remained enigmatic in terms of the molecular mechanisms governing its multifaceted functions. In this study, we present a comprehensive structural analysis of NAL1 proteins, shedding light on how NAL1 regulates the phase separation of its physiological substrate, FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP), a transcription factor. We determined that NAL1 assembles as a hexamer and forms a molecular cage with a wide central channel and three narrower lateral channels, which could discriminate its different substrates into the catalytic sites. Most notably, our investigation unveils that FZP readily forms molecular condensates via phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. NAL1 fine-tunes FZP condensation, maintaining optimal concentrations to enhance transcriptional activity. While phase separation roles include sequestration and suppression of transcriptional or enzymatic activity, our study highlights its context-dependent contribution to transcriptional regulation. NAL1 assumes a pivotal role in regulating the states of these molecular condensates through its proteolytic activity, subsequently enhancing transcriptional cascades. Our findings offer insights into comprehending the molecular mechanisms underpinning NAL1’s diverse functions, with far-reaching implications for the field of plant biology. Additionally, these insights provide valuable guidance for the development of rational breeding strategies aimed at enhancing crop productivity.",

With microglia recognized as critical to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, THIK1 channels are putative therapeutic targets to control microglia dysfunction. While THIK channels can principally be distinguished from other K2Ps by their distinctive inhibitory response to volatile anesthetics (VAs), molecular details governing THIK channel gating remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a 3.2 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the THIK1 channel in a closed conformation. A central pore gate located directly below the THIK1 selectivity filter is formed by inward-facing TM4 helix tyrosine residues that occlude the ion conduction pathway. VA inhibition of THIK requires closure of this central pore gate. Using a combination of anesthetic photolabeling, electrophysiology, and molecular dynamics simulation, we identify a functionally critical THIK1 VA binding site positioned between the central gate and a structured section of the THIK1 TM2/TM3 loop. Our results demonstrate the molecular architecture of the THIK1 channel and elucidate critical structural features involved in regulation of THIK1 channel gating and anesthetic inhibition.",

          "abstract": "Microglia, the largest population of brain immune cells, play an essential role in regulating neuroinflammation by removing foreign materials and debris and in cognition by pruning synapses. Since liver X receptor β (LXRβ) has been identified as a regulator of microglial homeostasis, this study examined whether its removal from microglia affects neuroinflammation and cognitive function. We used a cell-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP-mediated recombination to remove LXRβ from microglia specifically. We now report that ablation of LXRβ in microglia in early postnatal life led to a reduction in microglial numbers, distinct morphological changes indicative of microglial activation, and enhanced synapse engulfment accompanied by cognitive deficits. Removal of LXRβ from microglia in adult mice caused no cognitive defects. RNAseq analysis of microglia revealed that loss of LXRβ led to reduced expression of SAll1, a master regulator of microglial homeostasis, while increasing expression of genes associated with microglial activation and CNS disease. This study demonstrates distinctly different functions of microglial LXRβ in developing and adult mice and points to long-term consequences of defective LXRβ signaling in microglia in early life.",

Using tailored permutations, we construct point sets that are of 20% smaller discrepancy on average than those proposed by Rusch et al. In terms of inverse discrepancy, our sets reduce the number of points in dimension 2 needed to obtain a discrepancy of 0.005 from more than 500 points to less than 350.

          "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common cause of inherited retinal degeneration worldwide. It is characterized by the sequential death of rod and cone photoreceptors, the cells responsible for night and daylight vision, respectively. Although the expression of most RP genes occurs only in rods, there is a secondary degeneration of cones. One possible mechanism of cone death is metabolic dysregulation. Photoreceptors are highly metabolically active, consuming large quantities of glucose and producing substantial amounts of lactate. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mediates the transport of glucose from the blood to photoreceptors and, in turn, removes lactate, which can influence the rate of consumption of glucose by the RPE. One model for metabolic dysregulation in RP suggests that following the death of rods, lactate levels are substantially diminished causing the RPE to withhold glucose, resulting in nutrient deprivation for cones. Here, we present adeno-associated viral vector-mediated delivery of monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2, Slc16a7 ) into the eye, with expression limited to RPE cells, with the aim of promoting lactate uptake from the blood and encouraging the passage of glucose to cones. We demonstrate prolonged survival and function of cones in rat and mouse RP models, revealing a possible gene-agnostic therapy for preserving vision in RP. We also present the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging-based biosensors for lactate and glucose within the eye. Using this technology, we show changes to lactate and glucose levels within MCT2-expressing RPE, suggesting that cone survival is impacted by changes in RPE metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Increased differentiation or activity of osteoclasts is the key pathogenic factor of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). N4‐acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification, catalyzed by Nat10, is a novel posttranscriptional mRNA modification related to many diseases. However, its impact on regulating osteoclast activation in PMOP remains uncertain. Here, we initially observed that Nat10-mediated ac4C positively correlates with osteoclast differentiation of monocytes and low bone mass in PMOP. The specific knockout of Nat10 in monocytes and remodelin, a Nat10 inhibitor, alleviates ovariectomized (OVX)-induced bone loss by downregulating osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, epitranscriptomic analyses reveal that the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1) is the key downstream target of ac4C modification during osteoclast differentiation. Subsequently, translatomic results demonstrate that Nat10-mediated ac4C enhances the translation efficiency (TE) of Nfatc1, thereby inducing Nfatc1 expression and consequent osteoclast maturation. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the promotive role of Nat10 in osteoclast differentiation and PMOP from a novel field of RNA modifications and suggest that Nat10 can be a target of epigenetic therapy for preventing bone loss in PMOP.",

The prospective applications of genomically encoded bacterial metabolism present a compelling opportunity, particularly in the light of the rapid expansion of genomic sequencing data. Current metabolic inference tools face challenges in scaling with large datasets, leading to increased computational demands, and often exhibit limited inter-relatability and interoperability. Here, we introduce the Integrated Biosynthetic Inference Suite (IBIS), which employs deep learning models and a knowledge graph to facilitate rapid, scalable bacterial metabolic inference. This system leverages a series of Transformer based models to generate high quality, meaningful embeddings for individual enzymes, biosynthetic domains, and metabolic pathways. These embedded representations enable rapid, large-scale comparisons of metabolic proteins and pathways, surpassing the capabilities of conventional methodologies. The examination of evolutionary and functionally conserved metabolites across diverse bacterial species is facilitated by integrating the predictive capabilities of IBIS into a graph database enriched with comprehensive metadata. The consideration of both primary and specialized metabolism, combined with an embedding logic for enzyme discovery, uniquely positions IBIS to identify potential novel metabolic pathways. With the expansion of genomic data necessitating transformative approaches to advance molecular metabolism research, IBIS delivers an AI-driven holistic investigation of bacterial metabolism.",

The invasion history of these translocations remains uncertain for most species, limiting our understanding of their future adaptive potential and historical roles as vectors for coinvaded species. We provide a framework for filling this gap in invasion biology using the widely transplanted Pacific oyster as a case study. A two-dimensional summary of population-level variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms in native Japan reflected the geographical map of Japan and allowed identification of the source regions for the worldwide expansion. Pacific oysters proliferate in nonnative areas with environmental temperatures similar to those areas where native lineages evolved. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we ranked the likelihood of historical oyster or shipping vectors to explain current-day distribution of genotypes in 14 coinvaded algal and animal species. Oyster transplants were a more likely vector than shipping for six species, shipping activity was more likely for five species, and a vector was ambiguous for three species. Applying this approach to other translocated species should reveal similar legacy effects, especially for economically important foundation species that also served as vectors for nonnative species.",

These catalysts reversibly switch between Pt clusters and Pt single-atoms in response to reducing reaction and oxidizing regeneration conditions. This environmental adaptability allows them to completely self-regenerate over 110 reaction-regeneration cycles in propane dehydrogenation.

Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal T reg cells (mT reg cells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mT reg cells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD + sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for T reg cell–mediated immunosuppression.

GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance of Clostridium bolteae , which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment with C. bolteae and Food and Drug Administration–approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR–joint GLP-1 axis in mice.

          "abstract": "That neutrinos carry a nonvanishing rest mass is evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. Their absolute mass holds relevance in fields from particle physics to cosmology. We report on the search for the effective electron antineutrino mass with the KATRIN experiment. KATRIN performs precision spectroscopy of the tritium β-decay close to the kinematic endpoint. On the basis of the first five measurement campaigns, we derived a best-fit value of m ν 2 = − 0.14 − 0.15 + 0.13 eV 2 , resulting in an upper limit of m ν &lt; 0.45 eV at 90% confidence level. Stemming from 36 million electrons collected in 259 measurement days, a substantial reduction of the background level, and improved systematic uncertainties, this result tightens KATRIN’s previous bound by a factor of almost two.",

Patients with cachexia experience extreme fatigue, apathy, and clinical depression, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these behavioral symptoms and their relationship to the disease remain unclear. In a mouse cancer model, cachexia specifically induced increased effort-sensitivity, apathy-like symptoms through a cytokine-sensing brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit. This neural circuit detects elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at cachexia onset and translates inflammatory signals into decreased mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity. We alleviated these apathy-like symptoms by targeting key circuit nodes: administering an anti–IL-6 antibody treatment, ablating cytokine sensing in the brainstem, and optogenetically or pharmacologically boosting mesolimbic dopamine. Our findings uncovered a central neural circuit that senses systemic inflammation and orchestrates behavioral changes, providing mechanistic insights into the connection between chronic inflammation and depressive symptoms.",

We show that combining oral vaccination with engineered or selected niche-competitor strains permits pathogen exclusion and strain replacement in the mouse gut lumen. This approach can be applied either prophylactically to prevent invasion of nontyphoidal Salmonella strains, or therapeutically to displace an established Escherichia coli. Both intact adaptive immunity and metabolic niche competition are necessary for efficient vaccine-enhanced competition. Our findings imply that mucosal antibodies have evolved to work in the context of gut microbial ecology by influencing the outcome of competition. This has broad implications for the elimination of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacterial reservoirs and for rational microbiota engineering.",

We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types—peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells—with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns. Our findings highlight the potential convergent evolution of a biophysical mechanism in the emergence of multicellular systems across domains of life.",

In this work, we show that a prominent industrial process, palladium (Pd)–catalyzed vinyl acetate synthesis, proceeds via interconversion of heterogeneous Pd(0) and homogeneous Pd(II) during catalysis, with each species playing a complementary role. Using electrochemical probes, we found that heterogeneous, nanoparticulate Pd(0) serves as an active oxygen reduction electrocatalyst to furnish the high potential required for corrosion to form homogeneous Pd(II), which then catalyzes selective ethylene acetoxylation with reformation of heterogeneous Pd(0). Inhibiting the corrosion of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by galvanic protection results in reversible poisoning of catalysis, evincing the essential role of phase conversion in this catalytic cycle. These results highlight how dynamic phase interconversion can harness and couple complementary reactivity across molecular and material active sites.",

We report a three-dimensional (3D) printing chemistry through stepwise photopolymerization by forming dithioacetal bonds. The polymerized network can be transformed back into a photoreactive oligomer by dissociation of the dithioacetal bonds. This network-oligomer transformation is reversible, therefore allowing circular 3D printing using the same material. Our approach offers the flexibility of making modular adjustments in the design of the network backbone of a polymer. This allows access to fully recyclable elastomers, crystalline polymers, and rigid glassy polymers with high mechanical toughness, making them potentially suitable for diverse applications.",

First, condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. Second, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion as sisters separate. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II, and condensin I alone or in combination lead to refined models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase, loops are extruded in vivo at ∼1 to 3 kilobases per second by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids.",

Clobazam exposure increased the speed with which fish passed through two hydropower dams along their migration route, resulting in more clobazam-exposed fish reaching the sea compared with controls. We argue that such effects may arise from altered shoaling behavior in fish exposed to clobazam. Drug-induced behavioral changes are expected to have wide-ranging consequences for the ecology and evolution of wild populations.",

We found that Cat1 provides immunity by cleaving and depleting NAD + molecules from the infected host, inducing a growth arrest that prevents viral propagation. Cat1 forms dimers that stack upon each other to generate long filaments that are maintained by bound cOA ligands, with stacked TIR domains forming the NAD + cleavage catalytic sites.

A helitron insertion in the PUB21 promoter introduced multiple MYC2-binding cis-elements to create a regulatory circuit linking the PUB21 activity with MYC2 degradation. Ectopic expression of a natural dominant-negative PUB21 paralog discovered in distant Citrus relatives stabilized MYC2 and conferred resistance to HLB. Antiproteolysis peptides (APPs), identified by artificial intelligence, stabilized MYC2 by binding and inhibiting PUB21 activity.

The DNA strands are distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* b and Apo* states. We also identify several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism.

It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials.",

          "abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has revolutionized biology by visualizing dynamic cellular processes in three dimensions. However, light scattering in thick tissue and photobleaching of fluorescent reporters limit this method to studying thin or translucent specimens. In this study, we applied nondiffractive ultrasound beams in conjunction with a cross-amplitude modulation sequence and nonlinear acoustic reporters to enable fast and volumetric imaging of targeted biological functions. We reported volumetric imaging of tumor gene expression at the cubic centimeter scale using genetically encoded gas vesicles and localization microscopy of cerebral capillary networks using intravascular microbubble contrast agents. Nonlinear sound-sheet microscopy provides a ~64× acceleration in imaging speed, ~35× increase in imaged volume, and ~4× increase in classical imaging resolution compared with the state of the art in biomolecular ultrasound.",

Quantum Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase via discrete interference phase jumps when the number of encircled localized quasiparticles changes. Here, we observe this braiding phase in both the ν = 1/3 and 4/3 fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real-time. We find that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number n fluctuations and reconstruct three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by 2π/3, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around n (mod 3) anyons. Our methods can be readily extended to interference of non-abelian anyons.",

          "abstract": "Human pelvic evolution following the human-chimpanzee divergence is thought to result in an obstetrical dilemma, a mismatch between large infant brains and narrowed female birth canals, but empirical evidence has been equivocal. By using deep learning on 31,115 dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans from UK Biobank, we identified 180 loci associated with seven highly heritable pelvic phenotypes. Birth canal phenotypes showed sex-specific genetic architecture, aligning with reproductive function. Larger birth canals were linked to slower walking pace and reduced back pain but increased hip osteoarthritis risk, whereas narrower birth canals were associated with reduced pelvic floor disorder risk but increased obstructed labor risk. Lastly, genetic correlation between birth canal and head widths provides evidence of coevolution between the human pelvis and brain, partially mitigating the dilemma.",

We report that lattice strain locks Rb ions into the α-phase of the lattice of a triple-halide WBG perovskite, preventing phase segregation into a nonperovskite Rb-cesium–rich phase. This process cooperates with chloride accommodation and promotes halide homogenization across the entire film volume. The resulting 1.67–electron volt WBG perovskite exhibits photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 14% under 1-sun-equivalent irradiation, corresponding to a quasi–Fermi level splitting of ~1.34 electron volts. A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiative V OC limit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites.",

          "abstract": "Exogenous messenger RNAs (mRNAs) require cellular machinery for delivery and translation but also encounter inhibitory factors. To investigate their regulation, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens with in vitro–transcribed mRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) were identified as mediators of LNP uptake and endosomal escape, respectively. TRIM25—an RNA binding E3 ubiquitin ligase—emerged as a key suppressor inducing turnover of both linear and circular mRNAs. The endoribonucleases N4BP1 and KHNYN, along with the antiviral protein ZAP, act redundantly in TRIM25-dependent surveillance. TRIM25 specifically targets mRNAs delivered by endosomes, and its RNA affinity increases at acidic pH, suggesting activation by protons released from ruptured endosomes. N 1 -methylpseudouridine modification reduces TRIM25’s RNA binding, helping RNAs evade its suppressive effect. This study comprehensively maps cellular pathways regulating LNP-mRNAs, offering insights into RNA immunity and therapeutics.",

In general, this strategy necessitates a final protein-folding step, constraining the types of systems amenable to the approach.

Conceptually, our system is analogous to a DNA transposition reaction but uses orthogonal pairs of engineered split inteins to mediate the editing process. This “protein transposition” reaction is applied to several systems, including folded protein complexes, allowing the efficient introduction of a variety of noncoded elements. By carrying out a molecular “cut and paste” under native protein-folding conditions, our approach substantially expands the scope of protein semisynthesis.",

          "abstract": "The arrangement of genes along bacterial chromosomes influences their expression through growth rate–dependent gene copy number changes during DNA replication. Although translation- and transcription-related genes often cluster near the origin of replication, the extent of positional biases across gene families remains unclear. We hypothesized that natural selection broadly favors specific chromosomal positions to optimize growth rate–dependent expression. Analyzing 910 bacterial species and proteomics data from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis , we found that about two-thirds of bacterial gene families are positionally biased. Natural selection drives genes mainly toward the origin or terminus of replication, with the strongest selection in fast-growing species. Our findings reveal chromosomal positioning as a fundamental mechanism for coordinating gene expression with growth rate, highlighting evolutionary constraints on bacterial genome architecture.",

We propose a microstructural strategy with dendritic nanopolar (DNP) regions self-assembled into an insulator, which simultaneously enhances breakdown strength and high-field polarizability and minimizes energy loss and thus markedly improves energy storage performance and stability. For illustration, in this study, we achieved a high energy density of 215.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency of 80.7% at a high electric field of 7.4 megavolts per centimeter in a DNP structure–designed PbZr 0.53 Ti 0.47 O 3 -MgO film.

We resolve the integrated viral genome using long-read sequencing, identify a putative polinton-like integrase, and show that viral particles accumulate primarily during the stationary growth phase. A diverse array of viral-encoded selfish genetic elements is expressed during viral activity, including several Fanzor nuclease-encoding transposable elements. In addition, we show that field isolates of Chlamydomonas sp. harbor signatures of endogenous giant viruses related to the C. reinhardtii virus that exhibit similar infection dynamics, suggesting that giant virus latency is prevalent in natural host communities. Our work describes an unusually large temperate virus of a unicellular eukaryote, substantially expanding the scope of cryptic viral infections in the virosphere.",

We identified a hominin mandible (Penghu 1) from Taiwan (10,000 to 70,000 years ago or 130,000 to 190,000 years ago) as belonging to a male Denisovan by applying ancient protein analysis. We retrieved 4241 amino acid residues and identified two Denisovan-specific variants. The increased fossil sample of Denisovans demonstrates their wider distribution, including warm and humid regions, as well as their shared distinct robust dentognathic traits that markedly contrast with their sister group, Neanderthals.",

          "abstract": "Anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, composed of IFT-B, IFT-A, and BBSome subcomplexes, are responsible for transporting ciliary proteins into the cilium. How IFT subcomplexes reach the ciliary base and assemble into IFT trains is poorly understood. Here, we perform quantitative single-molecule imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans chemosensory cilia to uncover how IFT subcomplexes arrive at the base, organize in IFT trains, and enter the cilium. We find that BBSomes reach the base via diffusion where they either associate with assembling IFT trains or with the membrane surrounding the base. In contrast, IFT-B and IFT-A reach the base via directed transport most likely on vesicles that stop at distinct locations near the base. Individual subcomplexes detach from the vesicles into a diffusive pool and associate to assembling trains. Our results show that IFT-B is first incorporated into IFT trains, followed by IFT-A, and finally BBSomes, indicating that the assembly of IFT trains is a highly regulated, step-wise process.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is exposed to multiple insults produced by normal cellular function. Upon mtDNA replication stress, the mitochondrial genome transfers to endosomes for degradation. Using proximity biotinylation, we found that mtDNA stress leads to the rewiring of the mitochondrial proximity proteome, increasing mitochondria’s association with lysosomal and vesicle-related proteins. Among these, the retromer complex, particularly VPS35, plays a pivotal role by extracting mitochondrial components. The retromer promotes the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles shuttled to lysosomes. The mtDNA, however, directly shuttles to a recycling organelle in a BAX-dependent manner. Moreover, using a Drosophila model carrying a long deletion on the mtDNA (ΔmtDNA), we found that ΔmtDNA activates a specific transcriptome profile to counteract mitochondrial damage. Here, Vps35 expression restores mtDNA homoplasmy and alleviates associated defects. Hence, we demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown quality control mechanism for the mitochondrial matrix and the essential role of lysosomes in mtDNA turnover to relieve mtDNA damage.",

Our continuous tree-ring δ 18 O record reveals a significant long-term drying trend over much of the Holocene ( P  &lt; 0.001), which is in line with orbital forcing and independent evidence from proxy reconstructions and model simulations. Wetter conditions in the early-to-mid Holocene coincide with the African Humid Period, whereas the most severe summer droughts of the past 9000 years are found during the Little Ice Age in the 18th and 19th centuries Common Era. We suggest that much of Europe was not only warmer but also wetter during most of the preindustrial Holocene, which implies a close relationship between insolation changes and long-term hydroclimate trends that likely affected natural and societal systems across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) significantly influence material properties upon isotopic substitution, particularly with light atoms such as hydrogen. While water is rich in hydrogen, its hydrogen-bonded structure exhibits only moderate NQEs. Simulations ascribe this to competing zero-point energies (ZPEs): Intermolecular ZPEs stabilize hydrogen-bonds, while intramolecular ZPEs destabilize them. However, experimental validation has been lacking due to the difficulty in quantifying NQEs. The air/water interface provides an ideal platform to quantify NQEs in liquid water using surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. By analyzing the excess/depletion of interfacial HOD, H 2 O, and D 2 O molecules with one free OH/OD group and the other H-bonded OH/OD group, we found that the intermolecular ZPE destabilizes the hydrogen-bonds by 0.74 ± 0.20 kilojoule per mole upon isotope substitution from H to D, while the intramolecular ZPE stabilizes them by 0.78 ± 0.33 kilojoule per mole. This near-complete cancellation explains the overall moderate NQE in liquid water. The interface thus allows for quantifying NQEs in water.",

We also measure equations of state with tunable dipolar interactions. Our findings show a transition point shift due to dipole orientation, aligning with BKT transition with effective short-range interaction. However, we observe that in-plane tilted dipoles show nonlocal effects in the superfluid regime, preventing the effective short-range interaction from revealing universal behavior near the BKT critical point. We also measure anisotropic atom number fluctuations in the superfluid regime, highlighting its dipolar nature. Our results provide a foundation for understanding dipolar bosons in 2D and pave the way for investigating complex orders in dipolar superfluids.",

          "abstract": "Unpreferable vibrations and impacts pose substantial risks to sensitive devices, structures, and the human body, demanding materials capable of providing both high energy dissipation and impact protection across a broad temperature range. Traditional damping materials often fail to meet these demands because of a trade-off between damping and mechanical strength. We introduce an innovative strategy to fabricate armored polymer-fluid gels (APFGs) that combine high damping and high modulus for effective damping and impact protection under extreme conditions. By using a controlled surface cross-linking process through diffusion, we greatly enhance the mechanical strength of polymer-fluid gels without sacrificing their damping capabilities. This asymmetric design results in an unprecedented loss factor (tanδ &gt; 0.5 from −45 degrees to 135 degrees Celsius, peaking at tanδ = 2.2) while achieving a tensile modulus of 20 megapascals. This method resolves the long-standing damping-modulus trade-off, positioning APFGs as promising candidates for robust damping and impact protection in electronics and human motion applications.",

We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8 + T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis. Our findings suggest that the intratumoral mycobiome suppresses lipid catabolism and induces T cell exhaustion in RCC.",

To study whether and how differences in receptor types affect the propensity for eliciting inflammatory responses in a model system wherein TCR and CAR target equalized sources of clinically relevant antigen, we discovered a CD22-specific TCR and compared it to CD22 CAR. Both CD22 TCR-T and CD22 CAR-T cells eradicated leukemia in xenografts, but only CD22 CAR-T cells induced dose-dependent systemic inflammation. Compared to TCR-T cells, CAR-T cells disproportionately upregulated inflammatory pathways without concordant augmentation in pathways involved in direct cytotoxicity upon antigen engagement.

To address this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of fairness in medical text-to-image diffusion models. Evaluations of the Stable Diffusion model reveal substantial disparities across gender, race, and ethnicity. To reduce these biases, we propose FairDiffusion, an equity-aware latent diffusion model that improves both image quality and the semantic alignment of clinical features. In addition, we design and curate FairGenMed, a dataset tailored for fairness studies in medical generative models. FairDiffusion is further assessed on HAM10000 (dermatoscopic images) and CheXpert (chest x-rays), demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse medical imaging modalities.

The flow pathway on the lyophilic TELD can be conveniently managed by regulating the competition forces along orthogonal directions at the liquid front, which is instantly realized by adjusting the mechanical strain in TELD (mode 1 regulation) or inserting extra forces at the liquid front (mode 2 regulation). Furthermore, TELD can serve as a logic gate, stress valve, microfluidic reactor, and fog collector.

Here, we present such an attempt by visualizing both the stripping and plating interfaces of a micron-sized SSB cycled in galvanostatic mode in a transmission electron microscope. Various voltage responses in the charge/discharge curves are well correlated to the nucleation, growth, and refilling of single voids. Notably, two distinct modes of Li stripping, namely, void-growth stripping and void-free stripping, are experimentally identified. We unveil the roles of stack pressure and current density on void evolutions, which suggests a mechanism of void suppression without involving plastic deformation of Li metal.

In striate and extrastriate cortex, the gain of neural responses tracked the priority of memoranda. We decoded higher-priority memoranda with smaller error and lower uncertainty. Moreover, these neural differences predicted behavioral differences in memory prioritization between and within participants. Trial-wise variability in the magnitude of delay activity in the frontal cortex predicted differences in decoded precision between low- and high-priority items in visual cortex.

Expeditious assembly of the oligosaccharides derived from these glycans is challenging because β- d -idopyranosidic linkages are formidable to directly construct. Furthermore, whether the synthetic C. jejuni oligosaccharides could induce sufficient immunogenicity as the potential antigens remains unexplored. Here, we report a protocol for directly forming β- d -idopyranosidic bonds using α- d -6-deoxy- ido -heptopyranosyl, α- d -idopyranosyl, and d -/ l - glycero -α- d - ido -heptopyranosyl ortho -hexynylbenzoates as glycosylating agents under gold(I) catalysis.

Considering the high mental and metabolic effort discrete motor tasks impose, we used a forced-choice Bayesian Optimization approach that promotes sampling efficiency by leveraging domain knowledge about just noticeable differences between assistance settings. Optimizing over two control parameters, preferred settings were consistent within and uniquely different between participants. We discovered that overall, participants preferred asymmetric parameter configurations with more lifting than lowering assistance, and that preferences were sensitive to user anthropometrics.

MprF presents a promising target in multiresistant pathogens, but structural information is limited and both substrate specificity and energization of MprF-mediated lipid transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of MprF from P. aeruginosa ( Pa MprF) bound to a synthetic nanobody. Pa MprF adopts an “open” conformation with a wide, lipid-exposed groove on the periplasmic side that induces a local membrane deformation in molecular dynamics simulations.

Here, we break this long-held belief by finding the emergence of reversed Cherenkov radiation from a positive-index isotropic slab by exploiting optical gain. We find precise conditions under which the backward-propagating Cherenkov radiation is maintained while the forward-propagating one is suppressed.

This study presents a multistage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multimetallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process. Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then, the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings. By leveraging diverse data sources and multiple ML strategies, we demonstrate an efficient pathway for electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. This comprehensive, data-driven approach represents a paradigm shift and potentially benchmark in electrocatalysts research.",

          "abstract": "Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum are spin-dependent high- Q resonances in meta-photonic structures that are realized by perturbing symmetry-protected optical states by engineering in-plane and out-of-plane asymmetries, and they support chiral lasing in the vertical direction. Here, we explore the coupling between two resonances in a chiral metasurface and introduce a mechanism for high-purity chiral laser emission. We reveal that two resonances with nearly orthogonal polarizations become strongly coupled in an engineered chiral metasurface. The inherent phase difference of the resonances, associated with the coherent destruction on the decay channel, can endow high- Q factor and maximize chirality to one of the hybrid modes. We verify this approach experimentally by measuring transmission spectra, angle-resolved photoluminescence, and laser emission. We believe that this mechanism allows breaking restrictions on conventional chiral quasi-BIC lasing, enabling the realization of chiral emission at any designed direction.",

Our previous work suggests that αSyn can facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, promoting genomic stability. We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs. Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage. αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.",

A two-band analysis has been used to extract transport parameters for electron and hole carriers as a function of temperature.

This study designed composite microneedles and ion solutions using calcium silicate bioceramics, which deliver SiO 3 2− directly into myocardial tissue or indirectly via systemic circulation. These interventions modulate the cell microenvironment by regulating CD4 + T/T helper 17 (T H 17) cells and their interactions with neutrophils and fibroblasts through the forkhead box O (FOXO) signaling pathway. Specifically, SiO 3 2− inhibits the hyperdifferentiation of CD4 + T cells to T H 17 cells by regulating FOXO1 and neutrophils to neutrophil extracellular traps as well as fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by regulating FOXO3, thereby ultimately disrupting the vicious cycle of myocardial inflammation and subsequent fibrotic lesions in iDCM.

Using advanced electron ptychography techniques, we identified the presence of carbon-vacancy-carbon chains with boron vacancies in B 4 C lattice. The fabricated B 4 C beams exhibit a high ductility (~26.8%) at room temperature, a characteristic previously unattained in covalent materials and comparable to metals. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that the formation of local amorphous regions after B 4 C lattice exceeded its elastic strain limit, causing plastic deformation. Atomistic simulations, using experimentally observed B 4 C models, reveal that the creation of carbon-carbon bonds in chains containing boron vacancies causes localized amorphization and contributes to the plastic deformation. This research highlights the significance of vacancies in facilitating plastic deformation in B 4 C and suggests a potential strategy to improve the ductility of strong covalent materials.",

Herein, we describe an actionable bioenergetic mechanism unique to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mitochondria. Unlike healthy cells that couple respiration to ATP synthesis, AML mitochondria support inner-membrane polarization by consuming ATP. Matrix ATP consumption allows cells to survive bioenergetic stress. Thus, we hypothesized AML cells may resist chemotherapy-induced cell death by reversing the ATP synthase reaction. In support, BCL-2 inhibition with venetoclax abolished OxPhos flux without affecting mitochondrial polarization. In surviving AML cells, sustained mitochondrial polarization depended on matrix ATP consumption. Mitochondrial ATP consumption was further enhanced in AML cells made refractory to venetoclax, consequential to down-regulations in the endogenous F 1 -ATPase inhibitor ATP5IF1. Knockdown of ATP5IF1 conferred venetoclax resistance, while ATP5IF1 overexpression impaired F 1 -ATPase activity and heightened sensitivity to venetoclax. These data identify matrix ATP consumption as a cancer cell–intrinsic bioenergetic vulnerability actionable in the context of BCL-2 targeted chemotherapy.",

Silencing PRCAT71 inhibited cancerous properties of PCa cells and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Mechanistically, PRCAT71 acts as a scaffold to recruit K homology (KH)–type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) to AR messenger RNA (mRNA) and stabilize AR mRNA, leading to activated AR signaling. KHSRP plays a critical role in PCa progression. PRCAT71 is transcriptionally regulated by AR-driven enhancers, forming a positive regulatory loop between AR and PRCAT71 in PCa.

However, particular roles of rigid and flexible parts in layer formations remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate formation of an unprecedented superlayer cocrystal phase via a unique smectic LC phase in the equimolar melt mixture of symmetrically distinct molecules. The molecules used are a monoalkylated [(π-core)-C n ] using 2-octyl[1]benzothieno[3,2- b ][1]benzothiophene (mono-C 8 -BTBT) and a dialkylated [C n -(π-core)-C n ] using 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2- b ][1]benzothiophene (di-C 8 -BTBT). Thermal analyses show that the superlayer cocrystal is exclusively induced at the equimolar mixture via melt crystallization from the LC phase. X-ray structure analysis reveals a reversible C n -(π-core)-C n ···(π-core)-C n stacking arrangement in the superlayer cocrystal, where π-cores and alkyl chains form nearly independent layers. Notably, this melt crystallization allows solvent-free fabrication of semiconductive polycrystalline films for excellent thin-film transistors.

Inhibition of these astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics impairs, while their activation facilitates, fear extinction. In this regulation of fear extinction, the posterior basal forebrain (pBF) cholinergic input to hippocampus drives CA1 astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics through the activation of α4 and α7 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Clinically used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases CA1 astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics and facilitates fear extinction.

Chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals.

This protocol uses commercially available Ellman sulfinamide, tert -butanesulfinamide ( t BS), as the exclusive chiral source to selectively produce all possible stereoisomers. Sequential formation of contiguous α-amino chiral carbons is achieved by chirality induction and transfer mechanisms that are both enabled by t BS, the stereoselective imine functionalization and alkyne-participated rearrangement reaction.

We found that depletion of cellular PIP 2 blocks incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles. Expansion microscopy revealed that PIP 2 depletion diminishes nanoscale coclustering between viral structural protein Gag and the three transmembrane proteins at the PM and that Gag induces PIP 2 enrichment at its vicinity. CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 also increased local PIP 2 density, revealing their PIP 2 affinity. Together, these results support a previously unknown mechanism where local enrichment of an acidic phospholipid drives coclustering between viral structural and cellular transmembrane proteins, thereby modulating the content, and hence the fate, of progeny virus particles.",

Cardiomyocytes demonstrated the most heterogeneous expression landscape among cell types caused by metabolic perturbation, and pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed dynamic cellular states transitioning from compensation to severe compromise. This progression coincided with the transient up-regulation of a transcription factor, ATF3 . Genetic ablation of Atf3 in FS6KD corroborated its pivotal role, effectively delaying cardiomyopathy progression in a female-specific manner. Our findings highlight a fate-determining role of ATF3 in female MCM progression and that the latest transcriptomic analysis will help decipher the mechanisms underlying MD progression.",

Here, we identify transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), an Mg 2+ -permeable ion channel, as a critical regulator of MuSC activation. Trpm7 deletion in MuSCs reduced Mg 2+ influx, impairing myofiber regeneration and leading to decreased MuSC numbers and cell cycle arrest during regeneration. These changes were linked to disrupted mTOR signaling, which drives the transition of MuSCs from G 0 to G Alert phase. In addition, Trpm7 -deficient MuSCs exhibited impaired early responses, including quiescent projection retraction and AP-1 induction. Mg 2+ supplementation rescued these defects, restoring normal MuSC activation.

Here, we present spectroscopic evidence for a magnonic SRPT in ErFeO 3 , where the role of the photonic mode (two-level atoms) in the photonic SRPT is played by an Fe 3+ magnon mode (Er 3+ spins). The absence of the diamagnetic term in the Fe 3+ -Er 3+ exchange coupling ensures that the no-go theorem does not apply. Ultrabroadband terahertz and gigahertz magnetospectroscopy experiments revealed the signatures of the SRPT in thermal equilibrium, a kink and a softening, respectively, of two spin-magnon hybridized modes at the critical point.

Pro-inflammatory [RLR (retinoic acid–inducible gene I–like receptor)–dependent pathway] and cell growth inhibitory mechanisms [oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/ribonuclease L (RNase L)– and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)–dependent pathways] can act independently. We found that the 5′ ends of dsRNA direct the onset of cellular inflammation, whereas the RNA duplex activates the OAS/RNase L and PKR pathways. Unexpectedly, three of the most common human RNA epitranscriptomic marks—i.e., N 6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and pseudouridine—had almost no influence on the immunogenicity of dsRNA; however, the presence of N 6-methyladenosine inhibited the OAS/RNase L pathway.

Our functional CRISPR interference screen–based approach revealed that EIF3D, a translation initiation factor, is crucial for maintaining primed pluripotency. Loss of EIF3D disrupted the balance of pluripotency-associated signaling pathways, thereby compromising primed pluripotency. Moreover, EIF3D ensured robust proliferation by controlling the translation of various p53 regulators, which maintain low p53 activity in the undifferentiated state. In this way, EIF3D-mediated translation contributes to tuning the homeostasis of the primed pluripotency networks, ensuring the maintenance of an undifferentiated state with high proliferative potential.

In one complex, the mitochondrial trafficking adaptor MIRO recruits ARMC1, which mediates the assembly of a mitochondrial fission regulator (MTFR). MTFR stability depends on ARMC1, and MIRO-MTFR complexes specifically antagonize retrograde mitochondrial movement. In another complex, DNAJC11 facilitates ARMC1 release from mitochondria. Disrupting MIRO-MTFR assembly fails to rescue aberrant mitochondrial distributions clustered in the perinuclear area observed with ARMC1 deletion, while disrupting ARMC1 interaction with DNAJC11 leads to excessive mitochondrially localized ARMC1 and distinct mitochondrial defects.

The continuum kinematics of the fingers enables a multitude of manipulation capabilities such as translation, rotation, twisting, and multi-object conveyance. Furthermore, the dual mechanical properties of stiffness and softness in the fingers endow the gripper with inherent safety from collisions and enables soft-contact with objects. Deployable structures such as tape springs offer opportunities for manipulation in cluttered or remote environments.",

          "abstract": "Soft Li-ion batteries, based on conventional organic electrolytes, face performance degradation challenges due to moisture penetration and safety concerns due to possible leakage of toxic fluorine compounds and flammable solvents under mechanical damage. We design a water-scarce hydrogel electrolyte with fluorine-free lithium salt to achieve wide electrochemical stability window (up to 3.11 volts) in ambient air without hermetic packaging while balancing high stretchability (1348%), ion conductivity (41 millisiemens per centimeter), and self-healing capabilities for mechanically and chemically safe stretchable Li-ion batteries. Molecular synergy between hydrophilicity and lithiophilicity of zwitterionic polymer backbone is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The battery exhibits capacity retention under harsh mechanical stresses—enduring stretching, twisting, folding, and multiple through-punctures by a needle—while self-healing from repeated through cuts by a razor blade. Stable ambient operation for 1 month over 500 charge-discharge cycles (average coulomb efficiency, 95%) is achieved. A prototype self-healing electronic system with embedded soft batteries demonstrates practical application as a durable embodied energy source.",

          "abstract": "This article reopens the issue of corporate planning (CP) by exploring its evolving role in capitalism. We analyze the content of Harvard Business Review from its foundation in 1922 until 2021, using text mining and network analysis techniques. Our results show that CP remains at least as crucial in the age of intellectual monopoly capitalism as in the age of industrial capitalism dominated by the integrated modern corporation. Yet, we identify qualitative transformations in CP regarding its purpose, its means, the type of knowledge predominantly mobilized, and its temporality.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes the individual-level effects of disability onset on labor market outcomes using novel administrative data from Germany. Combining propensity score matching techniques with an event-study design, we find lasting negative impacts on employment and wages. One important mechanism is transitions to nonemployment after disability onset: the number of nonemployment days of the newly disabled increases by 36 days per year after one year and by 55 days after five years compared to the control group. For those who stay in employment, working part-time and switching to less physically or psychosocially demanding jobs are important adjustment paths. The negative labor market effects of disability onset are more pronounced for severely disabled, older, and low-skilled individuals.",
