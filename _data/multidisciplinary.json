          "authors": "Allison Ann Payne",
          "abstract": "Schools continue to rely on restrictive security and punitive discipline in dealing with crime and delinquency despite evidence that these measures can negatively impact both students and schools. In addition, these measures are inequitably implemented across schools, with historically marginalized communities seeing greater use. I argue that attending to social justice in school-based crime and delinquency prevention should begin with an examination of strategies that are effective in reducing risk factors for crime and deviance. I describe those evidence-based strategies, show that they are inequitably implemented across schools, and discuss how equitable implementation can happen. The solution I argue for—equitable implementation—includes engagement of the schools’ community members, building trusting relationships, equitable decision-making, strong collaborative leadership, local adaptation, and reliance on data. I also discuss a particular framework that researchers and schools can use to achieve equitable implementation.",

          "authors": "Nancy Rodriguez",
          "abstract": "The evidence base on the effectiveness of crime prevention programs and policies has grown significantly over the past two decades. But despite the attention given to particular kinds of crime reduction interventions, advancement of social justice and reduction of racial disparities in the administration of criminal justice have been limited. Additionally, despite the growing diversity of the U.S. population, prevention research that focuses on disparities among racial and ethnic groups is limited. In this article, I draw on insights from three juvenile court case studies to discuss the strengths and limitations of research on youth justice. These cases illustrate how social inequalities shape the lives of youth and how juvenile court responses, which are ostensible evidence-based treatments, can compound inequality and punish some youth. I then present strategies that center racial equity and social justice as part of a new framework for youth crime prevention.",

Foundational to this work is to bring about social justice for marginalized and underserved populations. Drawing on several case studies from developed and developing countries, we apply ideas and practices from social medicine to explore how the advancement of social justice can help prevent interpersonal violence. Several themes offer fresh perspectives on inculcating social justice principles and practices in violence prevention, including recognizing the impacts of structural violence, fostering equity in the distribution of resources, expanding accompaniment, and overcoming a socialized acceptance of scarcity. We conclude with observations on the indistinct and dynamic boundaries between medicine and criminology.",

          "abstract": "Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the city of Minneapolis grappled with shattered community trust, record rates of violence, and low officer morale. Balancing the interests of crime prevention and social justice in the community that the authors of this article serve is a vital concern, as it is in so many other cities and jurisdictions. Our perspective on crime prevention and social justice emphasizes transparency, community partnerships, and evaluative metrics, and we argue for and reflect on that approach here. By implementing practical, purposeful, and informed policy changes, the Minneapolis Police Department and our community have made significant strides forward in both building capacity for community trust and launching crime prevention initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Twenty-five years ago, we argued that it would be possible to reduce incarceration and use the resultant savings for investments in preschool education, which would further lower the crime rate. In this article, we revisit that line of thinking, surveying recent literature on the cost and efficacy of prisons and preschool education for crime reduction. We find that the new evidence strengthens our earlier conclusion about the feasibility of this thought experiment. The costs (in real dollars) of prison are higher than 25 years ago, and prisons are slightly less effective at reducing or preventing crime. In addition, the evidence shows broader and stronger effects of preschool on crime and in programs operating at a much larger scale than the programs we previously evaluated.",

          "abstract": "The police are traditionally seen as experts in crime prevention, and a large body of research supports the effectiveness of police-led prevention initiatives targeted at crime hot spots. However, there is growing interest in identifying alternative prevention efforts that do not rely on the police, especially with youth in communities that have challenging relationships with the formal justice system. This article reports on a quasi-experimental evaluation of an innovative school- and community-led crime prevention partnership that prioritized social justice and social impact. The partnership was associated with modest but statistically significant reductions in calls for service and reported offenses in the treatment areas. Results for juvenile-involved offenses were not statistically significant, but the magnitude and direction of that effect were similar to the other results. We discuss the benefits and challenges of leveraging informal social controls to prevent crime “beyond the police.”",

          "authors": "Savannah A. Reid, Eric L. Piza, Brandon C. Welsh, John P. Moylan",
          "abstract": "Critics of evidence-based crime prevention argue that extant research lacks insight into aspects of crime control and prevention that are critical to policymakers. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of programs require the use of experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and some scholars argue that relaxing that methodological criterion would result in a larger pool of studies that could better inform policy and practice. We test that proposition by using a comprehensive database of 160 evaluation studies of public-area video surveillance and measuring their policy relevance by looking for four specific factors: causal mechanisms, moderators, implementation, and economic costs. We find that studies incorporating experimental and high-quality quasi-experimental designs scored significantly higher than studies using less rigorous designs on three of the four dimensions. This suggests that adherence to a high standard of methodological rigor does not compromise the practical value of video surveillance research. We then discuss the implications of this finding.",

          "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, there has been growing concern over a purported link between proactive policing to control crime and unfair, biased, and abusive policing approaches. Overly aggressive and indiscriminate policing initiatives run the risk of driving a wedge between police and the communities they serve, with residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods feeling less like partners and more like targets. At the same time, research suggests that effective policing has an important impact on public safety. We present a conceptual framework for how police can prevent crime while minimizing unintended harm. We focus particularly on cities and urban communities, arguing that the benefits of policing can be maximized and the costs of policing can be minimized when the police respect individual rights and dignity and focus on community, and that problem solving should begin with a focus on risky people in the places that generate the most crime.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research on evidence-based crime prevention draws attention to a pressing need for these crime prevention programs, policies, and practices to do more to bring about social impact and social justice. Crime prevention that prioritizes social impact is about harnessing the knowledge of evidence-based interventions and fostering systems change that is both meaningful and lasting. This approach includes targeting the social and environmental conditions that lead to criminal activity, building on existing strengths and assets, and tailoring evidence-based practices to local conditions. Social justice in this context equitably delivers crime prevention resources, and promotes perceptions of fairness and legitimacy among individuals and the community at large. In this introduction, we lay out the ideals, challenges, and progress of crime prevention for social impact and social justice and summarize the conclusions of the other articles in this volume of The ANNALS .",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, public health researchers have been advancing the Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) framework to examine differential impacts of health policy. This article extends an equity-oriented policy agenda by applying the IBPA framework to three domains of the criminal justice system: policing, corrections, and legislation. I present case studies of algorithmic policing, the housing of transgender persons in carceral settings, and U.S. firearm legislation as examples of this approach. Through these cases, I argue for equitable processes and outcomes in the creation and application of criminal justice policy and practice.",

          "abstract": "Preventing the development of criminal potential in young people is an important component of broader crime reduction strategies. A key feature of developmental crime prevention is a comprehensive effort to improve the life chances of at-risk children and families, and there is evidence that doing so improves long-term life-course outcomes like physical health, mental health, education, and employment. We assess available research evidence from 12 high-quality studies of developmental crime prevention initiatives and find that extensive use of multimodal interventions helps to foster cumulative protection over the life course, that there are significant improvements in other outcomes over the life course, that there are promising signs of intergenerational transmission of the intervention effects, and that there is strong support for these sorts of interventions from the perspective of benefit-cost analysis. We also discuss implications for public policy and research.",

          "abstract": "Reducing crime opportunities at places is a successful strategy to reduce actual crime. This conceptual article examines how reducing crime at places is also an opportunity to have greater social impact and improve social justice, particularly when crime displacement may occur, through the recognition that no place exists in a vacuum. We discuss opportunity reduction in its traditional form, but also in a broader context that considers a fuller extent of crime prevention that more closely resembles its original formulation in the field of environmental criminology. We interrogate our traditional opportunity-reduction theories, identifying some of their limitations and noting that theoretical integration is not only conceptually possible, but empirically shown to matter. This is followed by a discussion of theoretical integration and its importance for crime prevention. We close our discussion outlining a crime prevention model, SafeGrowth, that considers both place-based strategies and community approaches.",

          "abstract": "Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment 1 was designed to first detect elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed 2 . Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7 σ from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395 ± 106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347 ± 59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation 1 . Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/C CDH1 ) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/C CDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes 2 , raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry.",

          "abstract": "Immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments are common in cancers such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (MASH-HCC) 1–3 . Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood 4 . ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation 5–7 . Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways 8–12 . Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC.",

However, little is known about corticostriatal axon activity and structural plasticity during learning in the adult brain. Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution.",

          "abstract": "Mouse lemurs are the smallest and fastest reproducing primates, as well as one of the most abundant, and they are emerging as a model organism for primate biology, behaviour, health and conservation. Although much has been learnt about their ecology and phylogeny in Madagascar and their physiology, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing to create Tabula Microcebus, a transcriptomic atlas of 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs opportunistically obtained from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration and expert cell annotation, we define and biologically organize more than 750 lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. This includes cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and differentiating cells along the developmental trajectories of spermatogenesis, haematopoiesis and other adult tissues. We also describe dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types. We globally compare expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explore primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing lemur transcriptomes to those of human, mouse and macaque. This reveals cell-type-specific patterns of primate specialization and many cell types and genes for which the mouse lemur provides a better human model than mouse 1 . The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this model primate and establishes a general approach for characterizing other emerging model organisms.",

          "abstract": "Mouse lemurs ( Microcebus spp.) are an emerging primate model organism, but their genetics, cellular and molecular biology remain largely unexplored. In an accompanying paper 1 , we performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing of 27 organs from mouse lemurs. We identified more than 750 molecular cell types, characterized their transcriptomic profiles and provided insight into primate evolution of cell types. Here we use the generated atlas to characterize mouse lemur genes, physiology, disease and mutations. We uncover thousands of previously unidentified lemur genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions including over 85,000 primate splice junctions missing in mice. We systematically explore the lemur immune system by comparing global expression profiles of key immune genes in health and disease, and by mapping immune cell development, trafficking and activation. We characterize primate-specific and lemur-specific physiology and disease, including molecular features of the immune program, lemur adipocytes and metastatic endometrial cancer that resembles the human malignancy. We present expression patterns of more than 400 primate genes missing in mice, many with similar expression patterns to humans and some implicated in human disease. Finally, we provide an experimental framework for reverse genetic analysis by identifying naturally occurring nonsense mutations in three primate immune genes missing in mice and by analysing their transcriptional phenotypes. This work establishes a foundation for molecular and genetic analyses of mouse lemurs and prioritizes primate genes, isoforms, physiology and disease for future study.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy 1 . Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation 2,3 . Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4 + T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8 + T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.",

          "authors": "Gaurav Kamath, Michelle Yang, Siva Reddy, Morgan Sonderegger, Dallas Card",
          "abstract": "A central question in the study of language change is whether or not such change is generational. If a language changes over time generation-by-generation, the process looks as follows: New generations of speakers introduce innovations, while older speakers conserve their usage patterns, and the language changes as new generations replace older ones. At the opposite extreme, language change could be a zeitgeist phenomenon, in which changes are universally adopted by speakers simultaneously, regardless of age or generational cohort. This paper asks this question in the context of word meaning change. We analyze meaning change in over 100 words across more than 7.9 million U.S. congressional speeches, to observe whether, when a word sense rises or falls in prominence, adult speakers from different generations uniformly adopt it, or those from older generations conserve their prior usage. Using language model-based word sense induction methods, we identify different senses of each word, and then model the prevalence of each of these word senses as a function of time and speaker age. We find that most words show a small but statistically significant effect of speaker age; across almost 140 y of Congress, older speakers typically take longer than younger speakers to follow changes in word usage, but nevertheless do so within a few years. Our findings indicate that despite minor age-based differences, word meaning change among mature speakers is likely not a generational process, but rather a zeitgeist process, in which older adult speakers can readily adopt new word usage patterns.",

          "abstract": "Ecosystem connectivity—the uninterrupted flow of natural processes within and among ecosystems—is critical for maintaining healthy ecosystem functions. However, in the Amazon drainage basin, multiple anthropogenic activities are rapidly disrupting connectivity. To assess the severity of this problem, we analyzed the spatial distributions of six major anthropogenic activities: dam construction, deforestation, fire, mining, oil and gas exploitation, and roads. We examined their impacts across four key landscapes: Amazonian Andes, lowland nonflooded forests, wetlands, and rivers. Using a resistance-based connectivity model, we quantified connectivity across terrestrial, wetland, and river ecosystems and found a marked decline in connectivity across the basin. A central focus of our study was the role of Indigenous Territories and Protected Areas (ITPAs), which collectively cover over 50% of the basin. Our findings show that ITPAs sustain significantly high levels of ecosystem connectivity. Only 14 to 16% of ITPA land is impacted by anthropogenic activities, compared to 38% in unprotected areas. Terrestrial ecosystems in the southern and eastern Amazon are heavily impacted by deforestation, mining, and fires, with significantly higher connectivity inside ITPAs than in unprotected areas ( P &lt; 0.01). Wetlands and riverine ecosystems also face severe fragmentation, particularly from dams and illegal mining—but maintain stronger connectivity within ITPAs (wetlands: P &lt; 0.01; rivers: P &lt; 0.001), with the few remaining free-flowing Andean rivers increasingly isolated from the lowland Amazon. Strengthening governance and sustainable initiatives in ITPAs, in partnership with local inhabitants, represents an expedient, efficient, and cost-effective strategy for conserving ecosystem connectivity in the Amazon basin.",

          "abstract": "Genomic sequence data harbor valuable information concerning the history of species divergence and interspecific gene flow and may offer important insights into conservation of endangered species. However, extracting such information from genomic data requires powerful statistical inference methods. A recent analysis of genomic sequence data found little evidence for gene flow from domestic Bactrian camels into the endangered wild Bactrian species. Nevertheless, the methods used to infer gene flow are based on data summaries and lack the power and precision to represent the complex phylogenetic history of the species with gene flow. Here, we apply Bayesian methods to genomic sequence data to test for both recent and ancient gene flow among the three species in the genus Camelus and to estimate the strength and timing of gene flow. We detect a strong signal of gene flow from domestic into wild Bactrian camels, confirming early evidence based on mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome. Overall gene flow appears to affect the autosomal genome uniformly, with similar effective rates of gene flow for exonic and noncoding regions. Estimation of species divergence times is seriously affected if gene flow is not accommodated in the analysis. Our results highlight the power of the coalescent model in analysis of genomic data and the utility of the coding as well as noncoding parts of the genome in elucidating the evolutionary history of modern species.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons that project to the dorsal striatum, and mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are the most common genetic causes of familial Parkinson’s disease. Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which normally support dopamine neurons vulnerable in PD. Here, we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling and Hedgehog-dependent neuroprotective factor production by a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity increases lysosomal accessible cholesterol and thus decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells; this change in lipid composition blocks ciliary Hedgehog signaling that depends on accessible cholesterol. Consistent with defects in Hedgehog signaling in the mouse dorsal striatum, GBA1 mutant mice show reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons, with no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.",

According to previous isotopic studies, much of the perchlorate deposited to the Earth’s surface is formed in the atmosphere, with 36 Cl suggesting a large contribution from the stratosphere. Here, we present measurements of perchlorate in stratospheric aerosol particles and confirm that the stratosphere is an important source of perchlorate, whereas we did not observe production in the troposphere. Mass mixing ratios of aerosol perchlorate in the stratosphere were 1 to 10 parts per trillion by mass (pptm), with the highest concentrations observed in summer and in the Southern Hemisphere. Almost all of the perchlorate is in biomass burning and nitrogen-rich particles, despite those types contributing only a few percent of the aerosol particles. Such particles are less acidic than the majority of sulfuric acid particles. If the formation of perchlorate is sensitive to acidity, then the injection of some materials for solar radiation modification might significantly increase the global production of perchlorate.",

          "authors": "Natsuki Mizutani, Yasushige Yonezawa, Atsushi Nakagawa, Yasushi Okamura",
          "abstract": "Voltage-sensing phosphatase (VSP) comprises a voltage sensor domain (VSD) and a cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR), achieving a unique electrochemical signal conversion. Previous studies suggest that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ), a membrane phospholipid known to be critical for activities of diverse voltage-gated ion channels, associates with a linker connecting the VSD with the CCR of VSP and regulates VSD-CCR coupling. However, the details of PI(4,5)P 2 interaction with the linker of VSP remain elusive. Here, we exploit advantage of sensitivity of a fluorescent unnatural amino acid, 3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (Anap), to changes in local environment to study interaction between PI(4,5)P 2 and the linker of Ciona intestinalis VSP (Ci-VSP). We found that a conserved tyrosine residue (Y255) as well as neighboring basic residues interacts with PI(4,5)P 2 and this interaction was maintained in G365A Ci-VSP mutant which lacks the substrate PI(4,5)P 2 at the active site and Ci-VSP/human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) chimera which does not dephosphorylate PI(4,5)P 2 , indicating that the linker interacts with nonsubstrate, regulatory PI(4,5)P 2 outside the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the linker formed stable interaction with PI(4,5)P 2 in the activated state. These findings indicate that regulation of coupling to an effector region downstream of the VSD through PI(4,5)P 2 binding to the linker is shared among voltage-dependent membrane proteins.",

          "abstract": "Past traumatic experiences shape neural responses to future stress, but the mechanisms underlying this dynamic interaction remain unclear. Here, we assessed how trauma-related brain networks respond to current acute stress in real time. Using a machine learning approach, we trained and tested brain functional connectivity networks to predict past trauma exposure in a community sample of adults ( N = 170). We then evaluated the response of these trauma-predictive brain networks to an acute emotional and physiological stressor in a subsample of participants ( N = 92) and to a pharmacological manipulation (hydrocortisone) in an independent crossover study ( N = 27). We found that connectome-based predictive modeling successfully predicted past trauma exposure. The network associated with greater trauma exposure showed high involvement of salience network connections, with model prediction driven by connectivity in the medial frontal cortex, salience network, motor regions, default mode network, and cerebellum. Notably, connectivity in this trauma-predictive network was significantly attenuated following an acute stressor relative to control. A similar pattern was observed in the pharmacology sample, with decreased connectivity under hydrocortisone compared to placebo within this trauma-predictive network. Finally, attenuated trauma-predictive network connectivity after acute stress was associated with lower depressive symptoms in the stress-exposed group, but not control group. These findings suggest that stress may induce blunted connectivity of brain networks related to past traumatic experiences and that the reduced engagement of these trauma-predictive brain networks may facilitate adaptive regulatory response to later stress.",

Here, we determined G2L4 RT apoenzyme and snap-back DNA synthesis structures revealing unique structural adaptations that optimized its cellular function in DSBR. These included an RT3a structure that stabilizes the apoenzyme in an inactive conformation until encountering a DNA substrate; a longer N-terminal extension/RT0-loop with conserved residues that together with a modified active site favors strand annealing; and a conserved dimer interface that localizes G2L4 RT homodimers to DSBR sites with both monomers positioned for MMEJ. Our findings reveal how an RT can function in DNA repair and suggest ways of optimizing related RTs for genome engineering applications.",

Rapid, recent radiations are ideal systems for this question because they still show key morphological and ecological adaptations associated with speciation. While most research on recent radiations focuses on those occurring in insular environments, less attention has been given to continental radiations with complex species interactions. Here, we study the drivers of continental radiations of Melinaea and Mechanitis butterflies (Nymphalidae: Ithomiini), which have rapidly radiated in the continental Neotropics. They are classical models for Amazonian biogeography and color pattern mimicry and have been proposed as biodiversity indicators. We generated reference genomes for five species of each genus and whole-genome resequencing data of most species and subspecies covering a wide geographic range to assess phylogeographic relationships, hybridization patterns, and chromosomal rearrangements. Our data help resolve the classification of these taxonomically challenging butterflies and reveal very high diversification rates. We find rampant evidence of historical hybridization and putative hybrid species in both radiations, which may have facilitated their rapid diversification by enriching the genetic diversity. Moreover, we identified dozens of chromosomal fusions and fissions between congeneric species that have likely expedited reproductive isolation. We conclude that interactions between geography, hybridization and chromosomal rearrangements have contributed to these rapid radiations in the highly diverse Neotropical region. We hypothesize that rapid radiations may be spurred if repeated periods of geographic isolation are combined with lineage-specific rapid accumulation of incompatibilities, followed by secondary contact with some gene exchange.",

          "abstract": "Plant–microbe symbioses such as the legume–rhizobium mutualism are vital in the web of ecological relationships within both natural and managed ecosystems, influencing primary productivity, crop yield, and ecosystem services. The outcome of these interactions for plant hosts varies quantitatively and can range from highly beneficial to even detrimental depending on natural genetic variation in microbial symbionts. Here, we take a systems genetics approach, harnessing the genetic diversity present in wild rhizobial populations to predict genes and molecular pathways crucial in determining partner quality, i.e., the benefits of symbiosis for legume hosts. We combine traits, dual-RNAseq of both partners from active nodules, pangenomics/pantranscriptomics, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for a panel of 20 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains that vary in symbiotic partner quality. We find that genetic variation in the nodule transcriptome predicts host plant biomass, and WGCNA reveals networks of genes in plants and rhizobia that are coexpressed and associated with high-quality symbiosis. Presence–absence variation of gene clusters on the symbiosis plasmid (pSymA), validated in planta, is associated with high or low-quality symbiosis and is found within important coexpression modules. Functionally our results point to management of oxidative stress, amino acid and carbohydrate transport, and NCR peptide signaling mechanisms in driving symbiotic outcomes. Our integrative approach highlights the complex genetic architecture of microbial partner quality and raises hypotheses about the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis.",

Here, we propose a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact analytic solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intracortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain.",

          "abstract": "Reticulate evolution has long been recognized as a key mechanism that contributes to genetic and trait diversity. With the widespread availability of genomic data, investigating historical reticulate evolution across taxa has gained significant attention, driven by the rapid development of statistical methods for detecting nontreelike patterns. Phylogenetic networks provide a biologically intuitive approach to depicting evolutionary processes such as hybrid speciation and introgressive hybridization, which result in signatures of historical gene flow. Interpreting phylogenetic networks is especially critical for groups of conservation concern that lack reference genome resources and explicit hypotheses from prior investigation, such as those based on molecular data, morphology, or species distributions. Here, we highlight recent advances in computational methods for inferring networks from genome-scale data and offer guidelines for deriving biological insights from phylogenetic networks. Particular emphasis is placed on modeling hybridization and whole-genome duplication in the context of allopolyploidization. Practical recommendations for empirical studies and the limitations of commonly used methods are discussed throughout. We anticipate that phylogenetic networks will influence conservation biology and biodiversity research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of reticulate evolution inferred from these networks in the near future. Networks will accelerate other pressing avenues of biodiversity research, especially investigations of orphan crops and climate change resilience in natural systems. The promise of phylogenetic networks connects with broader themes in the special feature Monitoring and restoring gene flow in the increasingly fragmented ecosystems of the Anthropocene by providing an emerging probabilistic framework for inferring historical connectivity between species and populations.",

          "abstract": "Our current understanding of protein folding is based predominantly on studies of small (&lt;150 aa) proteins that refold reversibly from a chemically denatured state. However, as protein length increases so does the competition between off-pathway misfolding and on-pathway folding, creating a more complex energy landscape (\"folding funnel\"). Little is known about how intermediates populated during the folding of larger proteins affect navigation of this more complex landscape. Previously, we reported extremely slow folding rates for the 539 aa β-helical passenger domain of pertactin (P.69T), including conditions that favor the formation of a kinetically trapped, off-pathway partially folded state (PFS). Existence of an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding was speculated but its characterization remained elusive. In this work, we exploited the extremely slow kinetics of PFS unfolding to develop a double-jump “denaturant challenge” assay. With this assay, we identified a transient unfolding intermediate, PFS*, that adopts a similar structure to PFS, including C-terminal folded structure and a disordered N terminus, yet unfolds much more quickly than PFS. Additional experiments revealed that PFS* also functions as an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding. Collectively, these results support a C-to-N-terminal model for P.69T folding, with folding initiated in the C-terminus with the rate-limiting formation of the transient on-pathway PFS* intermediate, which sits at the junction of the kinetic competition between folding and misfolding. Notably, processive folding from C-to-N terminus also occurs during C-to-N-terminal translocation of P.69T across the bacterial outer membrane. These results illuminate the crucial role of kinetics when navigating a complex energy landscape for protein folding.",

Among these, we show that the DUF1907 domain of C11orf54 catalyzes formation of L-xylulose by establishing a zinc-coordinated Michaelis complex with β-keto-L-gulonate (BKG). The identification of BKG decarboxylase completes the pentose pathway, in which pentose sugars are produced by decarboxylation of nonphosphorylated hexose precursors. The pathway was present in the unicellular ancestor of animals and is conserved in all deuterostomes, in contrast to the alternative L-ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway. An increased flux toward pentoses may have represented an evolutionary tradeoff, favoring energy metabolism and redox cofactor balance at the expense of ascorbate biosynthesis in organisms, such as humans and other Haplorhini primates, where dietary vitamin C intake prevents scurvy.",

However, there is a paucity of cancer-specific antigens that are endogenously produced. HapImmune™ technology utilizes covalent inhibitors directed to an intracellular cancer driver to create cancer-specific neoantigens in the form of drug–peptide conjugates presented by class I MHC molecules. Our previous study with sotorasib, an FDA-approved covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C), demonstrated that drug-treated cells produce such neoantigens and can be killed by T cell engagers directed against the drug–peptide/MHC complex. Thus, this technology can unite targeted and immune therapies. In the present study, we examined whether this approach could generalize to another FDA-approved KRAS(G12C) inhibitor, adagrasib, whose chemical structure and cysteine reactivity differ substantially from sotorasib. We developed antibodies selective to adagrasib-KRAS(G12C) peptides presented by HLA-A*03 and A*11 that also show cross-reactivity to other KRAS(G12C) inhibitors presented in the same manner. Cryoelectron microscopy structures revealed a mode of adagrasib-peptide/HLA recognition distinctly different from that of sotorasib-directed HapImmune antibodies. The antibodies in a bispecific T cell engager format killed adagrasib-resistant lung cancer cells upon adagrasib treatment. These results support the broad applicability of the HapImmune approach for creating actionable cancer-specific neoantigens and offer candidates for therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Natural habitats have undergone drastic changes in quality, continuity, and extent during the Pleistocene, influencing the distribution of many species. More recently, human activities have converted continuous habitats into fragmented and isolated patches. Recent meta-analyses suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation (HL&amp;F) have negatively impacted the genetic diversity of species but very few studies have analyzed the consequences of HL&amp;F on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity and on isolation by distance (IBD) patterns (i.e., correlations between genetic and geographical distances) observed in many species. In this work, we use spatial simulations to investigate the speed at which IBD patterns generated in continuous habitats are lost in a context of HL&amp;F. We characterized the behavior of IBD in the case of i) instantaneous HL&amp;F, ii) gradual (two-steps) HL&amp;F, and iii) range expansion followed by instantaneous HL&amp;F. In addition, we show that a spatially explicit theoretical framework based on previous IBD theoretical results can be modified and applied to a toroidal stepping-stone model undergoing HL&amp;F. Our results suggest that IBD patterns can be maintained for long periods of time after HL&amp;F, thus pointing to the long-term persistence of signatures associated to past habitat connectivity in the genetic diversity of many species, even if they went through major and sometimes ancient fragmentation events. This suggests that some present-day fragmented species, who still exhibit significant IBD patterns, may have been partly disconnected for very long periods, on the order of tens of thousands of years for species with long generation time.",

We used iggypop to synthesize a series of single-transcript autonomously bioluminescent reporters (STARBURSTs) that link the five genes of a fungal bioluminescence pathway via ribosomal skipping LP4/2A sequences into a 9.5 kb transcript that function in planta. We also synthesized RUBY reporters (a reporter gene system producing red betalain pigment) recoded to match dicot codon usage, as RUBY was codon optimized for rice codon usage and has a high GC content. Surprisingly, the recoded RUBYs substantially reduced betalain production in transient Nicotiana benthamiana assays. Based on this observation, we synthesized six GC-boosted STARBURSTs, which produced robust luminescence in both transient assays and transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Thus, iggypop enabled the rapid synthesis of multiple genetic designs to deliver a bright single transcript autobioluminescent reporter. Iggypop should enable the facile synthesis and optimization of new genetic parts and complex polycistronic pathways.",

          "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis requires excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) to reaction centers (RCs) to drive photochemical redox chemistry. The effective absorption cross section of RCs dynamically responds to the light environment on time scales of seconds to days, allowing rapid acclimations to changes in spectral irradiance and photoprotection under high light, thereby optimizing light absorption for photochemistry. Although energy coupling between LHC–RCs has been studied for decades in laboratory cultures, it remains poorly understood in real-world conditions, where it is potentially influenced by nutrients. In the oceans, one of the most critical micronutrients for photosynthesis is iron (Fe). To investigate the effects of Fe stress on the energetic coupling between LHC–RCs in natural phytoplankton assemblages in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, we assessed photophysiological responses using a pair of custom-built fluorometers measuring chlorophyll-a variable fluorescence and picosecond fluorescence lifetimes. Detailed analysis based on the functional absorption cross section of the oxygen-evolving complex, quantum yield of photochemistry, energetic connectivity of RCs, and the average lifetime of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence suggested that between 10 and 25% of LHCs remain uncoupled from RCs and do not effectively contribute to photochemical charge separation. Addition of Fe to samples under trace metal-clean on-board incubations indicates relatively rapid recoupling (&lt; 24 h) of antennae to photochemistry, followed by biophysical stabilization of recoupled complexes. Our findings highlight the crucial role of micronutrients in controlling the excitation energy transfer from LHCs to RCs in marine phytoplankton and the overall primary productivity in the real-world oceans.",

          "abstract": "Reproductive, male-enriched small RNAs are present in flowering plants and animals, yet their role in plants remains underexplored. We generated dicer-like 5 ( dcl5 ) mutants in durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum 2n = 4× = 28; AABB), revealing temperature-sensitive genic male sterility. Loss of DCL5 depleted premeiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNA production, correlating with sterility under standard growth conditions and partial fertility recovery at higher temperatures. A single functional DCL5 allele restored complete fertility, presenting a promising alternative to current methods for hybrid production. We demonstrate that premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNA biogenesis is independent of miRNA-mediated cleavage and driven by a conserved motif initiating DCL5 activity. In the dcl5 mutant developing under sterility-inducing conditions, developmental defects are observed during pollen maturation, rather than at peak 24-nt phasiRNA accumulation in premeiotic and meiotic anthers. Although no visible morphological abnormalities were apparent during early development, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that dcl5 mutant cells exhibit transcriptional profiles distinct from those of wild-type cells, when premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs are accumulating at the early developmental stage. Finally, the coexpression of Argonaute ( AGO1b , AGO4a, and AGO6 ) homeologs in 24-nt phasiRNA-producing cells identifies candidate effectors and suggests a role for 24-nt phasiRNAs in transcriptional gene silencing.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we established a mouse reporter model for studying muscle cell contribution to bone fracture repair. Analyzing skeletal muscle scRNA-seq datasets revealed that Prg4 marks a fibroadipogenic progenitor (FAP) subpopulation. In mice, Prg4 + cells were specifically located in the skeletal muscle, but not at the periosteum or inside cortical bone. These cells expressed FAP markers, responded to muscle injury, and became periosteal cells under normal and muscle injury conditions. Fracture fragmented muscle fibers, rapidly expanded Prg4 + FAPs at the injury site and promoted their migration into the fracture gap. Later, they gave rise to many chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the outer periphery of callus next to muscle. In repaired bones, the descendants of Prg4 + FAPs were detected as mesenchymal progenitors in the periosteum and osteocytes at the prior fracture site. A second fracture activated those cells and stimulated them to become osteoblasts in the inner part of callus. Importantly, ablation of Prg4 + FAPs impaired fracture healing and functional repair. In an intramembranous bone injury model (drill-hole), Prg4 + FAPs became periosteal cells, but their contribution to bone defect repair was significantly less than in fractures. Taken together, we demonstrate the critical role of FAPs in endochondral bone repair and uncover a mechanism by which mesenchymal progenitors transform from muscle to cortical bone.",

          "abstract": "Conservation science and policy are geared primarily toward the preservation of species and habitats, with priority often given to the rarest, most vulnerable or most charismatic forms. This pattern-based approach has broad appeal and offers a pragmatic short-cut for targeting conservation action. However, the long-term efficacy of species and landscape conservation programs remains highly uncertain, amid growing evidence that sustainable conservation action requires an increased emphasis on preserving ecological and evolutionary processes. This reframing of conservation goals was first proposed 50 y ago, but the concept has struggled to gain traction, particularly in terms of translation into policy. Nonetheless, recent events have shifted the narrative, with multiple interlinked global challenges—including biological invasions, food security, disease, and climate change—putting ecological processes firmly back on the agenda. Concurrently, conservation finance is changing rapidly, driven in part by the 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which prioritized actions to enhance and restore ecosystem stability, connectivity, and resilience. These ecosystem properties are fundamentally process-driven and appear to create an operational gulf between current conservation practice and the targets of international agreements. We describe how new approaches can be used to close this gap by redirecting conservation attention toward processes at the heart of ecosystem function, including adaptation, gene flow, dispersal, and trophic interactions. Wider adoption of these approaches is urgently needed to forge a deeper connection between conservation practice and policy targets, thereby ensuring that ongoing investment in biodiversity conservation goes beyond damage limitation and instead leaves a lasting legacy of resilient ecosystems.",

We then screened more than 18,000 genomes from all major bacterial groups for the presence of those mutations and determined which mutations can evolve through point mutations. Our results demonstrate that although the evolvability of individual mutations varies considerably across species, overall predicted evolvability is high and relatively homogeneous across bacterial taxa. Rifampicin resistance mutations are present intrinsically in 8% of species that tend to be phylogenetically clustered.

We found that the senescent ECs showed high endocytic capacity and SARS-CoV-2 virus uptake. This triggers an nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway–mediated inflammatory response. Further, Basigin enhanced endocytosis in the senescent ECs by activating the intracellular vascular endothelial growth factor signaling.

          "abstract": "The fossil record of functional diversity is increasingly used to study ecosystem evolution, extinction recovery, and factors affecting long-term trends in biodiversity. In addition, the youngest fossil record (late Quaternary) can provide insights into the natural range of functional variability of present-day ecosystems, providing a historical framework for conservation and restoration. However, the reliability of common functional diversity measures derived from fossils is uncertain. If fossils yield reasonable estimates of functional diversity, paleontological data could provide information on ecological attributes and trophic structure in past ecosystems allowing for temporally scalable assessments of ecological and evolutionary processes. To assess how well fossils preserve functional diversity across multiple types of marine invertebrates with varying preservation potential, we compared the live benthos (135 species from 6 phyla) with sympatric skeletal accumulations (150 species) and the predicted fossil record (112 species) for 51 coastal sites in North Carolina (USA). High functional fidelity between the live, dead, and fossil assemblages was supported by congruence in quantitative functional diversity indices (e.g., functional richness, redundancy, overredundancy, and vulnerability), overlap in multidimensional functional space, and species distributions among functional groups ( ρ &gt; 0.85, P ≪ 0.001). Calculating vulnerability using a threshold of ≤2 species also reasonably approximated the vulnerability in the live assemblages. The results suggest that, despite differential preservation and time-averaging, functional estimates based on fossils may allow for historical assessments of ecological and evolutionary processes, including short-term community responses to human impacts as well as long-term macroevolutionary dynamics of marine ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Under an accelerating biodiversity crisis, increased urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and climate change require new approaches to assess conservation impact. We argue that animal biologging is a cost-effective method for monitoring biodiversity at its source, including tracked animals and the habitats they occupy. Biologging, or animal-mounted sensors to record data, can act as a reporting, measurement, and verification system, and deliver direct insights into environments of selection. Using a case study of migrating white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), we show that biologging yields real-time measurements of individual performance, mechanistic insights into environments of selection, and the potential for gene flow across anthropogenically influenced habitats. These insights can inform the success of biodiversity targets and conservation initiatives and improve real-time species management. At the global scale, we further illustrate that biologging studies display substantial bias in the types of environments and human conditions sampled. Studies appear biased toward sparsely populated areas and remain particularly rare in highly urbanized areas, areas experiencing high rates of recent forest fragmentation, and key areas for global biodiversity conservation efforts. We highlight the need for equitable access to technology to leverage the biodiversity potential of biologging in the Global South. Advances in software-defined tracking technology will soon give real-time information on energy budgets, survival, reproduction, and ultimately demographic processes and population-level parameters. When deployed into areas most needed, biologging can operationalize access to key measures of biodiversity maintenance such as gene flow, especially in difficult-to-access areas that are key to the future persistence of a species.",

Although several archaeal filament types have been characterized in considerable detail, many remain understudied, particularly those utilizing noncanonical secretion systems. Here, we describe the Tafi bundling pilus that facilitates biofilm formation in the haloarchaeon Natrinema sp. J7-2. Unlike previously characterized archaeal pili, Tafi is secreted via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, which transports fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Structural analysis reveals that although Tafi pili assemble via a canonical strand-donation mechanism, the pilin subunit (TafE) adopts a distinct structural topology that sets it apart from the previously characterized Sec-dependent pilins that form bundling pili in archaea. Sequence analyses show that TafE homologs are also present in thermophilic archaea from different phyla, but Tat-signal sequences are exclusive to pilins of halophilic archaea. Nevertheless, we find that Tat signal peptides in haloarchaeal TafE-like pili were exchanged back to the Sec signal peptides on multiple independent occasions. These findings expand our understanding of the diversity and evolution of archaeal extracellular filaments and highlight the Tat pathway as a route for pilus assembly in halophilic archaea.",

          "abstract": "The acrosome is a crucial organelle essential for sperm function and male fertility. During acrosome biogenesis, numerous proacrosomal vesicles (PAVs) are transported to the concave region of the nuclear membrane and fuse to form the acrosome. However, the mechanisms governing the fusion of PAVs to form the acrosome remain poorly understood. Here, we identify endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator 1 (ELAPOR1), a conserved protein, as a key factor in PAVs fusion during acrosome biogenesis. Male mice lacking Elapor1 ( Elapor1 −/− ) are infertile, exhibiting defective acrosome biogenesis and a globozoospermia-like phenotype. Using cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ELAPOR1 forms a square planar homodimer in cis, which assembles into a trans-tetramer via head-to-head homophilic interactions dependent on copper chelation. Notably, ELAPOR1 exhibits dual membrane orientation, with a predicted N in − C out topology and a noncanonical N out − C in topology in vesicles. The noncanonical N out − C in topology enables ELAPOR1 to function as a tethering factor bridging vesicles through head-to-head homophilic interactions. A mutant ELAPOR1 (ELAPOR1 4HA ) incapable of copper chelation forms cis homodimers but fails to mediate homophilic interactions in vitro, leading to defective PAVs fusion in mice, phenocopying the Elapor1 -deficient mice. Additionally, ELAPOR1 was shown to interact with soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors protein STX12. Conditional knockout of Stx12 in germ cells resulted in similar defects in acrosome biogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggest that ELAPOR1 functions as a tethering factor that regulates PAV fusion through a copper-dependent mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Pumas ( Puma concolor ) occupy a vast geographical range spanning from Canada to Argentina. Due to urbanization and unregulated hunting, pumas in Florida, known as panthers, are the only breeding population east of the Mississippi River. In the 1990s, Florida panthers numbered &lt;30 individuals suffering from inbreeding depression. In 1995, eight pumas from Texas were translocated into southern Florida to mitigate the effects of isolation. This translocation reduced inbreeding depression and increased population size. While genetic rescue is often suggested as a means of ameliorating the effects of small population size, the underlying genetic mechanism and its long-term efficacy remain understudied. We sequenced the genomes of posttranslocation Florida panthers (PTFPs) to elucidate the genomic consequences of genetic rescue. We inferred local ancestry across the genomes of PTFPs and found that no regions have been entirely replaced by Texas ancestry, discarding the possibility of genetic swamping. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of the translocation were likely caused by a reduction in homozygosity, alleviating recessive deleterious load, rather than by a reduction in the number of deleterious variants. We did not find evidence that selection has favored replacement of original Florida DNA with Texas DNA in any systematic fashion. Using simulations, we found that heterozygosity increased in the long-term compared to a no translocation scenario; however, the effects on fitness are more transient. Our findings hold significant implications not only for the management of Florida's panther population, but also for informing strategies for genetic rescue in other wild, inbred populations encompassing broader conservation efforts.",

Various factors affect the extent of load, such as population size and breeding system, but other important determinants remain unexplored. In particular, whole-genome duplication (WGD)—a pervasive macromutation occurring broadly across Eukaryotes—remains poorly understood in terms of its impact on neutral and selective processes within populations. Using iterative forward simulations and empirical analysis of 632 short- and 16 long-read sequenced individuals of Arabidopsis arenosa (in 23 diploid and 42 natural autotetraploid populations), we measure the effects of WGD on genome-wide diversity and mutation load. Our simulations show how genetic variation gradually rises in autotetraploids due to increased mutational target size. Moreover, mutation load increases due to relaxed purifying selection as ploidies rise, when deleterious mutations are masked by additional chromosome copies. Empirical data confirm these patterns, showing significant increases in nucleotide diversity, ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs, and numbers of indels and large structural variants in A. arenosa autotetraploids. However, a rather modest increase in load proxies together with a broad distribution and niche of autotetraploids suggests load accumulation has not yet limited their successful expansion. Overall, we demonstrate a complex interplay between neutral processes and purifying selection in shaping genetic variation following WGD and highlight ploidy as an important determinant of mutation load, genetic diversity, and therefore adaptive potential in natural populations.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic destruction and fragmentation of habitat restrict many species to small, isolated populations, which often experience high extirpation risk. Restoring connectivity through translocations is one approach for mitigating the demographic and genetic perils faced by small populations. However, translocation interventions often lack substantial postrelease monitoring, and thus important information including the performance of translocated individuals, the long-term impacts on the recipient population, and the extent to which management objectives are fulfilled over time are often poorly known. Here, we examined the establishment dynamics and long-term outcomes of translocations from multiple donor populations into an intensively monitored population of the federally threatened red-cockaded woodpecker. We found evidence that translocations contributed to population growth and led to genetic admixture within the population. The translocated birds provided direct demographic benefits through high rates of establishment, breeding, and survival. We found that the survival and lifetime reproductive success of individuals were positively related to their amount of translocation ancestry, indicating that demographic benefits extended beyond the direct performances of the translocated birds. The translocations diversified the population’s genetic composition with the ancestry of most individuals in the latter years of the study deriving from multiple translocation donor populations. We found marked heterogeneity in the genetic contributions of translocated individuals and cohorts, leading to disproportionate representation of certain lineages. Encouragingly, despite some accumulation of inbreeding during the study, the translocations thus far have not substantially contributed to inbreeding. Our findings illustrate in precise detail how translocations can be an effective approach for managing imperiled taxa.",

This extends to libraries of printed ligands dispensed directly onto TEM grids for later soaking with microcrystal slurries, and complexes with noncovalent ligands. ED-MS resolves structures of the natural product, epoxide-based cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, and its biosynthetic analogs bound to the model cysteine protease, papain. It further identifies papain binding to its preferred natural products, by showing that two analogs of E-64 outcompete others in binding to papain crystals, and by detecting papain bound to E-64 and an analog from crude biosynthetic reactions, without purification. ED-MS also resolves binding of the CTX-M-14 β-lactamase, a target of active drug development, to the non-β-lactam inhibitor, avibactam, alone or in a cocktail of unrelated compounds.

          "abstract": "As memories age, their immediate retrievability decreases albeit, due to ongoing memory consolidation, their future rate of forgetting weakens. Here, we show in two experiments ( N = 1.216 participants) that mentally traveling back in time to older memories’ temporal context at encoding reverses the two effects and makes the memories similar again to how they were at an earlier point in time. Mental time travel increased both the memories’ immediate retrievability and their future rate of forgetting when individuals attempted to reinstate context deliberately and actively and when they retrieved other memories sharing a similar temporal context. Intriguingly, the forgetting after mental time travel even followed the same trajectory as the forgetting after encoding. Attempts to reinstate memories’ encoding context thus rejuvenated memories, although the degree of rejuvenation decreased as temporal lag between encoding and the reinstatement attempts increased, which was mediated by the fact that, with increasing lag, decreasing proportions of the encoded memories were reactivated and reconsolidated in response to participants’ reinstatement attempts. Mentally traveling back in time creates rejuvenation cycles with enhanced retrievability followed by a restart of forgetting and consolidation processes. Recurring rejuvenation cycles may thus be key to maintain memories’ retrievability over longer periods of time, painting the picture of Sisyphus-like memory resurrection.",

Mosaic hybrid zones can form when geographically co-occurring, yet environmentally distinct, lineages cross-pollinate and form hybrids that occupy unique environmental niches absent of a geographic cline. This expands the total environmental space across which parental and hybrid individuals grow, resulting in larger, less fragmented geographic distributions. Here, we highlight hybridization mosaics across three study systems containing taxa critical to widespread plant communities in western North America: Ericameria nauseosa , Artemisia tridentata , and Sphaeralcea fendleri . The systems contain diverged taxa that co-occur across the landscape and hybridize readily. Hybridization among taxa has facilitated niche expansion into intermediate environments consistent with unique combinations of adaptive genetic variation, creating more continuity within each study system—study systems occupy ~820 to 270,000 km 2 more geographic area by virtue of hybridization. Furthermore, hybrids are predicted to play important roles in future climates, as they may occupy 8 to 475% larger distributions compared to present. Convergent patterns signal mosaic hybridization as an underappreciated mechanism with broad ecological and evolutionary ramifications. Leveraging mosaic hybridization may assist the creation of restoration management plans that aim to mitigate the deleterious effects of habitat fragmentation on ecosystems in the context of climate change.",

We developed a strategy for quantifying surface localization from fluorescence microscopy images of surface-stained cells. Using clustered protocadherins, a protein family important for cell–cell recognition during neuronal development, we found that surface delivery levels vary among clustered protocadherin isoforms and between wild-type and engineered variants. Quantifying these differences provides evidence that cis dimerization is not tightly coupled to surface delivery for clustered protocadherins.

          "abstract": "The recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1/2) recombinase, which initiates V(D)J recombination in jawed vertebrates, evolved from RNaseH-like transposases such as Transib and ProtoRAG. However, its postcleavage transposase activity is strictly suppressed. Previous structural studies have focused only on the conserved core domains of RAG1/2, leaving the regulatory mechanisms of the noncore regions unclear. To investigate how RAG1/2 suppresses transposition and regulates DNA cleavage, we determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of nearly full-length RAG1/2 complexed with cleaved recombination signal sequences (RSS) in a signal-end complex (SEC) at resolutions up to 2.95 Å. Two key structures, SEC-0 and SEC-Plant Homeodomain (PHD), reveal distinct regulatory roles of RAG2, which is absent in Transib transposase. SEC-0 displays a closed conformation, revealing that the core RAG2 facilitates sequential DNA cleavage by stabilizing the RSS-cleaved states in a “spring-loaded” mechanism. SEC-PHD reveals how RAG2’s noncore PHD and Acidic Hinge (AH), which are absent in ProtoRAG, inhibit target DNA binding in transposition. Histone H3K4me3, which recruits RAG1/2 to RSS sites, does not influence RAG1/2 binding to V, D, or J gene segments bordered by RSS. In contrast, the suppressed transposition can be activated by H3K4me3 peptides that dislodge the inhibitory PHD. To achieve this derepression in vivo, however, would require an unlikely close placement of two nucleosomes flanking a target DNA bent by nearly 180°. Our structural and biochemical results elucidate how RAG1 has acquired RAG2 and utilizes its core and noncore domains to enhance V(D)J recombination and suppress transposition.",

In some Corynebacteriales , this mycomembrane is further supported by a proteinaceous surface layer or “S-layer,” whose function, structure, and mode of assembly remain largely enigmatic. Here, we isolated ex vivo PS2 S-layers from the industrially important Corynebacterium glutamicum and determined its atomic structure by 3D cryo-EM reconstruction. PS2 monomers consist of a six-helix bundle “core,” a three-helix bundle “arm,” and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) helix. The PS2 core oligomerizes into hexameric units anchored in the mycomembrane by a channel-like coiled-coil of the TM helices. The PS2 arms mediate trimeric lattice contacts, crystallizing the hexameric units into an intricate semipermeable lattice. Using pulse-chase live cell imaging, we show that the PS2 lattice is incorporated at the poles, coincident with the actinobacterial elongasome. Finally, phylogenetic analysis shows a paraphyletic distribution and dispersed chromosomal location of PS2 in Corynebacteriales as a result of multiple recombination events and losses. These findings expand our understanding of S-layer biology and enable applications of membrane-supported self-assembling bioengineered materials.",

          "abstract": "Neonates and infants are distinct in their clinical and cellular responses to viral infections, with neonatal CD8 + T cells displaying innate-like characteristics and a low threshold for T cell receptor activation. However, specific molecular programs that drive these unique responses are incompletely understood, particularly in humans, and targetable pathways to modulate viral illness in this vulnerable population remain to be elucidated. Early-life immune responses may be developmentally programmed to prioritize avoidance of tissue immunopathology, especially while maternal immunoglobulin provides passive immunity. We set out to define the unique response characteristics and transcription factor landscape of neonatal human CD8 + T cells. Here, we report evidence that naïve neonatal human CD8 + T cells are poised for an accelerated effector switch, with elevations of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 (KLRB1/CD161), Fc epsilon receptor I-gamma ( FCER1G ), DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM1/CD226), granzymes, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and glycolysis compared to naïve adult CD8 + T cells. Further, rapid proliferation and cell death occur upon activation of neonatal CD8 + T cells, with cell viability largely rescued by IL-2 or IL-7. These features are coupled with a unique transcription factor landscape, including high expression of thymocyte selection associated high mobility group box (TOX) and HELIOS ( IKZF2 ), and these signatures continue in postnatal life until at least 2 mo of age. We conclude that early-life human CD8 + T cells maintain a unique transcriptional state associated with an accelerated effector switch and short-lived effector program, revealing key nodes of regulation relevant for the unique immunobiology of neonatal humans.",

          "abstract": "The cytoplasmic genomes of plants and animals often fail to track species boundaries. However, the mechanisms responsible for such patterns are poorly understood, in part because few studies have linked cytoplasmic variation to phenotypic traits or environmental differences. Here, we use 1,554 previously published and 185 new whole genome sequences representing 14 taxa from the sunflower genus Helianthus , 91 phenotypic traits measured in common gardens, and 39 environmental variables to test for environmental and phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic genome variation. In agreement with previous work, two distinct chloroplast clades were found across multiple species and the sharing of chloroplast clades between species was mainly due to repeated introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Two mitochondrial clades were also found that matched the chloroplast clades for 98% of individuals, implying predominantly maternal inheritance of both genomes. Cytoplasmic clade was associated with differences in seed shape across several species, and likely with aridity, suggestive of a role in local adaptation. Conversely, we failed to find any credible cytonuclear interactions based on associations between chloroplast and nuclear variation. Taken together, this work suggests that cytoplasmic genomes in annual sunflowers represent a trans-species balanced polymorphism that is likely maintained by adaptation to different environments. More broadly, our results corroborate the syngameon concept, showing how introgression across even very strong reproductive barriers can facilitate environmental adaptation across a species complex.",

Instead of an isolated circadian phenotype seen with disease-causing variants in other molecular clock genes, all individuals carrying BMAL1 variants surprisingly share a clinical syndrome manifest as developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder, with variably penetrant sleep disturbances, seizures, and marfanoid habitus. Variants were functionally tested in cultured cells using a Per2 -promoter driven luciferase reporter and revealed both loss-of-function and gain-of-function changes in circadian rhythms. The tested BMAL1 variants disrupted PER2 mRNA cycling, but did not cause significant shifts in cellular localization or binding with CLOCK. Conserved variants were further tested in Drosophila , which confirmed variant-dependent effects on behavioral rhythms. Remarkably, flies expressing variant cycle , the ortholog of BMAL1 , also demonstrated deficits in short- and long-term memory, reminiscent of the highly prevalent developmental delay observed in our cohort. We suggest that ultrarare variants in the BMAL1 core clock gene contribute to a neurodevelopmental disorder.",

TMs 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 constitute the two halves of a classic LeuT-fold, and TM11 interacts with both halves at the interface. In the IAA-bound state, IAA is specifically recognized in a central pocket formed by TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8. In the presence of IAA, TM1 and TM6 undergo marked conformational changes that are critical for IAA transport. His249 stands out to be a key residue for substrate uptake and release.

          "abstract": "Granulomas play a crucial role in the pathology of tuberculosis, but the immune environment governing their formation remains largely unknown. To explore the dynamic changes in the immune microenvironment during the formation of tuberculous granulomas, we infected adult zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum and then examined uninfected and infected kidneys, as well as large and small granulomas in the kidneys. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we identified two major macrophage subpopulations in the hematopoietic tissue (kidney) of zebrafish under uninfected physiological conditions: monocyte derived and tissue-resident macrophages. Interestingly, the infection induced the emergence of epithelioid cells and a previously undescribed grna.2 + macrophage subpopulation. Depletion of grna.2 + macrophages with the nitroreductase-metronidazole ablation system resulted in shortened zebrafish survival after infection, increased bacterial load, and more granulomas, especially necrotic granulomas. Depletion of grna.2 + macrophages also produced a denser granuloma structure with fewer T cells. RNA-seq and flow cytometry analysis revealed that depletion of grna.2 + macrophages led to upregulated inflammatory signaling pathways, including tnfα and il1β , and increased macrophage lytic cell death. Similarly, in samples from tuberculosis patients, we also identified GRN-positive macrophages, which exhibit similar anti-inflammatory functions. This subset of grna.2 + macrophages present in developing granulomas can suppress excessive inflammatory responses to alleviate macrophage lytic death, reduce tissue damage, promote T cell infiltration and ultimately help control mycobacterial growth in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation provide robust biomarkers of biological age, yet the mechanistic basis and functional significance of slowing these clocks remain unclear. Progress has been limited by the lack of short-lived, genetically tractable model organisms with functional DNA methylation systems. The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis , offers a unique solution. It combines a functional DNA methylation system with a short lifespan and established tools for experimental manipulation. We previously developed an epigenetic clock in Nasonia , but whether this clock reflects plastic, environmentally driven aging processes was unknown. Here, we test this directly by experimentally inducing larval diapause, a naturally occurring developmental arrest triggered by environmental cues. Diapause extended median adult lifespan by 36% and significantly slowed the rate of epigenetic aging. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across multiple adult timepoints, we show that while adults that have passed through diapause as larvae initially emerge epigenetically older, their subsequent epigenetic aging proceeds 29% more slowly than adults that have not passed through diapause as larvae. Clock CpGs were enriched for gene ontology terms related to conserved nutrient-sensing and developmental pathways, including insulin/IGF signaling and mTOR, supporting the established mechanistic link between development and epigenetic aging. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic aging is plastic in Nasonia and can be experimentally modulated by early-life environment, establishing this animal model as a tractable system for dissecting the causal mechanisms of epigenetic aging.",

          "abstract": "The standard model of sex chromosome evolution is based on ancient XY or ZW systems. Young neo-sex chromosomes that form via the translocation of autosomal material to preexisting sex chromosomes provide materials to study early events in sex chromosome evolution. Neo-sex chromosomes are taxonomically widespread but, until recently, appeared to be rare in female-heterogametic taxa, including birds. Here, we report on the comparative evolutionary genomics of newly discovered neo-Z and neo-W sex chromosomes in two Pacific Island birds, the honeyeater species, Myzomela tristrami and M. cardinalis . Our results show that 19 to 21 Mya, ~85% of chr5 , an autosome, translocated to the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of an ancestral sex chromosome (Z or W) and rapidly recombined onto its heterolog, leaving the remainder of chr5 to segregate as a remnant autosome. A large inversion then established a nonrecombining (NR) neo-W region and a neo-PAR. The accumulation of at least seven additional inversions created interspersed blocks of ancestral and neo-W sequence, without expanding the NR region. The neo-W experienced mass invasion by endogenous retrovirus repeats, a reduced efficacy of selection, and functional degeneration. Many of our observations are consistent with predictions of the standard model, whereas others highlight idiosyncrasies of neo-sex chromosomes that arise via translocation of autosomal sequence to ancestral sex chromosomes. We speculate, in particular, that the repository of retrotransposons on the ancestral W may have been an accelerant in the evolution of neo-W structure, content, and functional degeneration.",

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on MNs whose glutamate release is weakened by knockdown of components of the MN transmitter release machinery reveals a reduction in expression of a group of genes that encode potassium channels and their positive modulators.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules.",

We undertook an electron micrographic reconstruction of the brain of the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus and compared the results with the brain of Caenorhabditis elegans , which diverged at least 100 million years ago. We revealed changes in neuronal cell death, neuronal cell position, axodendritic projection patterns, and synaptic connectivity of homologous neurons that display no obvious changes in overall neurite morphology and projection patterns. These multiscale patterns of evolutionary changes show no bias to specific brain regions or neuron types.",

Using cooperative photobiocatalysis, we developed a stereoselective three-component radical-mediated C–C coupling unknown in both organic chemistry and biochemistry. Directed evolution of repurposed pyridoxal decarboxylases enabled full fragment variability in this three-component coupling, giving rise to six classes of valuable products, many of which were inaccessible by other methods, even in a racemic fashion. This enzymatic platform integrates a range of asymmetric catalysis principles, including remote stereocenter construction, stereodivergent catalysis, kinetic resolution and parallel kinetic resolution, achieving excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol over radical intermediates. The broad substrate scope and complementary specificities of evolved enzyme variants enabled combinatorial library synthesis, affording structurally and stereochemically diverse scaffolds for medicinal chemistry.",

We capitalized on electrically driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We placed gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultraconfined geometries.",

          "abstract": "Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.",

Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 are critical for male fertility and transmission of the malaria parasite. They form a core fertilization complex, but it is unknown how they interact. We determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex showing that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14. Transgenic parasite lines with these domains removed were defective in Pfs230 gamete localization and showed reduced oocyst formation. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibited Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduced transmission and structural analyses revealed their epitopes. These Pfs230 domains were targets of naturally acquired immunity and immune sera from mRNA–lipid nanoparticle immunizations blocked parasite transmission.",

          "abstract": "Dietary shifts and corresponding morphological changes can sometimes evolve in succession, not concurrently—an evolutionary process called behavioral drive. Detecting behavioral drive in the fossil record is challenging because it is difficult to measure behaviors independently from corresponding morphologies. To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.",

The cloud-top ice-to-total frequency (ITF) quantifies the occurrence of clouds with an ice top relative to total cloud occurrence, but the factors controlling ITF are poorly understood. Using 35 years of satellite data, we show that in the Northern Hemisphere, between −15° and −30°C, dust aerosol is strongly correlated with ITF in both time and space. Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.",

          "abstract": "Extreme metabolic adaptations can elucidate genetic programs that govern mammalian metabolism. Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes. This work provides a genetic framework for harnessing hibernator adaptations to understand human metabolic control.",

To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain’s biology—the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.",

          "abstract": "Given their high sociality and close evolutionary distance to humans, monkeys are an essential animal model for unraveling the biological mechanisms underlying human social behavior and elucidating the pathogenesis of diseases exhibiting abnormal social behavior. However, behavioral analysis of naturally behaving monkeys requires manual counting of various behaviors, which has been a bottleneck due to problems in throughput and objectivity. Here, we developed a three-dimensional markerless motion capture system that used multi-view data for robust tracking of individual monkeys and accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional poses of multiple monkeys living in groups. Validation analysis in two monkey groups revealed that the system enabled the characterization of individual social dispositions and relationships through automated detection of eight basic social events. Analyses of social looking demonstrated its potential for investigating adaptive behaviors in a social group. These results suggest that this motion capture system will greatly enhance our ability to analyze primate social behavior.",

          "abstract": "Explaining the rapid evolution of human cooperation and its role in our species’ biodemographic success remains a major evolutionary puzzle. To address this challenge, we tested a social drive hypothesis, which predicts that social plasticity and social selection in human groups cause indirect genetic effects that accelerate the adaptation of fitness, promoting population growth via feedback between the environmental causes and evolutionary consequences of cooperation. Using Bayesian multilevel models to analyze fertility data from a small-scale society, we demonstrate that density- and frequency-dependent indirect genetic effects on fitness promote the evolution of cooperation among neighboring women, increasing the rate of contemporary adaptation by ~5×. Our results show how interactions between the genetic and socioecological processes shaping cooperation in reproduction can drive rapid growth and social evolution in human populations.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have revealed links between prenatal/early-life stress and elevated morbidity and risks of mortality later in life. Given the number of subsistence crises in medieval England, this study uses stable isotopic, demographic, and paleopathological data from human skeletal remains ( n  = 275) to assess associations between early-life nutritional stress and health outcomes before, during, and after the Black Death in London and rural Lincolnshire approximately 1000 to 1540 CE. Our results suggest that survivors of early-life nutritional stress were resilient with respect to causes of death in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Ultimately, however, early-life nutritional stress was associated with the presence of skeletal biomarkers of stress and elevated mortality in middle and late adulthood in the medieval period, consistent with models from developmental biology. We find that the prevalence of nutritional stress increased before the Black Death and decreased afterward. Understanding the long-term consequences of early-life nutritional stress can offer insights on the health trajectories of historical populations.",

We analyzed 4017 livestock manure metagenomes from 26 countries and constructed a comprehensive catalog of livestock ARGs and metagenome-assembled genomes. Livestock resistome is a substantial reservoir of known (2291 subtypes) and latent ARGs (3166 subtypes) and is highly connectable to human resistomes. We depicted the global pattern of livestock resistome and prevalence of clinically critical ARGs, highlighting the role of farm and human antibiotic stewardship in shaping livestock resistome. We developed a risk-assessment framework by integrating mobility potential, clinical significance, and host pathogenic relevance, and prioritized higher risk livestock ARGs, producing a predictive global map of livestock resistome risks that can help guide research and policy.",

          "abstract": "Nrf2 acts as a transcriptional master regulator to orchestrate antioxidant responses and maintain redox balance. However, the cellular pathway for translating oxidative stress signals into Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as signaling molecules in modulating Nrf2’s stability and transcriptional activity by activating the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway. When activated, CHK2 phosphorylates the autophagy adaptor protein p62 at serine-349, promoting its interaction with Keap1 and disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, thereby inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitination–dependent degradation. In addition, CHK2 directly phosphorylates Nrf2 at serine-566/serine-577, enhancing its transcriptional activity and antioxidant capacity. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant target genes, along with more severe renal tissue damage in an ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our study reveals a direct mechanism linking the DDR signaling pathway to ROS-triggered Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses, providing critical insight into cellular protection against oxidative stress–induced damage.",

          "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms involved in reconstructing the eye-to-brain connection and functional recovery following optic nerve damage remain unclear. This study revealed that HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 7 (HAUS7) is a molecule that binds to dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3), a regulator of neurotrophic factor signaling and axon regeneration. We observed a distribution pattern of HAUS7 expression, suggesting that neuronal HAUS7 is transported from the cell body to the growth cone under the control of DOCK3. In addition, phosphorylation of DOCK3 at Y562 by tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling leads to the dissociation of HAUS7, which is considered an important step for microtubule assembly. Deletion of Haus7 in mice significantly reduced microtubule formation and axon regeneration following optic nerve crush (ONC). Transcriptome analysis suggested that HAUS7 levels decrease in glaucoma and after the ONC, while retinal ganglion cells actively regenerating their axons express high levels of HAUS7. In summary, HAUS7 is a binding partner of DOCK3 necessary for axon elongation.",

          "abstract": "Metformin is the most commonly prescribed antidiabetes drug, yet its precise mechanism of action remains controversial. Previous studies have suggested that metformin acts peripherally by reducing hepatic glucose output and altering gut functions. Here, we report a neural mechanism via the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). Mice with forebrain-specific Rap1 knockout exhibited resistance to the antidiabetic effects of low-dose metformin while remaining sensitive to other antidiabetic agents. Centrally administered metformin inhibited brain Rap1 and reduced hyperglycemia. Conversely, forced activation of brain Rap1 increased glycemia and abolished the glycemic effect of metformin. Metformin activated a specific subset of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) that requires Rap1. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggest that VMH Rap1 is indispensable for the antidiabetic effects of metformin. These findings highlight the VMH Rap1 pathway as a critical mediator of metformin action.",

The prescreening tests (tier alpha and beta) show the average carbon number of the distillation cut (150° to 230°C) of upgraded fuel is 10.6, close to the value of 11.4 for average conventional jet fuel, and the specifications of properties including surface tension, viscosity, heating value, flash point, and freezing point were found to meet the standards of SAF.

This transformation exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and achieves an impressive isolated yield of up to 98% in just 1 minute under ultraviolet light. Mechanistic studies suggest that the sulfonyl group acts as a free radical leaving group, with the capability of abstracting the chlorine atom from SF 5 Cl. This radical chain propagation pathway facilitates the rapid regeneration of the sulfur pentafluoride radical, resulting in a notably high quantum yield. Moreover, this light-driven radical pentafluorosulfanylation simplifies the synthetic pathway to modify complex and bioactive molecules. In addition, the drug-modified pentafluorosulfanyl compounds exhibited promising effects in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this protocol provides a practical synthetic route to radical pentafluorosulfanylation, highlighting its potential in drug discovery.",

AuNX-PDA facilitated effective absorption of released TDAs after near-infrared II photothermal treatment and delivery of the absorbed TDAs to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of dendritic cells for cross-presentation, thereby activating CD8 + T cells for efficient tumor-specific immunity. The nanovaccine (NV) significantly inhibited irradiated primary tumors and nonirradiated distant tumors by producing robust antitumor immune responses in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer mouse models.

Leu-F irreversibly binds to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cross-kingdom glycolytic enzyme and a promising therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases. Crystal structure of the GAPDH–leu-F complex reveals the formation of a covalent bond between leu-F and the Cys 152 residue. Leu-F notably attenuated glycolysis and concurrently diminished GAPDH-mediated stabilization of activated protein kinase B (AKT). Both leu-F and the total sesterterpenoid extract of Leucosceptrum canum demonstrated notable therapeutic efficacy and safety in mouse models of psoriasis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Through multipole analysis, we demonstrate efficient polarization rotation with high transmission for different knot-particle topologies. We explore the knot-particle topologies required to achieve matched polarization rotation and derive simple design rules for the knot parameters without resorting to numerical optimization. The microscopic polarizability tensors and macroscopic susceptibilities reveal that the trefoil knot exhibits strong chiral bianisotropic behavior through its magnetoelectric coupling tensor. We implement knot-particle metasurfaces using advanced 3D printing, which realizes the full 3D geometry of the wires.

          "abstract": "Early postgermination growth is critical for the success of direct seeding in rice cultivation. However, the underlying mechanism determining postgermination growth of rice is largely unknown. Here, we report the rice OsDREB1A-OsNAC3-OsGA20ox1 transcriptional module that positively regulates the early postgermination growth through the gibberellic acid (GA) pathway. Transcription factor OsDREB1A improves postgermination growth by OsNAC3-mediated increase of GA biosynthesis. OsNAC3 can directly bind to the promoter of GA biosynthesis gene OsGA20ox1 , which consequently activates its expression and increases GA content during the early postgermination growth stage. Furthermore, the expressions of OsDREB1A and OsNAC3 are positively regulated by each other, and the cis-regulatory polymorphisms in promoters fine-tune their corresponding expressions to determine the natural variations of postgermination growth. The transferred elite haplotypes of OsNAC3 and OsDREB1A and overexpression of both genes in japonica varieties contribute postgermination growth. The application of OsDREB1A and OsNAC3 is useful for the development of rice varieties for direct seeding cultivation.",

Here, we introduce the adaptive optics rolling slit ophthalmoscope, a unique noninvasive, label-free, high-speed, cellular-resolution clinical imaging system for assessing retinal NVC in the living human eye. Using an off-axis phase contrast approach combined with camera-based confocal slit gating, our method provides large field-of-view imaging of arterial and venular walls, enabling the study of vascular dynamics with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Our findings highlight that this level of precision is essential for accurately distinguishing NVC-driven vasodilation from spontaneous fluctuations, such as vasomotion and the cardiac cycle. By bridging the gap between fundamental neurovascular research and clinical applications, this approach offers a powerful tool for neuroscience research and early disease detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative and vascular disorders.",

The device uses reversible electro-intercalation of ions to modulate the in-plane thermal conductivity of graphite film by more than 13-fold via tunable phonon scattering, enabling observable modulation of the thermal conductivity at the device level.

Among variants of this experiment, only electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) has been established to detect nuclei at interspin distances up to about 1.7 nanometers using 19 F labels. This limit is dictated by the ENDOR linewidth of 10 to 30 kilohertz, which appeared insurmountable given dipolar broadening of the detected nucleus with the nuclear spin bath. Herein, we present ENDOR experiments based on nuclear sublevel coherence spectroscopy that push the boundaries of ENDOR sensitivity and resolution by one order of magnitude. In particular, we introduce an experiment, in which the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction can be exquisitely extracted from other nuclear broadening mechanisms, thus enabling to access distance distributions. This methodology paves the way for structural studies using 19 F ENDOR in biomolecular systems. Moreover, it offers opportunities to access spin dynamics in electron-nuclear coupled spin systems.",

Despite these advances, our understanding of how Hippo signaling regulates transcription is less clear. To address this, we used live microscopy to study the nuclear behavior of the major Hippo pathway transcription effectors, YAP and TEADs. We reveal that TEADs are a major determinant of YAP DNA binding and nuclear mobility, while YAP minorly influences TEADs. YAP and TEAD1 associate with DNA for longer periods in cells with intrinsically low Hippo pathway activity and upon acute Hippo pathway perturbation. TEAD1 binds the genome on a broad range of timescales, and this is extended substantially in nuclear condensates. Last, a cancer-associated YAP fusion protein exhibits substantially different biophysical behavior than either YAP or TEAD1. Thus, we reveal that Hippo signaling regulates transcription, in part, by influencing the DNA binding times of YAP and TEADs.",

Here, we investigated wild fish shoals responding collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analyzed the collective response in reaction to bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size. Larger shoals increasingly detected predator attacks (i.e., true positives), while their response facing harmless flybys (i.e., false alarms) remained constant. Furthermore, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to simultaneously overcome two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision-making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy.

This design offers high stiffness in stable states while allowing for long-stroke transitions, making it suitable for integration with soft actuators to balance deformability and load-bearing capacity. With advantages such as high compressibility and rapid integration, these exoskeleton-enhanced arms have promising applications when mounted on unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, facilitating large-scale dexterous manipulation with the necessary load capacities.

HCeO x -D@PM comprises a platelet membrane (PM) shell for targeted delivery to injured lungs and an HCeO x core, which enables high drug loading, efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and penetration of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Initially, HCeO x -D@PM suppresses the inflammation and mitigates the adverse effects of lesions on AT2 cell by scavenging accumulated ROS. It then adaptively releases 7,8-dihydroxyflavone in response to cysteine–aspartic acid protease 3 activation, facilitating AT2 cell proliferation and notably improving survival rates in vivo, offering a promising advancement in the precise treatment of respiratory diseases.",

Although these two zones can be readily measured today, there has been limited understanding of how the mixed and transition layers evolved over the Phanerozoic since animals first began to extensively colonize the seafloor. Here, we provide a record for the depths of the sedimentary mixed and transition layers through the Phanerozoic.

The resulting expanded depth and spatial resolution of PPIs charted compartment-specific assemblies of protein complexes throughout infection. We find that a broader suite of host chaperones than previously anticipated exhibits nuclear recruitment to form condensates known as virus-induced chaperone-enriched (VICE) domains. Monitoring protein and RNA constituents and ribosome activity, we establish that VICE domains sequester ribosome biogenesis factors from ribosomal RNA, accompanying a cell-wide defect in ribosome supply.

Consequently, their time-of-day–dependent response to vesicular stomatitis virus was dysregulated, and the diurnal development of CD8 + T cells into variegated populations of memory/effectors was altered in the absence of ADRB2 signaling. The diurnal fluctuations in T cell phenotypes were a distinct developmental process, independent of migration kinetics within the spleen. Thus, Adrb2 directly entrains core clock gene oscillation and regulates T cell developmental responses to virus infection as a function of time of day of pathogen exposure.",

For the clinically approved drug combination, we found a sequential administration regimen leading to a substantial reduction in the total drug dose, in comparison with concurrent drug supply, both at comparable drug efficacy. For the drugs that are currently under clinical development, we found a synergistic effect of concurrently administered drugs and showed that the synergy diminishes for the sequential drug supply.

          "abstract": "Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can also be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and nonionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.",

This study presents an innovative thermoresponsive, metal-free carbon nanodot (CD) hydrogel, termed F-CD hydrogel, which exhibits potent neutralization capabilities against multiple free radicals, including OH·, O 2 − ·, and ·DPPH. This hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic capacity, effectively relieving DED symptoms by eliminating ROS at their source. Furthermore, its thermosensitive characteristics enhance the adherence of CDs to the ocular surface. In mouse models of DED, the F-CD hydrogel accelerates epithelial repair, thickens the corneal epithelium, promotes tear secretion, and boosts goblet cell count by up-regulating protective genes while suppressing those promoting apoptosis and oxidative stress. Coupled with its excellent biocompatibility and reduced administration frequency and treatment duration, the F-CD hydrogel emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DED.",

Despite regional variation in geography, habitat, and species composition, a consistent pattern emerges: Biodiversity loss predominantly stems from declines in the most abundant bird species, whereas less abundant species show increases. We demonstrate that species once abundant and near their carrying capacity have declined, while less abundant species farther from their carrying capacity have increased. A path analysis identifies the key role played by anthropogenic land-use changes in causing the observed declines.

While most of the world’s dry/wet areas continue to get drier/wetter, dry areas are now drying faster than wet areas are wetting. Changes in TWS are driven by high-latitude water losses, intense Central American/European droughts, and groundwater depletion, which accounts for 68% of TWS loss over non-glaciated continental regions. “Continental drying” is having profound global impacts. Since 2002, 75% of the population lives in 101 countries that have been losing freshwater water. Furthermore, the continents now contribute more freshwater to sea level rise than the ice sheets, and drying regions now contribute more than land glaciers and ice caps.

We found that PCYOX1L is a secreted protein that promotes ASIC1a assembly. PCYOX1L was indispensable for ASIC1a expression in the plasma membrane and synaptosomes, and the genetic deletion of PCYOX1L severely impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. Endocytosed PCYOX1L promoted plasma membrane expression of ASIC1a, and PCYOX1L secreted from astrocytes induced ASIC1a activity in neurons.

The overall architecture of the complex remains undefined because several subunits contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Here, we combined structural and functional approaches to establish PELP1 as the central scaffold of the rixosome upon which the enzymatic subunits modularly assemble. The C-terminal half of PELP1 is composed of a proline-rich IDR that mediates association with the AAA-ATPase MDN1, histones, and the SUMO-specific protease SENP3. The PELP1 IDR contains a glutamic acid–rich region that we establish can chaperone the histone octamer in vitro. Last, the x-ray structure of a small linear motif (SLiM) from the PELP IDR bound to SENP3 reveals how PELP1 allosterically activates SUMO protease activity.

We validate this principle with three distinct oxides: garnet Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.5 O 12 , perovskite BaCo 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 3 , and pyrochlore Gd 1.5 La 0.5 Zr 2 O 7 . This structural templating approach enables synthesis along predesigned pathways, forming intermediates that are thermodynamically favored for prior formation and kinetically preferred for the final product, resulting in precisely synthesizing high-purity target materials. This study not only represents a substantial advancement in comprehending the interplay between thermodynamics/kinetics and phase evolution in complex solid synthesis but also provides an effective strategy for guiding exploratory solid-state synthesis.",

Genome-wide retrospective assessment of the iconic migratory Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) from the Barents Sea, unraveled varying degree of admixture with the nonmigratory coastal ecotype throughout the 20th century, and intriguingly more intensified during recent decades. These genomic changes were supported by an increased number of individuals displaying the heterozygous state of the chromosomal inversion coupled to migratory behavior in Atlantic cod. Ecological models and genome-wide scans identified that some of the observed frequency shifts, coupled to neural development, metabolic, and growth regulation, covaried with intensified fisheries, reduced generation time, and ocean warming.

We show that floorplate and hypochord cells collectively migrate posteriorly along the nascent notochord extracellular matrix as it extends posteriorly, maintaining the tripartite configuration. Fibroblast growth factor-mediated migration in a spatially graded manner causes cell stretching, which triggers Yap-dependent proliferation and controls floorplate and hypochord growth. Supported by mathematical modeling, we further suggest that their growth is fine-tuned by mechanical tethering to the notochord via cadherin 2 at the posterior end. We propose that the notochord instructs and sustains the tripartite formation via leader-follower formation control, a strategy from engineering that spatially organizes multiple agents to coordinate the growth of the midline tissues.",

However, limited by the difficulties in atomic-level fabrication and material stability, the experimental visualization of the CDW states in two-dimensional (2D) TMDs with Janus structure is still rare. Here, using surface selenization of VTe 2 , we fabricated monolayer Janus VTeSe. With scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed and characterized an unusual 13 × 13 CDW state with threefold rotational symmetry breaking. Combined with theoretical calculations, we find that this CDW state can be attributed to the magnetic-involved charge modulation in the Janus VTeSe, rather than the conventional electron-phonon coupling.

Here, we report the results of δ 15 N bulk analyses of fly larvae of three families (Diptera: Brachycera: Calliphoridae, Piophilidae, and Stratiomyidae) collected from putrefying carcasses. Putrefaction led to modest changes in the initial muscle tissue δ 15 N values that ranged from −0.6 to 7.7‰. Much greater δ 15 N values ranging from 5.4 to 43.2‰ were observed in the fly larvae associated with putrefaction.

In this study, by using high-resolution remote sensing data, we evaluated drought strategies of different ecosystem types throughout Europe by evaluating three key physiological regulation aspects (evapotranspiration, water content, and carbon regulation) based on their associated vegetation attributes. We found that different ecosystem types show divergent responses in these physiological attributes, suggesting different optimization strategies with respect to water saving versus spending, water content stabilizing versus fluctuating, and leaf conserving versus shedding strategies facing drought. These drought strategies from remote sensing provide timely ecosystem response information, facilitating earth system model predictions and aiding the protection against future droughts at large scales.",

          "abstract": "The Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica’s largest by area, may face increased instability under future warming, threatening the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Understanding its past response to climate change is critical for anticipating future sea-level rise. We present a multi-proxy reconstruction of ocean and cryosphere conditions in the Ross Sea over the past 40,000 years. Our data show that warm Circumpolar Deep Water reached the JOIDES Trough in the western Ross Sea shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum, coinciding with the retreat of an ancestral ice shelf. This oceanic warming aligns with a southward shift of both the westerly and easterly wind belts, indicating a large-scale atmospheric mechanism driving regional ocean changes. The timing and nature of these processes reveal the tight coupling between atmospheric circulation, ocean heat transport, and ice shelf dynamics. These interactions led to reduced ice shelf extent, highlighting the role of ocean-atmosphere coupling in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean during deglaciation.",

          "abstract": "The thickness of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) is typically limited to around 100 nm, which could lead to the formation of short-circuit paths that ultimately reduce the device performance. Here, we develop micrometer-scale-thick QLEDs by using extremely conductive ZnMgO as an electron transport layer. With a H 2 O-regulated doping method, the electron concentration of the ZnMgO film is greatly increased, which results not only in the ohmic injection but also in the trap-free electron transport. As a result, micrometer-scale-thick QLEDs, with thickness of more than 10 times that of standard QLEDs, are achieved. The demonstrated micrometer-thick red QLEDs not only can be directly built on various substrates such as Cu slabs, Ag nanowire–coated substrate, Al foils, and printing papers but also can exhibit a notably enhanced T 90 life span over 11,000 hours at 1000 candelas per square meter and an ultrahigh brightness of 3,941,000 candelas per square meter, which represent 5.03- and 4.36-fold improvements over those of conventional QLEDs.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the global malnutrition crisis requires precise and timely diagnostics of plant stresses to enhance the quality and yield of nutrient-rich crops, such as tomatoes. Soft wearable sensors offer a promising approach by continuously monitoring plant physiology. However, challenges remain in identifying direct physiological indicators of plant stresses, hindering the development of accurate diagnostic models for predicting symptom progression. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-powered spectral-dominant multimodal soft wearable system (MapS-Wear) for precise, long-term, and early-stage diagnosis of stresses in tomatoes. MapS-Wear continuously tracks leaf surrounding temperature, humidity, and unique in-situ transmission spectra, which are critical stress-related indicators. The machine learning framework processes these multimodal data to predict gradual stress progression and diagnose nutrient deficiencies in plants over 10 days earlier than conventional computer vision methods. Moreover, MapS-Wears enables portable and large-scale screening of grafted tomato varieties in greenhouses, accelerating the identification of compatible grafting combinations. This demonstration highlights the potential for high-throughput plant phenotyping and yield improvement.",

          "abstract": "Ochre, an iron-rich pigment, is widely associated with symbolic communication, but its functional applications in the Middle Stone Age (MSA) remain poorly understood. Experimental and ethnographic evidence suggests ochre being useful for hide tanning, hafting adhesives, and skin protection, although direct archeological evidence is scarce. We address this gap by presenting ochre tools from Blombos Cave, South Africa, found in Still Bay to pre–Still Bay layers dated 90 to 70,000 years ago. Seven ochre pieces were deliberately modified into lithic retouchers, showing clear use-wear patterns and evidence of intentional shaping. Targeted experiments confirm that some were used for pressure flaking and were rejuvenated to maintain function. These findings provide direct evidence of ochre being used to retouch lithic artifacts during the MSA, highlighting its role in technological systems of this period. The results emphasize the multifunctionality of ochre and suggest that such curated tools may have held personal, cultural, or technological significance within early modern human communities.",

Although most of New Orleans is generally stable, rapid elevation loss occurs in parts of the city (up to −20 millimeters per year) and on flood protection walls constructed following Hurricane Katrina (up to −28 millimeters per year). This work provides unprecedented spatial coverage of land motion rates in GNO, including wetlands and the flood protection system previously lacking data, which allows a more detailed examination of ground deformation patterns and insight into underlying drivers. In the broader context, this work shows the potential of InSAR for measuring localized land motion in New Orleans and similar communities, particularly where the presence of wetlands complicates its application.",

Decreased NMNAT1 expression and activity were observed in the liver of patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis and either liver or primary hepatocytes from ALD mice. F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7)–regulated interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) ubiquitination degradation contributed to the alcohol-inhibited NMNAT1 transcriptional level. Hepatic NMNAT1 knockout aggravated alcohol-induced hepatic NAD + decline and further hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Metabolomics and transcriptomics interaction revealed that the cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD)–regulated taurine pathway was involved in NMNAT1-disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism in ALD. Hepatic CSAD overexpression or taurine supply attenuated hepatic NMNAT1 knockout–aggravated ALD. Hepatic NMNAT1 loss inhibited NMN-protected ALD. Replenishing hepatic NMNAT1 reversed liver lipid accumulation in ALD mice. These findings identified NMNAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for ALD.",

A total of 335 genomes from 15 locations revealed a single well-supported phylogenetic split among species, with a large share of the radiation unresolved. The polytomic nature of the hamlet radiation is extreme compared to other recent radiations such as Lake Victoria cichlids. At the gene-tree level, we identified just one genomic region, centered around the casz1 transcription factor, with a topology that reflects species differences.

Regulatory elements were associated with their putative target genes by linkage analysis, and this was complemented and verified experimentally using promoter capture Hi-C. We identified the transcription factor motifs enriched in these regulatory elements along with their occupancy, pinpointing LHX9/EMX2 as potentially critical regulators of ovarian development. Variations in the DNA sequence of these regulatory elements are likely to be responsible for many of the unexplained cases of individuals with differences of sex development.",

Our analysis highlights how solar adoption in one region affects CO 2 emissions in neighboring regions, emphasizing the potential for collaborative efforts. We estimate that a 15% increase in solar generation is associated with an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons (MMT) of CO 2 emissions, contributing 12.38% toward the yearly target of 69 MMT CO 2 reductions needed to cut 1380 MMT of CO 2 in 20 years, as per the Environmental Protection Agency rule on fossil fuel power plants.

In this study, we examine how diurnal T /RH hysteresis modulates VPD across different climates using observational data alongside high-resolution reanalysis and simulations. Here, we find that regions exhibiting strong diurnal T /RH hysteresis, especially in some waterside and montane regions, experience earlier daily VPD peaks. We also demonstrate that global warming weakens diurnal T /RH hysteresis, leading to amplified VPD increasing trends and greater ecosystem stress. These results highlight the need for improved representation of diurnal T /RH interactions in climate models to better predict atmospheric dryness and its impacts on land-atmosphere feedbacks, ecosystems, and regional water cycles.",

The vicious cycle between the inflammatory microenvironment (inflamed soil) and dysfunctional chondrocytes (degeneration-related seeds) drives the chronic progressive deterioration of OA. Here, we report a genetically engineered chondrocyte-mimetic nanoplatform (termed HKL-GECM@MPNPs) comprising a honokiol (HKL)–loaded mitochondrion-targeting nanoparticle core coated with an interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1R2)–overexpressing chondrocyte membrane. HKL-GECM@MPNPs fuse with OA chondrocytes, transferring IL-1R2 onto the plasma membrane and reprogramming the inflamed microenvironment through IL-1β blockade. Mitochondrion-targeting cores then directly deliver HKL to restore mitochondrial sirtuin-3 in OA chondrocytes, reprogramming the cells’ pathological phenotype. Intra-articular injection of HKL-GECM@MPNPs in OA mice reduces inflammation, alleviates joint pain, and mitigates cartilage damage through a synergistic effect. Moreover, HKL-GECM@MPNPs effectively reverse cartilage degeneration in human OA cartilage explants. This approach highlights the potential of HKL-GECM@MPNPs to combine IL-1β blockade and mitochondrial sirtuin-3 restoration as a promising strategy for OA treatment.",

Activated with N -iodosuccinimide (NIS)/trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf), PPAP donors support both O- and N-glycosylation across a broad range of substrates. Guided by density functional theory calculations, their design allows straightforward synthesis through a simple amide coupling reaction, facilitating diverse latent-active transformations and broadening their strategic utility. Furthermore, the distinct reactivity profile of PPAP donors—marked by a clear gap relative to other known donors and orthogonality to many standard activation methods—makes them well suited for modular, one-pot glycosylation strategies.

Our results show that the H─Au bonding can be described as a process wherein H─Au interactions compensate for relatively weaker Au─Au bonding driven by intrinsic aurophilic interactions. This phenomenon originates from parity-forbidden coupling of superatomic molecular orbitals under a noncentrosymmetric field, giving rise to the atypical H─Au bonding and a formally neutral interstitial H atom. A detailed analysis of optical properties reveals partial suppression of visible-light absorption and emergence of a more favorable phosphorescent channel, a manifestation of the complex nature of this H─Au bonding.

          "abstract": "Microfluidic fabrication technologies are increasingly used to produce functional anisotropic microstructures for broad applications. However, the limited flow manipulation methods hinder the production of intricate microstructure morphologies. In this work, we introduce CeyeHao, an artificial intelligence–driven flow programming methodology for designing microchannels to perform unprecedented flow manipulations. In CeyeHao, microchannels containing hierarchically assembled obstacles are constructed, offering more than double flow transformation modes and immense configurability compared to state-of-the-art methods. An AI model, CEyeNet, predicts the transformed flow profiles, reducing computation time by up to 2700 folds and achieving up to 97 and 90% accuracy with simulated and experiment results. CeyeHao facilitates microchannel design in both human-guided and automatic modes, enabling creation of flow morphologies with highly regulated geometries and elaborate artistic patterns, along with precise topology manipulation of multiple streams. The superior flow manipulation capability of CeyeHao can facilitate broad applications from complex microstructure fabrication to precise reaction control.",

However, uncontrolled and nonplanar morphological evolution and parasitic reactions at the metal anodes are fundamental barriers to realizing full reversibility. Here, using aqueous electrochemistry as a probe, we develop multiscale characterization tools that can precisely determine the root cause of these morphological instabilities and parasitic reactions. Our analysis indicates that these issues are fundamentally from the free water molecules in aqueous electrolytes, leading to low reversibility of metal anodes. We therefore demonstrate a straightforward and effective strategy, based on modulating the solute anions in aqueous electrolytes, to suppress free water molecule concentration in conventional aqueous electrolytes. A proof of concept is demonstrated using a Zn metal anode, which shows unprecedented reversibility and stability in conventional aqueous electrolytes with structure-making anions under a harsh condition of 10 milliampere hours per square centimeter. This work unlocks an alternative angle to develop sustainable electrolytes for cost-efficient, practical battery chemistries.",

However, the molecular connections between ABA and light to control cell elongation are poorly understood. Here, we show that, in Arabidopsis, ABA inhibits hypocotyl elongation in the light but not in the dark. In the dark, hypocotyl sensitivity to ABA is restored in pifq and cop1-4 mutants, suggesting that an active light signaling pathway is necessary for hypocotyl responsiveness to ABA. Through an RNA sequencing subtractive approach, we identified ABA differentially expressed genes that correlate with ABA inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, including several SAUR genes. The abrogation of PP2C.D2-SAUR interaction in the pp2c.d2 / PP2C.D2 M331K -GFP line restored ABA sensitivity in the dark, suggesting that SAUR proteins are key to maintain hypocotyls insensitive to ABA. This hypocotyl-specific mechanism enables growth toward the light, overriding ABA inhibition of cell elongation, ensuring subsequent seedling establishment and survival.",

Although seismic evidence for a BMO exists on present-day Mars and the Moon, the Earth’s BMO is (near-)completely solidified. Seismically observed “large low-velocity provinces” (LLVPs) are thought to have resulted from the canonical “fractional” style of BMO crystallization. However, we show using thermodynamic modeling that BMO fractional crystallization yields lowermost-mantle densities much higher than those of LLVPs. In turn, pollution of the BMO by progressive addition of recycled basaltic crust and related “reactive crystallization” can reconcile LLVP volumes, densities, and compositions. This model also makes testable predictions of the compositions of “ultralow-velocity zones,” enigmatic deep Earth seismic domains, and possible BMO remnants. The critical role of crustal pollution elucidates the survival of a BMO on Mars, but implies an Earth-like fate for any Venusian BMO.",

Histone variants also play key roles in various pathological processes including malignancies.

The multifunctionality of histone variants is regulated by their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). However, the PTMs of H2A.B and their functional implications are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Amino terminus of H2A.B serves as a central hub for a diverse range of gene regulatory protein-protein interactions, orchestrated by phosphorylation and arginine methylation. This includes a mechanism whereby non–chromatin-bound H2A.B associates with SWI/SNF, which limits its access to the genome.

Using data on emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006 to 2017, we find distinct differences in the temperature-response functions of these health outcomes, influenced by age distribution and underlying causes of morbidity and mortality. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: We project that while future warming will increase ED visits, mortality will decrease due to fewer cold extremes. These results underscore the need to quantify temperature-morbidity responses to fully understand and anticipate the health impacts of climate change and suggest that local declines in mortality due to warming can mask economically meaningful increases in temperature-driven morbidity and health care utilization.",

However, changes in neuronal activity, including the saturation of synaptic strength by the positive-feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity, could deteriorate the encoded memory. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to contribute to the stability of the encoded memory by maintaining the relative differences in synaptic strength against persistent destabilizing changes in neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear how and when these two types of plasticity work together in the context of memory. Here, we have demonstrated that LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, drives homeostatic resetting several hours after LTP by down-regulating AMPA-receptor trafficking via the Golgi apparatus. LARGE deficiency impairs long-term memory formation in mice.

The magnetic hydrogels are facilely prepared by mixing neodymium-iron-boron particles with an aqueous poly(acrylic acid– co –acrylamide) solution, which spontaneously forms supramolecular network with carboxylic–ferric ion coordinates as physical cross-links. This network enables dynamic control of viscoelasticity by localized laser heating, which reduces the pinning force of gel matrix and allows for reorientation of magnetic particles under a modest magnetic field.

This species is polymorphic with left- or right-headed morphs, each specialized for scraping scales from the opposite side of their prey. This polymorphism is stably maintained around a 50:50 ratio and is likely driven by negative frequency–dependent selection, a classic form of balancing selection. Using a genome-wide dataset, including a de novo haplotype-resolved reference genome, whole-genome sequences, and microcomputed tomography scans of 102 individuals, we identified 72 genetic loci linked to head asymmetry. Nearby genes are enriched for roles in symmetry establishment, facial morphology, and nervous system function, with evidence suggesting that balancing selection maintains this diversity.

Glia-to-neuron trans-differentiation by viral vector–mediated GFAP mini-promoter–driven NeuroD1 remains hotly debated. Developing inducible, lineage-traceable transgenic mice, we find that astrocyte-to-neuron conversion is restricted to a specific time window within the lesion core of injured spinal cord and brain. Spatiotemporal lineage-mapping combined with single-cell transcriptomics reveals that ectopic NeuroD1 induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion specifically in lesion cores via transit-amplifying OLIG2 + progenitors during early injury phase, but not in late phases or in nonreactive astrocytes. Neither a loss-of-function NeuroD1 mutant nor stemness-reprogramming factor SOX2 induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion. However, contrary to previous reports, the neuronal-like cells generated by NeuroD1 lack mature neuroelectrical properties, limiting their functional integration into neural circuits. Together, our findings establish a spatiotemporal framework for NeuroD1-driven glia-to-neuron conversion, revealing a mechanistic shift from direct astrocyte conversion toward transit-amplifying intermediates and highlighting the functional immaturity of NeuroD1-converted neurons.",

Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs but, instead, produces categorical representation of rhythms. These neural rhythm categories arise automatically, independent of any motor- or timing-related tasks, yet exhibit strong similarity with categorization observed in overt behavior.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) initially form a gradient to pattern the dorsal domains of the Drosophila embryo. Here, we show that the BMP homolog decapentaplegic (DPP) endows dorsal domains with specific mechanical programs to organize morphogenesis. These domains self-organize using high local DPP activities, a process we call automorphy. Automorphy is key to inducing specific morphological changes while being faithful to the initial positional information. The BMP morphogen therefore uses a series of automorphic events to translate each position into physical potentials that later produce a contractile amnioserosa and a dorsal epidermis displaying plasticity. Plasticity allows cell elongation in wild-type embryos, and perturbations of cellular patterns reveal its crucial role in adapting to mechanical constraints. We propose that gradient formation and automorphy constitute complementary processes that allow BMPs to act as a morphogen in the Drosophila embryo.",

The 2D perovskite induces structural fragmentation in 3D perovskites, facilitating plastic relaxation of tensile strain. By isolating extrinsic crystalline phase interference and exciton-related optical disturbances, we observe that 3D perovskites retain high crystallinity only with moderate tensile strain relaxation. This moderate relaxation enhances optoelectronic properties in 3D perovskites, including broadened band-to-band absorption and prolonged charge carrier lifetime, markedly contributing to an increase in the maximum attainable power conversion efficiency in photovoltaic devices.

Here, we report a theoretical framework that enables control over energy flux direction. On the basis of this framework, we conducted experiments and direct numerical simulations, producing a 2D turbulence with forward energy flux, contrary to classical expectations. Beyond theory, we discuss how our theoretical framework can have profound applications and implications in natural and engineered systems across length scale ranges from 10 −3 to 10 6 meters, including enhanced mixing of microfluidic devices, biologically generated turbulence, breaking persistent coastal transport barriers, and ocean energy budget.",

          "abstract": "Expression of brachyury in the notochord is regarded as a chordate novelty and links to the origin of the notochord, yet the evolution of this regulatory control remains unclear. Here, we uncovered a regulatory syntax (named SFZE) consisting of binding sites for four transcription factors in notochord enhancers of chordate brachyury genes. SFZE was also identified in potential brachyury enhancers in various non-chordate animals and even in Capsaspora , a unicellular relative to animals. These non-chordate SFZE-containing enhancers exhibited activity in the zebrafish notochord. Furthermore, the SFZE syntax in a non-chordate confers endoderm activity. Our results indicate the ancient association of SFZE with brachyury , likely predating the origin of animals. The emergence of notochordal brachyury expression could be attributed to co-option of upstream signals acting on the conserved SFZE syntax, which facilitates the origin of the notochord from rudimentary endodermal cells.",

          "abstract": "Photoreceptors signal ON and OFF pathways via a synapse with bipolar cells that are transmitted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) for luminance and contrast detection. Retinal neurons metabolize glucose whose transport is mediated by photoreceptor contact with the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Rod loss in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) reduces RPE contact, diminishing glucose transport. We show diminished glucose leads to light hyperresponsiveness driven by deregulated ON cone bipolar signaling. Transmission of this constitutive signal to RGCs causes ON &gt; OFF signaling imbalance and failure to detect luminance and contrast changes. Our results suggest that the aspartate-malate shuttle in GABAergic amacrine cells metabolizes glucose to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which in turn regulates the ON cone bipolar signal. GABA A receptor agonists such as Ativan are a widely prescribed first-line therapy for seizures initiated by low brain GABA, and we show that Ativan restores ON cone bipolar cell regulation in RP where retinal GABA is diminished, reestablishing luminance and contrast detection.",

To address these issues, we developed and locally manufactured the AVX/COVID-12 vaccine using a cost-effective Newcastle disease virus LaSota platform to express a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (HexaPro-S). We evaluated the AVX/COVID-12 vaccine in a phase 2/3 parallel-group, double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trial with 4056 volunteers, demonstrating its safety, good tolerability, and ability to induce neutralizing antibodies against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 variants. It also stimulated interferon-γ–producing CD8 + T cells and met the World Health Organization’s noninferiority criteria compared to AZ/ChAdOx-1-S. No vaccinated participants experienced severe disease, hospitalization, or death. These findings support the use of AVX/COVID-12 as a booster to help achieve and maintain population immunity while addressing global inequities in vaccine distribution, and it has been approved for adult booster use in Mexico.",

          "abstract": "The discrete events of our narrative experience are organized by the neural substrate that underlies episodic memory. This narrative process is segmented into distinct units by event boundaries, which facilitate a replay process that acts to consolidate each event into a narrative memory. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may synchronize neural activity during these processes. We use intracranial recordings from participants viewing and freely recalling a continuous, audiovisual stimulus. We find that hippocampal HFOs increase following event boundaries and hippocampal-cortical coincident HFOs (co-HFOs) occur in cortical regions that underlie event segmentation (inferior parietal, precuneus, lateral occipital, and inferior frontal cortices). Event-specific co-HFO patterns that occur during event viewing reoccur following event boundaries for the subsequent three events and during recall. This is consistent with models that support replay as a mechanism for memory consolidation. Therefore, HFOs may coordinate activity across brain regions that facilitate event segmentation, encode memory of discrete events, and bind representations to assemble memory of a coherent, continuous experience.",

We identify 11 cis and 10 trans V-gene associations, primarily to the MHC, that meet genome-wide significance. TCR clones containing HLA associated V-genes were less stable across treatment, while, at the single-cell level, genetically associated clones demonstrate subset enrichment and increased tumor reactivity expression profiles. Notably, patients with HLA-matched TCR clones demonstrate improved overall survival. Our work indicates a complex relationship between genotype and TCR repertoire in the context of ICB treatment, with implications for understanding factors relating to therapeutic response and patient outcomes.",

However, the mechanisms underlying cellular adaptation of m 6 A modification and their impact on protein synthesis machinery remain unclear. VIRMA, the largest and evolutionarily conserved core of the m 6 A methyltransferase complex, is highly expressed in the embryonic brain and various cancers. Here, we demonstrate that VIRMA-mediated m 6 A modification is essential for active ribosome biogenesis. VIRMA depletion destabilizes the entire writer complex and reduces m 6 A levels, leading to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of neural progenitor/stem cells, ultimately causing severe forebrain developmental defects. Mechanistically, VIRMA depletion impairs ribosome biogenesis by inhibiting mRNA decay, triggering a p53-dependent stress response and compromising global protein synthesis. These findings extend to some cancer cells, suggesting a potential conservation of this mechanism. Overall, our study reveals the critical role of m 6 A in adapting protein synthesis machinery during brain development.",

In this work, we demonstrate that even the simplest cell-like structures are capable of chemotactic navigation. By encapsulating enzymes within lipid vesicles that incorporate a minimal number of membrane pores, we reveal that a solitary vesicle can actively propel itself toward an enzyme substrate gradient. Specifically, vesicles loaded with either glucose oxidase or urease and embedded with corresponding transmembrane proteins were tracked within a microfluidic device under a controlled substrate gradient. Our findings establish that a system comprising only an encapsulated enzyme and a single transmembrane pore is sufficient to initiate chemotaxis. This proof-of-concept model underscores the minimalistic yet powerful nature of cellular navigation mechanisms, providing a previously unknown perspective on the origins and evolution of chemotactic behavior in biological systems.",

Here, we combine multiple datasets and ecosystem modeling to identify the presence of straddling stocks worldwide and consider the management implications of climate change–driven shifts. We identify 347 straddling stocks across 67 species, including both highly migratory and less mobile species. Our results suggest that regardless of the climate change scenario, at least 37% and 54% of stocks are projected to shift between EEZs and the high seas, by 2030 and 2050, respectively. More stocks are expected to shift toward the high seas, and highly migratory stocks are projected to shift across Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Coastal states and RFMOs require to revise governance frameworks to support sustainable and equitable adaptation to shifting stocks. Developing such strategies requires cooperation between management bodies within EEZs and the high seas.",

          "abstract": "When does industrial policy succeed and fail in advanced economies? Most approaches to these questions concentrate on policy design and state power. Instead, we draw attention to the historical legacies, industrial structures, and institutional arrangements that shape industrial policy outcomes. We use insights from historical institutionalism and international business to develop a relational argument based on two first-order conditions: a critical mass of firms with sufficient capabilities to leverage the resources resulting from industrial policy, and the alignment between industrial policy goals and national institutional systems. Industrial policy could succeed, given the important second-order conditions that many have examined, when one of these conditions is present and public intervention produces the other. But industrial policy is certain to fail when both conditions are absent. Using a most different systems design, we assess our framework through short case-studies of industrial policy success and failure in Europe in the past 6 decades.",

          "abstract": "Recently, workers’ bargaining power has been declining worldwide, and immigrant-native wage inequalities have been widening. In this context, cross-sectional studies show narrower immigrant–native wage gaps in firms with works councils or collective agreements. Yet, it remains unclear whether this correlation is causal. Leveraging German longitudinal linked employer–employee data covering 542 firms and 878,403 employee observations, we investigate whether collective agreements and works councils narrow within-firm immigrant–native wage gaps especially for disadvantaged immigrant groups, that is, immigrants from non-Western countries. Using firm-fixed effects with double-demeaned interaction effects, we find no evidence that works councils narrow immigrant–native wage gaps. However, collective agreements narrow immigrant–native wage gaps for immigrants from non-Western countries by 62.0 per cent but do not affect immigrants from Western countries. Overall, our results indicate that immigrant–native wage inequalities for disadvantaged immigrant groups in Germany would not have widened by 23.6 per cent if collective agreements remained as prevalent as in 1996.",
