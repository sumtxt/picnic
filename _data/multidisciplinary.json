          "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori disturbs the stomach lining during long-term colonization of its human host, with sequelae including ulcers and gastric cancer 1,2 . Numerous H. pylori virulence factors have been identified, showing extensive geographic variation 1 . Here we identify a ‘Hardy’ ecospecies of H. pylori that shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and host interaction factors. Most Hardy strains have a second urease, which uses iron as a cofactor rather than nickel 3 , and two additional copies of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. Hardy strains currently have a limited distribution, including in Indigenous populations in Siberia and the Americas and in lineages that have jumped from humans to other mammals. Analysis of polymorphism data implies that Hardy and Ubiquitous coexisted in the stomachs of modern humans since before we left Africa and that both were dispersed around the world by our migrations. Our results also show that highly distinct adaptive strategies can arise and be maintained stably within bacterial populations, even in the presence of continuous genetic exchange between strains.",

          "abstract": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a fatal drug-induced skin reaction triggered by common medications and is an emerging public health issue 1–3 . Patients with TEN undergo severe and sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death. Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is no effective therapy for TEN 4–6 . Here, to systematically map molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics, which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution proteomics 7,8 . We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000 proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells. This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1 activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity. In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse models of TEN. Crucially, treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKi) was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic drivers of TEN and demonstrates the potential of targeted JAKi as a curative therapy.",

          "abstract": "Oil has long been the dominant feedstock for producing fuels and chemicals, but coal, natural gas and biomass are increasingly explored alternatives 1–3 . Their conversion first generates syngas, a mixture of CO and H 2 , which is then processed further using Fischer–Tropsch (FT) chemistry. However, although commercial FT technology for fuel production is established, using it to access valuable chemicals remains challenging. A case in point is linear α-olefins (LAOs), which are important chemical intermediates obtained by ethylene oligomerization at present 4–8 . The commercial high-temperature FT process and the FT-to-olefin process under development at present both convert syngas directly to LAOs, but also generate much CO 2 waste that leads to a low carbon utilization efficiency 9–14 . The efficiency is further compromised by substantially fewer of the converted carbon atoms ending up as valuable C 5 –C 10 LAOs than are found in the C 2 –C 4 olefins that dominate the product mixtures 9–14 . Here we show that the use of the original phase-pure χ-iron carbide can minimize these syngas conversion problems: tailored and optimized for the process of FT to LAOs, this catalyst exhibits an activity at 290 °C that is 1–2 orders higher than dedicated FT-to-olefin catalysts can achieve above 320 °C (refs. 12–15 ), is stable for 200 h, and produces desired C 2 –C 10 LAOs and unwanted CO 2 with carbon-based selectivities of 51% and 9% under industrially relevant conditions. This higher catalytic performance, persisting over a wide temperature range (250–320 °C), demonstrates the potential of the system for developing a practically relevant technology.",

          "abstract": "As incarceration rates rise globally, the need to reduce re-offending grows increasingly urgent. We investigate whether positive group bonds can improve behaviours among incarcerated people via a unique soccer-based prison intervention, the Twinning Project. We analyse effects of participation compared to a control group (study 1, n = 676, n = 1,874 control cases) and longitudinal patterns of social cohesion underlying these effects (study 2, n = 388) in the United Kingdom. We also explore desistance from crime after release (study 3, n = 249) in the United Kingdom and the United States. As law-abiding behaviour also requires a supportive receiving community, we assessed factors influencing willingness to employ formerly incarcerated people in online samples in the United Kingdom and the United States (studies 4–9, n = 1,797). Results indicate that social bonding relates to both improved behaviour within prison and increased willingness of receiving communities to support re-integration efforts. Harnessing the power of group identities both within prison and receiving communities can help to address the global incarceration crisis.",

          "abstract": "Effective health promotion may benefit from understanding how persuasion emerges. While earlier research has identified brain regions implicated in persuasion, these studies often relied on event-related analyses and frequently simplified persuasive communications. The present study investigates the neural basis of valuation change induced by a persuasive healthy eating call, employing naturalistic stimuli. Fifty healthy participants performed two blocks of a bidding task, in which they had to bid on sugar-containing, sugar-free, and nonedible products during functional MRI. In between the two blocks, they listened to a persuasive healthy eating call that influenced their bidding behavior. Intriguingly, participants who resisted persuasion exhibited increased synchronization of brain activity during listening in several regions, including default mode network structures. Additionally, intersubject functional connectivity among these brain regions was found to be weaker in persuaded individuals. These results emphasize the individualized nature of processing persuasive messages, challenging conventional interpretations of synchronized neural activity. Our findings support the emerging practice of tailoring persuasive messages in health promotion campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Based on current research, it is evident that the way people see themselves is shaped by their conversation partners. Historically, this literature focuses on how one individual’s expectations can shape another person’s self-views. Given the reciprocal nature of conversation, we wondered whether conversation partners’ self-views may mutually evolve. Using four-person round-robin conversation networks, we found that participants tended to have more similar self-views post-conversation than pre-conversation, an effect we term “inter-self alignment.” Further, the more two partners’ self-views aligned, the more they enjoyed their conversation and were inclined to interact again. This effect depended on both conversation partners becoming aligned. These findings suggest that the way we see ourselves is coauthored in the act of dialogue and that as shared self-views develop, the desire to continue the conversation increases.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is a major public health crisis in the United States (US) affecting 42% of the population, exacerbating a spectrum of other diseases and contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality overall. Recent advances in pharmaceutical interventions, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide) and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., tirzepatide), have shown remarkable efficacy in weight-loss. However, limited access to these medications due to high costs and insurance coverage issues restricts their utility in mitigating the obesity epidemic. We quantify the annual mortality burden directly attributable to limited access to these medications in the US. By integrating hazard ratios of mortality across body mass index categories with current obesity prevalence data, combined with healthcare access, willingness to take the medication, and observed adherence to and efficacy of the medications, we estimate the impact of making these medications accessible to all those eligible. Specifically, we project that with expanded access, over 42,000 deaths could be averted annually, including more than 11,000 deaths among people with type 2 diabetes. These findings underscore the urgent need to address barriers to access and highlight the transformative public health impact that could be achieved by expanding access to these novel treatments.",

          "abstract": "We propose that experiencing a lack of personal control will increase people’s preferences for self-similar others and that this effect would be explained by a greater need for structure. Our hypotheses received support across 11 longitudinal, experimental, and archival studies composed of data from 60 countries (5 preregistered studies, N = 90,216). In an analysis of cross-country archival data, we found that respondents who indicated a lower sense of personal control were less likely to prefer to live with neighbors who had a different religion, race, or spoke a different language (Study 1). Study 2 found that participants who perceived lower (vs. higher) personal control indicated greater liking for coworkers who they perceived to be more self-similar across a wide range of characteristics (e.g., gender, personality). Studies 3a and 3b, two live-interaction experiments conducted in the United States and China, provided additional causal evidence for control-motivated similarity attraction. A causal experimental chain (Studies 4a to 4c) and a manipulation-of-mediation-as-a-moderator study (Study 5) provided evidence for the mediating effects of the need for structure. Study 6, a longitudinal study with Chinese employees, found that workers who reported perceiving a lower (vs. higher) sense of personal control preferred more self-similar coworkers, and this effect was mediated by a greater desire for structure. Finally, exploring downstream consequences, Studies 7a and 7b found that control-motivated similarity attraction was associated with a greater preference for homogenous (vs. diverse) groups. These findings highlight how the fundamental motive for personal control shapes the structure of social life.",

          "abstract": "Lockdowns were implemented to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. However, it is unclear how severely curtailed physical interaction shapes individual behaviors that are considered vital for socioeconomic development. In this exploratory study, we investigate the behavior of college students who experienced a strict campus-wide lockdown and those who did not. Employing a combination of experimental and survey methodologies, we elicit students’ behavioral variables, which are then integrated with administrative records from the university. We find that those exposed to the lockdown were more likely to trust others and be honest; however, their creativity was lower. Exposure to the lockdown was not found to significantly affect students’ trustworthiness, risk preferences, or competitiveness. A follow-up study reveals that the lower creativity among students may be attributed to reduced communication frequency with friends during the lockdown, mediating the lockdown’s impact. Conversely, the effects of the lockdown on trust and honesty may operate through a direct pathway, independent of changes in daily activities during the lockdown. Further analysis reveals a gender-dependent trend, with lockdowns exerting a more pronounced influence on male students than their female counterparts. These results underscore the consequences of lockdowns and advocate for enhanced support networks, emphasizing the importance of communicating with friends in similar circumstances.",

However, there are currently limited data on real-life effectiveness of the third-dose MMR vaccine in preventing mumps. Here, we used a deterministic compartmental model to infer the effectiveness of the third-dose MMR vaccine in preventing mumps cases by analyzing the mumps outbreak that occurred at the University of Iowa between August 24, 2015, and May 13, 2016. The modeling approach further allowed us to evaluate the population-level impact of vaccination by different timing in relation to the start of the outbreak and varied coverage levels, and to account for potential sources of bias in estimating vaccine effectiveness. We found large uncertainty in vaccine effectiveness estimates; however, our models showed that early introduction of a third dose of MMR vaccine during a mumps outbreak can be effective in preventing transmission. School holidays, such as the winter break, likely played important roles in preventing mumps transmission.",

          "abstract": "Shear bands frequently appear in lattice architectures subjected to compression, leading to an unstable stress–strain curve and global deformation. This deformation mechanism reduces their energy absorption and loading-bearing capacity and causes the architectures to prioritize mechanical protection of external components at the expense of the entire structure. Here, we leverage the design freedom offered by additive manufacturing and the geometrical relation of dual-phase nanolamellar crystals to fabricate heterogeneous lamellar lattice architectures consisting of body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cells in alternating lamella. The lamellar lattice demonstrates more than 10 and 9 times higher specific energy absorption and energy absorption efficiency, respectively, compared to the BCC lattice. The drastic improvement arises as the nucleation of shear bands is inhibited by the discrete energy threshold for plastic buckling of adjacent heterogeneous lattice lamella during loading. Despite its lower density than the FCC lattice, the lamellar lattice exhibits significant enhancement in plateau stress and crushing force efficiency, attributed to the strengthening effect induced by simultaneous deformation of unit cells in the BCC lattice lamella and the resulting cushion shielding effect. The design improves the global mechanical properties, making lamellar lattices compare favorably against numerous materials proposed for mechanical protection. Additionally, it provides opportunities to program the local mechanical response, achieving programmable internal protection alongside overall external protection. This work provides a different route to design lattice architecture by combining internal and external dual mechanical protection, enabling a generation of multiple mechanical protectors in aerospace, automotive, and transportation fields.",

          "abstract": "Many human pathogens, including malaria, dengue, influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and cytomegalovirus, coexist as multiple genetically distinct strains. Understanding how these multistrain pathogens evolve is of critical importance for forecasting epidemics and predicting the consequences of vaccination. One factor believed to play an important role is naturally acquired immunity. Consequently, a large body of research has sought to predict how acquired immunity molds the genomics of pathogen populations (i.e., what shapes pathogen strain structure). The diversity of existing models has resulted in conflicting evolutionary predictions and has sparked an ongoing debate about which predictions are most broadly applicable. Here, we adopt a multilocus population genetics perspective that unifies the predictions of existing models. We identify three key factors that determine the role of naturally acquired immunity in the evolution of pathogen strain structure: i) the strength and specificity of immune protections, ii) the dynamic immunological landscape, and iii) the number of loci coding for the antigens of the pathogen. Isolating and discussing these three factors clarifies the relationship among previous models of multistrain dynamics, and establishes a solid theoretical foundation for the study of the evolutionary epidemiology of multistrain pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Lepidopterans commonly feed on plant material, being the most significant insect herbivores in nature. Despite plant resistance to herbivory, such as producing toxic secondary metabolites, herbivores have developed mechanisms encoded in their genomes to tolerate or detoxify plant defensive compounds. Recent studies also highlight the role of gut microbiota in mediating detoxification in herbivores; however, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of gut symbionts is rare in Lepidoptera. Here, we show that the growth of various lepidopteran species was inhibited by a mulberry-derived secondary metabolite, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ); as expected, the specialist silkworm Bombyx mori grew well, but interestingly, gut microbiota of early-instar silkworms was affected by the DNJ level, and several bacterial species responded positively to enriched DNJ. Among these, a bacterial strain isolated from the silkworm gut ( Pseudomonas fulva ZJU1) can degrade and utilize DNJ as the sole energy source, and after inoculation into nonspecialists (e.g., beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua ), P. fulva ZJU1 increased host resistance to DNJ and significantly promoted growth. We used genomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify genes potentially involved in DNJ degradation, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis verified the function of ilvB , a key binding protein, in metabolizing DNJ. Furthermore, the ilvB deletion mutant, exhibiting normal bacterial growth, could no longer enhance nonspecialist performance, supporting a role in DNJ degradation in vivo. Therefore, our study demonstrated causality between the gut microbiome and detoxification of plant chemical defense in Lepidoptera, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of host–microbe relationships across this complex, abundant insect group.",

          "abstract": "RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) plays a crucial role in regulating innate immunity. Lysine acylation, a widespread protein modification, influences protein function, but its impact on ALKBH5 during viral infections has not been well characterized. This study investigates the presence and regulatory mechanisms of a previously unidentified lysine acylation in ALKBH5 and its role in mediating m 6 A modifications to activate antiviral innate immune responses. We demonstrate that ALKBH5 undergoes lactylation, which is essential for an effective innate immune response against DNA herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and mpox virus (MPXV). This lactylation attenuates viral replication. Mechanistically, viral infections enhance ALKBH5 lactylation by increasing its interaction with acetyltransferase ESCO2 and decreasing its interaction with deacetyltransferase SIRT6. Lactylated ALKBH5 binds interferon-beta (IFN-β) messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to demethylation of its m 6 A modifications and promoting IFN-β mRNA biogenesis. Overexpression of ESCO2 or depletion of SIRT6 further enhances ALKBH5 lactylation to strengthen IFN-β mRNA biogenesis. Our results identify a posttranslational modification of ALKBH5 and its role in regulating antiviral innate immune responses through m 6 A modification. The finding provides an understanding of innate immunity and offers a potential therapeutic target for HSV-1, KSHV, and MPXV infections.",

          "abstract": "Ribonuclease P (RNase P) plays a vital role in the maturation of tRNA across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. However, how RNase P assembles various components to achieve specific cleavage of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) in different organisms remains elusive. In this study, we employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the dynamics of RNase P from E. coli ( Escherichia coli ) and Mja ( Methanocaldococcus jannaschii ) during pre-tRNA cleavage by incorporating five Cy3-Cy5 pairs into pre-tRNA and RNase P. Our results revealed significant differences in the assembly and catalytic mechanisms of RNase P between E. coli and Mja at both the RNA and protein levels. Specifically, the RNA of E. coli RNase P ( Eco RPR) can adopt an active conformation that is capable of binding and cleaving pre-tRNA with high specificity independently. The addition of the protein component of E. coli RNase P (RnpA) enhances and accelerates pre-tRNA cleavage efficiency by increasing and stabilizing the active conformation. In contrast, Mja RPR is unable to form the catalytically active conformation on its own, and at least four proteins are required to induce the correct folding of Mja RPR. Mutation experiments suggest that the functional deficiency of Mja RPR arises from the absence of the second structural layer, and proper intermolecular assembly is essential for Mja RNase P to be functional over a broad temperature range. We propose models to illustrate the distinct catalytic patterns and RNA–protein interactions of RNase P in these two organisms.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, exhibiting remarkable resilience despite high mitochondrial mutation rates. The nuclear compensation mechanism suggests deleterious mitochondrial alleles drive compensatory nuclear mutations to preserve mito-nuclear compatibility. However, prevalence and factors conditioning this phenomenon remain debated due to its conflicting evidence. Here, we investigate how mito-nuclear incompatibilities impact substitutions in a model for species radiation. Mating success depends on genetic compatibility (nuclear DNA) and spatial proximity. Populations evolve from partially compatible mito-nuclear states, simulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression. Mutations do not confer advantages nor disadvantages, but individual fecundity declines with increasing incompatibilities, selecting for mito-nuclear coordination. We find that selection for mito-nuclear compatibility affects each genome differently based on their initial state. In compatible gene pairs, selection reduces substitutions in both genomes, while in incompatible nuclear genes, it consistently promotes compensation, facilitated by more mismatches. Interestingly, high mitochondrial mutation rates can reduce nuclear compensation by increasing mtDNA rectification, while substitutions in initially compatible nuclear gene are boosted. Finally, the presence of incompatibilities accelerates species radiation, but equilibrium richness is not directly correlated to substitution rates, revealing the complex dynamics triggered by mitochondrial introgression and mito-nuclear coevolution. Our study provides a perspective on nuclear compensation and the role of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in speciation by exploring extreme scenarios and identifying trends that empirical data alone cannot reveal. We emphasize the challenges in detecting these dynamics and propose analyzing specific genomic signatures could shed light on this evolutionary process.",

Herein, we report the creation of seven topological isoforms (i.e., linear, cyclic, knot, lasso, pseudorotaxane, and catenane) from a single protein fold precursor by rewiring the connectivity of secondary structure elements of the SpyTag-SpyCatcher complex and mutating the reactive residue on SpyTag to abolish the isopeptide bonding. These topological isoforms can be directly expressed in cells. Their topologies were confirmed by combined techniques of proteolytic digestion, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and topological transformation. To study the effects of topology on their structures and properties, their biophysical properties were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HSQC-NMR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were further performed to reveal the atomic details of structural changes upon unfolding. Both experimental and simulation results suggest that they share a similar, well-folded hydrophobic core but exhibit distinct folding/unfolding dynamic behaviors. These results shed light onto the folding landscape of topological isoforms derived from the same protein fold. As a model system, this work improves our understanding of protein structure and dynamics beyond linear chains and suggests that protein folds are highly amenable to topological variation.",

Traditional soft adhesives are designed by maintaining a balance between their cohesive strength and compliance. However, rough surfaces can significantly affect the adhesion strength of PSAs. Lowering the stiffness of the adhesive by reducing the cross-linking density or using additives can improve contact on rough surfaces. But this also decreases the cohesive strength and affects the overall performance of the adhesive. Additive-free LCE-based adhesives are shown to overcome these challenges due to their unique properties. Soft elasticity of LCE and low cross-link density contribute to their high compliance, while moderate cross-linking provides finite strength. The effect of contact time and substrate roughness on the adhesive performance is evaluated using probe-tack, indentation, lap shear, and static loading experiments. The unique combination of properties offered by LCE can lead to the development of roughness-tolerant adhesives, thereby broadening the application scope of PSAs.",

This minimalist model gives rise to steady-state network structures with density and rearrangement timescales predicted from the junction mobility and tubule spawning rate. Several parameter-independent geometric features of the liquid network model are shown to be representative of ER architecture in live mammalian cells. The liquid network model connects the timescales of distinct dynamic features such as ring closure and new tubule growth in the ER.

          "abstract": "Dynamic changes in intracellular ultrastructure can be critical for the ability of organisms to acclimate to environmental conditions. Microalgae, which are responsible for ~50% of global photosynthesis, compartmentalize their Ribulose 1,5 Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (Rubisco) into a specialized structure known as the pyrenoid when the cells experience limiting CO 2 conditions; this compartmentalization is a component of the CO 2 Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), which facilitates photosynthetic CO 2 fixation as environmental levels of inorganic carbon (Ci) decline. Changes in the spatial distribution of mitochondria in green algae have also been observed under CO 2 limitation, although a role for this reorganization in CCM function remains unclear. We used the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to monitor changes in mitochondrial position and ultrastructure as cells transition between high CO 2 and Low/Very Low CO 2 (LC/VLC). Upon transferring cells to VLC, the mitochondria move from a central to a peripheral cell location and orient in parallel tubular arrays that extend along the cell’s apico-basal axis. We show that these ultrastructural changes correlate with CCM induction and are regulated by the CCM master regulator CIA5. The apico-basal orientation of the mitochondrial membranes, but not the movement of the mitochondrion to the cell periphery, is dependent on microtubules and the MIRO1 protein, with the latter involved in membrane–microtubule interactions. Furthermore, blocking mitochondrial respiration in VLC-acclimated cells reduces the affinity of the cells for Ci. Overall, our results suggest that mitochondrial repositioning functions in integrating cellular architecture and energetics with CCM activities and invite further exploration of how intracellular architecture can impact fitness under dynamic environmental conditions.",

          "abstract": "The conservation status of monarch butterflies in North America is a topic of intense scrutiny and debate. It is clear that winter colonies in Mexico are declining, yet some recent studies suggest that summer breeding populations are relatively stable and similar to historical abundances. One possible explanation for these discordant patterns is that fall migration success has been recently disrupted. Here, we use a relatively unexplored citizen-scientist dataset on the size of monarch “roosts,” which are resting aggregations on vegetation, to infer changes in monarch abundance along the fall migration route over the last 17 y. We found that the timing of migration remained relatively unchanged while the flyway has generally become warmer and greener. Warmer and greener conditions were associated with larger roosts, yet we found steady, dramatic declines in roost sizes through time that were independent of climate and landscape factors. Roost sizes have declined as much as 80%, with losses increasing from north to south along the migration route. These findings suggest that failure during the fall migration could explain the apparent drop in monarch numbers from summer breeding to overwintering populations. This in turn suggests that conservation efforts that support fall migration success are most needed, such as providing high quality nectar plants along the migration route or limiting the planting of nonnative milkweeds that enhance monarch parasite loads. Overall, it appears the fall migration of monarch butterflies is under imminent threat, even if the species’ overall survival is not.",

          "abstract": "Hibernation is a widespread and highly efficient mechanism to save energy in mammals. However, one major challenge of hibernation is maintaining blood circulation at low body temperatures, which strongly depends on the viscoelastic properties of red blood cells (RBCs). Here, we examined at physiologically relevant timescales the thermomechanical properties of hundreds of thousands of individual RBCs from the hibernating common noctule bat ( Nyctalus noctula ), the nonhibernating Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ), and humans ( Homo sapiens ). We exposed RBCs to temperatures encountered during normothermia and hibernation and found a significant increase in elasticity and viscosity with decreasing temperatures. Our data demonstrate that temperature adjustment of RBCs is mainly driven by membrane properties and not the cytosol while viscous dissipation in the membrane of both bat species exceeds the one in humans by a factor of 15. Finally, our results show that RBCs from both bat species reveal a transition to a more viscous-like state when temperature decreases. This process on a minute timescale has an effect size that is comparable with fluctuations in RBC viscoelasticity over the course of the year, implying that environmental factors, such as diets, have a lower impact on the capability of RBCs to respond to different temperatures than general physical properties of the cell membrane. In summary, our findings suggest membrane viscoelasticity as a promising target for identifying mechanisms that could be manipulated to ensure blood circulation at low body temperatures in humans, which may be one first step toward safe synthetic torpor in medicine and space flight.",

In addition, free radical generation is usually elevated in cells under stress as is the case for many different pathological conditions. In liver tissue, cells produce radicals when exposed to toxic substances but also, for instance, in cancer, alcoholic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. However, free radicals are small, short-lived, and occur in low abundance making them challenging to detect and especially to time resolve, leading to a lack of nanoscale information. Recently, our group has demonstrated that diamond-based quantum sensing offers a solution to measure free radical generation in single living cells. The method is based on defects in diamonds, the so-called nitrogen-vacancy centers, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. As a result, this technique reveals magnetic resonance signals by optical means offering high sensitivity. However, compared to cells, there are several challenges that we resolved here: Tissues are more fragile, have a higher background fluorescence, have less particle uptake, and do not adhere to microscopy slides. Here, we overcame those challenges and adapted the method to perform measurements in living tissues. More specifically, we used precision-cut liver slices and were able to detect free radical generation during a stress response to ethanol, as well as the reduction in the radical load after adding an antioxidant.",

The treatment dramatically increased L. kimchicus abundance in the gut microbiota and increased alpha diversity. This effect was strongest in the youngest birds, validating earlier findings pointing to a brief developmental window when the gut microbiota are most sensitive. In time-lagged models, nestling weight was higher in the treatment birds suggesting L. kimchicus may have probiotic potential. There was also a positive time-lagged relationship between diversity and weight in control birds but not in the treatment birds, suggesting L. kimchicus helped birds compensate for low alpha diversity. We discuss why ecological context is likely key when predicting impacts of the microbiome. The manipulation of the gut microbiota with a host native strain in this wild population provides direct evidence for the role of the microbiota in the ecology and evolution of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is one of the primary risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA), acting through cross talk among altered biomechanics, metabolism, adipokines, and dietary free fatty acid (FA) composition. Obesity and aging have been linked to cellular senescence in various tissues, resulting in increased local and systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction. We hypothesized that obesity and joint injury lead to cellular senescence that is typically associated with increased OA severity or with aging and that the ratio of omega-6 (ω-6) to omega-3 (ω-3) FAs regulates these pathologic effects. Mice were placed on an ω-6-rich high-fat diet or a lean control diet and underwent destabilization of the medial meniscus to induce OA. Obesity and joint injury significantly increased cellular senescence in subcutaneous and visceral fat as well as joint tissues such as synovium and cartilage. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for fat-1 , a fatty acid desaturase that converts ω-6 to ω-3 FAs, decreasing the serum ω-6:ω-3 FA ratio had a strong senomorphic and therapeutic effect, mitigating metabolic dysfunction, cellular senescence, and joint degeneration. In vitro coculture of bone marrow-derived macrophages and chondrocytes from control and AAV8- fat1- treated mice were used to examine the roles of various FA mediators in regulating chondrocyte senescence. Our results suggest that obesity and joint injury result in a premature “aging” of the joint as measured by senescence markers, and these changes can be ameliorated by altering FA composition using fat-1 gene therapy. These findings support the potential for fat-1 gene therapy to treat obesity- and/or injury-induced OA clinically.",

          "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) slows aging in many animals, while in some cases, the sensory signals from diet alone are sufficient to retard or accelerate lifespan. The digestive tract is a candidate location to sense nutrients, where neuropeptides secreted by enteroendocrine cells (EEC) produce systemic signals in response to food. Here, we measure how Drosophila neuropeptide F (NPF) is secreted into adult circulation by EEC and find that specific EEC differentially respond to dietary sugar and yeast. Female lifespan is increased when gut NPF is genetically depleted, and this manipulation is sufficient to blunt the longevity benefit conferred by DR. Depletion of NPF receptors at insulin-producing neurons of the brain also increases female lifespan, consistent with observations where loss of gut NPF decreases neuronal insulin secretion. The longevity conferred by repressing gut NPF and brain NPF receptors is reversed by treating adults with a juvenile hormone (JH) analog. JH is produced by the adult corpora allata, and inhibition of the insulin receptor at this tissue decreases JH titer and extends lifespan in both males and females, while this longevity is restored to wild type by treating adults with a JH analog. Overall, EEC of the gut modulate Drosophila aging through interorgan communication mediated by a gut–brain–corpora allata axis, and insulin produced in the brain impacts lifespan through its control of JH titer. These data suggest that we consider how human incretins and their analogs, which are used to treat obesity and diabetes, may impact aging.",

However, the role of BLNK in Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptor (CLR) signaling in macrophages remains unclear. Here, we delineate that CLRs govern the Syk-mediated activation of BLNK, thereby impeding macrophage migration by disrupting podosome ring formation upon stimulation with fungal β-glucans or α-mannans. Mechanistically, BLNK instigates its association with casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), competitively impeding the interaction between c-Cbl and Src-family kinase Fyn. This interference disrupts Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of c-Cbl and subsequent c-Cbl-associated F-actin assembly. Consequently, BLNK deficiency intensifies CLR-mediated recruitment of the c-Cbl/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex to the F-actin cytoskeleton, thereby enhancing macrophage migration. Notably, mice with monocyte-specific BLNK deficiency exhibit heightened resistance to infection with Candida albicans , a prominent human fungal pathogen. This resistance is attributed to the increased infiltration of Ly6C + macrophages into renal tissue. These findings unveil a previously unrecognized role of BLNK for the negative regulation of macrophage migration through inhibiting CLR-mediated podosome ring formation during fungal infections.",

          "abstract": "The global steady state of a system in thermal equilibrium exponentially favors configurations with lesser energy. This principle is a powerful explanation of self-organization because energy is a local property of configurations. For nonequilibrium systems, there is no such property for which an analogous principle holds, hence no common explanation of the diverse forms of self-organization they exhibit. However, a flurry of recent empirical results has shown that a local property of configurations called “rattling” predicts the steady states of some nonequilibrium systems, leading to claims of a far-reaching principle of nonequilibrium self-organization. But for which nonequilibrium systems is rattling accurate, and why? We develop a theory of rattling in terms of Markov processes that gives simple and precise answers to these key questions. Our results show that rattling predicts a broader class of nonequilibrium steady states than has been claimed and for different reasons than have been suggested. Its predictions hold to an extent determined by the relative variance of, and correlation between, the local and global “parts” of a steady state. We show how these quantities characterize the local-global relationships of various random walks on random graphs, spin-glass dynamics, and models of animal collective behavior. Surprisingly, we find that the core idea of rattling is so general as to apply to equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems alike.",

          "abstract": "The poor prognosis of relatively undifferentiated cancers has long been recognized, suggesting that selection against differentiation and in favor of uncontrolled growth is one of the most powerful drivers of cancer progression. Goblet cells provide the mucous surface of the gut, and when present in colorectal cancers (CRC), the cancers are called mucinous. We have used the presence of MUC2, the main mucous product of goblet cells, and an associated gene product, TFF3, to classify a large panel of nearly 80 CRC-derived cell lines into five categories based on their levels of MUC2 and TFF3 expression. We have then shown that these five patterns of expression can be easily identified in the direct analysis of tumor specimens allowing a much finer characterization of CRCs with respect to the presence of goblet cell differentiation. In particular, about 30% of all CRCs fall into the category of expressing TFF3 but not MUC2, which has not previously been acknowledged. Using the cell line data, we suggest that there are up to 12 genes ( MUC2, TFF3, ATOH1, SPDEF, CDX1, CDX2, GATA6, HES1, ETS2, OLFM4, TOX3, and LGR5 ) that may be involved in selection against goblet cell differentiation in CRC by changes in methylation rather than mutations. Of these, LGR5 , which is particularly associated with lack of goblet cell features, may function in the control of differentiation rather than direct control of cell growth, as has so far mostly been assumed. These results emphasize the importance of methylation changes in driving cancer progression.",

MurG redeploys to the forespore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment abrogates MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly mis-localizes SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA+ ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes specialized chaperones involved in secretion, cell envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.",

The resulting multiscale Gauss link integral (mGLI) recovers the global topological properties of knots and links at an appropriate scale and offers a multiscale geometric topology approach to capture the local structures and connectivities in data. By integration with machine learning or deep learning, the proposed mGLI significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark problems in 13 intricately complex biological datasets, including protein flexibility analysis, protein–ligand interactions, human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene potassium channel blockade screening, and quantitative toxicity assessment.

          "abstract": "The chemical compositions of island arc basalts (IAB) reflect contributions from the mantle as well as fluids and melts from the subducting slab. Addition of radiogenic seawater Sr to oceanic crust through hydrothermal alteration and subsequent subduction is often invoked to explain elevated 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures in modern IAB. However, changes in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of island arc magmatic rocks through time has not been investigated, limiting our understanding of the factors influencing the Sr budgets of arcs throughout Earth’s history. To address this, we compiled 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values from island arc magmatic rocks ranging in age from modern to Paleoproterozoic, only including data from island arc localities that best preserve initial magmatic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. Median initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are consistently elevated compared to depleted mantle 87 Sr/ 86 Sr over this period, indicating persistent enrichment in radiogenic Sr in island arcs. Moreover, the elevation in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr relative to the depleted mantle is variable. A notable rise in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr during the late Neoproterozoic coincides with a steep increase in seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Sr concentration. To investigate this potential connectivity, we modeled the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of island arc magmas between 0 and 830 Ma with inputs of depleted mantle 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and seawater Sr concentration. The model reproduces the overall trajectory of the compiled data. We interpret the observed temporal variation in island arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and its close association with fluctuations in seawater chemistry as evidence that changes in marine geochemistry have strongly influenced the Sr isotopic record of island arc magmas over time.",

Moreover, upon in situ electron doping, the surface TFBs show a splitting with exotic doping evolution, with an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the lower split band, and pinning of the upper band near the Fermi level. These experimental observations together with Hartree–Fock calculations suggest that correlation effects are important in this system.

However, the relationship between dopamine decoding and AC5 regulation is unknown. Here, we utilized an unbiased global protein stability screen to identify Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain 1 (KCTD1) as a key regulator of AC5 level that is mechanistically tied to N-linked glycosylation. We then implemented a CRISPR/SaCas9 approach to eliminate KCTD1 in striatal neurons expressing a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP biosensor. 2-photon imaging of striatal neurons in intact circuits uncovered that dopaminergic signaling was substantially compromised in the absence of KCTD1. Finally, knockdown of KCTD1 in genetically defined dorsal striatal neurons significantly altered motor behavior in mice. These results reveal that KCTD1 acts as an essential modifier of dopaminergic signaling by stabilizing striatal AC5.",

          "abstract": "Although it is well established that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds to the host cell ACE2 receptor to initiate infection, far less is known about the tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility to the virus. Differential expression across different cell types of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, with variably sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and their synergistic interactions with host and viral N-glycans may contribute to tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility. Nevertheless, their contribution remains unclear since HS and N-glycans evade experimental characterization. We, therefore, carried out microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, followed by random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations, of the fully glycosylated spike:ACE2 complex with and without highly sulfated GAG chains bound. By considering the model GAGs as surrogates for the highly sulfated HS expressed in lung cells, we identified key cell entry mechanisms of spike SARS-CoV-2. We find that HS promotes structural and energetic stabilization of the active conformation of the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and reorientation of ACE2 toward the N-terminal domain in the same spike subunit as the RBD. Spike and ACE2 N-glycans exert synergistic effects, promoting better packing, strengthening the protein:protein interaction, and prolonging the residence time of the complex. ACE2 and HS binding trigger rearrangement of the S2’ functional protease cleavage site through allosteric interdomain communication. These results thus show that HS has a multifaceted role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they provide a mechanistic basis for the development of GAG derivatives with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.",

Since bat cells do not express an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that allows virus infection, we transduced the human ACE2 (hA) receptor into the cells and found that transduced cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to human embryonic stem cells-hA, infected bat induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-hA produced about a 100-fold lower level of infectious virus and displayed lower toxicity. In contrast, bat embryonic fibroblast-hA produced no infectious virus while being infectable and synthesizing viral RNA and proteins, suggesting abortive infection. Indeed, electron microscopy failed to detect virus-like particles in infected bat fibroblasts in contrast to bat iPSCs or human cells, consistent with the latter producing infectious viruses. This suggests that bat somatic but not pluripotent cells have an effective mechanism to control virus replication.

Strikingly, we revealed that another UBR-5 physical interactor, namely the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 ortholog PABP-2, worked antagonistically to UBR-5 and LET-70. Lowering pabp-2 levels restored normal transition of cell state out of stemness and promoted normal cell fusion when either ubr-5 or let-70 UBE2D function was compromised. The UBR-5-LET-70 and PABP-2 switch works independently of the stem pool size determined by pluripotency factors like lin-28. UBR-5 limits PABP-2 protein and reverses the PABP-2-dependent gene expression program including developmental, proteostasis, and innate immunity genes. Loss of ubr-5 rescues the developmental stall when pabp-2 is compromised. Disruption of ubr-5 elevates PABP-2 levels and prolongs expression of ectodermal and muscle stem markers at the transition to adulthood. Additionally, ubr-5 mutants exhibit an extended period of motility during aging and suppress pabp-2- dependent early onset of immobility.",

          "abstract": "Tumors can induce systemic disturbances in distant organs, leading to physiological changes that enhance host morbidity. In Drosophila cancer models, tumors have been known for decades to cause hypervolemic “bloating” of the abdominal cavity. Here we use allograft and transgenic tumors to show that hosts display fluid retention associated with autonomously defective secretory capacity of fly renal tubules, which function analogous to those of the human kidney. Excretion from these organs is blocked by abnormal cells that originate from inappropriate activation of normally quiescent renal stem cells (RSCs). Blockage is initiated by IL-6-like oncokines that perturb renal water-transporting cells and trigger a damage response in RSCs that proceeds pathologically. Thus, a chronic inflammatory state produced by the tumor causes paraneoplastic fluid dysregulation by altering cellular homeostasis of host renal units.",

          "abstract": "We present a dynamic perspective to quantify the air quality–related health impacts of the electrification of light-duty vehicles in the United States between 2022 and 2050. Using a fleet turnover model and future electricity generation mix scenarios, we compare ambitious vehicle electrification to fleet renewal relying on newer internal combustion engine vehicles, without electric vehicles. The model includes vehicle-level pollutant emission factors and a reduced complexity air quality and valuation model and covers direct (tailpipe, brake wear, and tire wear) and indirect (production of electricity and liquid fuels) emissions of NO x , SO 2 , PM 2.5 , NH 3 , and VOCs, with a breakdown at the county level to identify geographical disparities in the distribution of health impacts. Short-term health benefits are mostly generated by reductions in NO x emissions from newer gasoline vehicles, while fleet electrification generates further benefits in the long term. The electricity mix plays a crucial role in the success of electrification policies. With continued grid decarbonization, electrification would reduce harmful air quality–related health impacts cumulatively by 84 to 188 billion USD over the study period, compared with fleet renewal without electric vehicles. In contrast, artificially freezing the 2022 grid would make electrification responsible for 32 to 71 billion USD additional health disbenefits compared with fleet renewal. Finally, we show that while fleet electrification achieves most of its benefits over fleet renewal in the long term, delaying the implementation of such policies would sacrifice meaningful cumulative benefits.",

Leaf thermal regulation and tolerance are important for plant survival during heatwaves, though the interaction between these processes and water availability is unclear.

When water was not limiting, all genotypes cooled leaves 2 to 5 °C below air temperatures. Homeothermic cooling was disrupted for weeks following a 72-h reduction in soil water, resulting in leaf temperatures rising 3 °C above air temperature and 1.3 °C above leaf thresholds for physiological damage, despite the water stress having little effect on leaf water potentials. Tradeoffs between leaf thermal safety and hydraulic safety emerged but, regardless of water use strategy, all genotypes experienced significant leaf mortality following water stress. Genotypes from warmer climates showed greater leaf cooling and less leaf mortality after water stress in comparison with genotypes from cooler climates. These results illustrate how brief soil water limitation disrupts leaf thermal regulation and potentially compromises plant survival during extreme heatwaves, thus providing insight into future scenarios in which ecosystems will be challenged with extreme heat and unreliable soil water access.",

Yet, the impact of such asymmetric seasonal warming on soil microbial carbon metabolism and growth remains poorly understood. Using 18 O isotope labeling, we examined the effects of a decade-long experimental seasonal warming on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and growth in alpine grassland ecosystems. Moreover, the quantitative stable isotope probing with 18 O-H 2 O was employed to evaluate taxon-specific bacterial growth in these ecosystems. Results show that symmetric year-round warming decreased microbial growth rate by 31% and CUE by 22%. Asymmetric winter warming resulted in a further decrease in microbial growth rate of 27% and microbial CUE of 59% compared to symmetric year-round warming. Long-term warming increased microbial carbon limitations, especially under asymmetric winter warming. Long-term warming suppressed the growth rates of most bacterial genera, with asymmetric winter warming having a stronger inhibition on the growth rates of specific genera (e.g., Gp10 , Actinomarinicola , Bosea , Acidibacter , and Gemmata ) compared to symmetric year-round warming. Bacterial growth was phylogenetically conserved, but this conservation diminished under warming conditions, primarily due to shifts in bacterial physiological states rather than the number of bacterial species and community composition. Overall, long-term warming escalated microbial carbon limitations, decreased microbial growth and CUE, with asymmetric winter warming having a more pronounced effect. Understanding these impacts is crucial for predicting soil carbon cycling as global warming progresses.",

          "abstract": "Two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a central role in modulating cellular excitability and neuronal function. The unique structure of the selectivity filter in K2P and other potassium channels determines their ability to allow the selective passage of potassium ions across cell membranes. The nematode C. elegans has one of the largest K2P families, with 47 subunit-coding genes. This remarkable expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of atypical selectivity filter sequences that diverge from the canonical TxGYG motif. Whether and how this sequence variation may impact the function of K2P channels has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that the UNC-58 K2P channel is constitutively permeable to sodium ions and that a cysteine residue in its selectivity filter is responsible for this atypical behavior. Indeed, by performing in vivo electrophysiological recordings and Ca 2+ imaging experiments, we demonstrate that UNC-58 has a depolarizing effect in muscles and sensory neurons. Consistently, unc-58 gain-of-function mutants are hypercontracted, unlike the relaxed phenotype observed in hyperactive mutants of many neuromuscular K2P channels. Finally, by combining molecular dynamics simulations with functional studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we show that the atypical cysteine residue plays a key role in the unconventional sodium permeability of UNC-58. As predicting the consequences of selectivity filter sequence variations in silico remains a major challenge, our study illustrates how functional experiments are essential to determine the contribution of such unusual potassium channels to the electrical profile of excitable cells.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic-vesicle (SV) recruitment is thought to maintain reliable neurotransmitter release during high-frequency signaling. However, the mechanism underlying the SV reloading for sustained neurotransmission at central synapses remains unknown. To elucidate this, we performed direct observations of SV reloading and mobility at a single-vesicle level near the plasma membrane in cerebellar mossy fiber terminals using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, together with simultaneous recordings of membrane fusion by capacitance measurements. We found that actin disruption abolished the rapid SV recruitment and reduced sustained release. In contrast, induction of actin polymerization and stabilization did not affect vesicle recruitment and release, suggesting that the presence of actin filaments, rather than actin dynamics, was required for the rapid recruitment. Single-particle tracking experiments of quantum dot-labeled vesicles, which allows nanoscale resolution of vesicle mobility, revealed that actin disruption caused vesicles to diffuse more rapidly. Hidden Markov modeling with Bayesian inference revealed that SVs had two diffusion states under normal conditions: free-diffusing and trapped. After disruption of the actin filament, vesicles tended to have only the free-diffusing state. F-actin staining showed that actin filaments were localized outside the active zones (AZs) and surrounded some SV trajectories. Perturbation of SV mobility, possibly through interference with biomolecular condensates, also suggested that the restricted diffusion state determined the rate of SV recruitment. We propose that actin filaments confined SVs near the AZ to achieve rapid and efficient recruitment followed by priming and sustained synaptic transmission.",

Endocytic internalization is severely impeded in the absence of fimbrin, an actin filament crosslinking protein called Sac6 in budding yeast. Here, we combine live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to gain insights into the role of actin filament crosslinking proteins in force generation. Genetic manipulation showed that CME sites with more crosslinking proteins are more effective at internalization under high load. Simulations of an experimentally constrained, agent-based mathematical model recapitulate the result that endocytic networks with more double-bound fimbrin molecules internalize the plasma membrane against elevated turgor pressure more effectively. Networks with large numbers of crosslinks also have more growing actin filament barbed ends at the plasma membrane, where the addition of new actin monomers contributes to force generation and vesicle internalization. Our results provide a richer understanding of the crucial role played by actin filament crosslinking proteins during actin network force generation, highlighting the contribution of these proteins to the self-organization of the actin filament network and force generation under increased load.",

The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup NMR spectroscopy or imaging. Here, we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced 1 H and 13 C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at μ T-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization backaction effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven 13 C hyperpolarization of [1– 13 C]-pyruvate—the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. The approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport, and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.",

A critical step of all CRISPR-Cas technologies is the delivery of the Cas endonuclease to the target cell. Here, we investigate the possibility of using bacterial conjugation to translocate Cas proteins into recipient bacteria. Conjugative relaxases are translocated through a type IV secretion system into the recipient cell, covalently attached to the transferred DNA strand. We fused relaxase R388-TrwC with the endonuclease Cas12a and confirmed that it can be transported through a T4SS. The fusion protein maintained its activity upon translocation by conjugation into the recipient cell, as evidenced by the induction of the SOS signal resulting from DNA breaks produced by the endonuclease in the recipient cell, and the detection of mutations at the target position. We further show how a template DNA provided on the transferred DNA can be used to introduce specific mutations. The guide RNA can also be encoded by the transferred DNA, enabling its production in the recipient cells where it can form a complex with the Cas nuclease transferred as a protein. This self-contained setup enables to target wild-type bacterial cells. Finally, we extended this strategy to the delivery of relaxases fused to base editors. Using TrwC and MobA relaxases as drivers, we achieved precise editing of transconjugants. Thus, conjugation provides a delivery system for Cas-derived editing tools, bypassing the need to deliver and express a cas gene in the target cells.",

We devised a method to apply forces to the nucleus of living Caenorhabditis elegans embryos to measure the force generated inside the cell. We used a centrifuge polarizing microscope to apply centrifugal force and orientation-independent differential interference contrast microscopy to characterize the mass density of the nucleus and cytoplasm. The cellular forces moving the nucleus toward the cell center increased linearly at ~12 pN/μm depending on the distance from the center. The frictional coefficient was ~980 pN s/μm. The measured values were smaller than the previously reported estimates for sea urchin embryos. The forces were consistent with the centrosome-organelle mutual pulling model for nuclear centration. The frictional coefficient was reduced when microtubules were shorter or detached from nuclei in mutant embryos, demonstrating the contribution of astral microtubules. Finally, the frictional coefficient was higher than a theoretical estimate, indicating the contribution of uncharacterized properties of the cytoplasm.",

Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements.

Although metal-containing enzymes oxidize alkanes with remarkable ease and selectivity, chemical approaches have largely been limited to transition metal–based catalytic carbon–hydrogen functionalizations. Alkanes can be protonated to form pentacoordinated carbonium ions and fragmented into smaller hydrocarbons in the presence of strong Brønsted acids. However, catalytic stereocontrol over such reactions has not previously been accomplished. We show here that strong and confined acids catalyze highly enantioselective fragmentations of a variety of cyclopropanes into the corresponding alkenes, expanding the boundaries of catalytic selective alkane activation. Computational studies suggest the involvement of the long-debated cycloproponium ions.",

However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients.",

I argue that, with the discontinuity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the spread and increased use of genomics to every corner of the world, we are entering a new, third era of genomics that provides major opportunities to advance the health of humans, animals, and the planet.

Striking a blow against this precedent, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts indicated that Chevron was “fundamentally misguided” and that only the nation’s courts have the prerogative to interpret the laws they administer. Judges across the United States now anticipate an onslaught of litigation seeking to overturn federal regulatory actions, and many of these lawsuits will turn on scientific evidence that guided those actions. Instead of deferring to the scientific and technical expertise of federal agencies, courts must now independently review the scientific record behind a challenged regulation for its persuasiveness, along with scientific findings produced by the litigating parties. It’s too early to fully unpack the impact of overturning Chevron , but the scientific community must step forward to support the crafting of clear and evidence-informed legislation, and the use of scientific evidence in the courts.",

HACE leverages CRISPR-Cas9 to target a processive helicase-deaminase fusion that incurs mutations across large (&gt;1000–base pair) genomic intervals. We applied HACE to identify mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) that confer kinase inhibitor resistance, to dissect the impact of individual variants in splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1)–dependent missplicing, and to evaluate noncoding variants in a stimulation-dependent immune enhancer of CD69.

We found that a third of the disperser species and interactions face potential extinction and that 30% of the plant species have most of their dispersers threatened or declining.

We generated morphomaps of preimplantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit, and monkey embryos, and these morphomaps revealed that although blastomere divisions desynchronized passively, 8-cell embryos converged toward robust three-dimensional shapes. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations, we found that embryos progressively changed their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which could be predicted by a physical model in which actomyosin contractility and noise facilitate topological transitions, lowering surface energy. This mechanism favored regular embryo packing and promoted a higher number of inner cells in the 16-cell embryo. Synchronized division reduced embryo packing and generated substantially more misallocated cells and fewer inner-cell–mass cells. These findings suggest that stochasticity in division timing contributes to robust patterning.",

We forecasted the acoustic structure of songs for a set of possible evolutionary futures (successive droughts spurring increasingly large beaks) and, in a field assay, presented resulting song simulations to territorial males. We found that responses to songs dropped off after six simulated drought events, to degrees roughly comparable to drops in response to songs that diverged through cultural drift and acoustic adaptation.

Our observations reveal hitherto-unknown comet-like morphology arising from fluid-structure interactions of transparent exopolymer halos around sinking aggregates. These invisible comet tails slow down individual particles, greatly increasing their residence time.

Despite many studies of specific host-pathogen systems, a unifying framework for predicting the outcomes of interactions among pathogens has remained elusive. We address this gap by developing a pathogen invasion theory (PIT) based on modern ecological coexistence theory and testing the resulting framework against empirical systems. Across major human pathogens, PIT predicts near-universal mutual susceptibility of one strain to invasion by another strain. However, predicting co-circulation from mutual invasion also depends on the degree to which susceptible abundance is reduced below the invasion threshold by overcompensatory epidemic dynamics, and the time it takes for susceptibles to replenish. The transmission advantage of an invading strain and the strength and duration of immunity are key determinants of susceptible dynamics. PIT unifies existing ideas about pathogen co-circulation, offering a quantitative framework for predicting the emergence of novel pathogen strains.",

          "abstract": "Variables related to socioeconomic status (SES), including income, ethnicity, and education, shape contact structures and affect the spread of infectious diseases. However, these factors are often overlooked in epidemic models, which typically stratify social contacts by age and interaction contexts. Here, we introduce and study generalized contact matrices that stratify contacts across multiple dimensions. We demonstrate a lower-bound theorem proving that disregarding additional dimensions, besides age and context, might lead to an underestimation of the basic reproductive number. By using SES variables in both synthetic and empirical data, we illustrate how generalized contact matrices enhance epidemic models, capturing variations in behaviors such as heterogeneous levels of adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions among demographic groups. Moreover, we highlight the importance of integrating SES traits into epidemic models, as neglecting them might lead to substantial misrepresentation of epidemic outcomes and dynamics. Our research contributes to the efforts aiming at incorporating socioeconomic and other dimensions into epidemic modeling.",

Previous studies highlighted the value of large, threatened shark species, regulated under CITES Appendix II. However, sampling biases may have overlooked small shark species. Here, we address this by identifying species from ~4000 small shark fins in Hong Kong. These fins included species not recorded in previous surveys, raising the market’s species diversity to 106. Nearly 75% of the small fins came from small shark species and 58.1% of small species were threatened with extinction. We identified an important CITES listing gap: Trade in 19 small, threatened species, especially from the family Triakidae, is unregulated. In addition, a quarter of small fins come from large sharks, indicating that substantial exploitation of juveniles is occurring and may be affecting fisheries sustainability. Enhanced surveillance of small shark fin trade is essential to ensure effective conservation under emerging trade regulations.",

          "abstract": "A central barrier to effective governance and accountability in fisheries is the limited transparency of corporate ownership. Transshipment—the transfer of catches, fuel, parts, or crew between fishing and cargo vessels known as reefers—is often criticized for its opacity and poor governance. Better insight into the beneficial ownership of vessels involved in transshipment and their operational patterns could lead to more effective management. Our study presents a publicly accessible database of reefers’ owners, operators, and flags. We identified 569 individual reefers and found that Russian and Chinese owners control 26 and 20% of the global reefer fleet, respectively. Results also show that 65% of all reefer vessels fly the flags of Russia, Panama, or China. This high level of consolidation suggests considerable leverage for enhancing transparency and governance. Our findings highlight the potential for reforming existing transshipment practices through collaboration among owners, flag states, fishery regulators, and scientists.",

The Jevons paradox refers to circumstances where improvements in the efficiency of resource use lead to growth in consumption and therefore undermine conservation. The displacement paradox refers to circumstances where increasing use of a potential substitute for a resource (e.g., farmed fish) does not lead to proportionate reduction in consumption of the other resource (e.g., wild fish). The literature on the displacement paradox and the Jevons paradox suggests that there may be unanticipated consequences from the rise of aquaculture that may be detrimental for fisheries conservation. Here, we present theoretical explanations, drawing on the tragedy of the commodity, for understanding the tendencies for these technological paradoxes to occur and emphasize their relevance for concerns associated with fisheries and aquaculture systems.",

          "abstract": "Calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling is fundamental to cellular processes in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. While the mechanisms underlying eukaryotic Ca 2+ transport are well documented, an understanding of prokaryotic transport remains nascent. LMCA1, a Ca 2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) from Listeria monocytogenes , has emerged as a prototype for elucidating structure and dynamics in prokaryotic Ca 2+ transport. Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach integrating kinetics, structure, and dynamics to unravel the intricacies of LMCA1 function. A cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a Ca 2+ -bound E1 state showed ion coordination by Asp 720 , Asn 716 , and Glu 292 . Time-resolved x-ray solution scattering experiments identified phosphorylation as the rate-determining step. A cryo-EM E2P state structure exhibited remarkable similarities to a SERCA1a E2-P* state, which highlights the essential role of the unique P-A domain interface in enhancing dephosphorylation rates and reconciles earlier proposed mechanisms. Our study underscores the distinctiveness between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ca 2+ ATPase transport systems and positions LMCA1 as a promising drug target for developing antimicrobial strategies.",

          "abstract": "Efficient behavior requires the rapid attentional selection of task-relevant objects. Preparatory activity of target-selective neurons in visual cortex is thought to support attentional selection, guiding spatial attention and favoring processing of target-matching input. However, naturalistic searches are often guided by nontargets, including target-associated “anchor” objects. For instance, when looking for a pen, we may direct our attention to the office desk on which we expect to find it. Here, using fMRI and eye tracking in a context-guided search task, we tested whether preparatory activity in visual cortex reflected the target, the guiding anchor object, or both. Participants learned associations between targets and anchors, reversing across two scene contexts, before searching for these targets. Participants’ first fixations were reliably guided by the associated anchor. Preparatory activity in lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) represented the target-associated anchor rather than the target. These results shed light on the neural basis of context-guided search in structured environments.",

This study investigated alterations in the topographical structure of the brain related to aging and neurodegenerative diseases by analyzing brain gradients derived from structural MRI data across multiple cohorts ( n = 7323). The analysis identified distinct gradient patterns in AD, aging, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that inorganic ion transmembrane transport was the most significant term in normal aging, while chemical synaptic transmission is a common enrichment term across various neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the findings show that each disorder exhibits unique dysfunctional neurophysiological characteristics. These insights are pivotal for elucidating the distinct biological mechanisms underlying AD, thereby enhancing our understanding of its unique clinical phenotypes in contrast to normal aging and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Using engineered cardiac microtissues (CMTs) composed of HCM-causing MYH7 -variant hiPSC-CMs and wild-type fibroblasts, we observed cell-cell cross-talk leading to increased collagen deposition, tissue stiffening, and decreased contractility dependent on fibroblast proliferation. hiPSC-CM conditioned media and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data suggested that fibroblast proliferation is mediated by paracrine signals from MYH7 -variant cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase with erlotinib hydrochloride attenuated stromal activation. Last, HCM-causing MYBPC3 -variant CMTs also demonstrated increased stromal activation and reduced contractility, but with distinct characteristics. Together, these findings establish a paracrine-mediated cross-talk potentially responsible for fibrotic changes observed in HCM.",

          "abstract": "Aquacultured carnivorous species consume most of the world’s fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), which itself is primarily derived from small pelagic fish. This has raised concerns about the practice’s impact on wild fish stocks, ecosystems, and coastal communities that rely on these fish. The aquaculture industry claims a decreasing dependence on wild fish, relying on the Fish In:Fish Out (FIFO) metric as a ratio of the quantity of wild fish required for farmed fish production. This is misleading because it usually assumes constant FM or FO yields, inclusion rates and feed conversion ratios, which vary widely. Thus, a constant FIFO value for a given species cannot be assumed. Furthermore, low FIFO values resulting from averaging carnivores and herbivores conceal the high feed requirements of carnivore species. The increasing use of FMFO from by-products does not demonstrate a decreased use of wild fish but rather reflects a growing demand for FMFO, particularly for the fast growing and valuable salmon and shrimp farming industries.",

Dissolution-dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP) is a state-of-the-art technology that can markedly enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), providing metabolic and physiological information in vivo. However, the hyperpolarized state exponentially decays back to the thermal equilibrium, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation time ( T 1 ). Because of the limitation in T 1 , peptide-based DNP NMR molecular probes applicable in vivo have been limited to amino acids or dipeptides. Here, we report the direct detection of in vivo metabolic conversions of hyperpolarized 13 C-oligopeptides. Structure-based T 1 relaxation analysis suggests that the C-terminal [1- 13 C]Gly- d 2 residue affords sufficient T 1 for biological uses, even in relatively large oligopeptides, and allowed us to develop 13 C-β-casomorphin-5 and 13 C-glutathione. It was found that the metabolic response and perfusion of the hyperpolarized 13 C-glutathione in the mouse kidney were significantly altered in a model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.",

          "abstract": "A core problem in systems and circuits neuroscience is deciphering the origin of shared dynamics in neuronal activity: Do they emerge through local network interactions, or are they inherited from external sources? We explore this question with large-scale networks of spatially ordered spiking neuron models where a downstream network receives input from an upstream sender network. We show that linear measures of the communication between the sender and receiver networks can discriminate between emergent or inherited population dynamics. A match in the dimensionality of the sender and receiver population activities promotes faithful communication. In contrast, a nonlinear mapping between the sender to receiver activity, for example, through downstream emergent population-wide fluctuations, can impair linear communication. Our work exposes the benefits and limitations of linear measures when analyzing between-area communication in circuits with rich population-wide neuronal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Increases in the abundance of woody species have been reported to affect the provisioning of ecosystem services in drylands worldwide. However, it is virtually unknown how multiple biotic and abiotic drivers, such as climate, grazing, and fire, interact to determine woody dominance across global drylands. We conducted a standardized field survey in 304 plots across 25 countries to assess how climatic features, soil properties, grazing, and fire affect woody dominance in dryland rangelands. Precipitation, temperature, and grazing were key determinants of tree and shrub dominance. The effects of grazing were determined not solely by grazing pressure but also by the dominant livestock species. Interactions between soil, climate, and grazing and differences in responses to these factors between trees and shrubs were key to understanding changes in woody dominance. Our findings suggest that projected changes in climate and grazing pressure may increase woody dominance in drylands, altering their structure and functioning.",

          "abstract": "The world’s oceans are largely free from intensive farming, but momentum to intensify and expand mariculture—the cultivation of aquatic organisms in the ocean—is growing. Despite optimism that mariculture will create economic and nutritional benefits for humans, it can also generate a host of risks, including environmental degradation, harms to wildlife integrity and welfare, captivity effects, and shifts in how humans view the nonhuman world. Collectively, we refer to these four types of risks as “dewilding.” In this systematic review, we searched Scopus and Web of Science for recent literature documenting mariculture’s dewilding impacts to organize and collate this evidence under one unified framework. We find that mariculture’s dewilding impacts are consistently documented, though often in isolation, and that captivity and conceptual dewilding impacts are recognized as potential harms far less than impacts on the environment and wildlife. Future work examining mariculture’s dewilding impacts will be paramount to guiding human decision-making and activity going forward.",

Using genetically engineered mouse models to examine semaphorin 3D (SEMA3D), we identified a dual role for tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D in the malignant transformation of pancreatic epithelial cells and invasive PDA development. Pancreatic-specific knockout of the SEMA3D gene from the KRAS G12D and TP53 R172H mutation knock-in, PDX1-Cre(KPC) mouse model demonstrated delayed tumor initiation, prolonged survival, absence of metastasis, and reduced M2 macrophage expression. Mechanistically, tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D indirectly reprograms macrophages through KRAS MUT -dependent ARF6 signaling in PDA cells, resulting in increased lactate production, which is sensed by GPCR132 on macrophages to stimulate protumorigenic M2 polarization. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased M2-polarized macrophages proximal to nerves in SEMA3D-expressing human PDA tissue. This study suggests that altered SEMA3D expression leads to an acquisition of cancer-promoting functions, and nerve-derived SEMA3D is “hijacked” by PDA cells to support growth and metastasis in a KRAS MUT -dependent manner.",

Compatible with standard electrophysiology recording systems, the e-Flower does not require additional equipment or solvents and is ready to use with preformed 3D tissues. We designed an e-Flower achieving a curvature as low as 300 micrometers within minutes, a value tunable by the choice of reswelling media and hydrogel cross-linker concentration.

When temporal changes in the environment mirror spatial gradients, it opens up the potential for predicting the course of adaptive evolution over time based on patterns of spatial genetic and phenotypic variation. We assessed this approach in a 30-year transplant experiment in the intertidal snail Littorina saxatilis . In 1992, snails were transplanted from a predation-dominated environment to one dominated by wave action. On the basis of spatial patterns, we predicted transitions in shell size and morphology, allele frequencies at positions throughout the genome, and chromosomal rearrangement frequencies. Observed changes closely agreed with predictions and transformation was both dramatic and rapid.

Biological and transcriptomic approaches indicated that VRI-driven PD-L1 + neutrophils are endowed with potent regulatory functions and reduced classical antimicrobial properties, as compared to their PD-L1 − counterpart. VRI-induced regulatory PD-L1 + neutrophils were generated remotely in the bone marrow in an IFN-γ–dependent manner and were quickly mobilized into the inflamed lungs where they fulfilled their maturation. Neutrophil depletion and PD-L1 blockade during experimental VRI resulted in higher mortality, increased local inflammation, and reduced expression of resolving factors. These findings suggest that PD-L1 + neutrophils are important players in disease tolerance by mitigating local inflammation during severe VRI and that they may constitute relevant targets for future immune interventions.",

Precocial chicks acquire imprintability just after hatching when thyroid hormone (T 3 ) flows into the brain and primes later learning. Here, we show that the perihatch synthesis of T 3 paralleling thyroid development is crucial for imprinting and endows newborn chicks with cognitive flexibility via a mechanism involving the nidopallium dorsocaudale, the avian “prefrontal cortex.” Imprinted chicks showed higher cognitive flexibility than those unimprinted in switching or reversal task experiments. Notably, we discovered that exogenous T 3 endowed similar flexibility in unimprinted chicks.

Furthermore, a metric that incorporates wild fish mortality during capture and excludes unfed systems raises the wild fish mortality–to–farmed fish output ratio to 0.57 to 1.78. We also evaluate terrestrial ingredients in aquaculture feeds. Widely cited estimates of declines in wild fish use from 1997 to 2017 entailed a trade-off of more than fivefold increase in feed crops over the same period.

This suggests that the rate-strengthening friction commonly measured in clay-rich materials may govern episodic slow slip in landslides, in addition to tectonic faults. Further, our results show more generally that transient slow slip can arise in velocity-strengthening materials from modulation of effective normal stress through pore pressure fluctuations. This challenges the idea that episodic slow slip requires a narrow range of transitional frictional properties near the stability threshold, or pore pressure feedbacks operating on initially unstable frictional slip.",

This study uses lithium isotopes from a large suite of lamprophyres to characterize the mantle beneath the eastern North China Craton, which hosts giant Mesozoic gold deposits. Our results indicate a strong genetic link between carbonate metasomatism in the mantle and Au mineralization in the overlying crust.

Here, we propose and demonstrate a noise-enhanced microwave sensor using a thermal ensemble of interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the strong nonlinearity present in the Rydberg ensembles and leveraging stochastic noises in the system, we demonstrate the stochastic resonance driven by a weak microwave signal (from several microvolts per centimeter to millivolts per centimeter). A substantial enhancement in the detection is achieved, with a sensitivity surpassing that of a heterodyne atomic sensor by 6.6 decibels.

Transitioning from a proliferative to an invasive melanoma phenotype is coupled with increased ferroptosis vulnerability.

In this work, we identified Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) as the top lipid-metabolism gene segregating the melanoma MITF high /AXL low proliferative/ferroptosis-resistant from MITF low /AXL high invasive/ferroptosis-sensitive state. Mechanistically, ApoE secreted by the MITF high /AXL low cells protects the invasive phenotype from ferroptosis-inducing agents by reducing the content of peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids and boosting GPX4 levels both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-exome sequencing indicates that APOE high expression in patients with melanoma is associated with resistance to ferroptosis, regardless of APOE germline status. In aggregate, we found a ferroptosis-resistance mechanism between melanoma cell states relying on secreted ApoE and APOE high expression as a potential biomarker for poor ferroptosis response in melanoma.",

          "abstract": "c-di-GAMP was first identified in bacteria to promote colonization, while mammalian 2′3′-cGAMP is synthesized by cGAS to activate STING for innate immune stimulation. However, 2′3′-cGAMP function beyond innate immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that 2′3′-cGAMP promotes cell migration independent of innate immunity. 2′3′-cGAMP interactome analysis identifies the small GTPase Rab18 as a 2′3′-cGAMP binding partner and effector in cell migration control. Mechanistically, 2′3′-cGAMP binds Rab18 to facilitate GTP loading and subsequent Rab18 activation, which further promotes FosB transcription in facilitating cell migration. Induced synthesis of endogenous 2′3′-cGAMP by intrabreast tumor bacterium S. aureus infection or low-dose doxorubicin treatment facilitates cell migration depending on the cGAS/cGAMP/Rab18/FosB signaling. We find that lovastatin induces Rab18 deprenylation that abolishes 2′3′-cGAMP recognition therefore suppressing cell migration. Together, our study reveals a previously unidentified 2′3′-cGAMP function in cell migration control via the 2′3′-cGAMP/Rab18/FosB signaling that provides additional insights into clinical applications of 2′3′-cGAMP.",

          "abstract": "Aquaculture, fueled partly by claims of supporting food security, is experiencing unprecedented growth. Framing aquaculture as a monolith, however, overlooks its extreme taxonomic diversity. This paper assesses the welfare risks associated with that diversity, establishing seven species-level risk factors from involved parental care to long lifespans. Investigating these welfare risks across all aquatic species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed an uneven distribution of risk, with extreme species-level risks in chordates, crustaceans, and cephalopod mollusks. Compared to species with fewer risks, species with extreme welfare risks were found to cost more and contribute the least to global production. This work challenges the notion that prioritizing animal welfare is incompatible with addressing food security and creates the possibility of identifying certain plant and invertebrate species, like seaweeds and bivalves, that minimize welfare concerns while providing affordability and accessibility. Going forward, proactive welfare approaches are needed to inform consumer choice and shape just and sustainable aquaculture policy.",

Because of their large size and compressibility, the fNACPs robustly trap along the pressure antinodes of a standing wave and separate from blood components in under 60 seconds with &gt;99% efficiency. fNACPs are subsequently fluorescently labeled in the pipette and are analyzed by both a custom, portable fluorimeter and flow cytometer.

In this context, the role of evolving global geodynamics and plate (re)organization on the spatial and temporal distribution of compositional heterogeneities in the convecting mantle is poorly understood. Here, using the geochemical compositions of intracontinental basalts formed over the past billion years, we show that intracontinental basalts with subchondritic initial neodymium-144/neodymium-143 values become common only after 300 million years, broadly coeval with the global appearance of kimberlites with geochemically enriched isotopic signatures. These step changes in the sources of intraplate magmatism stem from a rapid increase in the supply of deeply subducted lithosphere during the protracted formation of Pangea following the widespread onset of “modern” (cold and deep) subduction in the late Neoproterozoic. We argue that the delay (~300 million years) in the appearance of enriched intraplate magmas reflects the time required for the sinking and (re)incorporation of slabs into the sources of mantle-derived magmas.",

PSDU, an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with alternating hard-soft segments and supramolecular bonds, imparts excellent compressibility, adhesion, and self-healing properties to the composite. Simultaneously, the incorporation of (DF-CBA) 2 CuCl 4 as functional fillers leverages the formation of a hydrogen bonding network to enhance charge transfer processes. These fillers facilitate charge accumulation through an electric poling process, resulting in a power output improvement that surpasses 1400 times higher than that of a dense PSDU-based GS-TENG. Tapping onto the versatile properties of porous poly(siloxane-diphenylglyoxime-urethane)-perovskite (PSDU-PK) GS-TENGs, applications such as hand gesture/food recognition and dual-mode sensing system have been demonstrated, suggesting their promising potential in wearable electronics and smart agriculture.",

Heat capacity data show that the spins in both compounds are dominantly Ising-like, even after being manipulated by high magnetic fields. On cooling below the Néel temperatures, a sharp field–induced transition in magnetization is observed for CaCoGe 2 O 6 , while multiple magnetization plateaus beneath the full saturation moment are spotted for CaCoSi 2 O 6 . Our analysis shows that these contrasting behaviors potentially arise from the different electron configurations of germanium and silicon, in which the 3d orbitals are filled in the former but empty in the latter, enabling electron hopping.

Here, we showed that chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5) exerts a critical role in mediating myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration. Deletion of CLIC5 in skeletal muscle leads to reduced muscle weight and decreases the number and differentiation potential of satellite cells. In vitro, CLIC5 consistently inhibits myoblast proliferation while promoting myotube formation. CLIC5 promotes myogenic differentiation by activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in a biglycan (BGN)–dependent manner. CLIC5 deletion impairs muscle regeneration. Paired box gene 7 (Pax7) expression and the activity of BGN-mediated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling are reduced in CLIC5-deficient mice. Conversely, increasing CLIC5 levels in skeletal muscles enhances muscle regeneration capacity. In conclusion, our findings underscore CLIC5 as a pivotal regulator of myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration, functioning through interaction with BGN to activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are key agents in distributing extratropical precipitation and transporting moisture poleward. Climate models forced by historical anthropogenic forcing suggest an increase in AR activity in the extratropics over the past four decades. However, reanalyses indicate a ~6° to 10° poleward shift of ARs during boreal winter in both hemispheres, featuring a rise along 50°N and 50°S and a decrease along 30°N and 30°S. Our analysis demonstrates that low-frequency sea surface temperature variability in the tropical eastern Pacific exhibits a cooling tendency since 2000 that plays a key role in driving this global AR shift, mostly over extratropical oceans, through a tropical-driven eddy-mean flow feedback. This mechanism also operates on interannual timescales, controlled by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and is less pronounced over the Southern Ocean due to weaker eddy activity during austral summer. These highlight the sensitivity of ARs to large-scale circulation changes driven by both internal variability and external forcing in current and upcoming decades.",

We used high-resolution measurements of refractory rBC in a firn core collected near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, as well as atmospheric rBC from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, satellite measurements, modeling, burned area data, and tourism statistics, to assess combined impacts of both long-range transported rBC and locally emitted rBC. Our findings suggest that tourism activities have a regional rather than local impact and the increase in rBC concentrations during late spring-summer, influenced by tourism activities and fires in the Southern Hemisphere, can enhance ice melt.

We find that stably enriched transcripts contain inefficiently excised introns and that disruption of nuclear speckles specifically affects splicing of speckle-enriched transcripts. We further reveal RNA sequence features contributing to transcript speckle localization, indicating a tight interplay between transcript speckle enrichment, genome organization, and splicing efficiency. Collectively, our data highlight a role of nuclear speckles in both co- and posttranscriptional splicing regulation.

Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals. We incorporate these results in mixing models that aim to reproduce Earth’s abundance and isotope compositions of Zn and other elements. Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn.

          "abstract": "This article explores how economic socialization serves as a bridge between individual economic behaviors and the broader social and cultural contexts that shape them. Drawing on a post-functionalist approach to socialization, the study examines the ultra-Orthodox Jewish (Haredi) community in Israel, where distinct gender roles, cultural norms and patterns of economic participation create a unique context for investigating divergent economic socialization pathways. Comparing four groups within the Haredi community—average/below-average and high-income women, men with work experience, and men who study at religious seminaries (Yeshiva/Kollel)—analysis of an original survey study reveals how differential exposure to economic life leads to significant variations in financial risk-taking, loss-aversion, financial literacy and competitiveness. The findings problematize explanations attributing economic gender gaps to innate differences, instead highlighting the profound impact of the cultural framing of gender roles vis-à-vis economic integration. By foregrounding economic socialization as a sociological phenomenon, the study contributes to discourses on culture’s role in economic behavior and opens new avenues for examining how individuals acquire economic dispositions through socialization pathways shaped by structural constraints and power relations.",
