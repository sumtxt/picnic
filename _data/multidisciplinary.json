          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in phenotypically normal tissue are common across adult organs 1,2 . This suggests that multiple events need to converge to drive tumorigenesis and that many processes such as tissue differentiation may protect against carcinogenesis. WNT–β-catenin signalling maintains zonal differentiation during liver homeostasis 3,4 . However, the CTNNB1 oncogene—encoding β-catenin—is also frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in aberrant WNT signalling that promotes cell growth 5,6 . Here we investigated the antagonistic interplay between WNT-driven growth and differentiation in zonal hepatocyte populations during liver tumorigenesis. We found that β-catenin mutations co-operate with exogenous MYC expression to drive a proliferative translatome. Differentiation of hepatocytes to an extreme zone 3 fate suppressed this proliferative translatome. Furthermore, a GLUL and Lgr5 -positive perivenous subpopulation of zone 3 hepatocytes were refractory to WNT-induced and MYC-induced tumorigenesis. However, when mutant CTNNB1 and MYC alleles were activated sporadically across the liver lobule, a subset of mutant hepatocytes became proliferative and tumorigenic. These early lesions were characterized by reduced WNT pathway activation and elevated MAPK signalling, which suppresses zone 3 differentiation. The proliferative lesions were also dependent on IGFBP2–mTOR–cyclin D1 pathway signalling, in which inhibition of either IGFBP2 or mTOR suppressed proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, we propose that zonal identity dictates hepatocyte susceptibility to WNT-driven tumorigenesis and that escaping WNT-induced differentiation is essential for liver cancer.",

Despite this constraint, however, there exists incredible diversity in the world’s 7,000 spoken languages, each of which is learned through extensive experience hearing speech in language-specific contexts 1 . It remains unknown which elements of speech processing in the brain depend on daily language experience and which do not. In this study, we recorded high-density cortical activity from adult participants with diverse language backgrounds as they listened to speech in their native language and an unfamiliar foreign language. We found that, regardless of language experience, both native and foreign languages elicited similar cortical responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), associated with shared acoustic–phonetic processing of foundational speech sound features 2,3 , such as vowels and consonants. However, only during native language listening did we observe enhanced neural encoding in the STG for word boundaries, word frequency and language-specific sound sequence statistics. In a separate cohort of bilingual participants, this encoding of word- and sequence-level information appeared for both familiar languages in the same individual and in the same STG neural populations. These results indicate that experience-dependent language processing involves dynamic integration of both shared acoustic–phonetic and language-specific sequence- and word-level information in the STG.",

          "abstract": "Ribosome collisions activate the ribotoxic stress response mediated by the MAP3K ZAK, which in turn regulates cell-fate consequences through downstream phosphorylation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK 1 . Despite the critical role of ZAK during cellular stress, a mechanistic and structural understanding of ZAK–ribosome interactions and how these lead to activation remain elusive. Here we combine biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to discover distinct ZAK–ribosome interactions required for constitutive recruitment and for activation. We find that upon induction of ribosome collisions, interactions between ZAK and the ribosomal protein RACK1 enable its activation by dimerization of its SAM domains at the collision interface. Furthermore, we discover how this process is negatively regulated by the ribosome-binding protein SERBP1 to prevent constitutive ZAK activation. Characterization of novel SAM variants as well as a known pathogenic variant of the SAM domain of ZAK supports a key role of the SAM domain in regulating kinase activity on and off the ribosome, with some mutants bypassing the ribosome requirement for ZAK activation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic blueprint of the kinase activity of ZAK at the collided ribosome interface.",

          "abstract": "Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behaviour 1–4 . Before volitional movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets 5–12 . This activity in the cortico-basal ganglia loop may function as an adjustable ‘timer,’ triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviours, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. Here, to address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a flexible lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. These findings are consistent with a model in which the striatum is part of a network that temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex and generates ramping activity that regulates motor timing.",

          "abstract": "Generative genomic models can design increasingly complex biological systems 1 . However, controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains challenging. Here, we show that Evo, a genomic language model, can leverage genomic context to perform function-guided design that accesses novel regions of sequence space. By learning semantic relationships across prokaryotic genes 2 , Evo enables a genomic ‘autocomplete’ in which a DNA prompt encoding genomic context for a function of interest guides the generation of novel sequences enriched for related functions, which we refer to as ‘semantic design’. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and type II and III toxin–antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant sequence similarity to natural proteins. In-context design of proteins and non-coding RNAs with Evo achieves robust activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural priors, known evolutionary conservation or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to complete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a database containing over 120 billion base pairs of artificial intelligence-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic design across many functions. More broadly, these results demonstrate that generative genomics with biological language models can extend beyond natural sequences.",

          "abstract": "Non-invasive skin permeation is widely used for convenient transdermal delivery of small-molecule therapeutics (less than 500 Da) with appropriate hydrophobicities 1 . However, it has long been deemed infeasible for large molecules—particularly polymers, proteins and peptides 2,3 —due to the formidable barrier posed by the skin structure. Here we show that the fast skin-permeable polyzwitterion poly[2-( N -oxide- N,N -dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OP) can efficiently penetrate the stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis into circulation. OP is protonated to be cationic and is therefore enriched in the acidic sebum and paracellular stratum corneum lipids containing fatty acids, and subsequently diffuses through the intercorneocyte lipid lamella. Beneath the stratum corneum, at the normal physiological pH, OP becomes a neutral polyzwitterion, ‘hopping’ on cell membranes, enabling its efficient migration through the epidermis and dermis and ultimately entering dermal lymphatic vessels and systemic circulation. As a result, OP-conjugated insulin efficiently permeates through the skin into the blood circulation; transdermal administration of OP-conjugated insulin at a dose of 116 U kg −1 into mice with type 1 diabetes quickly lowers their blood glucose levels to the normal range, and a transdermal dose of 29 U kg −1 normalizes the blood glucose levels of diabetic minipigs. Thus, the skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin, relieving patients with diabetes from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery.",

          "abstract": "Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets 1,2 , it remains mostly unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit 3,4 to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male–male courtship, we switched its connection nearly completely from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type to a new PN type that promotes courtship. From this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attraction between synaptic partners and repulsion between non-partners 5,6 . The anatomical switch changed the odour response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male–male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring—increasing repulsion with the old partner, decreasing repulsion with the new partner and matching attraction with the new partner—to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work shows that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving the way to investigations of how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.",

          "abstract": "Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing 1,2 and prime editing 3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration 4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Insulating nanomaterials have large energy gaps and are only electrically accessible under extreme conditions, such as high-intensity radiation and high temperature, pressure or voltage 1,2 . Lanthanide-doped insulating nanoparticles (LnNPs) are widely studied owing to their exceptional luminescence properties, including bright, narrow-linewidth, non-blinking and non-bleaching emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) range 3,4 . However, it has not been possible to electrically generate excited states in these insulating nanomaterials under low biases and, therefore, not possible to fabricate optoelectronic devices from these systems. Here we report an electrical excitation pathway to obtain emission from LnNPs. By forming LnNP@organic molecule nanohybrids, in which the recombination of electrically injected charges on the organic molecule is followed by efficient triplet energy transfer (TET) to the LnNP, it is possible to turn on LnNPs under a low operating bias. We demonstrate this excitation pathway in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with low turn-on voltages of about 5 V, very narrow electroluminescence (EL) spectra and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) greater than 0.6% in the NIR-II window 5 . Our LnNP-based LEDs (LnLEDs) also allow for widely tunable EL properties, by changing the type and concentration of lanthanide dopants. These results open up a new field of hybrid optoelectronic devices and provide new opportunities for the electrically driven excitation sources based on lanthanide nanomaterials for biomedical and optoelectronic applications.",

However, it remains unclear whether these cells exist as functional clusters that can be isolated from clinical samples. Here, using conventional and imaging flow cytometry, we show that from 21 out of 21 human melanoma metastases, we could isolate heterotypic clusters, comprising CD8 + T cells interacting with one or more tumour cells and/or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that T cells from clusters were enriched for gene signatures associated with tumour reactivity and exhaustion. Clustered T cells exhibited increased TCR clonality indicative of expansion, whereas TCR-matched T cells showed more exhaustion and co-modulation when conjugated to APCs than when conjugated to tumour cells. T cells that were expanded from clusters ex vivo exerted on average ninefold increased killing activity towards autologous melanomas, which was accompanied by enhanced cytokine production. After adoptive cell transfer into mice, T cells from clusters showed improved patient-derived melanoma control, which was associated with increased T cell infiltration and activation. Together, these results demonstrate that tumour-reactive CD8 + T cells are enriched in functional clusters with tumour cells and/or APCs and that they can be isolated and expanded from clinical samples. Typically excluded by single-cell gating in flow cytometry, these distinct heterotypic T cell clusters are a valuable source to decipher functional tumour–immune cell interactions and may also be therapeutically explored.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent and devastating form of oncogene amplification in cancer 1,2 . Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres, stochastically segregate during cell division 3–6 and persist over many generations. It has been more than 40 years since ecDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear 3,7 . Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. Using Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that we developed, we reveal thousands of human retention elements that confer generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions that are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins. This activity intermolecularly recapitulates promoter–enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated. Targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, which suggests that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, and reveal the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.",

          "abstract": "Neurons exhibit extraordinary precision in selecting synaptic partners. Although cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that mediate attractive interactions between developing axons and dendrites have been shown to instruct synaptic partner matching 1,2 , the degree to which repulsive interactions have a role is less clear. Here, using a genetic screen guided by single-cell transcriptomes 3,4 , we identified three CSP pairs, Toll2–Ptp10D, Fili–Kek1 and Hbs/Sns–Kirre, that mediate repulsive interactions between non-partner olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons and projection neuron (PN) dendrites in the developing Drosophila olfactory circuit. Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select ORN–PN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP. All CSP pairs are also differentially expressed in other brain regions. Together, our data reveal that multiple repulsive CSP pairs work together to ensure precise synaptic partner matching during development by preventing neurons from forming connections with non-cognate partners.",

          "abstract": "Most human secretory pathway proteins are N-glycosylated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes as they enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1–3 . Recent work revealed a substrate-assisted mechanism by which N-glycosylation of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is regulated to control cell surface receptor signalling 4 . Here we report the structure of a natively isolated GRP94 folding intermediate tethered to a specialized CCDC134-bound translocon. Together with functional analysis, the data reveal how a conserved N-terminal extension in GRP94 inhibits OST-A and how structural rearrangements within the translocon shield the tethered nascent chain from inappropriate OST-B glycosylation. These interactions depend on a hydrophobic CCDC134 groove, which recognizes a non-native conformation of nascent GRP94. Our results define a mechanism of regulated N-glycosylation and illustrate how the nascent chain remodels the translocon to facilitate its own biogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Most superconducting materials are well understood and conventional—that is, the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-temperature (high- T c ) cuprate superconductors 1 . Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of d -wave symmetry. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi 2 harbours nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional i -wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below 10 K, the superconductivity in PtBi 2 gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, whereas its bulk states remain normal 2 . The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the centre of the Fermi arcs and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This establishes PtBi 2 surfaces not only as unconventional, topological i -wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.",

          "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have had tremendous success accounting for reward-based learning across species, including instrumental learning in contextual bandit tasks, and they capture variance in brain signals. However, reward-based learning in humans recruits multiple processes, including memory and choice perseveration; their contributions can easily be mistakenly attributed to RL computations. Here I investigate how much of reward-based learning behaviour is supported by RL computations in a context where other processes can be factored out. Reanalysis and computational modelling of 7 datasets ( n = 594) in diverse samples show that in this instrumental context, reward-based learning is best explained by a combination of a fast working-memory-based process and a slower habit-like associative process, neither of which can be interpreted as a standard RL-like algorithm on its own. My results raise important questions for the interpretation of RL algorithms as capturing a meaningful process across brain and behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Human languages show astonishing variety, yet their diversity is constrained by recurring patterns. Linguists have long argued over the extent and causes of these grammatical ‘universals’. Using Grambank—a comprehensive database of grammatical features across the world’s languages—we tested 191 proposed universals with Bayesian analyses that account for both genealogical descent and geographical proximity. We find statistical support for about a third of the proposed linguistic universals. The majority of these concern word order and hierarchical universals: two types that have featured prominently in earlier work. Evolutionary analyses show that languages tend to change in ways that converge on these preferred patterns. This suggests that, despite the vast design space of possible grammars, languages do not evolve entirely at random. Shared cognitive and communicative pressures repeatedly push languages towards similar solutions.",

          "abstract": "As AI systems from decision-making algorithms to generative AI are deployed more widely, computer scientists and social scientists alike are being called on to provide trustworthy quantitative evaluations of AI safety and reliability. These calls have included demands from affected parties to be given a seat at the table of AI evaluation. What, if anything, can public involvement add to the science of AI? In this perspective, we summarize the sociotechnical challenge of evaluating AI systems, which often adapt to multiple layers of social context that shape their outcomes. We then offer guidance for improving the science of AI by engaging lived-experience experts in the design, data collection, and interpretation of scientific evaluations. This article reviews common models of public engagement in AI research alongside common concerns about participatory methods, including questions about generalizable knowledge, subjectivity, reliability, and practical logistics. To address these questions, we summarize the literature on participatory science, discuss case studies from AI in healthcare, and share our own experience evaluating AI in areas from policing systems to social media algorithms. Overall, we describe five parts of any quantitative evaluation where public participation can improve the science of AI: equipoise, explanation, measurement, inference, and interpretation. We conclude with reflections on the role that participatory science can play in trustworthy AI by supporting trustworthy science.",

          "authors": "Sean J. Westwood",
          "abstract": "The advancement of large language models poses a severe, potentially existential threat to online survey research, a fundamental tool for data collection across the sciences. This work demonstrates that the foundational assumption of survey research—that a coherent response is a human response—is no longer tenable. I designed and tested an autonomous synthetic respondent capable of producing survey data that possesses the coherence and plausibility of human responses. This agent successfully evades a comprehensive suite of data quality checks, including instruction-following tasks, logic puzzles, and “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors, achieving a 99.8% pass rate on 6,000 trials of standard attention checks. The synthetic respondent generates internally consistent responses by maintaining a coherent demographic persona and a memory of its prior answers, producing plausible data on psychometric scales, vignette comprehension tasks, and complex socioeconomic trade-offs. Furthermore, its open-ended text responses are linguistically sophisticated and stylistically calibrated to the level of education of its assigned persona. Critically, the agent can be instructed to maliciously alter polling outcomes, demonstrating an overt vector for information warfare. More subtly, it can also infer a researcher’s latent hypotheses and produce data that artificially confirms them. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in our data infrastructure, rendering most current detection methods obsolete and posing a potential existential threat to unsupervised online research. The scientific community must urgently develop new data validation standards and reconsider its reliance on nonprobability, low-barrier online data collection methods.",

          "abstract": "We advance the understanding of so-called “cancel culture” at the university by presenting the results of three survey experiments among university students. Designed in an “adversarial collaboration” among researchers with competing perspectives, these experiments disentangle whether students’ preferences for curtailing academic freedom are based on viewpoint discrimination, professional academic standards, or prosocial concerns. Our findings show that a substantive share of university students support viewpoint-based restrictions on academic discourse. While they also apply academic and prosocial criteria, they apply them more strongly to conservative viewpoints. The results further show that conservative statements are perceived as causing more social harm. However, prosocial concerns do not fully explain the higher demand for ideological viewpoint discrimination. These results are important because they can inform the debate about universities as ideological spaces—a view often invoked in recent government-led attacks on academic freedom.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists not only conduct impact evaluations but also participate in the design and implementation of the programs being evaluated. While Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) oversee research activities, they do not assess risks posed by the interventions themselves. We propose establishing External Advisory Committees (EACs) to provide independent, expert oversight of programming risks. EACs complement IRBs by focusing on potential harms to participants and communities, offering dynamic risk assessments, and advising on program adaptations or termination. By providing impartial expertise, EACs help address potential conflicts of interest that may arise when researchers and implementers are invested in a program’s continuation. We illustrate the value of EACs through our experience implementing a cross-border labor migration program in Niger. Our EAC provided crucial guidance on scaling up the intervention after a pilot study and adapting the program following an unexpected military coup. While EACs introduce additional costs and may limit researcher autonomy, they generate accountability and are particularly valuable for novel and politically sensitive interventions in fragile environments.",

          "authors": "Mélusine Boon-Falleur, Elise Huillery, Coralie Chevallier",
          "abstract": "Many domains in life require people to wait to access better outcomes, such as waiting in line to access prized tickets for a show, waiting to obtain a job offer from a selective firm, or being waitlisted for a prestigious university. Although waiting might be perceived as a fair mechanism to allocate resources, it may have unintended consequences on social inequalities as individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (SES) may be less likely to wait. In this study, we investigate socioeconomic differences in waiting behavior during the higher education admission process in France. To do so, we leveraged a unique national database that recorded the admission behavior of every high schooler in France over a period of three years. During the admissions process, students faced a trade-off: They could either accept an immediate offer from a university or wait in the hope of receiving a preferred offer later. Results collected among 274,316 students reveal that low-SES students were significantly less likely to wait for preferred offers, even when controlling for objective costs and benefits of waiting. This led low-SES students to ultimately enroll in programs they liked less and that were less prestigious. These results highlight how admission procedures generating uncertainty and requiring students to wait may inadvertently exacerbate educational inequalities. Such systems, while efficient, can end up favoring students who wait more. This research contributes to current discussions on admission procedure fairness by illustrating that seemingly neutral algorithms can in fact deepen social inequalities if their design rewards patience.",

          "abstract": "Numerous research efforts have used paleoecological data to reconstruct past biodiversity in Europe. In these projects, researchers have identified increases in biodiversity over the Holocene and hinted at a positive correlation with human population. These are important findings but are not easily translated into effective biodiversity conservation and restoration policy. We argue that, in order to better inform policymaking, studies of past biodiversity dynamics should include analyses of contemporaneous cultural phenomena in order to identify and describe specific anthropogenic drivers of past biodiversity changes. We present an example here, a case study from the Lake Constance region (southwestern Germany), one of the core areas of the Carolingian Empire, the foundational political structure of modern Europe. This uniquely well-documented region offers six fossil pollen profiles characterized by high taxonomic and chronological resolution, archaeobotanical evidence from hundreds of excavation sites, and historical records describing population, commerce, and agriculture dating from the mid-700s CE. These data indicate that a major, sustained increase in plant diversity occurred in the Lake Constance region between 500 and 1000 CE, the formative period of medieval civilization. Plant diversity reached a 4,000-y peak around 1000 CE, making the medieval period a plant diversity optimum in the region. Archaeobotanical evidence independently corroborates this finding. Palynological, archaeobotanical, and archival data suggest that cultural innovations—in agriculture, management, and trade—were the primary drivers of this biodiversity transition and were necessary to maintain elevated levels of plant diversity in the region through the 20th century.",

          "abstract": "The conventional assumption is that stomatal conductance ( g s ) dominates the regulation of water and carbon dioxide fluxes between leaves and the atmosphere. Here, a nanoreporter of water status at the mesophyll cell surface and local xylem within intact maize leaves documents significant undersaturation of water vapor in the outside-xylem zone (OXZ) and a large loss of conductance of this zone ( g oxz ) at moderate xylem water stress, without stomatal closure or turgor loss. The ratio of the resistances ( 1 / g oxz ) / ( 1 / g s ) serves as a predictive phenotype of undersaturation, nonstomatal regulation of transpiration, errors in standard gas exchange analysis, and an increase of intrinsic water use efficiency ( iWUE ). Cell-scale access to water status reveals symplasmic-apoplasmic disequilibrium and informs a biophysical model that can explain experimental observations quantitatively based on localization of variable conductance to the plasma membrane. This work opens paths of inquiry into the molecular basis and functional consequences of nonstomatal regulation of transpiration.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the ecological footprints of pre-Columbian Indigenous peoples in Amazonia persist in modern forests. Ecological impacts resulting from European colonization c. 1550 CE and the Amazonian Rubber Boom c. 1850 to 1920 CE are largely unexplored but could be important additive influences on forest structure and tree species composition. Using environmental niche models, we show the highest probabilities of pre-Columbian and colonial occupation sites, and hence human-induced ecological influences, occurred in forests along rivers. In many areas, the predicted pre-Columbian and colonial distributions overlap spatially with the potential for superimposed ecological influences. Environmental gradients are known to structure Amazonian vegetation composition, but they are also strong predictors of past human influence, both spatially and temporally. Our comparisons of model outputs with relative abundances of Amazonian tree species suggest that pre-Columbian and colonial-period ecological legacies are associated with modern forest composition.",

Among potential downstream guanine nucleotide-binding G proteins, ADGRL2 selectively activated Gα13. Follow-up tissue knockouts verified that Gα13 is also required for epidermal differentiation. A cryoelectron microscopy structure in lipid nanodiscs showed that ADGRL2 engages with Gα13 at multiple interfaces, including via an interaction between ADGRL2 intracellular loop 3 and a Gα13-specific QQQ glutamine triplet sequence in its GTPase domain. In situ gene mutation of this interface sequence impaired epidermal differentiation, highlighting an essential new role for an ADGRL2-Gα13 axis in epidermal differentiation.",

          "abstract": "We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the Nondeterministic Polynomial Time (NP) complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), hence coined DOCSAT, i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N = 15,000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.",

The data revealed responses that were largely uniform in rTreg, but diverse among aTregs, matching different STAT5 signal transduction efficiency. Individual Tregs displayed divergences in the preponderance of changes that may be attributed to STAT1 or STAT5 signal transduction downstream of IL2. Chromatin analysis identified an evolving implication of transcription factors that accounted for the waves of responsive genes. Covalent cytokine/Ab complexes that preferentially trigger high- (heterotrimer) or low-affinity (heterodimer) IL2 receptors activated the same signatures, yet with strong quantitative variations, especially in NK cells. Thus, IL2 is not a monolithic activator for Tregs, but a variegated sculptor of Treg identity.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is crucial for cellular energy production, metabolism, and signaling. Its dysfunction is implicated in various diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. mtDNA is susceptible to damage by endogenous and environmental factors; however, unlike nuclear DNA (nDNA), mtDNA lesions do not necessarily lead to an increased mutation load in mtDNA. Instead, mtDNA lesions have been implicated in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report a type of mtDNA damage: glutathionylated DNA (GSH-DNA) adducts. These adducts are formed from abasic (AP) sites, key intermediates in base excision repair, or from alkylation DNA damage. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified the GSH-DNA lesion in both nDNA and mtDNA and found its significant accumulation in mtDNA of two different human cell lines, with levels one or two orders of magnitude higher than in nDNA. The formation of GSH-DNA adducts is influenced by TFAM and polyamines, and their levels are regulated by repair enzymes AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1). The accumulation of GSH-DNA adducts is associated with the downregulation of several ribosomal and complex I subunit proteins and the upregulation of proteins related to redox balance and mitochondrial dynamics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the GSH-DNA lesion stabilizes the TFAM-DNA binding, suggesting shielding effects from mtDNA transactions. Collectively, this study provides critical insights into the formation, regulation, and biological effects of GSH-DNA adducts in mtDNA. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding how these lesions may contribute to innate immunity and inflammation.",

Most of these organic molecules have been significantly altered by geologic processes through deep time. Nonetheless, the nature and distribution of those ancient fragmentary organic remains have the potential to reveal diagnostic biomolecular information after billions of years of burial. Here, we analyzed 406 fossil, modern biological, meteoritic, and synthetic samples using pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We explored these analytical data via supervised machine-learning methods to discriminate samples of biogenic vs. abiogenic origin, plant vs. animal phylogenetic affinity, and photosynthetic vs. nonphotosynthetic physiology. Dividing 272 samples with known phylogenetic affinity and physiology into 9 categories, each further divided into 75% training and 25% testing sets, our random forest models accurately predict pairwise assignments of modern vs. fossil or meteoritic organics (100% correct assignments), fossil plant tissues vs. meteoritic organics (97%), modern vs. fossil plant tissues (98%), and modern plants vs. animal tissues (95%). Pairwise comparisons between fossil biogenic samples vs. abiogenic samples resulted in 93% correct classifications, while analysis of modern and ancient photosynthetic vs. nonphotosynthetic samples also resulted in 93% correct assignments. Our analyses demonstrate that molecular biosignatures can survive in ancient fossils and allow for the identification of organismal origins and traits. Consistent with previous morphological and isotopic inferences, we present evidence for biogenic molecular assemblages in Paleoarchean rocks (3.33 Ga) and for photoautotrophy in Neoarchean rocks (2.52 Ga).",

          "abstract": "Chirality is a conserved biological feature with critical implications in tissue morphogenesis and embryonic development. In culture, multicellular groups exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry break when moving collectively on micropatterned surfaces. Although several studies have shown that actin network integrity and actomyosin network contractility contribute to the establishment of the chirality of the movement, the role of contractile forces to the directionality of the chiral bias in collectives remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied the contractile forces produced by a minimal collective constituted of a pair of endothelial cells. We first show that cell doublets confined on disk-shaped micropatterns undergo spontaneous and persistent chiral swirling, displaying a mild but robust clockwise bias, as the one observed in bigger collectives. This bias could be amplified or reversed by modulating contractile forces. Traction force measurements revealed that high forces tend to drive counterclockwise rotation whereas low forces rather favor a clockwise rotation. Furthermore, the study of heterotypic doublets indicates that the direction of the rotation is determined by the more contractile cells within the doublets. These results thus revealed that contractile leader cells could drive the chiral motion of minimal collectives.",

          "abstract": "During autophagy, the contents enclosed within autophagosomes are degraded, while the outer membrane components are recycled from autolysosomes by the recycler complex through the recently discovered autophagosomal components recycling (ACR) process. This recycling is essential for maintaining autophagic activity. However, the molecular machinery and upstream regulatory mechanisms driving this recycling process remain poorly understood. Here, we identify SNX16 as a key component of the recycler complex, which localizes to autolysosomes and is required for ACR. SNX16 functions in ACR by regulating recycler complex formation, facilitating cargo recognition, and mediating the connection between STX17–SNX4–SNX5 and dynein–dynactin complexes. In addition, SNX16–cargo interactions are regulated by two ACR-related small GTPases, Rab32 and Rab38. Importantly, mTORC1 phosphorylates SNX16 to regulate ACR by inhibiting its interactions with STX17 and other recycler components, thus preventing recycler complex formation. Taken together, our findings identify SNX16 as a recycler component and establish a link between mTORC1 and ACR.",

          "abstract": "Axolotls can regenerate lost limbs throughout life, while they continue to grow. This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF8), are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, which eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.",

These effects have long been considered evidence for glassy physics in these and other materials having similar mechanics, such as the cytoskeleton. Here, we study such anomalous mechanics in a simulated wet foam driven by ripening and find behavior that has a different physical origin than that in glasses. Rather, the dynamics is due to a balance of forces from the system’s self-similar potential energy landscape and viscous stress. At the lowest viscosities, bubbles move intermittently, with the system shifting abruptly between shallow potential energy minima. For higher viscosities, in contrast, the bubbles move continuously and the system follows a tortuous, fractal path through high-dimensional configuration space, at higher mean energy than the lower viscosity case. The long-time dynamics and power-law rheology are the direct consequence of the potential energy landscape’s self-similar geometry. Last, we find that the slow recovery of perturbed foams is due to the foam being kinetically rather than energetically trapped in high-energy portions of the energy landscape. Overall, viscous ripening foams follow a biased energy minimization pathway that explores regions of the energy landscape that are qualitatively different (flatter and smoother) than those corresponding to well-annealed glasses.",

Cancer metastasis is regulated by complex crosstalk between tumor cells and niche-derived factors. However, the molecular mechanisms enabling metastatic seeding and outgrowth in the liver remain incompletely understood, representing a major clinical challenge. We identified neuropeptide Y (NPY) as a promotor of liver metastasis. Hepatocyte-derived NPY attracts metastatic tumor cells to the liver niche. Subsequent microenvironment activation induces TGFβ, promoting a vicious cycle of perimetastatic NPY secretion and liver metastasis. Concomitantly, cancer cells upregulate the NPY-5 receptor (Y5R) which is correlated with liver metastasis. NPY-Y5R crosstalk drives chemotactic migration via cAMP and ERK signaling. Moreover, NPY-Y5R activation dephosphorylates checkpoint kinase 2 to promote clonogenicity and proliferation of cancer cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a promising drug delivery vehicle for siRNAs. LNPs carrying siRNA pools targeting NPY were designed, and preclinical studies provided evidence for efficacy for the treatment of liver metastasis.

However, the mechanism for achieving specificity in downstream signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we present cryogenic electron microscopic structures of the S1PR3-G αq complex bound to endogenous agonists: d18:1 S1P or d16:1 S1P. Both agonists shared the same binding pocket and binding mode despite the different signaling intensities of the S1PR3-G αq signal pathway. By comparing the structures of two agonist-bound complexes, combined with mutagenesis studies, we identified key amino acids, Phe119 3.33 and Arg136 3.50 , that play crucial roles in differential agonist recognition and receptor activation. Furthermore, structural comparisons with previously determined S1PR3-G αi complex or G-protein-free S1PR3 structures, along with mutagenesis analysis, revealed dynamic intracellular loop 2 conformations and specific amino acid interactions that contribute to G-protein selectivity. Notably, we identified amino acids at the 34.50 and 34.53 positions within ICL2 as critical for specific interactions with G proteins.

Increased vascular permeability was confirmed in a Gnaq p.R183Q mouse model. Knockdown of elevated angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in EC-R183Q partially restored the EC barrier, as did a MEK1,2 inhibitor, implicating MAPK/ERK signaling. The combination of ANGPT2 knockdown and trametinib further restored the EC barrier in an additive manner. indicating the two operate in separate pathways.

          "abstract": "During photosynthesis, the photosystem II (PSII) enzyme catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water, fueling life on Earth by storing light energy and releasing O 2 as a byproduct. Determining the molecular mechanism for this water oxidation reaction has been of significant interest for the development of synthetic catalysts, but many details remain elusive. One of the open questions is how protons are strategically removed from the active site, a Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster called the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), during the reaction cycle via conserved water channels, and how proton transfer contributes to O–O bond formation energetics. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have investigated the role of conserved amino acid side chains in facilitating proton transfer. One of the most influential mutations is the Val185Asn substitution on the D1 subunit, which substantially slows O 2 release kinetics without abolishing catalytic activity. Forming a molecular understanding of how this mutation affects the active site will provide insight into the water oxidation reaction mechanism. Here, we investigated the structural basis of the Val185Asn substitution by determining a 1.99 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure. We observed that Asn185 orients away from the OEC and donates a H-bond to Cl1, a conserved chloride ion. We furthermore observed an alternative D2-Glu312-facing conformation of the D2-Lys317 side chain in the Cl1 water channel, a conformation that is consistent with recent models for proton transfer. These changes also produce perturbations to the hydrogen-bonding network. Overall, these finding provide insight into proton transfer in the Cl1 channel and its effect on the water oxidation reaction mechanism.",

The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space–time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides insight into the space–time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.",

Measurements were acquired at Jezero Crater, Mars, at midday, retrieving an average ozone column abundance of 3.8 ± 2.3 μm-atm (1σ) around aphelion, which fell below uncertainties in northern summer. The retrieved column abundance is in reasonable agreement with previous space-based and ground-based observations from Earth. The measurements of total ozone column abundance around aphelion from Mars 2020 and other missions, together with vertical profile observations from orbit, indicate that ~90% of the observed ozone is confined below 20 km of altitude, the aphelion layer weakly contributing to the total column abundance. These ozone levels below 20 km are 3 to 4 times higher than those predicted by models, challenging current understanding of atmospheric chemistry and composition in the lower atmosphere of Mars. It may be possible that aerosols are reducing the destruction pathways of ozone and/or that unknown active chemistry in the near-surface atmosphere of Mars is at work.

          "abstract": "Fluorescence in phytoplankton and other autotrophic organisms originates within the cell chloroplasts, where a fraction of the absorbed solar radiation is reemitted at longer wavelengths by photopigments. While traditionally employed as an indicator of physiological status, emerging evidence suggests that natural chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) may also play unanticipated functional roles in the marine environment. Here, we examine the ChlF emission fields generated by pennate planktonic diatoms, a key phytoplankton group playing a critical role in global biogeochemical cycles. Using cell micromanipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the ChlF emitted by Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta (Bacillariophyceae) is markedly anisotropic, a feature attributed to both the cells’ elongated morphology and the arrangement of chloroplasts within the cytoplasm. In these diatoms, fluorescence is preferentially emitted in the transapical direction, accounting for up to 35% of total emission. However, peak ChlF intensities occur at the cell apices, suggesting that the silica frustule focuses fluorescent light emission along the longitudinal axis. At elevated cell densities (~10 6 cells/L), the underwater light field is modulated by the combined effects of ChlF emission anisotropy and preferential alignment of diatom cells within the water column. Numerical simulations indicate that ChlF intensity can vary by up to 15% depending on whether cells are predominantly aligned—commonly in stratified water columns—or randomly oriented. These results suggest that diatom-driven modulation of the light field through structured ChlF emission may influence microscale optical environments, with potential consequences for processes ranging from intercellular signaling to large-scale phytoplankton dynamics, including remote sensing–based assessments of phytoplankton physiology.",

While extensive research has been conducted displaying the ability of coacervates to compartmentalize a wide variety of reactants, products, and catalysts, insight into how reactant, transition state, and product energies are altered within the droplet continues to be an active area of research. One promising strategy for investigating the thermodynamics and kinetics within the coacervate phase is temperature-dependent electrochemistry, which enables the extraction of reaction entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs energy. In this work, we use ferri/ferrocyanide, a well-behaved redox couple that has been proposed to be an essential oxidizing agent in prebiotic Earth, to investigate the microenvironment created by the coacervation of poly-L-lysine and polyuridylic acid. We observe an oxidative shift upon partitioning into the coacervates, which temperature-dependent experiments reveal is due to a 40 J/mol K and an 8 kJ/mol increase in reaction entropy and enthalpy, respectively. We attribute the change in entropy to a highly structured water hydrogen-bonding network within the droplets and, subsequently, around the redox probe. Further, we reveal via in situ Raman measurements that the change in reaction enthalpy is due to the destabilization of the product, ferrocyanide, within the ionic coacervate phase.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which fuels metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy. Through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified multiple heterogeneous tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) subpopulations as key regulators of PDAC progression, which coexpress MRC1 and exert their effects by actively suppressing antitumor immune responses. To overcome this barrier, we developed a spatiotemporal macrophage reprogramming platform that leverages STING phase separation to reprogram TAM plasticity and reshape the immune landscape. This system, MRC1-targeting peptide–M@BLZ945 (PMMB), integrates a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor and a STING agonist within a macrophage-mimetic nanostructure, enabling sequential, controlled reprogramming of TAMs. By leveraging STING phase separation, PMMB stabilizes TAMs in an antitumor CD80 + phenotype while preventing excessive inflammation, achieving durable immune activation. In preclinical models, PMMB not only suppresses both primary and metastatic PDAC but also enhances CD8 + T cell infiltration, reinvigorates anti-PD-1 therapy responses, and mitigates immune exhaustion. These findings establish spatiotemporal macrophage circuit engineering via STING phase separation as a cross-scale strategy to override PDAC’s immune barriers and drive next-generation macrophage-targeted immunotherapy. This study paves the way for rationally designed, precision macrophage modulation strategies in solid tumors.",

          "abstract": "Natural genetic transformation is a conserved mechanism of bacterial horizontal gene transfer, which is directed entirely by the recipient cell and facilitates the acquisition of new genetic traits such as antibiotic resistance. Transformation proceeds via the capture of exogenous DNA, its internalization in single strand form (ssDNA) and its integration into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. While the proteins involved in these steps have mainly been identified, the specific mechanisms at play remain poorly characterized. This study takes advantage of recent advances in structural modeling to explore the uptake of ssDNA during transformation. Using the monoderm human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae , we model a tripartite protein complex composed of the transmembrane channel ComEC, and two cytoplasmic ssDNA-binding proteins ComFA and ComFC. Using targeted mutation and transformation assays, we propose that pneumococcal ComEC features a narrow channel for ssDNA passage, and we show this channel is conserved in the diderm Helicobacter pylori . We identify key residues involved in protein–protein and protein–ssDNA interactions in the pneumococcal tripartite complex model and we show them to be crucial for transformation efficiency. Structural modeling reveals that this tripartite protein complex and its interaction with ssDNA are conserved in Firmicutes. Overall, this study validates a tripartite complex required for the internalization of ssDNA during transformation in Firmicutes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in this horizontal gene transfer mechanism central to bacterial adaptation. It also demonstrates the power of recent structural modeling techniques such as AlphaFold3 as hypothesis generators and guides for designing experiments.",

          "abstract": "During microbial infection, mammalian hosts reduce the availability of free metals such as zinc in a process known as nutritional immunity. Pathogens counteract nutritional immunity by expressing gene products that enhance growth in metal-limited conditions. One of the most transcriptionally induced genes in zinc-limited Neisseria gonorrhoeae , ngo1049, encodes a DUF4198 family protein we have named Zcp. This family of proteins is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we provide the first structural, biochemical, and functional characterization of a DUF4198 protein. Zcp is a periplasmic, homodimeric substrate-binding protein (SBP), which binds one zinc ion per subunit with submicromolar affinity. We identified a zinc binding pocket in each subunit, composed of three histidine residues. Zcp enables maximal growth of N. gonorrhoeae in zinc-limited conditions but is dispensable for zinc uptake, in contrast to the cluster A-I SBP ZnuA, which is required for zinc import. The growth defect of zcp mutant N. gonorrhoeae is rescued by zinc supplementation. Zcp associates with proteins with roles in maintaining cell envelope integrity, and N. gonorrhoeae lacking zcp is more sensitive to envelope-targeting antimicrobials. Zcp enables infectivity of human epithelial cells and neutrophils by zinc-limited N. gonorrhoeae . We conclude that N. gonorrhoeae produces Zcp to buffer periplasmic zinc, which enables ZnuA to balance import of different metals and ensures the bioavailability of zinc for extracytoplasmic zinc-requiring proteins, as part of the coordinated response to host-imposed nutritional immunity.",

          "abstract": "In Xenopus laevis tadpole tail regeneration, lineage-restricted tissue stem cells produce differentiated cells that form regenerated tail tissues, but the behavioral dynamics of tissue stem cells during tail regeneration remain largely unknown. We previously reported that multiple tissue stem/progenitor cells can be efficiently enriched from regeneration buds using the side population (SP) method. Here, we performed trajectory inference using single-cell RNA sequencing data of the SP fraction to construct differentiation trajectories and identify putative tissue stem cell populations that initiate differentiation pathways. We found that complement c1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 ( c1qtnf3 ) is specifically expressed in putative muscle stem cells (MSC) and, using knockdown (KD; CRISPR/Cas9-based F0 crispants) experiments, demonstrated that c1qtnf3 is necessary for tail regeneration. Furthermore, we found that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD was accompanied by abrogation of macrophage-like cell accumulation at the amputation site. These phenotypes were rescued by macrophage-like cell-specific forced expression of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 , a gene related to effector molecule production in myeloid cells, suggesting that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD is due to macrophage dysregulation. Our findings suggest that, in Xenopus , putative MSC modulate macrophage function via c1qtnf3 expression for successful tail regeneration.",

We determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) AGO1 and the recurrent, severe causative ΔF180 mutant. AGO1(ΔF180) unexpectedly rearranges the hydrophobic core of the L1 domain to preserve the overall RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) architecture and recognize guide RNAs similarly to WT. Functionally, the mutant binds target RNAs like WT but more frequently retains passenger strands, implicating a defect in RISC assembly. Biochemical assays of ΔF180 and L190P mutants revealed normal duplex loading but impaired passenger ejection, exposing guide 3′ ends to 3′→5′ exonucleases and generating abnormally short ~11-nucleotide RNAs. In cells, AGO1(ΔF180), AGO1(G199S), and corresponding AGO2 mutants likewise produced truncated guides. Together, these findings support a model in which defective passenger ejection underlies the pathology of AGO-associated NDDs by rendering microRNAs bound to AGO syndrome mutants susceptible to aberrant 3′ trimming.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of carbon and nutrient dynamics in globally vast and socioeconomically critical dryland ecosystems lags behind mesic systems. Litter decomposition models consistently underestimate measured decomposition in these regions. Both models and measurements largely represent spatially dominant intercanopy areas; however, little litter resides in these interspaces as transport vectors move litter to other microsites such as beneath plant canopies and buried in soil. Abiotic and biotic conditions differ among microsites, but few studies have characterized microsite impacts on decomposition. We collated data on microsites where litter accumulates. In microsites with sufficient available data, we used meta-analysis to test hypotheses on decomposition relative to litter in intercanopy spaces. Decomposition was lower under woody plant canopies than in intercanopy spaces. Buried litter decomposed faster than surface litter. There was no difference in decomposition between surface litter and litter suspended aboveground to simulate standing dead. All microsite contrasts had exceptions, suggesting that site-specific characteristics influence microclimate and subsequent decomposition. Extrapolation of decomposition rates to the landscape-level (using estimates of microsite-specific decomposition rates multiplied by litter pools), suggests that decomposition estimates based on intercanopy data alone underrepresent landscape-level decomposition. Thus, despite advances in the understanding of mechanistic decomposition drivers in drylands advancing, most studies are spatially unrepresentative analyses in intercanopy areas and this will underestimate decomposition at the landscape level. Expanding the ecological relevance of decomposition processes to be useful for predicting larger-scale carbon and nutrient dynamics requires improved characterization of dryland litter distribution, coupled with a mechanistic understanding of decomposition in microsites where litter accumulates.",

However, existing experimental techniques lack the capability to directly observe heterogeneous structural evolution and intercomponent interactions under controlled conditions that closely mimic realistic nonequilibrium thermal fronts. Consequently, theoretical models, which assume equilibrium conditions or neglect dynamic structural evolution, remain insufficiently validated and cannot accurately predict these critical transformation pathways. Here, we developed a gradiated fast-heating system (&gt;20 °C/s) enabling precise control of heating rate gradients within submillimeter transition regions in a single specimen, seamlessly integrated with sequential synchrotron X-ray tomography and radiography to directly visualize internal structural evolution. This approach allowed capture of diverse structural transformation pathways spanning microsecond-to-millisecond timescales under distinct nonequilibrium thermal conditions, revealing the complete sequence from initial pyrolysis through ignition to final burnout. We found that local heating rates, rather than bulk temperatures, dictate void formation dynamics and fragmentation pathways. In regions with high local heating rates, rapid void nucleation within the binder phase created reticulated porous networks, evolving four times faster than curved interfacial voids observed in adjacent regions experiencing lower heating rates. Furthermore, a cascade of heterogeneous component interactions subsequently fragmented the metallic network into isolated clusters, seeding critical ignition hotspots that governed combustion initiation and propagation mechanisms. These findings indicate that kinetic processes, influenced notably by heating rate, play an important role in mesostructural evolution under nonequilibrium conditions.",

          "abstract": "Metabolically versatile Pseudomonas species can assimilate various glycolytic and gluconeogenic substrates. Simultaneous assimilation is known to segregate carbons from each substrate type into different metabolic pathways. However, the mechanisms of this metabolic segregation remain unresolved. Here, we investigate Pseudomonas putida KT2440 during processing of the sugar glucose through glycolysis versus the phenolic acid ferulate through gluconeogenesis. Metabolome profiling reveals up to twofold less tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites but up to 10-fold higher metabolites of upper glycolysis, pentose-phosphate, and Entner–Doudoroff pathways in glucose-grown cells compared to ferulate-grown cells. After 13 C-substrate switching, kinetic isotopic profiling captures rapid assimilation of new substrate carbons into initial catabolic pathways, but incorporation into downstream pathways is absent or incomplete. Proteomics identifies a 22-fold higher abundance of one homolog of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, GapA) in cells fed on glucose relative to ferulate, while abundance of another homolog (GapB) remains unchanged. Growth phenotypes and quantitative metabolomics for single and double knockout mutants of these GAPDH homologs indicate only GapA involvement in glycolytic flux, which can be compensated by the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and distinct preference of GapB with minimal role of GapA for gluconeogenic flux. Accordingly, growth of triple knockout mutant with deletion of gapA , gapB , and edd is possible only when glycolytic and gluconeogenic substrates are provided together to meet metabolic demands in a segregated fashion, but metabolic tradeoffs lead to slow growth. A mathematical, experimentally constrained, model of the GAPDH node shows that tuning of GapA and GapB concentrations enables transition between flux regimes for nutritional adaptability.",

We report that beyond its function of degrading poly-ubiquitinylated proteins, the immunoproteasome (i-20S) is required for the proper function of ILC2s by controlling their mitochondrial capacity. We found that 90% of the catalytic β subunits of proteasomes in human ILC2s (hILC2s) are the immuno- (β5i) rather than constitutive (β5c) isoform. Specific, noncovalent, reversible inhibition of i-20S β5i (LMP7) in hILC2s induced ROS production, which inhibited aconitase, leading to altered mitochondrial function and reduced levels of ATP. Reprogramming of metabolic status by an LMP7 inhibitor impaired ILC2 activation, without significant cytotoxicity or preventing their recovery. Hence, the selective inhibition of i-20S in ILC2 cells did not kill them but reversibly depleted their ATP, preventing their activation and cytokine secretion. In mice, proteasome inhibition similarly blocked mitochondrial function and ILC2 activation, preventing airway inflammation in response to IL33 and asthma in response to house dust mites. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated linkage between proteasome blockade, central carbon metabolism, and mitochondrial function and identify a strategy to regulate immune cell metabolism in inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Paleolithic representations of human–animal interaction are rare, with only a few painted or engraved examples recorded in Upper Paleolithic contexts, mostly from Europe. Such scenes, depicting real or imagined interactions, are of major importance for understanding a wide range of past human perspectives, starting with how people conceived of their ontological relationship with the environment and nonhuman beings. In the Early Neolithic in Southwest Asia, shifts in perspective led human communities to manipulate and transform their environment while simultaneously depicting new forms of art featuring human–animal interactions. Here, we describe the recent discovery of the earliest figurine depicting a human–animal interaction—a woman and a goose—from the Late Epipaleolithic (c. 12,000 years cal. BP) village of Nahal Ein Gev II in northern Israel. The artistic techniques and raw materials that were used and the mythological scene that was depicted appear earlier than previous examples, foreshadowing the more monumental changes in symbolic expression that occur in the following Neolithic periods. Through technological, archaeometric, and dermatoglyphic analyses, we demonstrate that this unique figurine was meticulously modeled from clay using innovative techniques that created perspective using form and light. Importantly, the figurine captures a mythological scene between the woman and the goose that is consistent with an animistic belief system. Through our combined multidisciplinary approach, this study provides important original data regarding the antiquity and development of symbolic expression using clay at the end of the Epipaleolithic at a crossroads between early sedentary and fully Neolithic societies in Southwest Asia.",

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests combining physical activity with cognitive tasks may have been critical to human evolution and may be beneficial to human brain health today. These combined tasks are key elements of foraging, a lifestyle employed by human ancestors for over 2 My. However, it is unclear whether cognitive engagement during foraging-like tasks impacts endurance, and therefore foraging performance, and whether cognitive adaptations may mitigate these effects. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive engagement during endurance walking increases perceived physical effort without influencing physiological responses, and that enhanced cognition mitigates these effects. Thirty healthy adults ( n female = 17; aged 18 to 53) underwent nonlocomotor cognitive testing and completed two separate randomized endurance tests: one without (Ex) and one with simultaneous executive function tasks (ExCog). For each condition, participants walked on a treadmill for up to 30-min while physiological responses were recorded, and perception of effort was assessed every 2-min using Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale. During the ExCog condition, RPE was significantly greater ( P = 0.005), while energy expenditure was significantly lower ( P = 0.008) compared to the Ex condition. Additionally, we observed significant interactions between cognitive abilities and endurance performance—for example, individuals with greater visuospatial abilities experienced a smaller increase in perceived effort (RPE) in the ExCog condition compared to the Ex condition (FDR P = 0.039). These results indicate that cognitive demands and cognitive abilities associated with foraging distinctly influence endurance, suggesting that evolutionary shifts in human cognitive capacities may have relaxed constraints on endurance foraging performance.",

          "abstract": "The spatial organization of chromatin is governed by epigenetic factors, including epigenetic marks and the reader proteins that bind them. By dictating the accessibility of genomic loci, epigenetic factors contribute to the physical regulation of gene expression, enabling diverse cellular phenotypes to be encoded by a shared genome in an individual. Epigenetic dysregulation can lead to aberrations in chromatin architecture, contributing to diseases such as neurological disorders and cancers. Despite the known importance of chromatin organization for human health, the physical mechanisms governing chromatin folding remain underspecified. In this work, we develop a physical model of chromatin organization based on contributions from multiple epigenetic factors. Using our model, we evaluate how conditions in the nuclear environment and crosstalk between epigenetic marks affect the compartmentalization of chromatin into dense heterochromatin and loose euchromatin. Our results emphasize the role of reader protein binding in chromatin compartmentalization. We show that reader proteins interact through an indirect mechanism facilitated by the shared chromatin “scaffold” to which they bind. Under a scenario where reader proteins compete for binding sites, we find that indirect interactions affect the program adopted by the chromatin fiber. By isolating indirect modes of epigenetic crosstalk, we demonstrate how the interplay between epigenetic patterning and environmental factors influences chromatin architecture.",

NDRG3 binds via its C-terminal domain to the N-terminal domain of the long isoform of Stx5, thereby impairing ER-to-Golgi trafficking under hypoxic conditions and elevated intracellular lactate levels. In NDRG3-deficient cells, hypoxia- and lactate-induced inhibition of ER-to-Golgi trafficking is abolished.

          "abstract": "Pain is a multifaceted experience that not only impacts individuals physiologically but also reshapes their emotional well-being and social dynamics. The expression of pain and postpain emotional states is profoundly influenced by social contexts. Recent research has highlighted the pivotal role of social rewards—including empathy, support, and acceptance—in modulating both pain perception and subsequent negative emotional responses. However, how direct manipulation of brain circuits that govern social behaviors and social rewards impacts pain and negative emotional responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated whether direct activation of a newly identified noncanonical social reward circuit—specifically, the projections from the medial amygdala (MeA) to the medial preoptic area (MPOA)—can mitigate pain-related emotional and behavioral responses. Our findings demonstrated that both optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in the MeA significantly reduced freezing and anxiety-like behaviors after shock period as well as pain responses in the hotplate test in both male and female mice. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of the MeA-to-MPOA circuit produced similar behavioral outcomes. Together, our study expands the understanding of neural circuits underlying pain modulation and highlights the critical need to incorporate social and psychological factors into therapeutic approaches designed to improve human health and well-being.",

However, the impact of Scn2a haploinsufficiency on dendritic signaling in vivo, particularly during behavior, is unknown. In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to image dendritic calcium transients in deep layer pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. Scn2a +/− mice had diminished coupling between apical and proximal dendritic compartments. Pyramidal tract neurons had abnormal event rates, while intratelencephalic neurons had compartment-specific alterations indicative of diminished dendritic integration. In a matching pennies task, Scn2a +/− mice were inflexible in the face of changing competitive pressure. Apical dendritic tuft in intratelencephalic neurons typically encoded reward and strategy, but these task-specific representations were altered in Scn2a +/− mice. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that Scn2a haploinsufficiency weakens dendritic integration in vivo and disrupts dendritic encoding of task variables during flexible decision-making.",

However, the mechanism by which OST1 regulates SLAC1 activation and its relationship with CPKs remain unclear. Here, we identify that OST1 primarily activates SLAC1 in this process through CPK15. Mutation of CPK15 significantly impairs ABA-induced stomatal closure and increases drought sensitivity. OST1 interacts with CPK15 and phosphorylates it at T103, which is essential for ABA-induced stomatal closure. Moreover, CPK15 can phosphorylate eight sites in the N terminus of SLAC1 to activate its anion currents in oocytes. Expression of SLAC1 8D (a phosphomimetic form) in oocytes constitutively activates anion channel activity and effectively restores the impaired ABA-induced stomatal closure of cpk15-1 but not by SLAC1 8A (a phospho-dead form). Furthermore, activated CPK15 by OST1 and Ca 2+ enhances its activity toward SLAC1, and mutations of both OST1 and CPK15 have additive effect on ABA-induced stomatal closure, suggesting that CPK15 activates SLAC1 through both direct and indirect mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the key role of CPK15 in ABA-induced stomatal closure, revealing a connection between OST1 and CPKs in both Ca 2+ -independent and Ca 2+ -dependent pathways in ABA-induced stomatal closure.",

          "abstract": "DNA polymerase theta (Pol θ)-mediated end joining (TMEJ) initiates DNA double-strand break repair by using short homologies (microhomologies) between single-stranded DNA tails. This repair process is particularly important in cancer cells defective in homologous recombination. The exonuclease function of DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) has been identified as an essential component for TMEJ, functioning to remove unpaired bases flanking a microhomology (MH). It is not known if the exonuclease removes all unpaired bases at once and how this removal might affect subsequent MH selection. Here, we reconstituted a functional TMEJ repair process using purified human Pol θ and Pol δ. We find that when Pol δ exonuclease excises a nucleotide to generate a new 3′ terminus, Pol θ initiates a new MH search. Pol δ exonuclease removes a single nucleotide at a time, rather than cleaving an unpaired flap, and then transfers the DNA tail to the polymerase site of Pol θ. Specific primer-grasp amino acids in the polymerase domain of Pol θ are important for internal MH anchoring. The helicase-like domain of Pol θ harbors two activities which are recapitulated in reconstituted reactions: strand-capture to bring single-strand tails together and an ATPase activity that alleviates suppression of TMEJ by ssDNA binding protein RPA. This functional reconstitution of TMEJ advances the understanding of how two polymerases with three enzymatic activities orchestrate double-strand break repair.",

          "abstract": "Cell migration relies on balancing focal adhesion (FA) stability—necessary for traction generation—and turnover—essential for forward translocation. Here, we dissect how integrin binding frequency and force-dependent bond duration jointly regulate this balance in fibroblasts. Using block copolymer micelle nanolithography, we create gold nanoparticle (Au NP) arrays with controlled spacings to vary integrin–ligand binding frequency. In parallel, tension gauge tethers (TGTs) with defined force threshold limit bond lifetime of high-force integrins under cellular traction. We find that intermediate ligand spacing coupled with a moderate rupture threshold dramatically accelerates fibroblast migration—up to twelvefold faster than on denser or sparser substrates. These conditions foster rapid FA turnover and support a dendritic actin architecture driven by lamellipodia, challenging the longstanding view of fibroblasts as inherently slow, mesenchymal movers. Knockout and blocking experiments further identify α5β1 as the mechanically dominant integrin subtype that plays a pivotal role in supporting this rapid migration. Mechanistically, FAs remain sufficiently stable to generate traction but also disassemble quickly, fostering continuous protrusion–retraction cycles essential for high-speed migration. These findings refine the classic biphasic model of cell migration into a two-dimensional framework that considers ligand spacing (binding frequency) and TGT force thresholds (binding duration). Beyond expanding fundamental understanding of integrin mechanobiology, our results provide broad avenues for tissue engineering and therapeutic applications, where finely tuned adhesion mechanics can markedly modulate cell speed and phenotype.",

We also discuss the implications of this algorithm to related problems in shape analysis, such as shape inversion and subshape selection.

The remarkable diversity of male sexual behaviors among Drosophila species, despite their recent divergence, offers an excellent model for addressing this question. Here, by harnessing single-cell transcriptomics of the sexual circuits labeled by the sex determination gene doublesex ( dsx ) at high resolution, we delineated 84 molecularly distinct dsx + cell types, each mapped to anatomically and functionally defined dsx + neural populations. Our findings revealed a largely conserved cellular architecture, with minimal evolutionary gain or loss of cell types across four Drosophila species. A detailed comparison between Drosophila melanogaster ( D. melanogaster ) and D. yakuba uncovered pervasive heterogeneity in transcriptomic divergence among dsx + cell types. While core cell type identities—defined by the sex determination gene fruitless ( fru ), neurotransmitters, monoamines, and transcription factors—remain highly conserved, we observed striking evolutionary turnover in neuropeptide signaling pathways in a highly cell-type-specific manner, underscoring the role of functional reconfiguration of conserved circuits in behavioral evolution. Further investigation of sex differences in dsx + neurons revealed that male-specific cell types are not more evolutionarily divergent than sex-unbiased ones. Finally, we developed an interactive web resource for data access and characterized marker gene combinations enabling cell-type-specific labeling. Overall, our study provides insights into how neural circuits evolve to encode behavioral diversity and establishes a high-resolution framework for understanding the cellular basis of behavioral adaptation.",

In all domains of life, protein–protein interactions at the replisome maintain proximity between the enzymes that catalyze these two activities. Surprisingly, in bacteria, the replicative DNA polymerase (Pol III), responsible for DNA synthesis, is exchanged every few seconds. How processive synthesis is maintained under these conditions has remained unclear. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy in live cells to show that Pol III rapidly rebinds the replisome within seconds of dissociation. This fast recruitment is driven by an interaction with single-stranded DNA–binding protein (SSB), which enhances Pol III target search efficiency by ~20-fold. Disrupting this mechanism alters replisome stoichiometry, causes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation, depletes free SSB, and leads to helicase disassembly and DNA breakage, culminating in genome instability.

However, how thalamus–cortex interactions influence human cortical development remains unknown primarily because of the inaccessibility of the human embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate thalamus-dependent gene expression, circuit organization, and neural activity during corticogenesis using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs). Human cortical (hCOs) and thalamic organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited region-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal activity. Upon the fusion of these organoids, hThCAs reconstructed reciprocal thalamus–cortex axonal projections and synaptic connections. Transcriptomic analysis revealed thalamus-dependent acceleration of cortical maturation, with upregulation of programs linked to axon development, subplate/cortical plate identity, and activity-regulated genes. Histological analysis showed expanded progenitor pools and increased deep-layer neurons within hThCAs. Wide-field Ca 2+ imaging demonstrated that wave-like activity originated in the thalamic region and propagated to the cortical region. Furthermore, two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of cortical neurons revealed that synchronous activity emerged exclusively in pyramidal tract neurons and corticothalamic neurons, whereas intratelencephalic neurons remain asynchronous, highlighting cell type–specific circuit integration within hThCAs. These synchronized events were absent in isolated hCOs or in cortico–cortical assembloids, underscoring the specificity of thalamic input. Our findings suggest that diffusible thalamic cues broadly enhance progenitor expansion, while long-range thalamic input organizes cell type–specific synchronous activity. This study demonstrates the thalamus-dependent acquisition of mature cortical phenotypes in a cell type–specific manner in hThCAs, establishing developmental mechanisms linking regional interactions and cell type–specific circuit specification.",

          "abstract": "The contribution of Thwaites Glacier, Antarctica, to sea level rise is influenced by how quickly warm salty seawater of Circumpolar Deep Water origin melts basal ice near its grounding line. Satellite observations reveal tidally forced kilometer-scale seawater intrusions beneath grounded ice that form an “Ice Grounding Zone” (IGZ) where ice melts vigorously. Although melt rates have been measured at selected sites using Automated phase-sensitive Radar Echo Sounders (ApRES) and Automated Underwater Vehicle (AUV) instruments, their spatial distribution and total magnitude within the IGZ remain uncertain. Here, we present 2D high-resolution simulations of the melt regime of Thwaites Glacier using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology global circulation model ocean model. The model predicts high melt at the entrance of the IGZ, with a quadratic decay inside the IGZ, a linear increase with ocean thermal forcing and a sublinear increase with cavity length. On the slow-moving Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf, the modeled melt rate is low (10 m/y) due to a flat, shallow ice base, in agreement with in situ observations from AUV and ApRES instruments. On the Thwaites Glacier Tongue (TGT), the modeled melt rate is high (50 m/y) due to a steeper and deeper ice base. The modeled melt rates are consistent with the estimates derived from the satellite. Hence, multiple lines of evidence indicate high melt in the IGZ of TGT, which controls 80% of the glacier mass balance. An updated representation of grounding zones in ice sheet models including seawater intrusions will increase their sensitivity to ocean warming and will revise sea-level projections upward.",

Here, we find recombinant human DDHD2 preferentially hydrolyzes diacylglycerol (DAG) over phospholipids, with a slight preference for DAG over triacylglycerol (TAG). DDHD2 also exhibits transacylase activity, which enables transfer of acyl chains from TAGs to DAGs and monoacylglycerols to remodel the acyl chains of TAGs. A predicted hydrophobic amphipathic helix on DDHD2 is essential for lipid droplet binding in vitro and in cells, and its lack reduces the enzymatic activity and TAG acyl chain remodeling. Adipose triglyceride lipase, but not hormone sensitive lipase, also has transacylation activity and can remodel TAG acyl chains, but to a lesser extent than DDHD2. Taken together, this provides evidence that DDHD2 is a neutral lipid lipase and transacylase whose broad specificity enables TAG acyl-chain remodeling.",

It represents evidence hitherto unavailable, both for this species and the human fossil record in general, and sheds light on the possible influence of respiratory adaptations on the characteristic Neanderthal facial morphology. Part of the debate has revolved around inner nasal traits proposed as unique adaptations (autapomorphies) of the species Homo neanderthalensis in relation to cold climate, specifically: a vertically oriented medial projection and a medial swelling on the nasal cavity wall alongside the lack of an ossified roof over the lacrimal groove. The lack of complete anatomy in the Neanderthal fossil record further livened the discussion regarding their occurrence. With the description and analysis of this unique finding, we can rule out the existence of such features. In addition, our observations corroborate the hypothesis that the characteristic midfacial morphology of H. neanderthalensis (i.e., the midfacial prognathism) is the result of a combination of factors and not a direct result of respiratory adaptations in the upper airways. Finally, our data provide an enhanced perspective for modeling Neanderthal respiratory performances.",

Acute mortality, due to obstruction, perforation, or torsion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, has been confirmed via necropsy in all three taxa; however, quantitative risk assessment for macroplastic ingestion poses unique challenges, with risk more dependent on probability of discrete events involving diverse plastic types rather than cumulative exposure models (e.g., LC 50 ). We model mortality risk associated with macroplastic ingestion in seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles, using data from more than 10,000 necropsies reported in the academic literature and stranding network databases. Employing an adapted Weibull Accelerated Failure Time model, we assess the relationship between the GI load (pieces and volume/animal length) of different plastic types—hard, soft, rubber, or fishing debris—and likelihood of plastic-induced mortality. Overall, 35% of seabirds, 12% of marine mammals, and 47% of sea turtles ingested plastic, and 1.6%, 0.7%, and 4.4% died from plastic, respectively. When modeling plastic together, a 90% chance of mortality was associated with 23 pieces (0.098 cm 3 /cm) in seabirds, 29 pieces (39.89 cm 3 /cm) in marine mammals, and 405 pieces (5.52 cm 3 /cm) in sea turtles (377 for juveniles). The plastic types that posed the greatest risks were rubber for seabirds, soft plastics and fishing debris for marine mammals, and hard and soft plastics for sea turtles. This research furthers scientific understanding of the likelihood of mortality from plastic ingestion and can inform monitoring, risk assessments, and management frameworks.",

Here, we investigate the developing connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Our model’s predictions of the synaptic connections and their strength, using multiple reconstructions of adult worms, reflect that it identified much of the shared part of the connectivity graph. Thus, the accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.",

However, to date, a comprehensive pharmacological assessment of the downstream signaling outcomes of PAC1sR activation compared to PAC1nR has not been performed, and little information is available to mechanistically understand how ECD splicing may alter ligand engagement.

Cryo-EM structures of VIP-bound, stimulatory G protein (G s )-coupled PAC1sR and PAC1nR, supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrate transient engagement of the null loop in PAC1nR, which is absent in PAC1sR, with residues in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and the N-terminal helix of the ECD. These interactions result in differential engagement of VIP with these domains and the top of TM2/ECL1 with PAC1sR and PAC1nR. Moreover, MD simulations predicted differential interactions of the G s protein with the two PAC1R variants when bound by VIP that correlate with a greater allosteric influence of the G s protein on VIP affinity at the PAC1sR, relative to PAC1nR. Our study provides insights into the structural basis and functional consequences of PAC1R ECD splicing, increasing understanding of PAC1R ligand selectivity and signaling.",

          "abstract": "Structured population projection models are fundamental to many fields of science. They enable abundance forecasting for populations categorized by various traits such as age (for demography), patch (for spatial ecology), genotype (for genetics), infectious stage (for epidemiology), or capital (economics). The demography of a structured population, determined by the transition rates (e.g., survival, fertility) between its various classes, also shapes its relatedness—or kinship—structure. This structure (a probabilistic genealogy) is crucial for understanding how individuals are related to the rest of the population and affects effective population size, inclusive fitness, inbreeding, pedigrees, relatedness, familial structures, etc. Due to its significance, Kinship Demography, the study of the relationship between transition rates and kinship structure, is currently among the most actively growing areas of demography. In this manuscript, by incorporating the generation number as a trait into the population structure, we derive the Kinship Formula, yielding the expected number of any kin for any structured population. This formula is simple to implement and fast to compute, even for complex models and distant kin relationships. Most importantly, it promises significant theoretical advances. From the Kinship Formula, one can, for instance, assess the impact of embedded processes (e.g., dispersal, inheritance, growth) on kinship, compute mean population relatedness and the eventual number of kin (including kin already dead or not born yet). The Kinship Formula derived here stems from a one-sex constant environment framework. Its simplicity should allow for extensions to include environmental and demographic stochasticity as well as two-sex models.",

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Aβ) undergoes posttranslational glycation to produce glycated Aβ (gAβ), yet its pathological role remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that gAβ promotes neuronal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) efflux via a VDAC1-dependent mechanism, activating the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway. Using aged AD mice and human AD brain samples, we observed cGAS-mtDNA binding and cGAS-STING activation in the neuronal cytoplasm. Knockdown of RAGE, cGAS, or STING, as well as pharmacological inhibition of VDAC1, protected APP mice from mitochondrial dysfunction and Alzheimer’s-like pathology. Neuron-specific cGAS knockdown confirmed its pivotal role in driving neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. Treatment with ALT-711, an AGE cross-link breaker, alleviated gAβ-associated pathology. Furthermore, RAGE inhibition in APP knock-in mice suppressed innate immune activation and disease-associated gene expression, as revealed by spatially resolved transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings establish a mechanistic link between gAβ and innate immune activation, identifying VDAC1, the AGE-RAGE axis, and the cGAS-STING pathway as promising therapeutic targets in AD.",

Recent advances in Mg 3 Bi 2 -based thermoelectric materials have revealed exceptional room-temperature ductility in these compounds. However, the origin of their plastic behavior remains elusive. Herein, we report a pronounced in-plane plastic anisotropy in single-crystalline Mg 3 Bi 2 . Micropillar compression reveals that the observed anisotropy is critically dependent on the activation of single versus double slip systems, and superior plastic deformability can be achieved once the double slip system is activated. The interatomic potential for Mg 3 Bi 2 was developed via the machine learning approach, and molecular dynamics simulations establish that the crystallographic orientation-dependent activation of competing slip systems constitutes the fundamental origin of the plastic anisotropy in Mg 3 Bi 2 .

          "abstract": "Actin networks in cells are dynamic and constantly turning over as actin subunits exchange between monomer and polymer pools. Understanding these dynamics in vivo requires a detailed understanding of pure actin behavior in vitro. The prevailing model is treadmilling, which predicts continuous growth of filament barbed ends balanced by continuous shrinkage of pointed ends, while filament length remains roughly constant. While treadmilling has been observed directly at the level of single filaments, length fluctuations—expressed as “length diffusivity”—are much greater than expected, and the origin of these high diffusivity values could not be identified experimentally. By imaging single filaments tethered to glass via α-actinin, we observed frequent, low-amplitude barbed-end fluctuations of ±2–6 subunits per event and rarer, high-amplitude fluctuations of ±50–150 subunits per event. Barbed-end fluctuations depended on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and were blocked by phalloidin and barbed-end capping agents. Barbed-end fluctuations consumed an estimated one-third of the ATP at steady state, while two-thirds is still consumed by treadmilling. Fluctuations result in diffusive spreading of filament lengths that exceeds predictions from pure treadmilling yet is lower than previously reported values, suggesting that earlier measurements captured additional sources of variability. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for kinetic models that proposed a dampened form of dynamic instability in pure actin where transient loss of the ATP/ADP•Pi barbed-end cap leads to rare, large excursions superimposed on more frequent, small fluctuations.",

This pivotal enzyme has long been observed to be kinetically constrained. Yet, this impression is based on kinetic measurements heavily focused on eukaryotic rubiscos, a rather conserved group of low genetic diversity. Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes. Could there be yet faster rubiscos among the uncharted regions of rubisco’s phylogenetic diversity? Here, we perform a characterization of more than 250 rubiscos from a wide range of bacteria and archaea, thereby doubling the coverage of the diversity of this key enzyme. We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO 2 , and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding ≈30 reactions per second at 30 °C. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO 2 concentrating mechanism. Leveraging a simple machine learning model trained on this dataset, we predict the carboxylation rate for all ≈68,000 sequenced rubisco variants found in nature to date. This study provides the largest and most diverse dataset of natural variants for an enzyme and their associated rates, establishing a solid benchmark for future efforts to predict catalytic rates from sequence data.",

          "abstract": "Amid the biodiversity crisis, functional diversity, which is critical for ecosystem stability and conservation planning—faces challenges due to species’ complex life cycles. As the majority of animals, species with complex life histories may have distinct traits and ecological functions at different stages. Using all 557 Chinese anurans, we tested whether adult-based conservation protects entire taxa by analyzing functional trait diversity across life stages. We compiled adult and tadpole traits, mapped spatial diversity patterns, identified hotspots, recognized conservation priority species based on traits at different stages, and tested whether integrating information from different life history stages can effectively conserve functional diversity. Results showed functional diversity hotspots of adults and tadpoles are different. Species’ functional uniqueness between stages were not correlated, with only 18.8% species overlapped in conservation priority lists. Meanwhile, conservation strategies prioritizing species based on adult traits failed to protect tadpole functional diversity. The extent of functional diversity covered by these species was similar to that of randomly chosen species. These findings reject the hypothesis that conservation strategies made based on information of adults can adequately protect whole taxa. Nevertheless, when information from both stages is integrated, the conservation effectiveness has significantly improved. Thus, comprehensive biodiversity protection requires integrated assessments of all stages.",

However, a microscopic description of the photoproducts originating from ultraviolet (UV) absorption and emission processes has remained elusive. Here, we explore the photochemistry of ice using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory on various models of pristine and defective ice Ih. Our investigation of the excited state potential energy surface of the crystal shows that UV absorption can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals, and excess electrons. One of the dominant mechanisms of decay from the excited to the ground-state involves the recombination of the electron with the hydroxyl radical yielding hydronium-hydroxide ion-pairs. We find that the details of this charge recombination process sensitively depend on the presence of defects in the lattice, such as vacancies and preexisting photoproducts. We also observe the formation of Bjerrum defects following UV absorption; we suggest that, together with hydroxide anions, they are likely responsible for prominent features experimentally detected in long UV exposure absorption spectra, remarkably red-shifted relative to short exposure spectra. Our results highlight the key role of defects in determining the onset of absorption and emission processes in ice.",

Here, we elucidate the structural basis and evolutionary emergence of Lamassu, a bacterial immune system family featuring diverse effectors but a core conserved SMC-like sensor. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of the Vibrio cholerae Lamassu complex in both apo- and dsDNA-bound states, revealing unexpected stoichiometry and topological architectures. We further demonstrate how Lamassu specifically senses dsDNA ends in vitro and phage replication origins in vivo, thereby triggering the formation of LmuA tetramers that activate its Cap4 nuclease domain. Our findings reveal that Lamassu evolved via exaptation of the bacterial Rad50-Mre11 DNA repair system to form a compact, modular sensor for viral replication, exemplifying how cellular machinery can be co-opted for novel immune functions.",

The small magnitude of these interactions underlies the rapid reversibility of HOTS on the timescale of membrane signaling processes, permitting the dynamic modulation of signals. At the same time, weak interactions present an apparent paradox: HOTS should form only if the concentration of a particular protein is sufficiently high to produce oligomerization by mass action. And yet, HOTS are observed experimentally with membrane proteins present in cell membranes at concentrations of only a few per μ m 2 . In this study, we employ principles of statistical thermodynamics to explain how cells can alter the configurational entropy of the oligomerization reaction, thereby achieving HOTS formation at low concentrations of the protein in the membrane. We propose that this modification of the configurational entropy, a process we call configurational length scaling, is an important aspect of HOTS formation in cell membranes and possibly other cellular compartments.",

However, limited costimulatory signaling essential for sustained T cell effector activity may limit CD3 TCE clinical efficacy and response duration. The CD2 receptor is an attractive costimulation target owing to its association with T cell receptor signaling and favorable expression profile. We show that CD2 costimulation is superior in maintaining T cell viability and effector function relative to other pathways in in vitro chronic stimulation assays. The extracellular domain of CD58, the predominant CD2 ligand, is functional as an antibody fusion, improving bispecific potency. We observe that higher CD3 affinity molecules have the potential for superagonism in the context of an integrated CD2 agonist. Evaluation of TCEs with integrated CD2 costimulation and attenuated CD3 binding identified optimal CD3 affinity agonists that avoid target-independent T cell activation and demonstrated an increased therapeutic index relative to nonattenuated CD3 agonists. This platform shows increased tumor-killing efficacy as compared to CD3 affinity-matched bispecifics for known tumor targets such as HER2, CD20, B7-H4, and UL16-binding protein 2 (ULBP2). We demonstrate that ULBP2-targeted trispecifics with integrated CD2 costimulation and optimized CD3 affinity are superior to higher-affinity CD3 molecules in in vivo mouse efficacy studies. This integrated CD2 costimulation platform, which we termed EVOLVE, represents a next-generation TCE platform to increase T cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment and has the potential to address unmet patient needs by improving the depth and durability of clinical antitumor T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "While multiple chromatin-based epigenetic pathways are well characterized, their genome-wide coordination and hierarchical interplay remain poorly understood. We previously identified the BAH–PHD–CPL2 complex, where AIPP3 binds H3K27me3 via its BAH domain and, in concert with PHD2 and PHD3 (PHD2/3), recruits CPL2 to repress transcription by dephosphorylating RNA Polymerase II. Here, we show that CPL2 and PHD2/3 form a distinct module (CPL2–PHD2/3) that safeguards CHH DNA methylation and silences CHH-methylated sites at transposable elements (TEs) through engagement of multiple DNA methylation pathways. The CPL2–PHD2/3 module physically associates with SUVH4 and SUVH5 (SUVH4/5) to preserve SUVH4/5–CMT2-mediated CHH methylation at a subset of H3K9me2-marked regions. Chromatin enrichment of PHD3 likewise enables the module to sustain RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated CHH DNA methylation at sites bearing H3K9me2, H3K27me3, or neither. Thus, CPL2–PHD2/3 emerges as a previously underappreciated, multifunctional regulator of plant DNA methylation networks. Unexpectedly, its gene repression function is uncoupled from DNA methylation. CPL2–PHD2/3 represses Polycomb-marked genes by interacting with LHP1 or recognizing hypomethylated H3K4. While it cooperates with LHP1 at a subset of targets, it also independently silences many more genes that LHP1 alone cannot repress, both sets of genes being critical for proper development. This dual, yet largely LHP1-insufficient, repression mode singles out CPL2–PHD2/3 as the essential executor of Polycomb silencing. Together, our findings establish CPL2–PHD2/3 as a chromatin-responsive integrator that spans DNA methylation and Polycomb-associated repression, providing a unifying mechanism for epigenetic control of both TEs and genes across diverse chromatin landscapes.",

AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and plasticity of AMPARs signaling underlies the long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy and strength important for learning and memory. Recent work has indicated that the enigmatic N-terminal domain (NTD) of AMPARs may be a critical regulator of synaptic targeting and plasticity of AMPARs. However, few synaptic proteins have been identified that regulate AMPAR plasticity through interactions with AMPAR NTDs. Moreover, the scope of AMPAR NTD interactors that are important for synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here, we present the dynamic, extracellular interactome for AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Using surface-restricted proximity labeling and BioSITe-based proteomics, we identified 70 proteins that were differentially labeled by APEX2-tagged AMPARs after induction of chemical long-term potentiation of synapses in cultured neurons. Included in this list, were four members of the IgLON family of GPI-anchored proteins (Ntm, OBCAM/Opcml, Negr1, Lsamp). We show OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the extracellular domains of AMPARs. Moreover, overexpression of NTM significantly attenuates the mobility of surface AMPARs in dendritic spines.

          "abstract": "Cilia are essential cellular antennae that rely on precise motor-driven transport to assemble and function. Two kinesin-2 motors—kinesin-II and OSM-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans —cooperate to transport cargo along cilia, with kinesin-II operating in the middle segment and OSM-3 taking over distally. However, how kinesin-II is spatially confined to prevent its invasion into distal regions remains unclear. Here, we identify Joubert syndrome 26 protein (JBTS-26) as a critical regulator of this motor handover. JBTS-26 localizes to axonemal doublet microtubules in the ciliary middle segment, where it competes with kinesin-II for binding to the IFT-B subunit OSM-5/IFT88. This competition displaces kinesin-II from IFT particles, enabling OSM-3 to assume distal transport. Loss of JBTS-26 allows kinesin-II to invade the distal cilium and slows down IFT. Conversely, JBTS-26 overexpression accelerates IFT by prematurely releasing kinesin-II. Our findings reveal a mechanism for compartmentalized motor regulation and link defective motor handover to ciliopathy pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Hurricanes can be a source of strong, episodic natural selection, especially for coastal and island populations. In Anolis lizards, selection favors morphological traits that enhance clinging performance under hurricane-force winds. However, we know little about the longer-term persistence of morphological and genomic responses to these pulse-like events. To address this limitation, we capitalized on the well-documented history of hurricanes and spread of the invasive brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei , over the past 130 y in the southeastern United States. We used 30 sites with estimates of the number of hurricanes experienced since population establishment. We found that hurricane frequency is consistently related to morphological trait values that increase clinging performance—longer limbs and larger toepads. In contrast, traits with no known connection to clinging ability were not related to hurricane frequency. Our genomic results show that despite a complex genetic architecture for most traits, populations retain a signature of hurricane-mediated selection, with several loci being strongly associated with both hurricane frequency and longer limbs. Further, we found that hurricanes are a more persistent driver of among-population genomic differentiation than other environmental variables. These results solidify hurricanes as a major force shaping morphological and genomic variation in Anolis lizards. They also highlight how the evolutionary trajectories of populations will likely be altered as climate change modifies historical patterns of natural selection, such as those involving extreme weather events.",

          "abstract": "Cooperative regulation of biomolecular function is critical for the ability of all organisms to respond effectively to environmental changes. Such regulation is often manifested in a sigmoidal dependence of enzyme activity on ligand concentration. Various molecular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie such sigmoidal behavior, but they are usually assumed to occur independently of one another. We hypothesized that coexistence of allosteric mechanisms can lead to complex kinetic behavior and higher or lower cooperativity than expected. A mathematical framework that analyses sigmoidal behavior as a function of two cooccurring mechanisms, hysteresis and homotropic binding cooperativity, was developed. The model shows, for example, that i) the observed cooperativity, as measured by the Hill coefficient, can decrease with increasing binding cooperativity, and that ii) unusually high values of the Hill coefficient can be observed. Our mathematical analysis is shown to be relevant for a mutant of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase with an unusually high value of a Hill coefficient for a dimer of about 1.9, in which hysteresis and binding cooperativity coexist. More generally, our findings imply that the repertoire of allosteric regulation is richer than anticipated and suggest that ultrasensitive control in natural or designed systems may arise even in low-order oligomers.",

While its effects on neurons are well studied, its consequences on astrocytes and astrocytic contribution to PD pathology are understudied. Here, we differentiated patient-derived p.A53T-αSyn induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to ventral midbrain astrocytes and characterized them via comprehensive molecular, functional, and proteomic analyses. Gene-corrected and healthy iPSC-derived astrocytes served as controls. To assess the effects of p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes on dopamine neurons, we established neuron–astrocyte cocultures of iPSC-derived control and mutant cells at all combinations. Our analyses uncovered cell-intrinsic pathologies in p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes, such as calcium dyshomeostasis, and accumulation of protein aggregates including those of phosphorylated αSyn. Proteomic and mechanistic studies demonstrated perturbed protein catabolic processes, with associated disturbances in lysosomal function and mTOR signaling. These deficits reduced the endocytic clearance capacity of p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes and their ability to process exogenous αSyn cargo. p.A53T-αSyn dopamine neurons cocultured with p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes displayed Lewy-like pathologies, mirroring the histopathological hallmarks identified in postmortem PD brains and exacerbated neurodegeneration, in anatomical and functional aspects. Control astrocytes mitigated these pathologies, highlighting their neuroprotective role. Additionally, p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes induced PD-relevant pathology ιn control neurons. Our findings, validated using an isogenic pair, demonstrate a critical impact of p.A53T-αSyn in disrupting astrocytic protein quality control mechanisms and establish astrocytes as active contributors to PD neuropathology. Our two-dimensional coculture model reflects key aspects of PD pathology, offering a relevant platform for mechanistic and drug discovery studies.",

PT cells are exquisitely sensitive to ischemia due to their high metabolic rate. The small GTPase Rac1 regulates epithelial function by promoting polarity through its effects on the actin cytoskeleton. We show that Rac1, in the setting of the recovery of the PT from ischemic injury, plays a critical role in reconstituting cellular bioenergetics by promoting actin cytoskeleton formation around damaged mitochondria. This mechanism removes damaged mitochondria through mitophagy and preserves PT metabolic capacity and reabsorption function. Loss of Rac1 causes intracellular lipid accumulation, energy depletion, and PT cell atrophy. Thus, Rac1 promotes the repair of PT cells by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics, rather than by regulating cell polarity via a mechanism that links the actin cytoskeleton to metabolic demands and cell morphology.",

Here, we measure within-cell fitness of competing Escherichia coli plasmids and characterize their drift and selective dynamics. We made synthetic plasmid dimers that can be split in a controlled way to create balanced competition, which we probed experimentally. Incompatible plasmids coexist for an extended time due to methylation-based replication control. Moreover, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell advantage and fix preferentially, favoring gene loss. Critically, fixation depends non-trivially on the interplay between plasmid transcription and translation. Our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by within- and between-cell dynamics.",

A cell type–specific “innexin code” coordinates wave propagation through a defined gap junction network among non-neuronal retinal cells, excluding photoreceptors. Wave intensity scales with ommatidial size, triggering stronger myosin II–driven apical contraction at interommatidial boundaries in larger ommatidia. This size-dependent mechanism compensates for early boundary irregularities, ensuring uniform ommatidial packing that is critical for precise optical architecture.

          "abstract": "Van der Waals contact between two-dimensional semiconductors and metals has always been inferior to covalent bond contacts used in semiconductor industry because of weak band coupling and low bond strength. Here, we report an atomic layer bonding (ALB) contact with strong band coupling and high interfacial cohesion by establishing a metallic coherent bonding interface between the transition-metal atomic layer of transition-metal dichalcogenides and metals. This contact exhibits ultralow contact resistance and superb thermomechanical stability, comparable to those of covalent bond contacts and surpassing all reported contact configurations. ALB contact formed in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and gold demonstrates a contact resistance of 70 ohm-micrometers and thermomechanical stability up to 400°C and delivers a maximum on-current of 1.1 milliamperes per micrometer after high-temperature annealing, all of which meet industrial integration.",

We find that the presynaptic release of the tyrosine-directed ectokinase, vertebrate lonesome kinase (VLK/ Pkdcc ), is necessary and sufficient for the direct extracellular interaction between EphB2 and GluN1 at synapses for phosphorylation of the ectodomain of EphB2 and mediation of injury-induced pain. Pkdcc is an essential gene in the nervous system, and VLK is enriched at synapses and released from neurons in an activity- and soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE)–dependent manner to drive extracellular interactions. Our results show that presynaptic sensory neuron–specific VLK knockout attenuates postsurgical pain in mice without changing sensorimotor performance, suggesting that VLK critically regulates synaptic protein-protein interactions and acute pain in response to injury.",

We identified fill factor diminution as a key performance-loss mode in the state-of-the-art tandem architecture. We reveal that widely used hole-selective molecular contacts, which enhance tandem cell performance, undergo thermal degradation that undermines charge transport. At elevated temperatures, the resistance of conventional monomeric contacts increases by about sixfold because of thermal-induced disorder. To stabilize interfacial structures, we introduce in situ synthesized cross-linked molecular contacts based on Schiff base linkages. One-square-centimeter perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieved power-conversion efficiencies exceeding 34% (33.61% certified), and three independent devices retained 96.2 ± 1.7% of their initial performance after about 1200-hour maximum power point operation under AM1.5G illumination at 65°C.",

          "abstract": "Magmatic intrusion in Earth’s crust can lead to hazardous volcanic eruptions, but the physical processes involved remain largely hidden from direct observation. We used machine learning–derived seismicity as virtual stress meters at depth to study the disruptive 2025 seismogeodetic unrest in Greece between the Santorini volcano and the epicenter of the devastating moment magnitude 7.7 Amorgos earthquake that occurred in 1956. We show that the cause of unrest was magmatic dike propagation, which we imaged with ~25,000 relocated earthquakes occurring over 2 months. The dike propagated horizontally ~30 kilometers as multiscale rebounding waves of dike opening, magma pressure, and breaking of barriers while triggering intense surrounding seismicity. Our results establish magmatic intrusion as a more complex feedback process than previously recognized and can facilitate physics-based and data-driven modeling and eruption forecasting.",

Here, we report 3D semiconductors, integrating organic electronics, soft matter, and electrochemistry. These 3D semiconductors, in the form of hydrogels, realize millimeter-scale modulation thickness while achieving tissue-like softness and biocompatibility. This breakthrough in modulation thickness is enabled by a templated double-network hydrogel system, where a secondary porous hydrogel guides the 3D assembly of a primary redox-active conducting hydrogel. We demonstrate that these 3D semiconductors enable the exclusive fabrication of 3D spatially interpenetrated transistors that mimic real neuronal connections. This work bridges the gap between 2D electronics and 3D living systems, paving the way for advanced bioelectronics systems such as biohybrid sensing and neuromorphic computing.",

However, the mechanisms of this unusual signaling pattern and its physiological relevance are unclear. We report the structures of GPR1 bound to chemerin and β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 and an agonist-free GPR1–β-arrestin 1 complex. Upon agonist stimulation, the receptor binds the two arrestins in distinct interaction patterns, which may account for their differential cellular responses. Agonist-independent internalization was mediated by an inactive, constitutively phosphorylated GPR1 that accommodates β-arrestin 1 in an unconventional pocket together with a fatty acid, which potentially provides a basis for GPR1 modulating lipid accumulation in lipid-overloaded adipocytes.",

We tested 50 immunomodulatory regimes to determine their ability to protect mice from lethal infection. Only neutrophil depletion soon after infection prevented death from influenza. This result suggests that the infected host passed an early tipping point after which limiting innate damage alone could not rescue lung function. We investigated treatments that could have efficacy when administered later in infection. We found that partial limitation of viral spread together with enhancement of epithelial repair, by interferon blockade or limiting CD8 + T cell–mediated killing of epithelial cells, reduced lethality.

Pairing chiral counteranions with cation radical intermediates provides a potentially generalizable tool for controlling absolute stereochemistry in various reactivity contexts. However, ion-pairing effects on the efficiency of photoinduced processes and the reactivity of radical ion pairs impose severe limits on the chiral anions that can be engaged effectively. In this study, we report that association of neutral chiral small-molecule hydrogen-bond donors with the counteranions of cation radical intermediates can achieve enantioselectivity through ion-pairing and other noncovalent interactions. Applications to four different classes of cycloaddition reactions of electron-rich alkene substrates provide cyclic products with up to four new stereocenters in up to 99% enantiomeric excess.",

A fundamental challenge is that, because two people may differ in many ways, factors besides race might explain differences in treatment. Here, we propose a test for bias that circumvents the difficulty of comparing two people by instead assessing whether the same person is treated differently when their race is perceived differently. We apply our method to test for bias in police traffic stops, finding that the same driver is likelier to be searched or arrested by police when they are perceived as Hispanic than when they are perceived as white. Our test is broadly applicable to other datasets where race, gender, or other identity data are perceived rather than self-reported, and the same person is observed multiple times.",

We use data from the nationally representative (United States) High School and Beyond cohort, characterize fluoride exposure from drinking water across adolescence, adjust for confounders, and observe cognitive test performance in both secondary school and at age ~60. We find that children exposed to recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water exhibit modestly better cognition in secondary school, an advantage that is smaller and no longer statistically significant at age ~60.",

          "abstract": "Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems because of their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000°C per second, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO 3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with subgrain boundary fractions of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kilovolts per centimeter) and large polarization (70 coulombs per square centimeter). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 joules per cubic meter and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250°C. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.",

          "abstract": "Hotspot swells have typically been associated with mantle plume upwelling, yet the origins of much broader but lower superswells remain unclear. This study first reveals that swell width increases while height decreases at younger seafloor ages; it is possible for a single hot spot swell size to approach that of a superswell. Compressible numerical models replicate the observed trend. Modeling results suggest that both hot spot swells and superswells can form from interactions between mantle plumes and oceanic plates. Beneath young seafloors, the lateral redistribution of restitic, hence buoyant and relatively low-viscosity, lower lithospheric mantle due to plume impingement explains the formation of superswell-like morphology. These models effectively demonstrate lithospheric lid effects on mantle melting and support a reassessment of conventional methods for estimating core heat flux.",

However, achieving a balance between lightweight design, strength, and energy absorption remains challenging. Here, we develop a material-structure-function integrated strategy to additively manufacture lightweight metamaterials. Specifically, strong yet ductile aluminum (Al) alloy with heterogeneous grain was developed to print hero shrew–inspired damage-resistant metamaterials. The synergistic interplay between microscale strengthening and mesoscale architectural stress regulation leads to a cross-scale coordination mechanism, which effectively bridges material heterogeneities and structural hierarchy for multilevel energy dissipation. Such a strategy enables our metamaterials to maintain a stable stress platform during deformation. Hence, our metamaterials display an excellent combination of ultralightweight (0.91 ± 0.01 g/cm 3 ), high relative yield strength (17.0 ± 0.7%), and unprecedented specific energy absorption (39.1 ± 0.7 J/g), surpassing most metallic metamaterials. This facile concept expands the design space for lightweight metamaterials and demonstrates scalable strategies to realize the cross-scale coordination mechanism required by multifunction, showing transformative potential in mass production for sustainable engineering solutions.",

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) exhibited HP-induced damage exclusively on stiff matrices, recapitulating cirrhotic degeneration phenotypes and genotypes. Using the HH chip, we identified GPR116 as the key HP mechanosensor in LSECs and delineated its downstream mechanotransduction pathway driving cellular injury. Genetic silencing of GPR116 protected endothelial cells from HP-induced damage both in vitro and in cirrhotic murine models.

A unique Sicilian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) dataset, represented by 116 ancient mitogenomes (including two newly sequenced) collected from 16 archeological sites dating from 14,700 to 545 years ago, was compared with a collection of 236 modern mitogenomes covering all districts of the island. By integrating demographic modeling with phylogeographic analyses, we identified a statistically supported genetic discontinuity between the Paleolithic/Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods and two mtDNA lineages (U5b and U8b/K) that specifically mark this transition. The extensive variation and lack of genetic structure among modern mitogenomes suggest the presence of a continuous, maternally inherited gene flow from different regions of Western Eurasia (since the Paleolithic) and Africa (since the Bronze Age).",

We combined genomic and ecological analyses to investigate parallel introductions of the Eurasian Tree Sparrow across continents.

Despite the genome-wide loss of diversity, we identified conserved regions of high genetic variation in the introduced populations, potentially maintained through balancing selection of ancestral polymorphisms. Genotype-climate association and genetic offset modeling demonstrated that climate-adaptive genetic variants retained similar frequencies across the native and introduced ranges, likely maintaining similar interactions of genetic components with climate niches. Our findings highlight how retention of adaptive polymorphism facilitates establishment success in the introduced populations, providing a framework for predicting invasion potential through genomic signatures of adaptation.",

Starting with a phosphorus-enriched Archean melt, we observe that rapid cooling results in the formation of immiscible glassy droplets with up to 21 weight % phosphorus pentoxide, which can be delivered to the surface by volcanic processes. In aqueous leaching, we detect millimolar phosphate concentrations, which enable the synthesis of phosphorylating agents such as polyphosphates and imidazole phosphate with up to 34% yield.

Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultrathin SrTiO 3 membranes have the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and exceptionally slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nanometer-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~7 × 10 −5 c , rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials.

Under a modest AC electric field at 1 Hz, large electrostriction of 120 ppm is observed in pristine sample. Yet, after resting in ambient environment, electrostriction decreases by one order of magnitude without any electrochemical decomposition and phase transition. The oxygen vacancies are found to decrease in the degraded SDC as well, and the degradation does not occur at frequency of 500 Hz and higher, which exhibits electrostriction one order of magnitude smaller in the first place. We attribute the degradation to the redox reactions that induce oxygen vacancy complexes during field promoted reduction yet decrease mobile oxygen vacancies while resting, which must be mitigated for the practical applications of ceria-based electrostrictors.",

Using two complementary datasets, we identify a sharp increase in magnetic mineral concentration immediately after the early Miocene unconformity [~20 million years ago (Ma)], concurrent with a shift in detrital zircon ages, indicating a major provenance shift. We identify bimodal volcanism of the Columbia River Basalt Group as the dominant Miocene source, requiring that the early Miocene Continental Divide lay ~400 kilometers west of its present position. This reorganization, driven by Yellowstone plume–induced uplift, persisted until at least 10 Ma.

However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in MoSe 2 monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial subpicosecond ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-picosecond superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization.

          "abstract": "Nature has long inspired engineering innovations. Recent advances in biohybrid research have taken this inspiration further by directly integrating biotic materials into engineered systems. Here we report “3D necroprinting,” a biohybrid manufacturing technique that repurposes female mosquito proboscides as high-resolution 3D printing nozzles. The mosquito proboscis, with its unique geometry, structure, and mechanics, enables printed line widths as fine as 20 μm, surpassing commercially available 36-gauge dispense tips by ~100%. The mosquito proboscis dispense tip can withstand internal pressures of approximately 60 kPa, enabling effective fluid extrusion. Demonstrated applications include high-resolution printing of complex structures such as a honeycomb structure, a maple leaf, and bioscaffolds encapsulating cancer cells and red blood cells, showcasing the versatility and capacity of 3D necroprinting. By introducing biotic materials as viable substitutes to complex engineered components, this work paves the way for sustainable and innovative solutions in advanced manufacturing and microengineering.",

Here, we synthesize observations of deep SSEs in the Cascadia Subduction Zone and argue that rapid, cohesive fault strengthening may control the dynamics of deep SSEs. Cohesive strength is frequently ignored in constitutive laws used to describe fault rheology in numerical simulations of earthquakes and SSEs alike. To demonstrate its importance, we perform and analyze a suite of petrological experiments that simulate fault healing under representative pressure and temperature conditions. We show that significant cohesive strength recovery caused by dissolution-precipitation processes occurs on timescales of just a few hours. Together, our experimental and observational results support the idea that cohesion is a key component of fault strength under SSE conditions and highlight the need for its inclusion in both future experiments and numerical models of fault slip.",

The results demonstrated that individualized FCs captured disease heterogeneity and predicted symptom severity more accurately than raw FCs, while shared FCs revealed diagnosis-specific abnormalities and achieved an accuracy of 79.30% in differentiating PBD, SCZ, and SAD. Furthermore, molecular decoding implicated regionally selective serotonin systems and astrocytes in the neurobiological differences among disorders, suggesting disorder-specific pharmacological targets. Critically, these findings were replicated in an independent cohort, confirming the effectiveness of the COBE framework in mining neurophysiological and molecular profiles of schizophrenia-bipolar disorder.

We hypothesized that “spray-on probes” with specificity for fibroblast activation protein alpha in peritumoral fibroblasts could improve fluorescence-guided surgery, detect smaller tumors, improve imaging accuracy, and reduce the amount of times a patient is hospitalized. We show that this strategy increases achievable tumor margin contrast by 5- to 10-fold and detects even microscopic cancer deposits.

To bridge this gap, we devised an artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled approach that pairs rapid compound triage with mechanistic target deconvolution. Our AI-driven screening highlighted melatonin (MLT) as a promising candidate. Serum profiling of 161 human individuals confirmed an age-related fall in circulating MLT level, while subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that MLT rescues cognition, suppresses neuroinflammation, and alleviates senescence phenotypes. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)–guided chemoproteomic deconvolution next pinpointed the histone acetyltransferase p300 as MLT’s target. Integrated Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics revealed that MLT-bound p300 cooperates with specificity protein 1 (SP1) at a brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 super-enhancer, elevating histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation and reengaging a circadian-epigenetic program that links redox resilience to neuroprotection. By combining AI-driven discovery with PROTAC-based target mapping and super-enhancer–centric mechanistic resolution, our study identifies MLT as a dual-action candidate and sets out a reproducible “AI-to-clinic” paradigm for multitarget drug innovation in aging-related neurodegeneration.",

Here, we report experiments that investigate how photon statistics affect a natural photosynthetic system and vice versa. We directly compare how single photons and pseudothermal light from spontaneous parametric down-conversion drive light harvesting in the light-harvesting 2 complex from a purple bacterium. We find that the fluorescence lifetime and quantum efficiency are unchanged while the fluorescence photon statistics are markedly different, resembling that of the incident light, implying that the dynamics do not fundamentally modify the photon statistics.

This one-time intervention effectively prevented ADA formation in mice and rats, even after repeated challenges with UOX-Ery or free UOX protein, an outcome not achieved by CTX or UOX plus CTX. This tolerogenic effect relied on splenic uptake of UOX-Ery by myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, and was associated with the expansion of a distinct subset of effector regulatory T cells. Functionally, this immune tolerance enhanced the pharmacokinetics of UOX, sustained long-term control of serum uric acid levels, and attenuated local inflammation within tophus-like lesions. Together, these findings demonstrate that UOX-Ery, combined in a single dose with clinically used immunosuppressants, can effectively treat gout by inducing antigen-specific immune tolerance.",

We found that hyperoside increases pigeon pea seed set by promoting pollen tube growth, a process that benefits from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).

These lncRNAs up-regulate CcGPP (GRAS phosphorylase) kinase expression by binding to its promoter and acting as a scaffold to connect MRP23 and RNA polymerase while simultaneously inhibiting CcGDP (GRAS dephosphorylase) phosphatase activity by binding to key protein sites. Genetic evidence also confirms the relationship between lnc187 / lnc999 , MRP23, and the downstream CcGPP/CcGDP.

In the present study, single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells revealed that AMPKβ1 isoform (AMPKα1β1γ1) predominates in the erythroid lineage. AMPKβ1 activators increased the expression of HbF in erythroid cells from SCD donors and decreased sickling in vitro through activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) but independently from direct Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) inhibition, by way of a noncanonical NRF2 pathway, as shown by phosphorylation of Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1). In vivo studies in Townes SCD mice treated with the selective AMPKβ1 activator PF-06409577 confirmed increased HbF in circulating erythrocytes, associated with decreased reactive oxygen species and reduced chronic inflammation markers.

We found that ELAC2, a 3′ tRNA maturation endonuclease, decreases the mTE of UC[C/U] serine (Ser) codons in response to Ser limitation. Ablation of ELAC2 restored UC[C/U] mTE but reduced the mTE of AG[U/C] Ser codons. Among the tRNA Ser isoacceptors, tRNA Ser(GCU) decreased the most in ELAC2 -deficient cells.

However, human preimplantation embryos often display an array of morphological defects associated with poor development and implantation. Here, we used live-embryo imaging and computational analysis to capture how these defects can be produced in real time. We record various forms of mitotic errors including lagging chromosomes producing micronuclei, multipolar spindles causing abnormal chromosome organization recapitulated by daughter cells, and uncontrolled scattering of condensed chromosomes. In addition, we capture abnormal cleavage furrow dynamics during cytokinesis producing binucleated and enucleated cells. Finally, we find cells with disrupted mitotic progression ultimately leading to blebbing and fragmentation. Thus, these results document specific aberrant cell behaviors producing morphological defects in real time, and indicate that errors during mitosis and cytokinesis represent a major cause of developmental failures in human embryos.",

          "abstract": "Protein unfolding has emerged as a critical factor in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Direct visualization of unfolded proteins remains technically challenging yet critical for elucidating atherosclerosis pathogenesis and developing early diagnostic tools. Here, we report a dual-reporter unlocking two-photon fluorescence probe for dynamic tracking of unfolded proteins in early atherosclerotic plaques. The probe achieves synergistic fluorescence activation through covalent binding with exposed thiols and subsequent stabilization within the local hydrophobic microenvironment of unfolded proteins. This dual-activation property allows for precise differentiation between folded and unfolded proteins in foam cells, facilitating spatiotemporal mapping of protein disorder at various stages of atherosclerosis. Notably, the probe detects early-stage unknown or tiny plaques within 4 to 8 weeks by identifying protein unfolding events before conventional Oil Red O staining and clinical ultrasonography, demonstrating unprecedented sensitivity for subclinical plaque prediction. Our findings establish a paradigm for investigating proteostasis disorder in atherogenesis and introduce a powerful molecular tool for early atherosclerosis diagnosis.",

However, some extracellular proteins have been shown to coordinate pre- and postsynaptic differentiation by more elusive mechanisms. Here, we identify the nonfibrillar collagen CLE-1, a member of the evolutionarily conserved multiplexin family, as a master determinant of synapse identity in Caenorhabditis elegans . C. elegans muscle cells are innervated by both cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons. The CLE-1B isoform is secreted by motoneurons and localizes to neuromuscular junctions. Loss of CLE-1B causes the relocalization of acetylcholine receptors to GABAergic synapses. We show that CLE-1B positions previously unidentified proteolytic fragments of the extracellular scaffold Punctin/MADD-4 to align acetylcholine receptors with cholinergic terminals and independently modulates receptor abundance. These findings reveal CLE-1 as a dual-function synaptic organizer that integrates spatial and quantitative control of postsynaptic receptor localization to maintain synapse identity.",

Single-molecule microscopy reveals the dynamics governed by hydrodynamic interactions, demonstrating that increasing histone H4 acetylation density enhances structural fluctuations and relaxation times. In vitro Hi-C reveals power-law decay of the nucleosome contacts consistent with the Gaussian chain, which is globally reduced by acetylation. We also observe that heterogeneous modification patterns alone are sufficient to create distinct structural domains reminiscent of higher-order chromatin organization.

RNA sequencing revealed that MI platelets induced EC mitochondrial dysfunction, confirmed by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and disrupted mitochondrial networks. Integrating platelet transcriptomic data, we identified the C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) as significantly up-regulated in MI platelets and a key mediator of EC mitochondrial dysfunction. Blocking its receptor, CCR5, attenuated CCL3 effects. In an independent cohort of 261 patients with established cardiovascular disease, higher circulating CCL3 levels were associated with incident major adverse cardiovascular events.

We monitored Ca 2+ activity of dorsal CA1PNs in mice in a virtual go/no-go task series that required both spatial navigation and rule learning based on nonspatial environmental features. Spatial and context-dependent activity of CA1PNs developed sequentially during learning, parallel with behavioral performance. Upon switching to a new task condition involving familiar and novel environments, neuronal activity disorganized rapidly and extensively even in the unchanged environment. In contrast, reward reversal in unchanged environments induced more gradual activity changes, associated with behavioral adaptation. Our results indicate that, during learning a spatial-contextual task, CA1PNs initially generalize between environments coding primarily spatial position, but, with experience, their activity gradually reorganizes to form partially distinct representations within a shared contextual framework.",

Knockdown of Rbm20 at male-producing temperature induces male-to-female sex reversal, whereas Rbm20 overexpression at female-producing temperature triggers male development. RBM20 represses the splicing of Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 at KTS sites, thereby governing the balance of +KTS and −KTS isoforms between different temperatures. In addition, functional analysis reveals that the Wt1  +KTS variant is both necessary and sufficient to drive male development in T. scripta .

Collectively, these factors can cause uncontrolled shape change and functional failure. Here, we focus on slender magnetic soft structures to investigate their stability under misaligned fields. Our anisotropic design, achieved through flexural joints, yields ~52-fold higher bending stiffness in the preferred direction and ~18-fold higher torsional stiffness than isotropic beams. This structure serves as a building block for stable spiral tentacles, helices, planar sheets, expandable devices, cubes, and three-dimensional tessellation.

The increasing PRV infections in humans—resulting in severe encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and death since 2017 in China—have also posed a public health risk. PRV can establish latency in pigs, potentially leading to disease outbreaks upon reactivation. However, little is known about the PRV reactivation process, particularly in cases with other pathogens coinfection. We found that extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus suis , common zoonotic bacteria found in pigs, can trigger PRV reactivation, and bacteria up-regulated CXCL1 to enhance STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which triggers PRV reactivation by regulating the transcription of early viral genes. Effective booster immunization significantly reduced PRV reactivation among pigs.

We simulate the heatwave as a present-day forecast, a preindustrial-counterfactual scenario, and a future-counterfactual scenario. Despite the extremeness of the event, our analysis shows that, under current climate conditions, we could have still seen up to 30% more heat-related deaths than the number observed. We show that between 11 and 15% of the observed human mortality was attributable to climate change during this event, depending on the conditioning of the atmospheric circulation. We also show that, had “the same event” occurred in the future, the mortality toll is nonlinear compared with the warming trend, and so the future attribution would be even more extreme, 16 to 31%.

This study investigates the primary environmental parameters inducing alteration in the oil binder and elucidates the associated degradation pathways through a multiscale analytical approach, including noninvasive spectroscopic techniques and synchrotron radiation–based x-ray methods. By combining results from a historical oil painting by James Ensor (1860 to 1949) and artificially aged paint mock-ups, we identified ultraviolet A–visible light and humidity (relative humidity ≥ 95%) as key driving factors, inducing a dual degradation pathway: Light promotes surface-stratified arsenic oxidation (As 3+  → As 5+ ) resulting in amorphous As 5+ -rich compounds, whereas a dark, high moisture environment favors arsenolite (As 2 O 3 ) crystallization.

In the Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-X, we perform experiments where meltwater fluxes representing plausible tipping trajectories of the GIS and WAIS are applied. We find that WAIS meltwater input can increase or decrease the AMOC resilience to GIS meltwater. Also, we find that it can completely prevent an AMOC collapse, confirming in a comprehensive model what was previously found in conceptual frameworks.

Acute heart failure complicated with severe myocardial iron deposition was identified in the 31-year-old male proband of PIEZO1 D669Y variant. However, PIEZO1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutation D674Y mice and cardiomyocyte-specific Piezo1 overexpression disrupted cardiac function besides iron overload. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed suppression of lipid metabolism pathways in cardiomyocytes with the PIEZO1 GOF mutation, with forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a key mediator in lipid metabolism pathways. Specifically, the PIEZO1 GOF mutation increased Ca 2+ levels, leading to calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation and subsequent FOXO3 down-regulation.

These ILs preferentially oxidize to form a robust cathode-electrolyte interphase with LiF and sulfide species, which effectively suppresses dissolution of transition metal and enhances interfacial ion transport.

In yeast, Osh6 transfers phosphatidylserine (PS) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (PM) by exchange with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. We investigated why its activity depends on Ist2, an ER-resident lipid scramblase that connects the ER to the PM via an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We found that Osh6, in a lipid-loaded state, binds the Ist2 IDR with micromolar affinity and functions at ER-PM contact sites only if its binding site within the IDR is sufficiently distant from the ER membrane. We determined, in reconstituted contact sites, that the association of Osh6 with the Ist2 IDR enables rapid, directed PS transfer. We identified the Ist2-binding site in Osh6 by molecular modeling and functional analyses. Last, we established that Ist2’s scramblase activity sustains Osh6-mediated PS transfer between membranes. Identifying these functional partnerships highlights why lipid transport processes are organized in membrane contact sites.",

We observed pronounced mitochondrial disruption in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, including distorted ultrastructure and CHCHD2 aggregation, as well as disrupted mitochondrial protein-protein interactions in brain lysates. These abnormalities were associated with a whole-body metabolic shift toward glycolysis, elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and progressive accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein. In idiopathic PD, CHCHD2 gene expression also correlated with α-synuclein levels in vulnerable dopaminergic neurons, and CHCHD2 protein accumulated in early Lewy aggregates.

          "authors": "Mingchen Sun, Wei Li, Shaohua Zhang, Daniela A. Wilson",
          "abstract": "Surface functionalization with biomolecules transforms nanocarriers by integrating a range of bioderived functionalities; however, conventional methods often yield low efficiency and uneven ligand distribution, and compromise the structural integrity of nanocarriers. Here, we introduce a breakthrough approach that activates the traditionally inert PEG corona, enabling precise and spatially controlled functionalization of nanocarriers with biologically relevant entities. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between pyrene and FITC, we confirm accurate spatial distribution of ligands. Our method achieves exceptional efficiency and stability, maintaining over 40% of functional molecules across three cycles of washing and resuspension under various aqueous conditions. In vitro assays reveal high biological efficacy, with engineered polymersomes supporting targeted cellular interactions. Functionalization with diverse ligands introduces specific biological functionalities, including mitochondrial targeting, cell migration stimulation, and enhanced receptor-mediated endocytosis. This rapid, efficient, and user-friendly strategy for PEG surface functionalization heralds remarkable advances in nanomedicine and biomaterials.",

          "abstract": "The repeated evolution of avian obligate brood parasitism (OBP) across diverse lineages represents a major evolutionary puzzle. While host-parasite coevolution has been extensively studied, the initial conditions favoring OBP emergence remain unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical modeling, paleoclimate mapping, and phylogenetic comparative analyses to identify the key drivers underlying OBP evolution. Our model shows that rising parental care costs, particularly under environmental stress, may favor the emergence of OBP. However, its persistence requires additional life-history adaptations, including increases in fecundity (egg production). Paleoclimatic data support this framework: OBP origins often followed major climatic upheavals with fixations occurring during subsequently more stable periods. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that OBP is associated with high-mortality ecological traits, such as open-habitat use. We also find increased OBP likelihood in both smaller carnivorous and larger herbivorous/omnivorous species, indicating size-dependent trophic constraints. These results provide a unified framework explaining the recurrent evolution of OBP by linking environmental pressures and life-history trade-offs to this remarkable behavioral adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Cultivating microorganisms in native-like conditions is vital for bioprospecting and accessing now unculturable species. However, there remains a gap in scalable tools that can both mimic native microenvironments and enable targeted recovery of microbes from complex settings. Such approaches are essential to advance our understanding of microbial ecology, predict community functions, and discover previously unidentified biotherapeutics. We present magnetic nanocultures—a high-throughput microsystem for isolating and growing environmental microbes under near-native conditions. These nanoliter-scale bioreactors are encapsulated in semipermeable membranes that form magnetic polymeric microcapsules using iron oxide nanoparticles within polydimethylsiloxane-based shells. This design offers mechanical stability and magnetic actuation, enabling efficient retrieval from soil-like environments. The nanocultures are optimized for optical and biological properties to support microbial encapsulation, growth, and sorting. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using magnetically responsive microenvironments to cultivate elusive microbes, offering a promising platform for bioprospecting previously uncultured or unknown microbial species.",

          "abstract": "Observations since the 1990s reveal widespread warming in the deep and bottom Arctic Ocean. It is historically attributed to geothermal heating, whereas the impacts of global and Arctic climate change on the deep and bottom Arctic Ocean warming remain unresolved. Our study demonstrates that during the recent decades, the Arctic Ocean deep water is warming at 0.020°C/decade in the Eurasian Basin between 2000 and 2600 m, exceeding what can be explained by geothermal heating. We find that the rapid warming in the deep Greenland Basin diminishes its cooling effect on the deep Eurasian Basin via the Fram Strait, leading to the warming in the deep Eurasian Basin. Meanwhile, the Lomonosov Ridge blocks this warming signal from reaching the deep Amerasian Basin, maintaining its relative slow warming rate of 0.003°C/decade. Our findings indicate that the deep Greenland Basin warming has already exerted obvious impacts on the deep Arctic Ocean.",

We determine the structure of Ur-λ, resolving the full-length central and side fibers, thus providing a structural basis for host recognition. We show that Ur-λ contains six copies of its tape measure protein. We capture intermediates of the tail tip complex during infection initiation, revealing how extensive conformational changes enable adsorption, and visualize the trans-envelope channel required for genome ejection.",

          "abstract": "Quasi-solid polymer electrolytes (QSPEs) for flexible batteries face critical limitations in ion transport efficiency at high currents. We address this with a design of nanofluidic polyacrylamide hydrogel integrating aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as ion highways [SWCNT-embedded polyacrylamide(CPAM)]. Photo-polymerization ensures homogeneous SWCNT distribution, delivering a high ionic conductivity of 30.3 mS cm −1 while shielding polymer matrices from ion collision. Molecular dynamics simulations identify three ion transport modes, dominated by SWCNT-confined pathways. The CPAM-based Zn||Zn cell exhibits ultralong cycling (7000 hours), and Zn|CPAM|Zn 0.25 V 2 O 5 cells retain 80% capacity after 2000 cycles at 40 A g −1 (19.2 kW kg −1 ). Cryogenic operation (−15°C) and pouch cells further demonstrate the robust performance of CPAM. This work transcends conventional compromises of QSPEs, enabling wearables with ultrafast charging/discharging, cryogenic tolerance, and mechanical resilience.",

          "abstract": "Bering Sea winter sea ice (BSWI), vital for regional climate, ecosystem, and livelihoods, is significantly influenced by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we identify a shift in the ENSO-BSWI relationship. Pre–mid-1990s, traditional eastern Pacific ENSO dominated, driving a positive ENSO-BSWI linkage; post–mid-1990s, more frequent central Pacific (CP) ENSO events reversed this relationship to negative. Observations and model experiments show that CP El Niño coupled with positive-phase North Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) redirects poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains, enhancing Bering Sea southerlies. This suppresses ice advection, intensifies warm air intrusion, and reduces BSWI. Strengthened CP ENSO-NPMM coupling and heightened NPMM variability amplify this teleconnection, increasing its influence on BSWI by 38.9% versus NPMM alone. Our findings underscore the growing role of subtropical and tropical Pacific climate interactions in subarctic sea ice variability and highlight the need for improved climate models that capture ENSO diversity, NPMM dynamics, and subtropical-subarctic teleconnections to enhance BSWI projections under climate change.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) sclerosis represents a prominent feature of fibrotic disorders; however, the macrophage response to changes in matrix stiffness and its impact on fibrotic diseases remain unclear. This study reveals a vicious circle of ECM-cell-ECM, where increased ECM hardness activates the STING pathway in macrophages, in turn activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thus enhancing ECM stiffness again and exacerbating liver fibrosis. To reverse liver fibrosis, an innovative carrier-free nanosystem capable of degrading ECM, specifically blocking the STING pathway in macrophages as well as remodeling matrix mechanical, is created. In mouse models, pharmacological STING inhibition via alkylation in macrophages, combined with ECM degradation via matrix metalloproteinases and metal ion–induced macrophage polarization, reduces stromal stiffness and reverses fibrosis. Our findings underscore the antifibrotic potential of matrix mechanical remodeling, demonstrating that concurrent reduction of matrix stiffness and inhibition of STING pathway in macrophages can synergistically promote fibrosis regression. This research establishes a previously unidentified paradigm for liver fibrosis reversal.",

          "abstract": "This essay, based on the 2024 Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics Presidential Address, interrogates the role of emotions in economies of late capitalism. Scholars of the interplay between economy and society have recently been preoccupied with the study of economization of life. I argue that we have largely missed how these processes interact with what I call emotionalization of life, or developments that have made emotions our compass to understand who we are, how to think and act, and how to see others. I connect emotionalization to the rise in scholarly attention to affect as well as therapeutic and self-help culture in society that has been capitalized, evermore so in the platform economy. While commonly we codify the emotional and the economic as distinct, even hostile to each other, the marriage of emotionalization and economization thrives because they are both rooted in central ideas of human capital investment, and an increasingly tacit understanding that economic action should be geared around not only monetary but psychic income, or emotional economy. I end by outlining some empirical manifestations of emotional economies and research considerations.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the deindustrialization process in Germany and Spain from 1995 to 2018. It is argued that the deindustrialization trajectories of each country are partially related to their growth models. A two-step analysis is conducted. First, using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) input–output tables, a hierarchical structural decomposition analysis is applied, decomposing the manufacturing value-added share into five deindustrialization drivers: relative prices, income, investment, outsourcing, and international trade. Second, building on the growth model perspective, an interpretative framework to analyze the evolution of these drivers is presented. The interaction between institutions, aggregate demand, and the economic structure is explicitly considered in this framework. The comparison of the German and Spanish cases and the distinction between the pre and postcrisis periods illustrate the consequences of the distinct growth models (and the economic policies on which they are grounded) in structural change. The results suggest that deindustrialization trajectories in both countries are well-explained by their specific labor, financial, fiscal, and industrial policies.",
