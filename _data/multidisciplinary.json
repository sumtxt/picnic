          "abstract": "Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important to marine life and are essential tools for studying ocean processes 1 . Two different frameworks have arisen regarding marine TEI cycling: reversible scavenging favours water-column control on TEI distributions 2–5 , and seafloor boundary exchange emphasizes sedimentary imprints on water-column biogeochemistry 6,7 . These two views lead to disparate interpretations of TEI behaviours 8–10 . Here we use rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes as exemplar tracers of particle scavenging 11 and boundary exchange 6,7,12 . We integrate these data with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis to propose a general framework for marine TEI cycling. We show that, for elements with greater affinity for manganese oxide than biogenic particles, scavenging is a net sink throughout the water column, contrary to a common assumption for reversible scavenging 3,13 . In this case, a benthic flux supports increasing elemental concentrations with water depth. This sedimentary source consists of two components: one recycled from elements scavenged by water-column particles, and another newly introduced to the water column through marine silicate weathering inside sediment 8,14,15 . Abyssal oxic diagenesis drives this benthic source, and exerts a strong influence on water-column biogeochemistry through seafloor geometry and bottom-intensified turbulent mixing 16,17 . Our findings affirm the role of authigenic minerals, often overshadowed by biogenic particles, in water-column cycling 18 , and suggest that the abyssal seafloor, often regarded as inactive, is a focus of biogeochemical transformation 19,20 .",

          "abstract": "Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules 1,2 , but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees ( Taxus species) 3 . Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research 4 . Within Taxus ’ large, enzyme-rich genome 5 , we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3’- N -debenzoyl-2’-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets.",

          "abstract": "Although cell-fate specification is generally attributed to transcriptional regulation, emerging data also indicate a role for molecules linked with intermediary metabolism. For example, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which fuels energy production and biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is also a co-factor for chromatin-modifying enzymes 1–3 . Nevertheless, whether TCA-cycle metabolites regulate cell fate during tissue homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that TCA-cycle enzymes are expressed in the intestine in a heterogeneous manner, with components of the αKG dehydrogenase complex 4–6 upregulated in the absorptive lineage and downregulated in the secretory lineage. Using genetically modified mouse models and organoids, we reveal that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), the enzymatic subunit of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, has a dual, lineage-specific role. In the absorptive lineage, OGDH is upregulated by HNF4 transcription factors to maintain the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of enterocytes. In the secretory lineage, OGDH is downregulated through a process that, when modelled, increases the levels of αKG and stimulates the differentiation of secretory cells. Consistent with this, in mouse models of colitis with impaired differentiation and maturation of secretory cells, inhibition of OGDH or supplementation with αKG reversed these impairments and promoted tissue healing. Hence, OGDH dependency is lineage-specific, and its regulation helps to direct cell fate, offering insights for targeted therapies in regenerative medicine.",

          "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells use inhibitory and activating immune receptors to differentiate between human cells and pathogens. Signalling by these receptors determines whether an NK cell becomes activated and destroys a target cell. In some cases, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, immune receptors are found in pairs, with inhibitory and activating receptors containing nearly identical extracellular ligand-binding domains coupled to different intracellular signalling domains 1 . Previous studies showed that repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) proteins, displayed on the surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes, can bind to inhibitory immune receptors and dampen NK cell activation 2,3 , reducing parasite killing. However, no pathogen-derived ligand has been identified for any human activating receptor. Here we identified a clade of RIFINs that bind to inhibitory immune receptor KIR2DL1 more strongly than KIR2DL1 binds to the human ligand (MHC class I). This interaction mediates inhibitory signalling and suppresses the activation of KIR2DL1-expressing NK cells. We show that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs are abundant in field-isolated strains from both Africa and Asia and reveal how the two RIFINs bind to KIR2DL1. The RIFIN binding surface of KIR2DL1 is conserved in the cognate activating immune receptor KIR2DS1. We find that KIR2DL1-binding RIFINs can also bind to KIR2DS1, resulting in the activation of KIR2DS1-expressing NK cells. This study demonstrates that activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors can recruit NK cells to target a pathogen and reveals a potential role for activating immune receptors in controlling malaria infection.",

          "authors": "Anja Nusser, Oliver S. Thomas, Gaoqun Zhang, Daisuke Nagakubo, Laura Arrigoni, Brigitte Krauth, Thomas Boehm",
          "abstract": "The generation of self-tolerant repertoires of T cells depends on the expression of peripheral self antigens in the thymic epithelium 1 and the presence of small populations of cells that mimic the diverse phenotypes of peripheral tissues 2–7 . Whereas the molecular underpinnings of self-antigen expression have been extensively studied 8 , the developmental origins and differentiation pathways of thymic mimetic cells remain to be identified. Moreover, the histological identification of myoid and other peripheral cell types as components of the thymic microenvironment of many vertebrate species 9 raises questions regarding the evolutionary origin of this unique tolerance mechanism. Here we show that during mouse development, mimetic cells appear in the microenvironment in two successive waves. Cells that exhibit transcriptional signatures characteristic of muscle, ionocyte, goblet and ciliated cells emerge before birth, whereas others, such as those that mimic enterohepatic cells and skin keratinocytes, appear postnatally. These two groups also respond differently to modulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools caused by deletions of Foxn1 and Ascl1 , expression of a hypomorphic variant of the transcription factor FOXN1, and overexpression of the signalling molecules BMP4 and FGF7. Differences in mimetic cell populations were also observed in thymic microenvironments reconstructed by replacement of mouse Foxn1 with evolutionarily ancient Foxn1/4 gene family members, including the Foxn4 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the Foxn4 and Foxn1 genes of a cartilaginous fish. Whereas some cell types, such as ciliated cells, develop in the thymus in the absence of FOXN1, mimetic cells that appear postnatally, such as enterohepatic cells, require the activity of the vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1. The thymus of cartilaginous fishes and the thymoid of lampreys, a representative of jawless vertebrates, which exhibit an alternative adaptive immune system 10 , also harbour cells that express genes encoding peripheral tissue components such as the liver-specific protein transthyretin. Our findings suggest an evolutionary model of successive changes of thymic epithelial genetic networks enabling the coordinated contribution of peripheral antigen expression and mimetic cell formation to achieve central tolerance for vertebrate-specific innovations of tissues such as the liver 11,12 .",

          "abstract": "Compounds consisting only of the element nitrogen (polynitrogens or nitrogen allotropes) are considered promising clean energy-storage materials owing to their immense energy content that is much higher than hydrogen, ammonia or hydrazine, which are in common use, and because they release only harmless nitrogen on decomposition 1 . However, their extreme instability poses a substantial synthetic challenge and no neutral molecular nitrogen allotrope beyond N 2 has been isolated 2,3 . Here we present the room-temperature preparation of molecular N 6 (hexanitrogen) through the gas-phase reaction of chlorine or bromine with silver azide, followed by trapping in argon matrices at 10 K. We also prepared neat N 6 as a film at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), further indicating its stability. Infrared and ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, 15 N-isotope labelling and ab initio computations firmly support our findings. The preparation of a metastable molecular nitrogen allotrope beyond N 2 contributes to our fundamental scientific knowledge and possibly opens new opportunities for future energy-storage concepts. ",

The conserved transcriptional repressor SP140 inhibits interferon-β ( Ifnb1 ) expression through an unknown mechanism 3,4 . Here we report that SP140 does not directly repress Ifnb1 transcription. Instead, SP140 negatively regulates Ifnb1 mRNA stability by directly repressing the expression of a previously uncharacterized regulator that we call RESIST (regulated stimulator of interferon via stabilization of transcript; previously annotated as annexin 2 receptor). RESIST promotes Ifnb1 mRNA stability by counteracting Ifnb1 mRNA destabilization mediated by the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of RNA-binding proteins and the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex. SP140 localizes within punctate structures called nuclear bodies that have important roles in silencing DNA-virus gene expression in the nucleus 3 . Consistent with this observation, we find that SP140 inhibits replication of the gammaherpesvirus MHV68. The antiviral activity of SP140 is independent of its ability to regulate Ifnb1 . Our results establish dual antiviral and interferon regulatory functions for SP140. We propose that SP140 and RESIST participate in antiviral effector-triggered immunity 5,6 .",

Here we present data from n = 6,720 participants from 5 to 72 years old, freely viewing 40 natural scenes. We found that the development of scene viewing is surprisingly protracted. Semantic salience for social features continuously changes until adolescence, and text salience increases over the first two decades of life. Basic oculomotor biases towards the image centre and along the horizontal meridian develop until adolescence, matching developmental changes in visual sensitivity and cortex. Finally, while the tendency for visual exploration continuously increases, fixation patterns become less idiosyncratic and more canonical throughout adolescence. These findings show that fundamental aspects of adult gaze take up to two decades of continuous development and push individuals towards more canonical viewing patterns. We suggest that development is key to understanding the general mechanisms of active vision.",

          "abstract": "Recent estimates indicate that half of Ethiopian girls aged 15–19 years have experienced female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC). Establishing whether and how pro-FGMC norms are maintained through social transmission is a key priority for global eradication efforts. Here we present the first large-scale socio-centric social network study estimating social influence and social selection on preference for cutting female relatives using data from 5,163 Ethiopian Arsi Oromo adults. Statistical modelling, which accounts for network dependence in cross-sectional data, finds signals of ‘contagion’ within chatting, respect and money-borrowing networks. This indicates that social influence contributes to FGMC maintenance. We find no clear evidence of social selection within marriage-advice networks, suggesting these networks are not implicated in FGMC maintenance. Contrary to assumptions underpinning current eradication efforts, we find negligible evidence that FGMC is a social coordination norm (with only 6.3% endorsement) or an empirical or normative expectation. We conclude by making intervention design recommendations.",

          "abstract": "Individual sensitivity to environmental exposures may be genetically influenced. This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes, but these variants have proven challenging to detect. Genome-wide association studies of monozygotic twin differences are conducted through family-based variance analyses, which are more robust to the systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct one of the largest genome-wide association study meta-analyses of monozygotic phenotypic differences, in children, adolescents and adults separately, for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism and wellbeing. The proportions of phenotypic variance explained by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these phenotypes were estimated ( h 2 = 0–18%), but were imprecise. We identified 13 genome-wide significant associations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genes and gene sets), including genes related to stress reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. This is the largest genetic study of monozygotic twins to date by an order of magnitude, evidencing an alternative method to study the genetic architecture of environmental sensitivity. The statistical power was limited for some analyses, calling for better-powered future studies.",

          "abstract": "Humans solve complex multistage decision problems using hierarchical and counterfactual strategies. Here we designed a task that reliably engages these strategies and conducted hypothesis-driven experiments to identify the computational constraints that give rise to them. We found three key constraints: a bottleneck in parallel processing that promotes hierarchical analysis, a compensatory but capacity-limited counterfactual process, and working memory noise that reduces counterfactual fidelity. To test whether these strategies are computationally rational—that is, optimal given such constraints—we trained recurrent neural networks under systematically varied limitations. Only recurrent neural networks subjected to all three constraints reproduced human-like behaviour. Further analysis revealed that hierarchical, counterfactual and postdictive strategies—typically viewed as distinct—lie along a continuum of rational adaptations. These findings suggest that human decision strategies may emerge from a shared set of computational limitations, offering a unifying framework for understanding the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "The evolution of conversation facilitates the exchange of intricate thoughts and emotions. The meaning is progressively constructed by integrating both produced and perceived speech into hierarchical linguistic structures across multiple timescales, including words, sentences and discourse. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these interactive sense-making processes remain largely unknown. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during hours of spontaneous conversations, modelling neural representations of conversational content using contextual embeddings derived from a large language model (GPT) at varying timescales. Our results reveal that linguistic representations are both shared and distinct between production and comprehension, distributed across various functional networks. Shared representations, predominantly localized within language-selective regions, were consistently observed at shorter timescales, corresponding to words and single sentences. By contrast, modality-specific representations exhibited opposing timescale selectivity: shorter for production and longer for comprehension, suggesting that distinct mechanisms are involved in contextual integration. These findings suggest that conversational meaning emerges from the interplay between shared linguistic codes and modality-specific temporal integration, facilitating context-dependent comprehension and adaptive speech production.",

          "abstract": "A prominent feature of the primate visual system is its topographic organization. For understanding its origins, its computational role and its behavioural implications, computational models are of central importance. Yet, vision is commonly modelled using convolutional neural networks, which are hard-wired to learn identical features across space and thus lack topography. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing all-topographic neural networks (All-TNNs). All-TNNs develop several features reminiscent of primate topography, including smooth orientation and category selectivity maps, and enhanced processing of regions with task-relevant information. In addition, All-TNNs operate on a low energy budget, suggesting a metabolic benefit of smooth topographic organization. To test our model against behaviour, we collected a dataset of human spatial biases in object recognition and found that All-TNNs significantly outperform control models. All-TNNs thereby offer a promising candidate for modelling primate visual topography and its role in downstream behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Several cross-country examinations have found larger gender differences in Western countries. More recently, it has been argued, from an evolutionary standpoint, that equality may paradoxically increase gender differences, because it provides more freedom for men and women to pursue innate preferences. However, this paradox has primarily been examined with this cross-country methodology, opening up for other cultural differences to drive the results. For instance, measures developed in Protestant and Germanic-speaking countries, may not work the same in other cultural clusters of countries, and may not have the same statistical qualities there (e.g., in terms of reliability). Here, we reanalyze the results from multiple studies on the gender-equality paradox with country-level data available. We find that gender differences covary more strongly with cultural regions and data quality than gender equality, and that any variable higher in the West appears to achieve similar correlations as gender equality. Also, controlling for cultural regions consistently and strongly attenuates the association with gender equality, including to become statistically nonsignificant, or to switch direction. In other words, the baseline associations differ between and within cultural clusters (a Simpson’s paradox), suggesting there is no simple causal relation between gender equality and expressed gender differences. Similarly, controlling for data quality indicators strongly attenuates the paradox. Finally, we show that, with and without controls, there is no consistent paradoxical association across many of the largest cross-cultural studies on gender differences, including newly analyzed data. The same is true for other country development variables considered in the gender-equality paradox literature.",

          "abstract": "Inequality in outcomes may emerge through a reinforcement process in which stochastic variation in values is determined by prior values but may also originate in preexisting differences in unobserved factors. A common approach toward differentiating between these origins in longitudinal data is to attribute systematic differences between units—differences in means or differences proportional to a time-varying group average—to unobserved heterogeneity. We show that any longitudinal data with systematic differences can also be produced by a reinforcement-driven data generating process. This result reconciles findings in three distinct research areas—science of science, personal culture, and sexual networks—where reinforcement is a strong theoretical prior, yet longitudinal data analyses advance an explanation of interpersonal differences based on heterogeneity. Future studies may bound the role of heterogeneity and reinforcement from below by measuring fixed traits that systematically vary with the outcome and isolating random events that trigger emergent differences.",

          "abstract": "As the renewable energy transition continues into less receptive communities, local opposition is expected to intensify, potentially slowing the process. Since the local impacts are neither well quantified nor widely recognized, we lack policies and common practices to mitigate the potential associated welfare loss in affected communities. Based on a nationwide dataset combining property transactions and large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSSPV) sites, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of LSSPV on property prices and the associated causal pathways. Difference-in-differences estimates show that LSSPV significantly increases agricultural or vacant land value by about 19.4% within a 2-mile radius, while simultaneously reducing residential property values within 3 miles by about 4.8%. The estimated average negative impact on home values is primarily driven by site proximity and diminishes with both distance and time. Effect estimates are more robust to alternative specifications when proximity pairs with visibility rather than invisibility, but no evidence suggests visibility significantly amplifies the proximity effect. Heterogeneous effect estimates indicate that high solar lease potential, being in heavily Democratic-leaning counties, and brownfield redevelopment largely mitigate the negative residential value impact. The analysis reveals no significant heterogeneity across a few factors, including varying site visibility, directional orientation of properties relative to the LSSPV site, and different tracking systems. Evidence indicates that the negative impact on residential values might mainly stem from negative perceptions, but channels through physical conditions cannot be entirely dismissed. Our assessment provides benchmark information for local externality mitigation plans, potentially reducing community opposition and expediting the renewable energy transition.",

          "abstract": "Sporting events are powerful social phenomena that extend beyond the game itself, offering a unique lens to study collective emotional dynamics. We examine emotional alignment among football fans during a high-stakes match in Brazil, focusing on both the game and the preceding Rua de Fogo, a pregame ritual marked by chants, flares, and collective anticipation. Using wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensors to monitor heart rate patterns, we apply multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to track group synchrony over time. We find that the Rua de Fogo, driven by its sensory-rich and ritualized interactions, elicited the highest levels of emotional synchrony, surpassing even key moments of the game. This synchrony was sustained across participants, including the driver of the team delegation bus, who was not physically engaged in the ritual. Our results demonstrate the importance of pregame rituals in enhancing shared emotional experiences, underscoring the broader appeal of sports as a cultural phenomenon. By identifying the mechanisms underlying emotional alignment, this work contributes to understanding how collective gatherings promote unity and shared identities, with implications extending to other domains, such as religious ceremonies, political rallies, and public celebrations.",

          "abstract": "Despite living in an era where the mere concept of truth is increasingly contested, the cognitive processes underlying the processing of information we believe or disbelieve remain largely unexplored. In this fMRI study, we investigated how belief modulates narrative processing through belief context—the initial information indicating the speaker’s credibility—and actual belief—the truth value ultimately assigned by the listener. Across two experiments, participants listened to narratives preceded by contexts explicitly stating whether the speaker was lying or telling the truth. Then, after listening to the narratives, they were asked to rate their actual belief. To investigate the effects of (dis)belief on narrative processing, we analyzed neural synchronization using inter-subject-correlation analysis and inter-subject representational similarity analysis. In both experiments, we successfully differentiated (dis)belief contexts by modeling neural synchronization patterns, despite an actual “belief-bias” at the behavioral level. This indicates a unique neural pattern related to each belief context. Furthermore, our results revealed a dissociation between belief and disbelief in both contextual and actual (dis)belief. Per each narrative, belief and disbelief were associated with increased synchrony within the default mode network, but in distinguishable parcels. These findings highlight the influence of (dis)belief on narrative processing at both behavioral and neural levels. Behaviorally, the observed belief-bias supports the notion of belief as a cognitive default. Neurally, we suggest that belief and disbelief can be understood as fostering qualitatively distinct processing or interpretation of the same narrative, which are then reflected in shared neural responses among individuals who hold similar belief states.",

          "abstract": "Though racial disparities in shortened life expectancy have been well established, racial disparities in the burden of bereavement after such premature deaths are severely understudied. This is, in part, due to a lack of measurement tools for characterizing lifetime exposure to loss. We propose three indices that simultaneously quantify premature and cumulative lifetime loss—two typically unmeasured dimensions of loss. Using a longitudinal US sample of 27,985 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative burden of family member loss over the lifetime than all other racial groups across all three indices. These effects remained for Black participants after controlling for covariates such as parental education, household size, and years in the study. Second, we found that loss burden at study enrollment prospectively related to all-cause mortality. Depending on prematurity, each additional loss related to higher odds of dying during the study period after controlling for covariates such as chronic health conditions. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated death and its impact on mortality among the bereaved. The proposed measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health and earlier mortality.",

At the city level, population density has the largest effect on walk mode share and has a positive impact on cycling too, as higher densities bring destinations within feasible walk and cycle distances. Density has the strongest effects in wealthier countries where travelers often have more travel choices, while in lower-income places, walking and cycling may be primarily driven by financial constraints. We also find positive effects of bicycle lanes (proxying for a wider array of street design practices) on both walking and cycling. In the median city, each new km of bicycle lanes is associated with ~13,400 additional km yr -1 of bicycle travel. If every city increased the extent of its bicycle network to the level of Copenhagen, Denmark, our simulations indicate reductions in private vehicle emissions of ~6% and health benefits of ~US$435 billion per year.",

          "abstract": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) affects human fertility by 1) increasing the probability of multiple births through the transfer of multiple embryos, 2) raising the proportion of dizygotic twins, which leads to a higher occurrence of one-boy-one-girl twins, and 3) enabling gender selection through preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) when parents have specific gender preferences. While the above-mentioned increase in multiple births is well documented, the impact on the twins’ gender composition remains under-explored, partly because 2) and 3) are intertwined. This study uses millions of administrative observations from Taiwan to disentangle the effects of IVF on twin birth rates, gender composition, and parental preferences. Families are grouped by maternal age and family wealth across different periods, enabling a comparative analysis of socioeconomic and temporal factors. By examining the gender composition of first-born twins within these age-wealth-time groups, we can identify and test whether parents have gender preferences for one-boy-one-girl twins. Our empirical evidence reveals a significant increase in IVF adoption, particularly among older and wealthier mothers. The proportion of one-boy-one-girl twins among first-birth twins has risen from 20.42 to 41.86% over the past 30 y, and this proportion increases with wealth ranking, significantly exceeding expected ratios in the absence of gender preference. Parental gender preference contributed to approximately 10.95% of one-boy-one-girl twins among the wealthiest group, revealing a significant impact of parental preference on twin gender composition. These trends raise ethical and social concerns regarding reproductive technologies.",

          "abstract": "The influence of seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation on subsurface biogeochemical processes remains poorly understood. In the Lavey-les-Bains thermal system in the Swiss Alps, annual variations in electrical conductivity are observed to depths of 500 m, suggesting a potential link to surface environmental changes. Here we show, through year-round analyses of stable water isotopes, noble gases, and conductivity, that seasonally varying contributions of shallow groundwater from the Rhône alluvial aquifer mix with deep groundwater. Despite vertically similar fluid geochemical compositions suggesting high hydrological connectivity, microbial communities exhibit significant depth-dependent variation with minimal seasonal change. This decoupling of dynamic water source partitioning and stable microbial community structure has not been previously observed and fills a critical gap in our understanding of geothermal systems and microbial life in the deep subsurface. At 200 m, the communities are dominated by sulfur-disproportionating Bacteria ( Dissulfurispira ) and Micrarchaeota, while at 500 m the major groups include sulfate- and iron-reducers and/or hydrogen-oxidizers (Thermales, Thermodesulfobacteriota, and Bathyarchaeota). Our study highlights the resilience of terrestrial subsurface microbial communities to temporal variations in water sources and fluid composition. We propose that intrinsic environmental properties—such as temperature—are more critical drivers of microbial community structure in hydrologically connected deep aquifers than seasonal hydrological changes.",

A critical unanswered question is whether these properties are regulated by specific enhancer subsets, potentially licensing strategies that selectively block deleterious SASP components. Here, we identify two functionally distinct and independently regulated enhancer programs underlying senescence that are controlled by different TGF-β family ligands. Whereas Activin A stimulates recruitment of nuclear factor IA/C (NFIA/C) and SMAD2/3 transcription factors to an enhancer network that induces proliferation arrest, TGF-β2 promotes SMAD2/3-mediated suppression of a p65-dependent enhancer cohort driving the SASP. We have also uncovered reciprocal SMAD2/3-super-enhancer-regulated feedback loops that govern expression of the TGF-β2 ( TGFB2) and Activin A ( INHBA ) transcription units, both of which are significantly up-regulated in replicative senescence. The characteristic enhancer usage and transcriptional landscape of high-passage senescent cells are sensitive to rapamycin treatment, discontinuation of which results in robust but selective senescent enhancer activation and exacerbation of the SASP. Collectively, this study uncovers separable enhancer programs and their key constituent transcription factors that contribute to the canonical features of cellular senescence, potentially informing the development of SASP-targeted therapies.",

          "abstract": "tRNA introns are a universally conserved feature of eukaryotic genomes, but the reason for their conservation has remained obscure. We have previously shown that a defect in the essential tRNA splicing endonuclease of yeast results in transcriptome remodeling, resembling that of the integrated stress response (ISR). In this study, we show that ISR activation in this mutant requires the canonical ISR components, including the collided ribosome sensor Gcn1. We further show that splicing of tyrosine tRNA, but not splicing of any of the other intron-containing tRNAs, controls the ISR. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we show that the intron of tyrosine tRNA affects m1 A58 modification in the T arm loop of the mature tRNA. In support of these results, we show that deletion of either subunit of the enzyme that adds the m1 A58 modification also controls the ISR. Unlike the few intron-dependent modifications previously described, the intron-dependent m1 A58 modification site is distal from the intron and has a clear physiological impact. Finally, we survey the occurrence of tRNA introns in eukaryotic genomes and show that the tyrosine tRNA intron is more prevalent than any other tRNA intron. These data suggest that tRNA splicing is conserved in eukaryotes because hypomodified tyrosine tRNAs lead to collided ribosomes, resulting in stress to cell physiology.",

The mechanisms underlying the vastly different activities of PCs in the rodent hippocampal CA1 area are unknown. Here, we measured the in vivo activity of CA1 PCs using two-photon [Ca 2+ ] imaging in head-restrained mice during navigation in a virtual corridor and then performed in vitro patch-clamp recording to probe their intrinsic electrical properties and anatomical investigation to characterize their input synapses. The active and passive electrical properties of PCs were similar between PCs with different prior in vivo activities. Perisomatic inhibitory synapse density was also comparable among PCs. The average dendritic spine density and spine head area did not correlate with the mean in vivo activity of PCs, but the size of the spines of place cells was significantly larger compared to that of silent cells.

          "abstract": "For biomedical applications, new link prediction algorithms are continuously being developed. These algorithms are typically evaluated computationally, using test sets generated by sampling the edges uniformly at random. However, as we demonstrate, this evaluation approach introduces a bias toward “rich nodes,” i.e., those with higher degrees in the network. More concerningly, this bias persists even when different network snapshots are used for evaluation, as recommended in the machine learning community. This creates a cycle in research where newly developed algorithms generate more knowledge on well-studied biological entities while understudied entities are commonly overlooked. To overcome this issue, we propose a weighted validation setting specifically focusing on low-degree nodes and present AWARE strategies to facilitate bias-aware training and evaluation of link prediction algorithms. These strategies can help researchers gain better insights from computational evaluations and promote the development of new algorithms focusing on novel findings and understudied proteins.",

          "abstract": "Metabolism fuels cell growth and functions. While it is well established that cellular growth rate scales with cell size, how cells alter their metabolism as they change size remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of cell size–dependent metabolism across the NCI60 cancer cell line panel comprising a diverse range of cell sizes. We demonstrate that cellular metabolism and growth rate display 2/3 allometric scaling due to differential scaling of overall nutrient uptake and waste metabolite release with respect to cell size, with waste elimination decreasing less rapidly than nutrient uptake rate as cells grow larger. This results in cell size–dependent growth rate and predicts a maximum cell size where net nutrient uptake equals zero and cell enlargement ceases despite active metabolism. We experimentally confirm this prediction and identify that electron acceptor demand constrains cell enlargement as evidenced by depletion of intracellular aspartate and scaling of aspartate uptake, which is more than proportional to cell volume. Overall, these findings may have implications for understanding cell size homeostasis, developmental biology, and the design principles of living organisms.",

It is characterized by degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which can develop into choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to cause severe and rapid vision loss. Preventing this progression might help save vision, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, using clinical AMD samples and the gene knockout mice, we reported that the m 1 A eraser ALKBH3 reshaped retinal metabolism to promote this progression. In RPE, the dm 1 ACRISPR system demonstrated that ALKBH3 demethylated the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme HK2 to activate glycolysis, resulting in excess lactate production. This lactate promoted histone lactylation at H3K18, which in turn bound to ALKBH3 to amplify its transcription, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ALKBH3 inhibitor HUHS015 disrupted this loop, effectively mitigating RPE degeneration. Furthermore, ALKBH3 directly targeted the proangiogenic factor VEGFA to modulate the metabolic cross-talk between RPE and choroidal capillaries, thus promoting CNV. HUHS015 inhibited CNV synergistically with the anti-VEGF drug Aflibercept. Overall, our study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms and metabolic events that facilitates the progression from RPE degeneration to CNV in AMD, laying the groundwork for new treatments of age-related retinal disorders.",

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent pathogen that chronically infects the majority of human population. Among the many features that allow such widespread HCMV infection, one is its ability to maintain a transcriptionally dormant immune-evasive state called latency by suppressing its own major immediate early promoter (MIEP) via epigenetic alterations. In this study, we show a mechanism of MIEP regulation in which the major immediate early (MIE) gene product, immediate early 1 (IE1) transcript, downregulates its own promoter activity in an m 6 A modification-dependent manner. We found that the loss of the m 6 A writer, METTL3, in host cells impedes latency establishment in these cells. Through transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiling of latently infected monocytes, we identified that the major immediate early gene product IE1 transcript is m 6 A-modified during latent infection. Using IE1-specific m 6 A-abolished mutants, we found that m 6 A modification of the IE1 transcript was necessary for the efficient repression of MIEP, and these mutant viruses exhibited a significant defect in establishing latency and progressed toward lytic-like infection in the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and primary CD14+ monocytes. Our findings demonstrate that HCMV exploits the host m 6 A machinery to suppress its own lytic program to establish latency and uncover an unexpected role of immediate early gene messenger RNA (mRNA) in regulating its own expression.",

These compounds differentially activate JA responses through selective binding of specific COI-JAZ coreceptor complexes. Notably, In-Ile treatments enhanced rice resistance to brown planthopper attack, a destructive rice pest, under both laboratory and field conditions, without compromising rice’s growth or yield. Mechanistically, this agonist activates the OsMYB55-mediated lignin biosynthesis defense receptor module [OsCOI1a/2-OsJAZs (3,4,6,7,12)] without activating the growth-suppression receptor module (OsCOI1b-OsJAZs).

Single-cell RNA sequencing and electron microscope assays revealed that resistant tumor cell–expressing collagens, including Col3a1 and Col6a1 , formed multiple physical barriers surrounding tumor cells. Disruption of these barriers by collagenase or knockout of both Col3a1 and Col6a1 in tumor cells could sensitize the tumors of AIR. Mechanistically, the TGFβ pathway was upregulated upon immunotherapy, and treatment with TGFβ significantly increased the expression levels of both Col3a1 and Col6a1 in tumor cells. COL3A1 formed a castle-like barrier for a cluster of tumor cells and prevented T cell infiltration, while COL6A1 formed an armor-like barrier surrounding individual tumor cells to protect them against direct T cell attack.

The physical model explains the dynamics of slow and fast ruptures on transparent materials, as well as the amount of light transmitted across the interface during laboratory ruptures. The constitutive framework elucidates the origin of empirical friction laws, and the simulated ruptures can be described by linear elastic fracture mechanics.

          "abstract": "Germ cells transmit genetic information to offspring and maintain the genome of the species. In many animals including Drosophila , germ cell formation relies on maternal determinants in the germ plasm. Several proteins present in the germ plasm of oocytes also localize to the perinuclear nuage in nurse cells, where they contribute to the production of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These piRNAs guide the silencing of transposons, thereby protecting the germline genome from invading mobile elements. Aubergine (Aub) is a germ plasm/nuage protein and a piRNA-directed endonuclease that inactivates transposons. Aub is also essential for germ plasm assembly. The Aub-bound piRNAs in the germ plasm are inherited by the progeny germline and serve as templates for piRNA biogenesis in the next generation. Thus, piRNA production in the nurse cell nuage is thought to be coordinated with germ plasm assembly in the oocyte. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that a maternal factor, named tiny pole plasm ( tpp ), mediates this coordination. Tpp is a GTSF1 family PIWI cofactor. In tpp − ovaries, the production of piRNAs, particularly Aub-bound piRNAs, is defective, resulting in reduced Aub localization to the germ plasm and impaired germ cell formation. Notably, the levels of piRNA production required for proper Aub localization are much higher than those required for transposon silencing. We propose that producing abundant piRNAs beyond what is required for transposon silencing in the ovary promotes germ plasm assembly, thereby enabling the progeny germline to properly silence transposons for species survival.",

Effective radiative forcing quantifies the effect of such anthropogenic emissions together with natural factors on Earth’s energy balance. Evaluating the exact rate of effective radiative forcing is challenging, because it can not be directly observed. Therefore, estimating the effective forcing usually relies on climate models. Here, we present an estimate of effective radiative forcing that makes optimal use of observations. We use machine learning to learn the relationship between surface temperature and radiation caused by internal variability in a multimodel ensemble. Combining this with observations of surface temperature and the Earth’s net radiative imbalance, we predict an effective forcing trend of 0.71 ± 0.21 Wm − 2 per decade for 2001–2024. This is an independent assessment of the observed effective radiative forcing since 1985, that can be updated simultaneously with available observations and aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. We make advances to close the Earth’s energy budget on annual timescales, by separating the influence of forcing versus the radiative response to surface temperature variations. Effective radiative forcing has substantially increased since 2021 and has not been countered by a strongly negative radiative response until 2024, consistent with exceptional warmth in 2023 and 2024.",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing and synovial organoids, we demonstrate that RCAN1 + IL1α + senescent synovial fibroblasts, predominantly located in the lining layer of human OA synovium, exhibit proinflammatory phenotype, mitochondrial dysfunction, and promote cartilage degeneration. Mechanistically, RCAN1 stabilizes ATF4 mRNA and mediates saturated fatty acids (SFA) secretion from synovial fibroblasts, which could promote chondrocyte senescence and cartilage matrix degradation. Synovium-targeted delivery of anti-RCAN1 siRNA significantly ameliorated posttraumatic OA development in mice, reducing of SNC accumulation in synovium and increasing cartilage regeneration. Coculture experiments with human OA cartilage explants and synovial organoids confirm that RCAN1 silencing in synovial fibroblasts suppressess chondrocyte senescence and cartilage degradation.

Geophysical and laboratory studies of water content in the mantle transition zone (MTZ) and upper mantle solubility limits suggest these layers likely form through global dehydration melting near the 410 km discontinuity (D410). A key hypothesis posits that melts form globally but are preserved only where melt stability permits retention. However, challenges in quenching melts into glass or fine-grained crystals at mantle pressures have precluded precise determination of melt composition, fueling debates over the mechanisms governing LVLs’ sporadic distribution. Here, we developed a fast-quenching high-pressure cell assembly to synthesize hydrous glasses or fine-grained quench crystals at pressures &gt;10 GPa, enabling high-precision analysis of incipient melt composition. Experiments at 13 GPa reveal that the 410 melt contains 43 mol% H 2 O, 9.2 mol% CaO, 30.5 mol% (Mg, Fe)O, 0.2 mol% Al 2 O 3 , and 17 mol% SiO 2 . The melt’s high water content necessitates Fe enrichment to achieve neutral buoyancy, which can only be sourced from Fe-rich heterogeneities (Fe # = 100Fe/(Mg+Fe) in mole; Fe # &gt;18) within the MTZ. In contrast, melts derived from normal MTZ material (Fe # &lt;18) remain buoyant and migrate upward, precluding stable layer formation. We conclude that global dehydration melting generates hydrous melts, but only Fe-rich heterogeneities enable melt retention, reconciling the coexistence of widespread LVL detections and their lateral discontinuities.",

The jump model was completely solved analytically in our previous work and provides the exact distribution of syntenic gene block lengths (SBL) in compared genomes based on gene translocations alone. Comparing the SBL distribution predicted by the jump model with the distributions empirically observed for multiple groups of closely related bacterial and archaeal genomes, we obtained robust estimates of the genome rearrangement to gene flux (gain and loss) ratio. In most groups of bacteria and archaea, this ratio was found to be on the order of 0.1 indicating that the loss of synteny in the evolution of bacteria and archaea is driven primarily by gene gain and loss rather than by gene translocation.",

          "abstract": "The union of two or more different nuclear genomes with maternally inherited organellar genomes may lead to cytonuclear incompatibilities in plant allopolyploids. These incompatibilities may be reconciled by coevolutionary responses at the genomic and transcriptional levels. To date, the relationship between extent of divergence among parental organellar genomes and cytonuclear coevolutionary responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we studied transcriptional cytonuclear expression in synthetic alloplasmic allohexaploid wheat lines having the same nuclear subgenomic composition (the nuclear genome of Chinese Spring) but with varying cytoplasmic organelles (plasmon donors from B- and D- lineage Triticum/Aegilops species). A positive association between the extent of plastid organellar divergence from naturally occurring organelles in euplasmic Chinese Spring and transcriptional cytonuclear responses was observed. This response was enhanced under stress (highlight) treatment and was determined to be related to differential subgenomic methylation levels. These data comprise a transcriptional dimension of cytonuclear responses to polyploidy and point to a potentially responsible epigenomic regulatory mechanism.",

          "abstract": "SMAX1-LIKE (SMXL) proteins in plants are cellular signaling hubs, many of which are posttranslationally regulated by karrikins from smoke, the plant hormones strigolactones (SLs), and/or cues such as light and nutrients. SMXL proteins control diverse aspects of growth, development, and environmental adaptation in plants through transcriptional corepression and interactions with transcriptional regulator proteins. In flowering plants, the SMXL family comprises four phylogenetic clades with different roles. Functions of the aSMAX1 clade include control of germination and seedling development, while the SMXL78 clade controls shoot architecture. We investigated how SMXL roles are specified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through promoter-swapping experiments, we found that SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 . This implies that the distinct roles of these genes are primarily due to differences in protein sequences rather than expression patterns. To determine which part of SMXL proteins specifies downstream control, we tested a series of protein chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7. We found an N-terminal region that is necessary and sufficient to specify control of germination, seedling growth, or axillary branching. We screened 158 transcription factors (TFs) for interactions with SMAX1 and SMXL7 in yeast two-hybrid assays. The N-terminal domain was necessary and/or sufficient for most of the 33 potential protein–protein interactions that were identified for SMAX1. This finding unlocks different ways to engineer plant growth control through cross-wiring SMXL regulatory “input” and developmental “output” domains from different clades and lays a foundation for understanding how functional differences evolved in the SMXL family.",

While MAVS regulation is essential for antiviral defense, its modulation in keratinocytes is poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the CARD14–BCL10–MALT1 (CBM) complex, a skin-specific signaling module, in controlling MAVS-dependent antiviral responses. We identify CARD14 short as a dual regulator that activates NF-κB while inhibiting IRF3 signaling. Psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations are less efficient in restricting IRF3 activation and cytokine production upon Poly (I:C) stimulation, highlighting a potential mechanism in psoriasis pathogenesis. BCL10 is essential for MAVS-induced IRF3 activation, while MALT1 limits IRF3 signaling by promoting MAVS cleavage, K48-linked ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Genetic and chemical inhibition of MALT1 enhances IRF3 activation and type I IFN expression. These findings reveal a MAVS-CBM regulatory network linking innate immunity to epithelial homeostasis.",

Specific disruption of CXCR4 oligomers reduced basal cell migration and prosurvival signaling via changes in the phosphoproteome, indicating the existence of constitutive CXCR4 oligomer-mediated signaling. Oligomer disruption also inhibited growth of primary CLL 3D spheroids and sensitized primary malignant cells to clinically used Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Given its limited efficacy in some patients and the ability to develop resistance, sensitizing malignant B cells to venetoclax is of clinical relevance.

In cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease that arises from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene, there are signs of multiorgan disease affecting the function of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems already present at birth. Thus, treating CF patients early is crucial for preventing or delaying irreversible organ damage. Here, we demonstrate proof-of-concept of multiorgan mutation correction in CF using peptide nucleic acids encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles and delivered systemically in utero. In utero editing was associated with sustained postnatal CFTR activity, at a level similar to that of wild-type mice, in both respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues, without detection of off-target mutations in partially homologous loci. This work suggests that systemic in utero gene editing represents a viable strategy for treating monogenic diseases before birth that impact multiple tissue types.",

In this study, we investigated whether and how the MMR protein Msh2 affects TI of isogenic donor DNA. We found that HR-dependent TI is suppressed by Msh2 only when a homology arm of donor DNA is as short as 1.7 kb. In contrast, single-strand annealing–mediated TI, which is cell cycle–independent and becomes prominent when HR or non-homologous end joining is inactivated, is weakly but constantly affected by Msh2 irrespective of the size of homology arms. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized type of HR suppression by Msh2 and provide implications for precise genome editing using short-arm donor DNA vectors.",

We used an early-night LAN paradigm that was established in mice to examine behavioral and physiological consequences in adult male tree shrews. We found that 3-wk LAN exposure significantly impaired the mood and long-term memory of tree shrews without affecting the general activity pattern. We identified retinal projections to the perihabenular nucleus (pHb), a crucial area in LAN-induced negative mood, and demonstrated that the pHb continues to innervate the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in tree shrews. Moreover, the pHb was required for the LAN effect on mood but not long-term memory. Transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues containing the NAc area revealed drastic changes of several depression-related genes in NAc neurons post-LAN treatment, suggesting that long-term exposure to nighttime light could result in lasting changes in tree shrews. Collectively, we present behavioral and neural structural evidence that LAN exerts depression-inducing effects in diurnal animals via a pHb-related visual pathway, which may facilitate the translation from laboratory findings of excessive LAN exposure to clinical applications in humans.",

The physical and biological mechanisms of lumen expansion have been explored.

In this study, we utilized the ascidian notochord tube as a model to address the underlying mechanisms. We first quantitatively measured and calculated the geometric parameters and found that tube expansion experienced three distinct phases. During the growth processes, we identified and experimentally demonstrated that both Rho GTPase Cdc42 signaling-mediated cell cortex distribution and the stability of tight junctions (TJs) were essential for lumen opening and tube expansion. Based on these experimental data, a conservation-laws-based tube expansion theory was developed, considering critical cell communication pathways, including secretory activity through vesicles, asymmetric cortex tension driven anisotropic lumen geometry, as well as the TJs gate barrier function. Moreover, by estimating the critical tube expansion parameters from experimental observation, we successfully predicted tube growth kinetics under different conditions through the combination of computational and experimental approaches, highlighting the coupling between actomyosin-based active mechanics and hydraulic processes. Taken together, our findings identify the critical cellular regulatory factors that drive the biological tube expansion and maintain its stability.",

To explore liver biology changes across a lactation-wean cycle, we employed transcriptomic profiling. We identified elevated hepatocyte proliferation and anabolic metabolism gene signatures during lactation, consistent with the liver being a major producer of substrates needed for milk production. Rapid loss of these capacities upon weaning correlated with catabolic metabolism, lysosomal-mediated cell death, and an enrichment of immune-suppressive cells. Furthermore, we identified that the transcriptional profiles associated with liver involution share similarities with the gene expression patterns of liver premetastatic niches. This work identifies features of reproductive control of liver biology that set a foundation for better understanding the potential role of the liver in maternal health.",

          "abstract": "Since our first steps in life, we are forming incidental associations between diverse stimuli across various sensory modalities that influence our future choices and facilitate adaptation to environmental fluctuations. Daily behavior is usually governed by indirect incidental associations among sensory cues that have never been explicitly paired with a reinforcer. This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be systematically investigated in laboratory animals through specific behavioral paradigms such as sensory preconditioning protocols. In this study, using “Targeted Recombination in Active Populations” (TRAP2) transgenic mice, we have interrogated which are the brain areas orchestrating the encoding of associations between olfactory and gustatory stimuli and the expression of an aversive odor–taste sensory preconditioning paradigm. We identified neuronal ensembles within the basolateral amygdala specifically activated during odor–taste associations. To demonstrate the causal involvement of this brain region in our sensory preconditioning task, we inhibited it during the preconditioning phase (i.e., incidental associations) using a chemogenetic approach, which caused a clear impairment of the mediated responses. In addition, using retrograde tracers in the basolateral amygdala of TRAP2 mice, we observed that the projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex to the basolateral amygdala are particularly activated during odor–taste associations. Notably, the chemogenetic inhibition of this brain circuit impaired the mediated aversion performance in our sensory preconditioning task. Overall, these findings highlight the amygdala as a pivotal modulator of incidental associations during an aversive sensory preconditioning task and point toward a brain circuit crucially involved in these complex cognitive processes.",

Results support a mechanistic role for cortical inhibition in significantly increasing focality and strength of SMRs leading to accelerated BCI control in healthy subjects and an individual with spinal cord injury.

          "abstract": "The early detection of high-fitness viral variants is critical for pandemic response, yet limited experimental resources at the onset of variant emergence hinder effective identification. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework, VIRAL (Viral Identification via Rapid Active Learning), that integrates protein language model, Gaussian process with uncertainty estimation, and a biophysical model to predict the fitness of novel variants in a few-shot learning setting. By benchmarking on past SARS-CoV-2 data, we demonstrate that our method accelerates the identification of high-fitness variants by up to fivefold compared to random sampling while requiring experimental characterization of fewer than 1% of possible variants. We also demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies sites that are frequently mutated during natural viral evolution with a predictive advantage of up to two years compared to baseline strategies, particularly those enabling antibody escape while preserving ACE2 binding. Through systematic analysis of different acquisition strategies, we show that incorporating uncertainty in variant selection enables broader exploration of the sequence landscape, leading to the identification of evolutionarily distant but potentially dangerous variants. Our results suggest that VIRAL could serve as an effective early warning system for identifying concerning SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially emerging viruses with pandemic potential before they achieve widespread circulation.",

          "abstract": "The domestication of pigs ( Sus scrofa ) has had profound socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Although pigs are believed to have been independently domesticated in South China, the timing and initial mechanisms of this process remain debated. This study presents a microfossil analysis of pig dental calculus from two early Neolithic sites in the Lower Yangtze River region: Jingtoushan (8,300 to 7,800 cal. BP) and Kuahuqiao (8,200 to 7,000 cal. BP). Analyses of starch, phytolith, and parasite remains indicate that pigs consumed human-associated foods and waste, including cooked starchy plants and human whipworm ( Trichuris trichiura ) eggs, likely derived from food preparation and fecally contaminated materials. Identified plant taxa include acorns (Fagaceae), rice ( Oryza sp.), underground storage organs such as yam ( Dioscorea sp.), and wild grasses (Triticeae and Panicoideae), all present in the local botanical assemblages. Coefficients of variation in dental metrics further indicate the coexistence of both domestic and wild populations. Together, these lines of evidence point to multiple modes of human–pig interaction, including early domestic pigs under human management, pigs scavenging near settlements, and free-ranging individuals foraging beyond human influence. Pig domestication in the Lower Yangtze had begun by 8,000 y ago, likely following both commensal and prey pathways, in parallel with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifeways. This study also demonstrates the value of dental calculus analysis for revealing early human–animal relationships before the appearance of clear morphological markers of domestication in the archaeological record.",

          "abstract": "Munc13 family proteins are crucial for the secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones necessary for cell communication. They share a conserved C-terminal region that includes C 2 and the MUN domains, which facilitate membrane interactions and the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Neuronal isoforms of Munc13 possess a variable N-terminal region that is essential for neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity, although the precise functions of this region remain not fully understood. Here, we identified a negatively charged sequence within the N terminus of Munc13-1, termed polyE, which is specific to Munc13-1 among all Munc13 isoforms and potentially derived from a common ancestor of homeotherms. We found that polyE binds significantly to the MUN domain through charge–charge interactions, inhibiting MUN activity in promoting SNARE complex assembly. Disrupting the polyE–MUN interaction by introducing pseudophosphorylated mutations in the MUN domain alleviates this inhibition, thereby enhancing neurotransmitter release. Strikingly, Ca 2+ ions exhibit significant binding to polyE. We found that 40 μM of Ca 2+ adequately competes with the polyE–MUN interaction to reduce polyE inhibition. This concentration is comparable to presynaptic local [Ca 2+ ] i triggered by a single action potential. Taken together, these results indicate an autoinhibition conformation of Munc13-1 mediated by the polyE–MUN interaction. In addition, the relief of this autoinhibition conformation of Munc13-1 by presynaptic Ca 2+ influx and/or posttranslational modifications in the MUN domain may underlie Munc13-1 function in neurotransmitter release and short-term plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) is an important part of the plant immune system, allowing plants to sense and respond to harmful pathogen proteins known as “effectors.” Effectors can be sensed directly or indirectly by NLR (Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat) proteins, many of which “guard” the plant proteins targeted by effectors. Although a few effector–target–NLR interactions have been characterized, a general understanding of how these molecular interactions give rise to a functioning immune system is lacking. Here, we present a physics-based model of ETI based on protein–protein interactions. We show that the simplest physical model consistent with the biology gives rise to a robust immune sensor and explains the empirical phenomenon of effector interference as a generic consequence of molecules competing for binding partners. Using the evolutionarily conserved ZAR1 defense gene as a model, we explain how more complex interaction networks integrate multiple pathogen signals into a single response. We then examine alternatives to a guarding architecture, including direct sensing, decoys, and blended “integrated decoy” strategies, and reveal that these sensing architectures obey functional trade-offs between their sensitivity, target protection, and proteomic cost. This allows a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between different forms of ETI. We discuss these findings in the context of the evolutionary forces shaping the plant immune system.",

          "abstract": "Bald cypress ( Taxodium distichum ) is the longest-lived tree species in Eastern North America, but coastal cypress forests are vulnerable to a range of environmental factors [D. W. Stahle et al ., Q. Sci. Rev. 34 , 1–15 (2012)]. Here, we present analyses of bald cypress trees from a subfossil deposit at the mouth of the Altamaha River on the Georgia Coast, United States. Shifts in tree lifespans and growth rates correspond temporally to the onset of the Vandal Minimum environmental downturn, c. 500 CE. Trees that sprouted after c. 500 CE had significantly shorter lifespans on average (&lt;200 y) than those that sprouted before this point in time (&gt;470 y). Trees sprouting after c. 500 CE also grew significantly faster than those that sprouted before this point. Bald cypress lifespans at the Altamaha River mouth never recovered to pre-Vandal Minimum levels and, in fact, continued to decrease significantly over time. The last long-lived trees retrieved from the deposit died at the beginning of the Little Ice Age, another major climatic shift. This study suggests the enduring, localized impacts of climatic downturns and indicates the vulnerability to climate change of coastal cypress forests of the Southeast. These conclusions pertain to this location and, perhaps, other near-coastal forests. In remaining pockets of old-growth forest with bald cypress in the Southeast, 800 to 2600-y-old trees are still proven to be alive [D. W. Stahle et al ., Q. Sci. Rev . 34 , 1–15 (2012); D. W.

          "abstract": "Emergent patterns in biological systems arise through dissipative processes that balance reaction and transport phenomena, producing highly functional properties from self-regulating mechanisms. Synthetic fabrication, by contrast, often relies on user-controlled, multistep methods that lack the self-organizing capabilities of natural systems. Inspired by nature, we sought chemical systems that integrate strongly coupled reaction and transport phenomena, identifying frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) as a method capable of creating diverse forms and functions through reactive processing. By employing discrete molecular initiators, FROMP allows precise control of key reaction steps—inhibition, initiation, and propagation. Using an integrated computational and experimental framework, we uncover how near-equilibrium inhibition dynamics, coupled with far-from-equilibrium reaction kinetics, drive pattern formation in frontally polymerized synthetic materials. We propose the concept of equilibrium-gated pattern formation, demonstrating how initiator chemistry can be tuned to achieve programmable macroscale properties. Our study reveals a surprising insight: Emergent behavior in FROMP systems arises from the inhibition-dominated regime of resin composition, expanding prior observations that such behavior is confined to a narrow compositional space near the boundary between front quenching and uniform front propagation. We identify a broader compositional window, far from the quenching regime, where emergent behavior reliably manifests. This expanded design space significantly enhances the operational flexibility of reactive systems and their capacity for self-organization. These insights provide a roadmap for designing bioinspired materials with self-organizing capabilities, unlocking possibilities in synthetic manufacturing.",

          "abstract": "Species invasions spur costly and labor-intensive control efforts, yet even local eradication is seldom achieved. When control measures are initially effective, they may drive evolutionary adaptation that prevents full eradication, as has been documented for some chemical and biocontrol approaches. Although the intensity, directionality, and persistence of selection required to increase the frequency of resistant genotypes in complex natural ecosystems remains an open question, theory predicts that high mortality can cause life-history evolution even in the absence of a strong selective agent. Here, we use annually collected ecological and genetic data to show that rapid evolution of introduced smallmouth bass has undermined a 20-y manual suppression effort in a mid-sized lake. Despite nearly doubling annual mortality, our intensive control program produced a larger bass population dominated by young and early-maturing fish. These shifts were accompanied by large allele frequency changes in three genomic regions associated with earlier maturation and increased somatic growth. Our findings bear out the theoretical prediction that high mortality can drive evolutionary adaptation in target species. Controlling species invasions are worldwide practices that typically remove a substantial proportion of a population during each of many successive generations, hence life history adaptation may be commonplace. Such evolutionary responses could be salient in explaining the widespread failure of invasion control efforts. Genetic and phenotypic monitoring to detect cryptic adaptation and preemptive design of invader eradication programs to deliberately disrupt directional selection for resistance could improve invasion control outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of stroma-rich solid tumors acts as a significant barrier to effective chemotherapy by hindering drug penetration. In this study, a supramolecular hydrogel was successfully developed, enabling the codelivery and sequential release of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs designed to target the ECM. The hydrogel is easy to prepare, has self-healing properties and excellent biocompatibility. Upon administration, the hydrogel first releases pirfenidone to inhibit collagen production, weakening the ECM, followed by the release of paclitaxel, which improves tumor penetration. The effectiveness of this sequential drug delivery system was validated in both oral squamous cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer models, a classic example of a tumor with abundant ECM. In vitro experiments showed controlled sequential release profiles, whereas in vivo experiments using cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models revealed that the hydrogel was more effective at tumor suppression compared to traditional methods. Single administration of the hydrogel led to long-term localized drug release, maintaining higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents in the tumor tissue and effectively reducing the tumor volume. This study provided a promising strategy to enhance chemotherapy in ECM-dense tumors, offering an efficient and minimally invasive method for localized, sustained-release cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of neural circuits that respond to skin dysfunction, triggering itch, and pathophysiological scratching remains incomplete. Here, we describe a profound chronic itch phenotype in transgenic mice expressing the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) gene within the Phox2a lineage. Phox2a; tTA mice exhibit intense, localized scratching and regional skin lesions, controllable by the tTA inhibitor, doxycycline. As gabapentin and the kappa opioid receptor agonist, nalfurafine, but not morphine, significantly reduce scratching, this phenotype has a pharmacological profile of neuropathic pruritus. Importantly, the Phox2a; tTA expression occurs in a spatially restricted population of skin keratinocytes that overlaps precisely with the skin area that is scratched. Localized G i -DREADD-mediated inactivation of these Phox2a-keratinocytes completely reverses the skin lesions, while inducible tTA activation of keratinocytes initiates the condition. Notably, ablation of TRPV1-expressing primary afferent neurons also reduces scratching and skin lesions, but this occurs slowly, over a course of two months. In contrast denervation induced loss of all cutaneous input rapidly blocks scratching. These findings identify the cellular, molecular, and topographic basis of a robust and chronic sensory neuron–dependent and gabapentin-responsive neuropathic itch that is initiated by genetic factors within keratinocytes.",

          "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) with soilborne Glomeromycota fungi was pivotal in the conquest of land by plants almost half a billion years ago. In flowering plants, it is hypothesized that AM is initiated by the perception of AM fungi-derived chito- and lipochito-oligosaccharides (COs/LCOs) in the host via Lysin Motif Receptor-Like Kinases (LysM-RLKs). However, it remains uncertain whether plant perception of these molecules is a prerequisite for AM establishment and for its origin. Here, we made use of the reduced LysM-RLK complement present in the liverwort Marchantia paleacea to assess the conservation of the role played by this class of receptors during AM and in CO/LCO perception. Our reverse genetic approach demonstrates the critical function of a single LysM-RLK, MpaLYKa, in AM formation, thereby supporting an ancestral function for this receptor in symbiosis. Binding studies, cytosolic calcium variation recordings and genome-wide transcriptomics indicate that another LysM-RLK of M. paleacea , MpaLYR, is also required for triggering a response to COs and tested LCOs, despite being dispensable for AM formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the perception of symbionts by LysM-RLK is an ancestral feature in land plants, and suggest the existence of yet-uncharacterized AM fungi signals.",

          "abstract": "Reduction of China’s SO 2 emissions has been found to nonlinearly decrease the atmospheric sulfate (SO 4 2− ) aerosol concentrations in East Asia. Compared to Europe and North America, the lower effectiveness of SO 4 2− reduction in East Asia suggested much effects of “acidity-sensitive” feedback mechanisms in this high anthropogenic emission region, which have not been yet examined. In this work, we investigated these feedback mechanisms in East Asia through long-term measurements of the mass-independent oxygen-17 anomaly (Δ 17 O) in sulfate aerosols, machine learning and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. As China’s emissions reduced, the atmospheric acidity decreased, enhancing the ozone-driven oxidation of S(IV) and production efficiency of sulfate formation. This explained the weaker declining SO 4 2− concentrations than SO 2 emissions. By the evidence from observed Δ 17 O in non-sea-salt sulfate (Δ 17 O-nss-SO 4 2− ) and CMAQ simulations, the highly enhanced contributions of S(IV)+O 3 to sulfate driven by reduced SO 2 emissions explained the low effectiveness of SO 4 2− reduction in East Asia. Additionally, the decreases of acidity by substantial NH 3 emissions are projected to continue until 2050, limiting SO 4 2− reduction effectiveness. Thus, we highlighted that global control of both SO 2 and NH 3 emissions are needed to efficiently mitigate the sulfate-related climate and pollution, especially in high NH 3 emission region, such as East Asia.",

          "abstract": "Fungal pathogens infect billions and kill millions of people each year. Many of these pathogens have evolved strategies to evade our antifungal immune defenses. Candida albicans, for example, masks the proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) β-1,3-glucan, in response to specific host signals such as lactate. In C. albicans , most β-1,3-glucan lies in the inner cell wall shielded, by the outer mannan layer, from recognition by certain immune cells such as macrophages. β-1,3-glucan that becomes exposed at the cell surface can be shaved off by secreted enzymes. By integrating mathematical modeling with experimentation, we show that the dynamics of this shaving, together with the dynamics of β-1,3-glucan exposure during growth, can account for a range of β-1,3-glucan masking phenotypes. The mathematical model accurately simulates the dynamics of β-1,3-glucan exposure during growth and predicts levels of β-1,3-glucan shaving under a variety of conditions, revealing how subtle differences in growth contribute to observed variabilities in lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan masking. For example, clinical isolates previously thought to display minimal lactate-induced masking are shown to mask robustly. Using a range of C. albicans mutants, we confirm the importance of Gpr1/Gpa2-protein kinase A signaling for lactate-induced β-1,3-glucan shaving and define the contributions of the Xog1 and Eng1 glucanases to this shaving. Furthermore, examination of a shielding-defective C. albicans mnn2 x6 mutant confirms that both β-1,3-glucan shaving and shielding contribute to the dynamism of β-1,3-glucan masking at the fungal cell surface. Dynamism in PAMP masking is likely to be relevant to other fungal pathogens of humans.",

          "abstract": "The limited doubling capacity of human cells, known as replicative senescence or cellular senescence, is a major factor in cellular aging. This process is triggered by telomere erosion, which activates a p53-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) that halts cell proliferation. p53, a transcriptional regulator, responds to DNA damage by increasing the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. p21 then arrests cells at specific stages of the cell cycle. Additionally, p53 upregulates serpinB2 (also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, PAI-2), which stabilizes p21 in senescent cells. This study reveals that serpinB2 upregulation activates transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), which selectively deamidates multiple glutamine residues on p21, stabilizing the protein and halting cell proliferation in senescent cells. Moreover, inhibiting TGM2-mediated deamidation accelerates p21 degradation, delaying the onset of senescence. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of TGM2 improves aging phenotypes in an accelerated aging model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). These findings provide crucial insights into the role of TGM2-mediated enzymatic deamidation in senescence and its potential relevance to age-associated conditions.",

          "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the world’s largest projected increase in demand for food. Increased dependence on imports makes SSA vulnerable to geopolitical and economic risks, while further expansion of agricultural land is environmentally harmful. Cereals, in particular, maize, millet, rice, sorghum, and wheat, take nearly 50% of the cropland and 43% of the calories and proteins consumed in the region. Demand is projected to double until 2050. Here, we assess recent developments in cereal self-sufficiency and provide outlooks until 2050 under different intensification, area expansion, and climate change scenarios. We use detailed data for ten countries. Cereal self-sufficiency increased between 2010 and 2020 from 84 to 92% despite the 29% population increase. The production increase was achieved by increased yields per hectare (44%), area expansion (34%), and a shift from millet to the higher yielding maize (22%). Outlooks for 2050 are less pessimistic than earlier assessments because of the larger 2020 baseline area, higher shares of maize and somewhat less steep projected population increase. Yet, to halt further area expansion, a drastic trend change in annual yield increase from the present 20 to 58 kg ha −1 y −1 is needed to achieve cereal self-sufficiency. While such yield increases have been achieved elsewhere and are feasible given the yield potentials in SSA, they require structural changes and substantial agronomic, socioeconomic, and political investments. We estimate that amounts of added nitrogen need to at least triple to achieve such yield improvements, but it is essential that this comes with improved context-specific agronomy.",

          "abstract": "Subcellular compartmentalization is integral to the spatial regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. However, the biological outputs associated with location-specific mTOR signaling events are poorly understood and challenging to decouple. Here, we engineered synthetic intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) that are capable of modulating mTOR signaling with genetically programmable spatial resolution. Epitope-directed phage display was exploited to generate high affinity synthetic antibody fragments (Fabs) against the FKBP12–Rapamycin binding site of mTOR (mTOR FRB ). We determined high-resolution crystal structures of two unique Fabs that discriminate distinct conformational states of mTOR FRB through recognition of its substrate recruitment interface. By leveraging these conformation-specific binders as intracellular probes, we uncovered the structural basis for an allosteric mechanism governing mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) stability mediated by subtle structural adjustments within mTOR FRB . Furthermore, our results demonstrated that synthetic binders emulate natural substrates by employing divergent yet complementary hydrophobic residues at defined positions, underscoring the broad molecular recognition capability of mTOR FRB . Intracellular signaling studies showed differential time-dependent inhibition of S6 kinase 1 and Akt phosphorylation by genetically encoded intrabodies, thus supporting a mechanism of inhibition analogous to the natural product rapamycin. Finally, we implemented a feasible approach to selectively modulate mTOR signaling in the nucleus through spatially programmed intrabody expression. These findings establish intrabodies as versatile tools for dissecting the conformational regulation of mTORC1 and should be useful to explore how location-specific mTOR signaling influences disease progression.",

In maize, the target genes that 21-nt phasiRNAs regulate remain largely unknown. Here, we show that 21-nt phasiRNAs direct the cleavage of hundreds of target mRNAs in maize. Interestingly, while 21-nt phasiRNAs in anthers (somatic anther wall cells) do not have obvious preference for a particular nucleotide at the 5′ end and target genes implicated in stress response and cellular homeostasis, 21-nt phasiRNAs in male germ cells preferentially initiate with 5′ C and target genes related to meiotic processes in a ZmAGO5c-dependent manner. Our results indicate that mRNA cleavage is a conserved mechanism used by 21-nt phasiRNAs for gene regulation in grasses. However, the sequences of 21-nt phasiRNAs and their targets show little conservation in maize and rice, suggesting that 21PHAS loci and 21-nt phasiRNA targets have undergone fast divergence in grasses.",

Through comprehensive transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) and polysome profiling analyses, we elucidated the dynamic interplay of regulation at the transcriptional and translational levels during germination. We show that delayed germination in some ribosome-defective mutants is partially regulated by the gene ABSCISIC ACID DEFICIENT2 ( ABA2 ), with an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5′ untranslated region that represses translation of the downstream ORF encoding ABA2. In addition, disrupting rice OsABA2 uORF inhibited preharvest sprouting (PHS). Furthermore, we found two main haplotypes for the uORF among rice cultivars that result in different OsABA2 expression levels, thus contributing to diverse PHS phenotypes.

Despite the importance of PARP7 in these processes, PARP7 signaling networks remain underresearched. Here, we used genome-wide CRISPR screens and multiplex quantitative proteomics in distinct lung cancer cell lines treated with a PARP7 inhibitor to better understand PARP7 molecular functions. We find that manipulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) transcriptional activity mediates PARP7 inhibitor sensitivity and triggers robust changes to the AHR-controlled proteome (AHR-ome). One of the striking features of such AHR-ome remodeling was the downregulation of filamins A and B concurrent with the induction of the corresponding E3 ubiquitin ligase ASB2. We also show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) crosstalks to AHR. Inhibition of PARP7 in SOCS3 knockout cells leads to reduced viability compared to wild-type cells treated with a PARP7 inhibitor. Our results reveal signaling interplay between PARP7, AHR, and SOCS3 and establish an invaluable resource to study the role of PARP7 in the regulation of AHR signaling and innate immunity through its ADP-ribosyl transferase activity.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies have indicated that the transcription factor Creb5 is expressed in the joint interzone, which contains the progenitors for all synovial joint tissues in both mouse and human embryos. In the absence of Creb5 function, most synovial joint interzones fail to form and the cartilage templates in the long bones remain fused. This earlier work did not clarify whether Creb5 initiates a cascade of signaling molecules, such as growth and differentiation factor 5 (Gdf5) and Wnt-family members, that in turn induce the formation of the joint interzone, or instead directly activates the expression of joint interzone markers. In the present study, an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and Creb5-occupancy in joint progenitors revealed that Creb5 directly binds to both its own two promoters and to the regulatory regions of Gdf5 and Sfrp2 , each of whose expression in the joint interzone is Creb5-dependent. Functional enhancer analysis indicated that Creb5 binding sites in either the two Creb5 promoters, or in Gdf5 and Sfrp2 regulatory elements are necessary for these sequences to drive transgene expression in the developing synovial joints. While Creb5 directly drives Gdf5 and Sfrp2 expression in the inner joint interzone, Creb5 activates Barx1 expression specifically in the outer joint interzone. Our findings indicate that Creb5 initiates a regulatory network that both promotes the formation of synovial joints, and subsequently activates distinct transcriptional targets in the inner versus the outer regions of the joint interzone, thus regionalizing gene expression in the developing joint.",

Clinical studies have suggested a correlation between periodontitis and sleep deficiency, but the underlying mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we observed an elevated risk of periodontitis in individuals with sleep deficiency, as demonstrated in both clinical subjects and mouse models. Retrograde tracing from the periodontium revealed a neural connection from trigeminal TRPV1 neurons, which may mediate the aggravating effects of sleep deficiency on periodontitis. The ablation of TRPV1 neurons effectively mitigated the aggravating effects of sleep deficiency on periodontitis. Under periodontitis, sleep restriction increased the secretion of substance P from trigeminal neurons in the periodontium, enhancing vasodilation and vascular permeability, which in turn promoted the infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells. Blocking substance P signaling via a Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist or knocking down Tacr1 in vascular endothelial cells alleviated these detrimental effects. Our findings unveil a critical neuron-vessel-immune axis that exacerbates periodontitis during sleep deficiency and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting this axis for managing periodontitis in individuals suffering from sleep deficiency.",

Understanding and controlling factors affecting DNA–RNA strand displacement reactions is necessary to enable control of processes such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. By combining multiscale modeling with strand displacement experiments, we show that the distribution of bases within the displacement domain has a very strong effect on reaction kinetics, a feature unique to DNA–RNA hybrid strand displacement. Merely by redistributing bases within a displacement domain of fixed base composition, we are able to design sequences whose reaction rates span more than four orders of magnitude. We extensively characterize this effect in reactions involving the invasion of dsDNA by an RNA strand, as well as the invasion of a hybrid duplex by a DNA strand. In all-DNA strand displacement reactions, we find a predictable but relatively weak sequence dependence, confirming that DNA–RNA strand displacement permits far more thermodynamic and kinetic control than its all-DNA counterpart. We show that oxNA, a recently introduced coarse-grained model of DNA–RNA hybrids, can reproduce trends in experimentally observed reaction rates. We also develop a simple kinetic model for predicting strand displacement rates. On the basis of these results, we argue that base distribution effects may play an important role in natural R-loop formation and in the function of the guide RNAs that direct CRISPR-Cas systems.",

These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development. We then examined whether these trajectories were associated with literacy (sub)skills or influenced by familial risk of reading difficulty and children’s home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to early elementary school decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as one of the strongest behavioral predictors of decoding and word reading skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool.

Here, we explored the regulation of neuronal ALKAL2 in a colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model. We found that neuronal ALKAL2 is upregulated at early stages of CAC, which in turn activates ALK signaling in the colonic mucosa. Notably, treating mouse colonic organoids with exogenous ALKAL2 triggered ALK activation. In vivo, mice treated with the ALK inhibitor lorlatinib at the onset of colitis exhibited a remarkable 90% reduction in tumor burden without significantly affecting overall inflammation. Moreover, activating TRPV1+ neurons using DREADD technology exacerbated tumor growth, whereas silencing these neurons significantly reduced it.

In this study, we characterized the dynamics of CRE activation and TF occupancy during zebrafish EHT, and found that the enhancer–promoter collaboration forms the basis for EHT. Moreover, a ubiquitously expressed TF AP-1 collaborates with diverse lineage-specific TFs to remodel enhancer landscape. Deletion of AP-1 family member Jund impaired hematopoietic specification, resulting from the enhanced endothelial identity in the HEC. Mechanistically, Jund and hematopoietic TF Hoxa9a collectively repress the activity of an endothelial-related dll4 enhancer through tight control of the active histone modification H3K27ac.

To obtain mechanistic insights into several antiphage systems identified in previous studies, we isolated 66 phage escape mutants which had become insensitive to 13 distinct, plasmid-encoded lactococcal phage resistance systems (i.e. Rhea, Kamadhenu, Rugutis, Audmula, PARIS, type II CBASS, Septu, AbiA, AbiB, AbiD/F, AbiG, AbiJ, AbiP). Genome analysis of these phage escape mutants identified a total of 15 mutated genes. Six of the encoded proteins appear to activate specific antiphage systems. Furthermore, AbiA escape mutants were found to be insensitive to AbiJ, while distinct antiphage systems (AbiG and AbiP) were observed to be activated by a major phage tail protein, indicating mechanistic commonalities. PARIS homologues encoded by members of different bacterial genera appear to share similar sensing mechanisms, whereas our data indicate mechanistic differences between Septu homologues from different genera. Based on our escape mutant sequence analysis, previously predicted domains, and experimental data using the purified endolysin of phage c2, we propose that Audmula modifies the cell wall of the host bacterium, delaying cell lysis and release of progeny phages, protecting the host cell by a heretofore unknown mode of action. The obtained advances in our understanding of lactococcal antiphage mechanisms provide fundamental insights into phage–host interactions, which undoubtedly benefits the dairy industry but may also be useful for biotechnological or biomedical applications.",

Here, we explore the self-assembly of neural circuits in Hydra , an organism with a simple nervous system but no centralized information processing, to enhance the understanding of nervous system evolution. We define self-assembly as spontaneous organization of neurons into functional circuits without requiring a prespecified structural template. In this context, the N4 neuronal circuit, which we have previously found to be particularly important in the feeding of the animal, develops in embryos through activity-driven self-assembly, a process in which intrinsic calcium activity drives connectivity and synchronization among spatially distributed neurons over time. Gap junctions and vesicle-mediated communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells drive rapid assembly, with the embryo’s prospective oral region exhibiting the highest neuronal density. An artificial electrical circuit–based model as a biophysically inspired simulation demonstrates dynamic increases in synchronization over time, along with predictions for selective dynamic adaptions of connections. Environmental factors, like temperature and an absent microbiome, modify neural architecture, suggesting the existence of a certain adaptability during neural development. We propose that these fundamental features originated in the last common bilaterian ancestor, supporting the hypothesis that the basic architecture of the nervous system is universal. Since in the natural habitat of Hydra both temperature fluctuations and changes in the microbiome can occur, our work not only illuminates a fundamental developmental process but also may guide environmental and evolutionary studies by explaining how organisms adapt to environmental variations.",

          "abstract": "Shape-shifting structures can transform and recover their shapes in response to external stimuli, but they often lack programmable, clock-like control over spatiotemporal deformation and motion, especially after stimuli are removed. Achieving autonomous, time-regulated spatiotemporal motion remains a grand challenge. Here, we present an autonomous delayed-jumping metashell that integrates viscoelastic materials with monostable architected structures to address this limitation. The metashell with tunable prestored elastic energy features an internal time clock enabling programmable autonomous delayed snapping and jumping after actuation removal. The delay spans from seconds to 2.4 d, with jumping heights decreasing from over 9 to 0.5 body heights. We demonstrate its utility in autonomous explosive seed dispersal devices, achieving wide-area omnidirectional distribution with high survival rates. This strategy paves the way for creating autonomous spatiotemporal shape-shifting structures with broad applications in robotics, morphing matter, ecology, and intelligent systems.",

However, the nature of internal redistribution that occurs in the bulk of the collective is less clear. Using light-dimerizable kinesin motors to spatially control the formation and contraction of a microtubule network, we deliberately photobleach a grid pattern onto the filament network serving as a transient and dynamic coordinate system to observe the deformation and translation of the remaining fluorescent squares of microtubules. We find that the network contracts at a rate set by motor speed but is accompanied by a diffusive-like spread throughout the bulk of the contracting network with effective diffusion constant two orders of magnitude lower than that for freely diffusing microtubules. We further find that on micron scales, the diffusive timescale is only a factor of ≈3 slower than that of advection regardless of conditions, showing that the global contraction and long-time relaxation from this diffusive behavior are both motor-driven but exhibit local competition within the network bulk.",

Saimaa ringed seals show genetic, behavioral, and morphological differences from the other ringed seal subspecies, but the extent these differences stem from the end of the last glacial period remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate with comprehensive sampling and state-of-the-art genomic methods that the Saimaa ringed seals are much older than the lake they inhabit, having formed a separate evolutionary branch for at least 60,000 y. This deep evolutionary origin of the Saimaa ringed seals is further underscored by anatomical differences, including our ecomorphological analyses revealing adaptively distinct features in their dentition and tongue. Overall, glacial relicts may harbor a richer selection of evolutionary history than might be expected from their recent isolation history alone.",

          "abstract": "Necroptosis and apoptosis are two alternatively regulated cell death pathways. Activation of RIPK1 upon engagement of TNFR1 by TNFα may promote necroptosis by interacting with RIPK3 or apoptosis by activating caspases. RIPK1 is extensively regulated by a variety of dynamic posttranslational modifications which control its kinase activity and formation of downstream complexes to mediate necroptosis and apoptosis. Here, we investigate the functional significance and mechanism by which PARP12, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, interacts with RIPK1 and RIPK3 in cells stimulated by IFNγ and TNFα. We show that PARP12 catalyzes the mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of RIPK1 in both the intermediate domain and the kinase domain, as well as the MARylation of RIPK3. PARP12 deficiency reduces necroptosis by inhibiting the activation of RIPK1 kinase and its interaction with RIPK3, as well as sensitizes to apoptosis by promoting the binding of RIPK1 with caspase-8. Thus, upon induction by IFNs, PARP12 may function as a cellular checkpoint that controls RIPK1 to promote necroptosis and inhibit apoptosis. Importantly, while PARP12 is a known interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), PARP12 deficiency promotes the expression of a subset of ISGs and confers protection against influenza A virus-induced mortality in mice. Our study demonstrates that PARP12 is an important modulator of cellular antiviral response.",

SlPLT6 knockout caused precocious ripening initiation and enhanced fruit qualities without penalizing yield in two tomato cultivars. SlPLT6 represses genes involved in ripening initiation and major quality traits by directly binding to their promoters. Moreover, SlPLT6 connects two repressive mechanisms by recruiting Histone Deacetylase 1 via its C-terminal EAR motif and LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1b through the first AP2 domain. Furthermore, Sly-miR159 acts upstream of SlPLT6 to release its repression. Taken together, our data provide insights into the operating mode of SlPLT6 in modulating fruit ripening and quality traits and define a unique gene for targeted crop improvement aimed at upgrading fruit quality without yield penalty.",

          "abstract": "The breaking of translational symmetry at oxide surfaces gives rise to coordinatively unsaturated cations/anions and surface restructuring—key factors that govern surface reactivity. Using direct in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations along with atomistic modeling, we report oscillatory redox behavior in CuO under H 2 , where cyclic surface reconstruction and reactivity modulation occur via the Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. We observe self-switching between oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient surface reconstructions, alternately activating and deactivating the surface for H 2 O formation. During periods of chemical inactivity, the oxygen-deficient surface undergoes slow reoxidation via lattice oxygen diffusing from subsurface and bulk reservoirs, restoring the active oxygen-rich surface termination. The inherent disparity in chemical activity among undercoordinated surface ions, along with sluggish subsurface-to-surface oxygen replenishment, drives this oscillatory redox cycle, modulating H 2 -induced loss of lattice oxygen at the surface and its delayed replenishment from the subsurface. This creates spatiotemporally separated redox steps at the oxide surface. The phenomena and atomistic insights presented here have significant implications for manipulating the surface reactivity of oxides by tuning the separation of these redox steps.",

          "abstract": "To fertilize an oocyte, mammalian spermatozoa must undergo a maturation step known as capacitation that takes place after ejaculation. Protein kinase A (PKA) plays a fundamental role in capacitation in all mammalian species. Before capacitation, PKA is maintained in an inactive state where the catalytic subunits are bound to a dimer of inhibitory regulatory subunits. A key element in the regulation of PKA lies in its intracellular compartmentalization achieved by docking at A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP). Despite the crucial role of the modulation of local PKA activity in fertilization, its localization and mechanism of compartmentalization are not well understood. Here, we approach this problem using quantitative laser scanning microscopy and superresolution imaging to dissect the interactions and relocalization of PKA subunits during capacitation. We find that in the resting state, both catalytic and regulatory subunits colocalize close to the axoneme. Upon capacitation, the PKA regulatory subunits, but not the catalytic subunits, relocate to a quadrilateral structure along the flagellum principal piece, in the vicinity of AKAP4 and the CatSper channel signaling complex. Furthermore, this quadrilateral localization of PKA regulatory subunits disappears in sperm from CatSper1 knockout mice. The sharp difference between the localization of PKA regulatory subunits in capacitated vs. noncapacitated sperm cells demonstrates its suitability as a biomarker for identifying capacitation, an enduring problem in the study of sperm physiology.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer has now overtaken lung cancer as the “world’s leading cancer,” yet detecting and implementing effective therapies remains a significant challenge. Substantial advances have been made in photothermal therapy (PTT), where photosensitizers use photonic energy to induce localized hyperthermia for cancer eradication. This pioneering approach is gaining traction in clinical settings. However, traditional PTT faces inherent limitations, including the risk of damage to neighboring healthy tissues and potential inflammatory responses due to overheating. Drawing inspiration from the distinct characteristics of aggregation-induced emission the small molecule, PM331, was chosen for study. This donor–acceptor–donor system displays good photothermal conversion efficiencies (40% and 66%) upon excitation at 808 nm and 1,064 nm, respectively. It is also characterized by attractive optical features in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. Using nanoparticles containing PM331, PM331@F127 , we have developed a PTT strategy, termed dual-laser PTT (DLPTT), that involves successive excitation using 808 nm and 1,064 nm lasers guided by both NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. The DLPTT strategy involves two steps. First, it initiates DNA damage and downregulates heat shock protein expression as the result of an initial brief irradiation with an 808 nm laser. This is then followed by irradiation with a 1,064 nm laser to ablate tumor cells while minimizing inflammation and harm to surrounding healthy tissues. Based on the findings reported here, we suggest that DLPTT could represent an attractive approach to precision medicine and one that could make PTT more amenable to clinical implementation.",

Previously, AHE in RuO 2 was observed only in strain-relaxed thick films under extremely high magnetic fields (~50 T). Yet, in ultrathin strained films with distinctive anisotropic electronic structures, there are no reports, likely due to disorder and defects suppressing metallicity thus hindering its detection. Here, we demonstrate that ultrathin, fully strained 2 nm TiO 2 / t nm RuO 2 /TiO 2 (110) heterostructures, grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, retain metallicity and exhibit a sizeable AHE at a significantly lower magnetic field (&lt; 9 T). Density functional theory calculations reveal that epitaxial strain stabilizes a noncompensated magnetic ground state and reconfigures magnetic ordering in RuO 2 (110) thin films. These findings establish ultrathin RuO 2 as a platform for strain-engineered magnetism and underscore the transformative potential of epitaxial design in advancing spintronic technologies.",

          "abstract": "The recent Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) sets ambitious goals but no clear pathway for how zero loss of important biodiversity areas and halting human-induced extinction of threatened species will be achieved. We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "The complex morphological evolution of lithium metal at the solid-state electrolyte interface limits performance of solid-state batteries, leading to inhomogeneous reactions and contact loss. Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures. The counterintuitive strategy of adding electrochemically inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates the utility of interfacial self-regulation for solid-state batteries.",

Individual organisms, such as insects, have the potential to serve as natural reaction platforms in which high densities of multiple enzymes can perform new and complex reactions. We report an “in-insect” unnatural product synthesis that takes advantage of their xenobiotic metabolism. We selectively transform belt- and ring-shaped molecular nanocarbons into otherwise difficult-to-prepare derivatives in which oxygen atoms are inserted into aromatic rings. Cytochrome P450 variants are most likely the enzymes responsible for this reaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations indicated a possible mode of substrate incorporation into the enzyme and an unconventional mechanism of direct oxygen insertion into carbon–carbon bonds.",

Most models of the corona extrapolate its magnetic field from that measured on the photosphere (the Sun’s optical surface) over a full 27-day solar rotational period, providing a time-stationary approximation. We present a model of the corona that evolves continuously in time, by assimilating photospheric magnetic field observations as they become available. This approach reproduces dynamical features that do not appear in time-stationary models. We used the model to predict coronal structure during the total solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 near the maximum of the solar activity cycle. There is better agreement between the model predictions and eclipse observations in coronal regions located above recently assimilated photospheric data.",

However, thriving populations of aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in AMZs challenge this assumption and remain unexplained. Using theory and modeling, we show how periodic oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic NOB in AMZs alongside more competitive aerobic heterotrophs. Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change.",

Most investment focused on reactive law enforcement—rangers, tracking dogs, access controls, and detection cameras—which helped achieve &gt;700 poacher arrests. Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching). By contrast, reducing poacher reward through dehorning (2284 rhinos across eight reserves) achieved large (~78%) and abrupt reductions in poaching using 1.2% of the budget. Some poaching of dehorned rhinos continued because poachers targeted horn stumps and regrowth, signaling the need for regular dehorning alongside judicious use of law enforcement.",

Integrated carbon and nitrogen management holds the potential for a 74% reduction in nitrogen losses to air and water and a 91% decrease in carbon emissions to the atmosphere by 2060. Compared with separate control of carbon or nitrogen, integrated management delivers an additional reduction of 1.8 million tons of nitrogen and 26.5 million tons of carbon by 2060, bringing out a 37% decrease in unit abatement cost and a net societal benefit of 1384 billion USD.",

Mutations in MC4R and ADCY3 as well as ciliary dysfunction lead to obesity, but how melanocortin signaling works in cilia remains unclear. Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations in G protein–coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45) that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited Gα s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R + neurons caused obesity. These findings establish GPR45 as a key regulator of the ciliary melanocortin system, bridging MC4R and ADCY3.",

Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual.",

We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids.

However, such liquid-like membraneless bodies can undergo aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions into amyloid-like pathological species, which necessitates their efficient clearance by the cellular protein quality control machinery comprising molecular chaperones. We present a unique case to demonstrate that a heat shock protein 40 (Ydj1) promotes the heterotypic phase separation of intrinsically disordered tau via a multitude of interactions. Using multicolor imaging, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, vibrational Raman spectroscopy, and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we unmask the crucial molecular events associated with heterotypic phase separation of tau. We show that the presence of Ydj1 within condensates abolishes phase transitions into amyloids, unlike tau-only droplets that spontaneously mature into amyloid fibrils. We identify the amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that interacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1 promoting tau-Ydj1 condensate formation. Our results provide mechanistic underpinnings of condensate-mediated protein homeostasis.",

Here, we sought to address this in the context of cold exposure, a well-studied metabolic perturbation. We performed proteomics across six metabolic tissues and plasma, quantifying 11,394 proteins. Beginning our investigation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we identified a mechanism to explain enhanced glucose utilization in cold-adapted BAT. This was characterized by select remodeling of upper glycolysis and pentose cycling to increase oxygen consumption, likely by increasing uncoupling protein 1 activity through the production of reactive oxygen species. Cold-induced remodeling of the plasma proteome appeared to underpin the ability of BAT to modify its fuel preference, stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue and glucose production in the liver. These findings emphasize the importance of considering metabolic adaptations in the context of the whole body and suggest overlap between the mechanisms of cold adaptation and obesity.",

In this study, we show that zircons from the ~2.5–billion years ago TTGs in the Eastern Block (EB) of the North China Craton have low water contents (median of 263 parts per million) and high δ 18 O values (median of 6.22‰) and a negative correlation between them, which suggest a thick hybridized and hydrated mafic source. By contrast, zircon water contents of the adjoining coeval TTGs in the Trans-North China Orogen, formed in a supra-subduction zone setting, are notably higher. These results support a two-stage mantle plume-sagduction process for TTG formation. Our study suggests that Archean continental crust, such as that in the EB, most likely originated from plume-related oceanic plateaus, rather than subduction-related island arc magmatism under a plate tectonic regime.",

Here, we demonstrate a strategy for FDW engineering by tailoring the interfacial electrostatic profile. Using SrRuO 3 islands as “nano-masks,” we spatially modulate the interfacial atomic termination to generate alternating positive and negative built-in electric fields. The boundaries where the electric field switches polarity drive the formation of 180° FDWs in BiFeO 3 thin films. This mechanism is validated through theoretical calculations and direct experimental observations. Furthermore, atomic-scale analysis reveals localized lattice distortions, structural chirality of the FDWs, as well as the edge effect of SrRuO 3 islands on the position precision of FDW nucleation. Our findings pave the way toward a scalable and controllable bottom-up FDW-growth technique for future FDW nanoelectronics.",

To fill this technological gap, we have developed the eXtra Large FOV Miniscope (MiniXL) for mice, a 3.5-gram miniaturized microscope with an FOV measuring 3.5 mm in diameter. We demonstrate the capabilities of the MiniXL through large-scale neuronal population records in hippocampal dorsal CA1. We also demonstrate simultaneous multi-brain region imaging across bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc) during complex social behavior and stably track cells across multiple days. As with all microscopes in the UCLA Miniscope ecosystem, the MiniXL is fully open-source and designed to be shared with the neuroscience community to lower the barriers for adoption of this technology.",

Traditional design strategies, based on hydrophobicity and structural propensity, can be biased and could indeed prevent discovery of interesting, diverse, and unconventional peptides with desired nanostructure assembly. Using β sheet formation in pentapeptides as a case study, we used an integrated high-throughput experimental workflow and an artificial intelligence–driven active learning framework to improve prediction accuracy of self-assembly. By focusing on sequences where machine learning (ML) predictions deviate from conventional design strategies, we synthesized and tested 268 pentapeptides, successfully finding 96 forming β sheet assemblies, including unconventional sequences (e.g., ILFSM, LMISI, MITIY, MISIW, and WKIYI) not predicted by traditional methods. Our ML models outperformed conventional β sheet propensity tables, revealing useful chemical design rules. A web interface is provided to facilitate community access to these models.

While the initiation of regeneration has been studied extensively, how the damage response ends and normal gene expression returns is unclear. We found that in Drosophila wing imaginal discs, the pioneer transcription factor Zelda controls the exit from regeneration and return to normal gene expression. Optogenetic inactivation of Zelda during regeneration disrupted patterning, induced cell fate errors, and caused morphological defects yet had no effect on normal wing development. Using Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease, we identified targets of Zelda important for the end of regeneration, including genes that control wing margin and vein specification, compartment identity, and cell adhesion. We also found that GAGA factor and Fork head similarly coordinate patterning after regeneration and that chromatin regions bound by Zelda increase in accessibility during regeneration. Thus, Zelda orchestrates the transition from regeneration to normal gene expression, highlighting a fundamental difference between developmental and regeneration patterning in the wing disc.",

Mitochondrial activity, biomass, and efficiency are critical to this balance. While activity and biomass are well characterized in PD pathology, mitochondrial metabolic efficiency remains insufficiently explored. Our previous studies showed that the protein product of PD-associated gene DJ-1 modulates metabolic efficiency through its interaction with the F1Fo-ATP-synthase β subunit (β-sub). Here, using proximity ligation assay (PLA), we compared mitochondrial DJ-1-β-sub association in distinct mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neuronal subpopulations and their intracellular compartments of PD and control postmortem brains. In PD brains, DJ-1-β-sub-PLA was lower than control in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) somata and neurites but unchanged in ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. In PD and control cases, the PLA signal was reduced in distal neurites of SNpc compared to VTA neurons. These intracellular and region-specific differences suggest that impaired mitochondrial efficiency may contribute to the differential vulnerability of mesDA neurons in PD.",

The TCR libraries were panned against NY-ESO-1, which enabled us to collect thousands of epitope-specific TCR sequences. Leveraging these data, we trained a machine learning TCR-epitope interaction predictor and identified several epitope-specific TCRs from TCR repertoires. Cellular assays revealed that the predicted TCRs displayed activity toward NY-ESO-1 and no detectable cross-reactivity.

Using lymphoid progenitor–tracking systems, we report tissue segregation, a unique differentiation pathway, and the functions of L-cDCs. Notably, L-cDC2s are predominantly distributed in barrier tissues such as the lungs and skin. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the enrichment of lymphocyte signature genes in L-cDCs. We identified lymphocyte-primed cDC precursors, which are distinct from pDC-like cells, as sources of L-cDCs. Compared with M-cDC2s, L-cDC2s weakly primed T cells under low-dose antigen stimulation and preferentially promoted T helper 2 (T H 2) differentiation under sufficient antigenic stimulation.

Loading single atoms is known to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, as their activity is heavily influenced by the microenvironment. Therefore, achieving precise control over the microenvironment of single atoms is crucial but remains a substantial challenge. Here, we reported a unique Pt–C/TiO 2 photocatalyst with Pt quantum dots (Pt QD ) and C-coordinated Pt single atoms (Pt SA ). Under the given experimental conditions, the hydrogen production rate reaches 43.2 mmol hour −1 with 70 mg of the photocatalyst. Notably, the hydrogen molecules generated per incident photon (H 2 /photon) reach 0.92. The special coordination environment influenced by C not only provides a direct transmission channel for photogenerated electrons but also activates surrounding Ti, thus improving the separation of the electron-hole pairs and H 2 production performance.

In this context, 25% of the area (formerly blue hue) is turning light blue or green, while the remaining 11% becomes bluer, mainly concentrating in the low-latitude oceans. This study further identifies a “direct” notable impact of both sea surface temperature (SST) and climate on ocean colorimetry tendency and anomaly, especially in the low-latitude oceans. Extreme SST events cause “distinct” ocean colorimetry anomalies, although 94% of cases involve relatively small SST fluctuations. Causal analysis reveals important impacts of climate change on equatorial ocean dynamics, particularly ENSO events. Our findings prove the low-latitude oceans as one of the core changing regions that respond to climate change in the early 21st century.",

Nevertheless, the fundamental, molecular-level mechanisms governing ion selectivity are still not fully understood. This study explores ion selectivity in polyamide desalination membranes, focusing on the partitioning and diffusion mechanisms of co-ions and counterions. Our experimental and molecular simulation results reveal that electrostatic interactions play a key role in impeding co-ion partitioning while enhancing their diffusion. The results further suggest that ion selectivity is predominantly controlled by the partitioning step, particularly the selective partitioning of co-ions. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on ion partitioning at the water-membrane interface to improve membrane ion-ion selectivity. In addition, our results point out to a trade-off between partitioning and diffusion, requiring careful tuning of these processes. Overall, this study provides the scientific foundation for molecular design of membranes with high ion-ion selectivity.",

Viroporins constitute a growing group of virus-encoded transmembrane oligomeric proteins that allow passage of small molecules across the membrane. Despite sparsity in viroporin structures, recent work has revealed diversity in both the number of transmembrane helices and oligomeric states. Here, we provide evidence that the small hydrophobic protein (SH) from mumps virus is a pentameric viroporin. From extensive biophysical data, a HADDOCK model of full-length SH shows its intracellular C-terminal region to form an extended structure crucial to stabilization of the pentamer. Heterologous expression of wild-type SH and variants in Xenopus laevis oocytes reveals the viroporin as a chloride channel, with transport facilitated by conserved hydroxyl-carrying residues lining the pore. The channel function of SH is inhibited by the small-molecule BIT225, highlighting the potential for antiviral targeting through SH.",

Profiles and samples collected directly beneath Bud’s wake revealed rapid OMZ shoaling of 29 to 50 meters, reaching depths as shallow as 41 meters. Untargeted mass spectrometry–based characterization of organic matter, along with elevated particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll concentrations, demonstrated production and accumulation of distinct organic compounds—including phytoplankton biomarkers—within a hurricane-generated phytoplankton bloom. 16 S rRNA transcripts from active microbes were dominated by degraders of phytoplankton-derived organic matter near the surface and by anaerobic bacteria (including sulfate-reducing bacteria) within the shoaled OMZ—indicating rapid microbial responses. Tropical cyclones therefore severely disrupt OMZ biogeochemistry through vertical OMZ expansion and altered carbon cycling.",

          "abstract": "In contrast to global warming, the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced long-term cooling throughout the 20th century. This cooling, known as the North Atlantic cold blob, has been hypothesized to arise from reduced poleward oceanic heat transport associated with a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Here, by diagnosing historical simulations from multiple coupled climate models, we find that ocean heat transport is not the only pathway through which the AMOC modulates sea surface temperature variability. A weakened AMOC is also associated with colder, drier lower atmospheric conditions, which lead to a reduction in surface warming expected from increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases by reducing downward clear-sky longwave radiation at the surface. This radiative pathway and the oceanic processes contribute equally to the North Atlantic cold blob. These results highlight the importance of the AMOC’s impact on atmospheric properties and their radiative effects.",

After defining a classical nuclear limit that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium, we include nuclear quantum effects through a variational polaron transformation of the high-frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum-mechanical benchmark calculations and applied to three prototypical light-harvesting complexes. For light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the inter-ring transfer is 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than in the classical treatment. For the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, the transfer rate is the same in both cases, whereas for light-harvesting complex II of spinach, the transfer is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. The effect is most pronounced for systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes. In all cases, nuclear quantum effects are found to be unimportant for the directionality of energy transfer.",

To date, designing artificial scattering structures that match the performance of these organic structures has proven challenging. Typically, sound manipulation relies on active transduction in fluid media rather than passive scattering principles, as often observed in nature. In this work, we use computational morphogenesis to create complex, energy-efficient, wavelength-sized single-material scattering structures that passively decompose radiated sound into its spatio-spectral components. Specifically, we design an acoustic rainbow structure with “above unity” efficiency and an acoustic wavelength splitter. Our work demonstrates what is possible when using computational morphogenesis to tailor the emission and reception of sound fields, with relevance to disciplines concerned with the sensing and emission of wave fields.",

          "abstract": "High-entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted attention due to their unique elemental synergistic effect and lattice distortion. However, mixing elements’ vastly different radii and valences leads to substantial element segregation during the reaction. In addition, the requirement for a harsh temperature (1100°C) to achieve entropy stabilization results in the volatilization of low–melting point components. Here, we propose a strategy for synthesizing functionalized Ga-based HEOs (GHEOs) at a low temperature (400°C) by the Ga integration mechanism. The negative mixing enthalpy between Ga and other metals reduces the Gibbs free energy, enabling the creation of homogeneous GHEOs through a hydrothermal process at a lower temperature. The Ga integration mechanism is supported by thermodynamic and density functional theory analyses. In particular, the perovskite, spinel, and rock salt crystal can be precisely tuned by choosing metal ions, enabling tailored applications in electrocatalysis, energy-saving materials, and methane sensors. Hence, this GHEOs strategy can be extended to realize many ideal GHEOs adjusted for specific applications.",

Advances in deep learning–based protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2-multimer (AF2M) and ESMFold, provide opportunities for studying these challenging proteins. Here, we introduce RBPseg, a method that combines monomeric ESMFold predictions with a structural-based domain identification approach, to divide tail fiber sequences into manageable fractions for high-confidence modeling with AF2M. Using this approach, we generated complete tail fiber models, validated by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy of five fibers from three phages. A structural classification of 67 fibers identified 16 distinct classes and 89 domains, revealing patterns of modularity, convergence, divergence, and domain swapping. Our findings suggest that these structural classes represent at least 24% of the known tail fiber universe, providing key insights into their evolution and functionality.",

We show that only chemokines able to bind these two phospholipids kill bacteria and that they exert rapid bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects with a higher potency than the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin 3. Both biochemical and genetic interference with the chemokine-cardiolipin interaction impaired microbial growth arrest, bacterial killing, and membrane disruption by chemokines. Moreover, unlike conventional antibiotics, Escherichia coli failed to develop resistance when placed under increasing antimicrobial chemokine pressure in vitro.

          "abstract": "Two kinds of multidimensional atom interferometers are demonstrated that are capable of measuring both the magnitude and direction of applied inertial forces. These interferometers, built from ultracold Bose-Einstein condensed rubidium atoms, use an original design that operates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice. Through time-dependent lattice position control, we realize Bloch oscillations in two dimensions and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the observed Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied acceleration of 2 g along two axes, where g is Earth’s gravitational acceleration. For the Michelson interferometer, we perform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments for two-axis accelerations and demonstrate vector parameter estimation. Accelerations can be measured from single experimental runs and do not require repeated shots to construct a fringe. The performance of our device is near the quantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of the atoms.",

Color consistency in computer vision, color constancy in human perception, and color accuracy in biomedical imaging are intertwined, complicating digital color–based diagnostics. Existing color reference charts and correction algorithms are inadequate for mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine in digital health applications where detecting subtle color changes is critical. We present a machine reading and learning platform for color recognition and quantification to extract diagnostic information from colors. A unique combination of spectroscopic gamut determination, reference color optimization, nonsubjective quantification metrics, and neural network–based color recovery retrieves absolute colors of biological tissue. Studies on inflammation bioimaging of photocarcinogenesis and mHealth blood hemoglobin assessment demonstrate accuracy and precision in color recovery across diverse acquisition scenarios. The reported framework overcomes limitations of conventional colorimetric detection, enabling machine-compatible color-based bioassays and bioimaging, advancing digital diagnostics.",

This study investigates the nature and dynamics of defect-localized excitons under in-plane magnetic fields using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Observations reveal a sharp PL peak, indicative of single-photon emission, with doublet peaks from hybridized spin–state excitons. Notably, magnetic brightening of the PL peak was detected at a low magnetic field (&lt;1 tesla), and the dynamics of hybridized-state excitons under magnetic fields indicated field-induced state mixing, explaining the magnetic brightening. These findings advance tunable single-photon emitters controlled by magnetic fields, with implications for quantum optics applications.",

We show that frequency synchronization is achieved over a range of intrinsic frequency detuning and is thus a robust effect.

Changes in the trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)–type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play an essential role in synaptic plasticity, which is the cellular basis of learning and memory. To explore receptor trafficking, genetically encoded approaches (e.g., the fusion of fluorescent proteins to receptors) are often used. However, concerns remain that genetic approaches cannot fully reproduce the receptor functions that are inherent to neurons. Herein, we report on PFQX1(AF488), a fluorescent probe for the visualization of cell-surface AMPARs without any genetic manipulation to neurons. The rapid and reversible staining features of this probe enabled snapshot imaging, which showed the accumulation of native AMPARs in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the mechanism of this synaptic accumulation, for which genetically encoded approaches have given controversial results, was revealed by integrating two chemical methods: PFQX1(AF488) and covalent chemical labeling.",

Algorithms used in classical optimization methods cannot avoid assessing high-energy states where, for example, simulated annealing is designed to initially spend computational effort. We introduce a scalable, practical, and accurate approach using quantum annealing to efficiently sample low-energy configurations of disordered materials, avoiding the need for excessive high-energy calculations. Our method includes temperature and simulates large unit cells, producing a Boltzmann-like distribution to identify thermodynamically relevant structures.

While stimulation of vagal efferent neurons is known to reduce maladaptive host responses during endotoxemia, only selective vagal afferent neuron stimulation inhibited TLR7-induced macrophage activation and neutrophil recruitment to the lung. These anti-inflammatory actions are dependent on adrenal gland–derived epinephrine, as adrenalectomy or inhibition of epinephrine production eliminated the protection afforded by VNS. Selective afferent VNS induced activation in the nucleus tractus solitarius and the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of neuronal activity in this brain region that controls peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity rendered VNS ineffective. Activation of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) is critical for innate immune cell suppression, as the anti-inflammatory effects of VNS were eliminated in β 2 AR knockout mice and with pharmacological inhibition of the β 2 AR. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified neuroimmune circuit elicited by VNS that can control acute lung inflammation.",

In this work, we investigate the mechanism of air fluorescence from excited neutral N 2 molecules by carrier-envelope phase–stabilized sub–4 femtosecond pulses. Our results show that fluorescence from N 2 + ions reaches a maximum with cosine-like pulses, while fluorescence from excited neutral N 2 molecules peaks with sine-like pulses. In addition, by scanning the chirp of the driving pulse, we find that ionic fluorescence is maximized with chirp-free pulses, whereas neutral fluorescence favors negatively chirped pulses. These observations, supported by classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations, support the mechanism of intersystem crossing from excited spin-singlet states, which are populated via recollision-induced strong-field excitation.",

There is now mounting evidence that the CoREST complex plays oncogenic roles, although the contributions of its catalytic versus noncatalytic functions remain unclear. Here, we summarize and discuss mechanisms whereby the CoREST complex coopts tissue-specific transcription factors to elicit pathogenic activity in cancer and neurodegenerative disease. We also identify tumor types with selective dependencies on the scaffolding properties of the CoREST complex. We argue that these tumor types may benefit from a KBTBD4-activating/CoREST complex degrader therapy, which could also enhance antitumor immunity and sensitize resistant tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, understanding how the CoREST complex operates abnormally and differences between its targeting through catalytic inhibitors or protein degraders will help discern all possible applications for targeting therapies now in clinical development.",

Our investigation of Syx17 function in Drosophila nephrocytes and salivary gland cells revealed unexpected effects. We find that Syx17 loss induces the formation of autophagosome-lysosome clusters in a HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting)–dependent manner, entrapping this tether, autophagosomes, and lysosomes. While locked in clusters, these organelles cannot participate in other vesicle fusions, impeding endosomal progression and autophagosome secretion. Therefore, the absence of Syx17 not only inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion but also prevents HOPS release from autophagosome-lysosome tethering sites causing a “tethering lock.” Preventing autophagosome formation or removing the HOPS adaptor Plekhm1 (pleckstrin homology domain–containing family M member 1) leads to release of HOPS and lysosomes from these clusters, thus rescuing secondary effects of Syx17 loss. Our findings show that a tethering lock can disrupt multiple vesicle trafficking routes.",

Here, we found that ablation of splenic FRCs impaired virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed that FRCs promote CD8 + T cell clustering with type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) in the T cell zone before migration to the infected marginal zone. Without FRCs, T cells instead clustered with cDC1 and virus-infected cells in the marginal zone, leading to suboptimal priming. Mechanistically, FRCs coordinated early viral replication and the inflammatory milieu for optimal DC activation, and an intact FRC network was crucial for generating effector T cells and maintaining protective memory T cells.

While membranes can decarbonize H 2 /CO 2 separation, their moderate H 2 /CO 2 selectivity requires secondary H 2 purification by pressure swing adsorption. Here, we report hyperselective carbon molecular sieve hollow fiber membranes showing H 2 /CO 2 selectivity exceeding 7000 under mixture permeation at 150°C, which is almost 30 times higher than the most selective nonmetallic membrane reported in the literature. The membrane is able to maintain an ultrahigh H 2 /CO 2 selectivity over 1400 under mixture permeation at 400°C. Pore structure characterization suggests that highly refined ultramicropores are responsible for effectively discriminating the closely sized H 2 and CO 2 molecules in the hyperselective carbon molecular sieve membrane.

Bulk tissue δ 13 C and δ 15 N analysis showed that fishes in kelp forests had larger trophic niches and greater interspecific niche separation than fishes on turf reefs. Moreover, δ 13 C analysis of essential amino acids revealed that kelp-derived energy accounted for most of the energy used by kelp forest fishes (&gt; 50% on average), whereas fishes on turf reefs compensated for kelp decline via greater reliance on a phytoplankton-based energy channel.

          "abstract": "The impact of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled with denitrification on the emission of the denitrification intermediate N 2 O remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the influence of AOM coupled with nitrate and nitrite reduction on soil N 2 O emissions and the associated microbial interactions. We show that AOM coupled with denitrification markedly reduces soil N 2 O emissions, with the type I methanotroph Methylobacter species collaborating with the Methylophilaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae families to perform key roles. The suppression of N 2 O emissions by AOM primarily stems from its role in supplying electrons and carbon sources, fueling complete denitrification by associated bacteria. In addition, we uncovered distinct microbial interaction strategies for AOM-coupled nitrate and nitrite reduction. While nitrite reduction necessitates both bacterial cooperation and extracellular electron transfer during its initial stages, nitrate reduction predominantly depends on methanotrophic bacteria alone at the outset. These findings advance our understanding of carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling and underscore AOM’s potential to simultaneously mitigate both CH 4 and N 2 O emissions.",

          "abstract": "Self-powered sensing related to triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a sustainable self-sufficient power source for environmental monitoring by harvesting energy from a living environment is critical in the field of energy and environmental science. However, features of small energy-density and irregularity of environmental energy make it difficult to use directly for real-time environmental monitoring. Here, we report a self-powered and self-calibrated environmental monitoring system (SSEMS) composed of TENG, a calibration resistor, and a sensor network in parallel for real-time temperature and humidity monitoring. The calibration resistor can monitor in real time the irregular output of TENG from the irregularity of rainfalls. SSEMS uses this calibrating signal to calibrate the sensing signal in real time, achieving accurate sensing with an error margin less than 5.0%. We applied SSEMS under waterfalls and rainfalls to monitor in real time the environmental temperature and relative humidity with a sensing error as low as 1.0%. This work promotes self-powering technology one step further to practical applications.",

          "abstract": "Past coral range expansions suggest that high-latitude environments may serve as refugia, potentially buffering coral biodiversity loss due to climate change. We explore this possibility for corals globally, using a dynamic metacommunity model incorporating temperature, photosynthetically available radiation, pH, and four distinct, interacting coral assemblages. This model reasonably reproduces the observed distribution and recent decline of corals across the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean. Our simulations suggest that there is a mismatch between the timescales of coral reef decline and range expansion under future predicted climate change. Whereas the most severe declines in coral cover will likely occur within 40 to 80 years, large-scale coral reef expansion requires centuries. The absence of large-scale coral refugia in the face of rapid anthropogenic climate change emphasizes the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate nonthermal stressors for corals, both in the tropics and in higher latitudes.",

However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of atomic-scale structures remain a substantial challenge. Here, we developed ultralow tip oscillation amplitude s-SNOM (ULA-SNOM), where the ultraconfined field localized at a 1-nm-scale gap between a plasmonic tip and sample is combined with frequency-modulation (noncontact) AFM in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM. ULA-SNOM paves the way for the acquisition of optical information from atomic-scale structures, such as single photo-active defects and molecules.",

Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals ultrafast internal conversion and intersystem crossing, along with oscillatory features superimposed on transient signals that unveil coherent vibrational dynamics. Two dominant modes are identified: a longitudinal mode scaling with rod length and a transverse mode independent of aspect ratio. Theoretical simulations support these findings and clarify the structural origins of the observed vibrational behavior.

Critical bacterial and mammalian cell factors involved are PltC R109 residue and carbohydrate sulfotransferases CHST2/4. One notable effect associated with the hepatobiliary tropism of PltC typhoid toxin is a reduction in bile acids, consequently promoting S. Typhi pathogenicity in infected mice. Similarly, bile acids serve as anti– S. Typhi infectivity agents at the cellular level, as bile acids inhibit invasion of mammalian cells.

Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased small interfering RNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. We derive a series of novel small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit virus-induced TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad antiviral activities including attenuating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in two animal models. Together, these results delineate a virally triggered pathway that impairs lysosomal homeostasis in the host.

Despite their severe impacts, their atmospheric drivers and future trends remain unclear. Using a 160-year documentary record, historical reanalysis datasets, and statistical modeling, we examine the climatic and hydrological controls of ice-jam floods in the lower Yellow River, one of the world’s most flood-prone rivers. Our findings show that ice-jam floods are strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric teleconnections, including the Arctic Oscillation, Siberian High, and Ural Blocking, which regulate regional thermal contrasts and cold-air intrusions. Over the past century, ice-jam flood frequency has declined, with hot spots shifting toward the river estuary due to weakening upstream-to-downstream temperature gradients under climate warming. Projections using bias-corrected CMIP6 multimodel ensemble indicate a continued decline in ice-jam flood occurrences by 2100.

Sex differences in AVS progression depend on valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activating to myofibroblasts that drive aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling. To date, no treatment strategies have leveraged cellular sex differences to determine drug combinations that target VIC myofibroblast activation. Here, we harnessed IDentif.AI, an artificial intelligence (AI)–derived platform, to optimize sex-biased synergistic drug combinations that may prevent and reverse VIC myofibroblast activation on hydrogel biomaterials. The results reveal that sex-specific drug response models can be used to predict sex biases in drug efficacy and combinatorial interactions. This study provides a framework for developing AVS treatments through the integration of high-throughput hydrogel cell culture platforms and AI-driven drug optimization.

Here, we report a small luminescent molecule, TPA2PyPh, as a potent antibacterial agent and its potential for lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer strategy in treating bacterial sepsis. Engineered macrophages, created by directly incubating TPA2PyPh with macrophages, enabled the luminogen to precisely bind to intracellular lipid droplets. Upon engulfment of bacteria, these TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages use natural lipid uptake mechanisms to deliver the luminogen to intracellular bacteria, disrupting their membranes and inserting into the bacterial DNA, thereby inducing bacterial elimination. Our findings show that the adoptive transfer of TPA2PyPh-loaded macrophages substantially diminishes bacterial burden in septic mice and substantially reduces mortality rates. This study demonstrates the potential of TPA2PyPh as an effective antibacterial agent and supports the use of adoptive lipid droplet–engineered macrophage transfer as an effective approach for treating sepsis and managing severe infectious diseases.",

We found that in the localized model of neuroblastoma, low-dose radiation delivered by 177 Lu-NM600, an alkylphosphocholine mimetic RPT agent, followed 9 days later by GD2 TRAC- CAR T cells led to complete tumor regression. Irradiation of neuroblastoma before GD2 TRAC- CAR T cells enhanced the release by CAR T cells of perforin, granzyme B, tumor necrosis factor–α, and interleukin-7 while abrogating transforming growth factor–β1. Low-dose RPT up-regulated the death receptor Fas on neuroblastoma, potentially enabling CAR-independent killing. This suggests that low-dose RPT can enhance suboptimal CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors.

Here, we reveal a mechanism in which light chain 3 proteins (LC3s) and pericentrin (PCNT) form an adaptor complex that is required for vRNPs binding to the dynein 1 and IAV uncoating at endosomes. This function of LC3s and PCNT is independent from their established role in autophagy and centrosome assembly, respectively. LC3s or PCNT depletion severely impairs IAV cytoplasm entry and infection, which can be further inhibited by additional silencing of histone deacetylase 6, an APM component.

This thermal preference increases wasp mortality and enhances host survival. We find that behavioral fever is mediated by up-regulation of Heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) genes in infected hosts as Hsp70 loss abolishes behavioral fever, whereas its overexpression induces heat-seeking behavior. We further find that behavioral fever up-regulates immune genes in infected hosts, including 12 antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) genes, which disrupt the gut microbiota homeostasis of parasitoid wasps and, in turn, lead to substantial wasp mortality. Our findings elucidate the detailed mechanisms of behavioral fever in Drosophila hosts, advancing our understanding of ectothermic animal defenses against macroparasites.",

Crystal structures reveal a steric clash between the rigid, bulky NIR tert -butyl group and the β-branched Val 166 , disrupting the covalent binding of NIR to the catalytic Cys 145 and leading to high resistance in BA.1 and WA1 replicons. NIR-resistant replicons remained susceptible to GC376, which can still covalently bind Cys 145 by avoiding a steric clash with Val 166 through “wiggling and jiggling.” Hence, strategic flexibility is a strategy that will help design second-generation antivirals against NIR-resistant viruses.",

          "abstract": "Direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced neurons (iNs) has become an attractive strategy for the generation of patient-specific neurons for disease modeling and regenerative neuroscience. To this end, adult human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) present one of the most relevant cell sources. However, iNs generated from adult hDFs using two-dimensional cultures are difficult to maintain in vitro and face challenges in survival upon transplantation into the adult brain, thus imposing constraints on biomedical applications of iN technology. Here, we present a platform for direct in vitro reprogramming of adult hDFs inside three-dimensional suspension microcultures (3D-iNs). We show that the 3D environment favors neuronal over fibroblast cellular identity to yield more robust conversion into functional neurons with extended culturing span. The 3D reprogramming approach also provides a platform for fusion into induced assembloids. 3D-iNs can be gently harvested and transplanted into the adult rodent brain to reproducibly generate neuron-rich grafts, thus eliminating a major bottleneck in the direct reprogramming field.",

Using photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), we explored the gas-phase reaction of the methyl radical (CH 3 • ) with the aromatic and resonance-stabilized fluorenyl radical (C 13 H 9 • ) under high-temperature conditions in a chemical microreactor. Anthracene and phenanthrene were detected isomer-selectively using photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves and mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra. While phenanthrene is produced through a radical-radical recombination of the carbon-centered radicals, anthracene may plausibly be formed through an unconventional radical addition to a low spin-density fluorenyl carbon. These pathways result in five-membered ring expansion—a critical mechanism crucial to PAH mass growth converting bent PAHs into planar nanostructures.",

Cd24a + cells gave rise to the dentin-pulp complex, while Pax9 + ones mainly generated periodontal tissues. During development, guided by alveolar bone–derived PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor, B polypeptide), Cd24a + / Pax9 + cells gradually concentrated on the apical region during the crown-to-root transition, collectively migrated and formed dental root. Cell ablation and conditional Wnt knockout notably compromised tooth establishment. Single-cell RNA sequencing, CUT&amp;Tag, and spatial mapping further revealed distinct features of Cd24a + / Pax9 + cells and their cellular organization. Last, the CD24 + / PAX9 + core was also present in human teeth, suggesting it as a conserved developmental program. Together, our work underscores the role of spatially organized dental stem cells in the postnatal establishment of a model mineralized organ in mammals.",

However, impairments resulting from glass elongation that make the phase and the propagation time of guided light change with external temperature remain even in HCFs. Here, we demonstrate an HCF made from an ultralow expansion glass that exhibits a three orders of magnitude lower coefficient of thermal delay than traditional fibers.

Our reconstructions indicate remarkable stability of water table depth in a Pacific Northwest aquifer throughout the LGT despite increasing precipitation, closely matching independent Earth system model (ESM) simulations. In the American Southwest, ESM simulations and noble gas isotopes both suggest a pronounced LGT decline in water table depth in in response to decreasing precipitation, indicating distinct regional groundwater responses to climate. Despite the hydrologic simplicity of ESMs, their agreement with proxy reconstructions of past water table depth suggests that these models hold value in understanding groundwater dynamics and projecting large-scale aquifer responses to climate forcing.",

To investigate diversity in auditory representation within and between the sexes, we used molecular and functional analyses to explore Aedes aegypti mosquito auditory processing. We identified shared and dimorphic neurons connecting mosquito ears to the brains’ primary auditory processing center. Calcium imaging from this brain region facilitated definition of multiple neuronal clusters based on auditory stimulation responses. More clusters with greater complexity were identified in males than females, with these clusters highly differentiated among males. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses found enrichment of ciliary-related factors in male ears compared to females, potentially underlying sexual dimorphisms in hearing systems.",

To explore mechanisms underlying these effects in SNCA Dupl neurons, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate isogenic control hiPSCs. Isogenic correction of SNCA dosage restored SNCA Dupl -induced neurite defects and bTubIII levels. Multi-omics analyses revealed SNCA Dupl -induced alterations in neuronal differentiation, with a notable down-regulation of PAX6. Moreover, SNCA Dupl induced an up-regulation of vimentin. Further characterization revealed heightened vimentin truncation associated with altered distribution and organization. Similar changes in vimentin levels and truncation were observed in postmortem putamen tissue from patients with sporadic PD.

Targeting the inactive conformation of LRRK2 is functionally distinct from targeting the active-like conformation using type I inhibitors. We designed these inhibitors with a combinatorial chemistry approach fusing selective LRRK2 type I and promiscuous type II inhibitors using iterative cycles of synthesis supported by structural biology and activity testing. Our lead compounds are selective and potent toward both LRRK2 and LRRK1, a close relative of LRRK2. Through cellular assays, cryo–electron microscopy structural analysis, and in vitro motility assays, we show that our inhibitors stabilize the open, inactive LRRK2 kinase conformation.

First, 3D models of the mammary duct/alveoli (D/A) were designed inspired by shapes found in vivo. Photoresins based on mammary decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) were optimized to match the mechanical properties of native breast tissue. Next, these D/A models were printed with a volumetric printer and seeded with human milk-derived mammary epithelial cells (MECs). MECs formed stable epithelial layers on the printed surfaces and secreted the β-casein and milk fat globules.

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptomic heterogeneity of vascular endothelial cells in CLEC5A-deficient lungs following CLP. Endothelial-specific knockdown of CLEC5A improved survival of CLP-challenged mice, which was completely ineffective with reexpression of endothelial CLEC5A. The survival benefits were attributed to alleviated inflammatory storm and vascular leakage. Furthermore, endothelial CLEC5A deficiency protected mice against Escherichia coli –induced pneumonia. In vitro, CLEC5A deletion maintained trans-endothelial electrical resistance, and inhibited adhesion and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes/neutrophils under LPS stimulation.

Using ultracold gases, here, we experimentally investigate the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system with neither disorder nor tilt potential, which has been predicted to exhibit HSF caused by a strong interatomic interaction. Specifically, we analyze far-from-equilibrium dynamics starting from a charge density wave of doublons (atoms in doubly occupied sites) in a singlon- and doublon-resolved manner to reveal a slowing down of the relaxation in a strongly interacting regime. We find that the numbers of singlons and doublons are conserved during the dynamics, indicating HSF as a mechanism of the observed slow relaxation.

By analyzing &gt;2000 canyons, we show that canyon occurrence correlates with the inclination of continental slopes. Onshore orogeny and associated surface processes, long considered key controls on canyon formation, play a subordinate role. Instead, our results suggest slope inclination as the primary control on submarine canyon density. Because continental slope morphology is fundamentally shaped by marine tectonic and thermal processes, these large-scale forces indirectly govern canyon formation and distribution globally.

          "abstract": "The impact of chemotherapy-induced tumor cell pyroptosis on fibroblasts, a key stromal cell type within the tumor microenvironment (TME), remains unexplored. Here, we report morphologically and molecularly distinct subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in bladder cancer, including αSMA + IL-6 − myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs), αSMA − IL-6 + inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), and hybrid i/myCAFs. Caspase-1–dependent tumor pyroptosis releases several inflammatory chemokines, converting αSMA + CAF into iCAFs in a CCR6-dependent manner. This is clinically relevant, as a fibroblast gene signature driven by iCAF markers and collagen type III is enriched in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrary to the current notion, iCAFs, rather than myCAFs, produce collagen III in response to chemotherapy, supporting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, tumor cell pyroptosis initiates an iCAF-CSC feedforward loop that drives chemoresistance, indicating that inflammatory cell death is not universally beneficial to anticancer therapy, depending on the target cell type.",

However, the problem of notably low machining speed remains unsolved. Here, we demonstrate that by transiently exciting electrons in a transparent material, the laser drilling speed is increased by a factor of 1 million compared to that in multishot percussion drilling. By irradiating with a single shot of a spatially shaped ultrashort laser pulse, the optical properties are momentarily changed on the picosecond scale, making the material considerably easier to machine by a successive laser pulse. The selective absorption of laser energy in regions with excited electrons leads to the rapid heating and evaporation of material at an extraordinarily high speed. Furthermore, the machining is achieved using a low-power light source, four orders of magnitude lower than conventional femtosecond lasers. The concept of transiently altering material properties is expected to usher in a paradigm shift in research and development for manufacturing.",

While p-type doping of conjugated polymers can be readily achieved with a variety of oxidants, n-type doping is more challenging, usually requiring highly reactive reducing agents. Here, we demonstrate that an air-stable photoredox catalyst (acridinium salt), together with a mild and air-stable reducing agent (amine), can effectively dope common n-type conjugated polymers under light at room temperature, yielding conductivity values on par with the highest obtained via other means. We elucidate the mechanism and show that this photoredox n-doping occurs via a one-photon–one-electron transfer process that is catalytic in nature. This simple and facile n-doping approach opens more avenues for doping organic semiconductors with the potential to revolutionize device design and substantially enhance doping efficiency.",

Interlaced by tectonic faults, the surface records convergent motions that induced crustal disappearance in some areas. Subduction has been advocated as an explanation; however, its driving mechanism still remains unexplained. We perform numerical simulations to test under what conditions may lateral compression initiate subduction in Europa’s ice shell. We demonstrate that subduction-like recycling can occur only for shells of thickness ≲ 10 kilometers, transporting the surface ice into the subsurface ocean. We further show that compression large enough to initiate subduction-like behavior in a thin shell is achieved during brief periods of enhanced eccentricity, implying increased hydrothermal activity at the seafloor. Together with the subduction-like transport of surface oxidants, such conjunction should favor chemical disequilibria in the ocean, increasing its astrobiological potential.",

One of their anatomical hallmarks is the onion-like cell layers surrounding the central axon. The innermost layers consist of ~60 densely packed lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), whose function remains largely unknown. Using high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy, we found that LSCs do not form concentric rings, but complex, multilayered, and intertwining assemblies that are connected via a high density of desmosomes and gap junctions. LSCs make multiple converging contacts with the afferent axon via desmosomes. Using optogenetic manipulations of LSCs, we demonstrate not only that their activation drives reliable time-locked spiking in the axon but also that their inactivation significantly elevates the thresholds in situ and increases perceptual thresholds behaviorally. Together, these findings provide evidence that LSCs are a key element of somatosensory processing, actively potentiating mechanosensitivity in Pacinian corpuscles.",

Rivers, critical for drinking water and food supply, have seen rapid increases in mercury concentrations and export to coastal margins since the Industrial Revolution (~1850). However, patterns of these changes remain understudied, limiting assessments of environmental policies. Here, we develop a global model to simulate preindustrial riverine total mercury and assess human perturbations by comparing it to present-day conditions. We find that global rivers transported ~390 megagrams annually of mercury to the oceans in the preindustrial era, with spatial variability. Human activities have elevated riverine mercury budgets by two to three times in the present day. Establishing a baseline riverine mercury level, our findings reveal rapid responses of riverine mercury to human perturbations and could be used to inform targets for global riverine mercury restoration. Total riverine mercury concentrations could also be used as indicators to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of mercury pollution governance.",

          "abstract": "Oceanic mesoscale eddies play a crucial but underexplored role in regulating carbon fluxes and climate change. While they redistribute heat, salt, nutrients, and other tracers, their effects on CO 2 uptake remain uncertain. Using observation-based machine learning to estimate CO 2 fluxes throughout the lifetimes of thousands of eddies, we show that anticyclonic eddies substantially enhance CO 2 uptake on average, while cyclonic eddies marginally diminish it. This asymmetry yields an overall net increase in CO 2 absorption by 9.98 ± 2.28 and 13.82 ± 9.94% in the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream, respectively, major carbon sequestration regions. The primary driver of this enhanced uptake is the downward pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon within anticyclonic eddies. Asymmetric biological responses between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies contribute to the overall eddy-induced CO 2 flux imbalance. The finding suggests a potential underestimation of the ocean’s capacity for carbon sequestration because of insufficient incorporation of eddies in current observations, emphasizing the need for expanded monitoring in eddy-rich, undersampled regions.",

However, transition pathways from low-density, high-sp 2 structures to high-density, high-sp 3 forms remain poorly understood, within which thermodynamical behaviors are practically unexplored. Here, we investigated the phase transition and thermal transport properties of a recently reported amorphous carbon phase, amorphous diaphite (a-DG). The continuous transformation pathway of a-DG is characterized by distinctive heterogeneous microstructural evolutions across a wide density range. We observed anomalous thermal conductivities in a-DG, which initially decrease and then increase with the density and sp 3 /sp 2 ratio, deviating markedly from previously reported trends. This anomaly originates from changes in phonon mean free path and phonon lifetime at the medium-frequency range (7 to 30 terahertz), dictated by the unique two-stage microtopological transition. These findings challenge conventional views of thermal conductivity in amorphous carbons, and, in a wider context, our mechanistic understanding provides fundamental insights into phase transitions and thermodynamic mechanisms of other amorphous materials.",

Previous research has emphasized workplace characteristics such as salaries and family-friendly work hours. Less attention has been paid to skill requirements, even though they are an important part of job descriptions and serve as reference points for individuals’ assessment of their suitability for occupations. Using a choice experiment among Swiss adolescents who are in the process of choosing their vocational training occupation, this article demonstrates that women and men have surprisingly similar preferences for workplace characteristics. In contrast, skill requirements are better predictors of gender differences in occupational preferences. We find that technical skills are critical in explaining gendered occupational preferences, with occupations that rely more heavily on new technologies attracting fewer women. At the same time, both genders prefer occupations that emphasize social interactions, suggesting that the prominent ‘people’ versus ‘things’ distinction does not adequately capture gendered occupational preferences.",

The classification work of both professionals relies on utilitarian fairness notions shaped by market contexts and professional cultures. In the publicly sensitive context of pricing, actuarial fairness guides the classification of risk into groups through transparent models, creating barriers to ML adoption. In the insulated context of claims prevention, data scientists’ moral frameworks and technical fairness metrics justify individual risk classifications that deliver equal opportunities for customers in need. By demonstrating how professional notions of fairness shape broader morals of markets, this article contributes to debates on multiple market moralities and theorizes moral authority as a key factor driving the uneven algorithmization of markets.",

          "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, Chinese overseas financing has reached a staggering $2 trillion. Differing from neoliberal principles, Chinese finance is characterized by longer time horizons, less conditionality, and more state capital. Consequently, a consensus has emerged that China is gradually reshaping the global financial architecture toward a post-neoliberal order. Through a mixed-methods analysis, I draw from three statistical databases and 132 interviews to show that since peaking in 2017, Chinese financing has fallen drastically by end of 2023 across both debt (96 per cent) and equity (68 per cent). I find that Chinese financing is no longer perceived in China, the West, or host countries as providing a scalable alternative to Western sources. Challenging the current consensus, I argue that we need to adjust expectations to recognize a diminished impact. Instead, China’s evolving role includes promoting a variety of both neoliberal and post-neoliberal principles in the adjacent fields of debt renegotiations, development finance norms, and project finance practices.",
