          "abstract": "In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance 1,2 . Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging 3–6 . We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti 75.25 Al 20 Cr 4.75 , this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 10 3 kg m − 3 ) and a high specific strength (185 × 10 3 Pa m 3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases.",

          "abstract": "For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots 1,2 . Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots 3 . How they navigate these design challenges is unclear 4 . Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network 5 . Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection.",

          "abstract": "Up to 80% of rare disease patients remain undiagnosed after genomic sequencing 1 , with many probably involving pathogenic variants in yet to be discovered disease–gene associations. To search for such associations, we developed a rare variant gene burden analytical framework for Mendelian diseases, and applied it to protein-coding variants from whole-genome sequencing of 34,851 cases and their family members recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project 2 . A total of 141 new associations were identified, including five for which independent disease–gene evidence was recently published. Following in silico triaging and clinical expert review, 69 associations were prioritized, of which 30 could be linked to existing experimental evidence. The five associations with strongest overall genetic and experimental evidence were monogenic diabetes with the known β cell regulator 3,4 UNC13A , schizophrenia with GPR17 , epilepsy with RBFOX3 , Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease with ARPC3 and anterior segment ocular abnormalities with POMK . Further confirmation of these and other associations could lead to numerous diagnoses, highlighting the clinical impact of large-scale statistical approaches to rare disease–gene association discovery.",

          "abstract": "Humans emerged across Africa shortly before 300 thousand years ago (ka) 1–3 . Although this pan-African evolutionary process implicates diverse environments in the human story, the role of tropical forests remains poorly understood. Here we report a clear association between late Middle Pleistocene material culture and a wet tropical forest in southern Côte d’Ivoire, a region of present-day rainforest. Twinned optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating methods constrain the onset of human occupations at Bété I to around 150 ka, linking them with Homo sapiens . Plant wax biomarker, stable isotope, phytolith and pollen analyses of associated sediments all point to a wet forest environment. The results represent the oldest yet known clear association between humans and this habitat type. The secure attribution of stone tool assemblages with the wet forest environment demonstrates that Africa’s forests were not a major ecological barrier for H. sapiens as early as around 150 ka.",

          "abstract": "Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state 1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state.",

          "abstract": "Investigating glacial isostatic adjustment has been the standard method to decipher Earth’s interior viscosity structure 1,2 , but such an approach has been rarely applied to other planets because of a lack of observational data 3,4 . The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure 5,6 . Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models 7 , viscoelastic deformation calculations 8 and radar observations 6 . We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field 9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate 10 . Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 10 22 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars 11,12 .",

          "abstract": "Chirality is a ubiquitous and fundamental asymmetry in nature 1,2 . Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives 3–5 . Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography 6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode 8–10 . Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.",

          "abstract": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), vital for northwards heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean, is projected to weaken owing to global warming 1 , with significant global climate impacts 2 . However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models 1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse 5 . Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.",

          "abstract": "Social grouping increases survival in many species, including humans 1,2 . By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (‘loneliness’) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion 3–5 . The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social need, similar to physiological drives such as hunger, thirst or sleep 3,6 . In this study, we assessed social responses in several mouse strains, among which FVB/NJ mice emerged as highly, and C57BL/6J mice as moderately, sensitive to social isolation. Using both strains, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during either social isolation or social rebound and orchestrate the behaviour display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations and with brain areas associated with social behaviour, emotional state, reward and physiological needs and showed that mice require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfil their social need. These data show a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis and provide significant mechanistic insights into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive, computable representation of the functional repertoire of all macromolecules encoded within the human genome is a foundational resource for biology and biomedical research. The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms 1,2 . Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available.",

          "abstract": "The virus particles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are released in an immature, non-infectious form. Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into a distinct, mature MA lattice 1 . The mechanism of MA lattice maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind lipid into a side pocket as previously thought 1 , but instead binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein–protein interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro. SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger of MA structural maturation and assign function to the SP2 peptide.",

Here we analyse US survey data to reveal a nested structure within skill portfolios, where the direction of dependency is inferred from asymmetrical conditional probabilities—occupations require one skill conditional on another. This directional nature suggests that advanced, specific skills and knowledge are often built upon broader, fundamental ones. We examine 70 million job transitions to show that human capital development and career progression follow this structured pathway in which skills more aligned with the nested structure command higher wage premiums, require longer education and are less likely to be automated. These disparities are evident across genders and racial/ethnic groups, explaining long-term wage penalties. Finally, we find that this nested structure has become even more pronounced over the past two decades, indicating increased barriers to upward job mobility.",

We conducted a systematic literature review and pre-registered meta-analysis of 303 effect sizes from 67 experimental articles evaluating accuracy ratings of true and fact-checked false news ( N Participants = 194,438 from 40 countries across 6 continents). We found that people rated true news as more accurate than false news (Cohen’s d = 1.12 [1.01, 1.22]) and were better at rating false news as false than at rating true news as true (Cohen’s d = 0.32 [0.24, 0.39]). In other words, participants were able to discern true from false news and erred on the side of skepticism rather than credulity. We found no evidence that the political concordance of the news had an effect on discernment, but participants were more skeptical of politically discordant news (Cohen’s d = 0.78 [0.62, 0.94]). These findings lend support to crowdsourced fact-checking initiatives and suggest that, to improve discernment, there is more room to increase the acceptance of true news than to reduce the acceptance of fact-checked false news.",

Here, we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness—i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time—that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the modus operandi of sociotechnical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system toward the proverbial “edge of a cliff.” Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to critical fragility is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental “excess volatility puzzle” in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing sociotechnical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.",

If each drug had a single international price across the highest-income OECD countries and total pharmaceutical firm profits were held fixed: U.S. prices would fall by half; every other country’s prices would increase (by 28 to over 300%); and R&amp;D incentives would be maintained.

          "abstract": "High-profile incidents of police violence against Black citizens over the past decade have spawned contentious debates in the United States on the role of police. This debate has played out prominently in the news media, leading to a perception that media outlets have become more critical of the police. There is currently, however, little empirical evidence supporting this perceived shift. We construct a large dataset of local news reporting on the police from 2013 to 2023 in 10 politically diverse U.S. cities. Leveraging advanced language models, we measure criticism by analyzing whether reporting supports or is critical of two contentions: 1) that the police protect citizens and 2) that the police are racist. To validate this approach, we collect labels from members of different political parties. We find that contrary to public perceptions, local media criticism of the police has remained relatively stable along these two dimensions over the past decade. While criticism spiked in the aftermath of high-profile police killings, such as George Floyd’s murder, these events did not produce sustained increases in negative police news. In fact, reporting supportive of police effectiveness has increased slightly since Floyd’s death. We find only small differences in coverage trends in more conservative and more liberal cities, undermining the idea that local outlets cater to the politics of their audiences. Last, although Republicans are more likely to view a piece of news as supportive of the police than Democrats, readers across parties see reporting as no more critical than it was a decade ago.",

Research in cultural evolution theory distinguishes factors related to social influence (such as copying from the majority, or from certain individuals) from factors related to individual, nonsocially influenced, propensities such as evolved cognitive predispositions, or physical, biological, and environmental constraints. Here, we show, using analytical and individual-based models, that individual preferences, even when weak, determine the equilibrium point of cultural dynamics when acting together with nondirectional social influence in three out of four cases we study. The results have implications regarding the importance of keeping into account individual-level, nonsocial, factors, when studying cultural evolution, as well as regarding the interpretation of cross-cultural regularities, that must be expected, but can be product of weak directional forces, intensified by social influence.",

          "abstract": "The conservation of biodiversity represents a global challenge as the world experiences its sixth mass extinction. Understanding how conservation efforts are allocated is paramount to effectively protect threatened species. We analyzed ~14,600 conservation projects over a 25-y period, revealing substantial taxonomic biases in funding. When matched with formal assessments of species’ threat status, several highly threatened groups such as amphibians receive little and ever-decreasing support. Within particular groups (e.g., Mammalia, Reptilia), funding is directed to a very narrow selection of taxa, leaving the majority of their threatened species with limited or no support. More attention is urgently needed to assess the extinction risks of neglected taxa, especially smaller species. Paradoxically, while approximately 6% of species identified as threatened were supported by conservation funds, 29% of the funding was allocated to species of “least concern”. A more holistic distribution of conservation funding is, therefore, urgently needed if we are to protect biodiversity efficiently. We suggest avenues and mechanisms for a more balanced coverage of threatened species within conservation programs and highlight some of the benefits that could be derived from such an approach.",

          "abstract": "A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.",

          "abstract": "Processivity clamps mediate polymerase switching for translesion synthesis (TLS). All three Escherichia coli TLS polymerases interact with the β 2 processivity clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif (CBM), which is indispensable for TLS. Notably, Pol IV also interacts weakly with the rim of the clamp through non-CBM residues. Ablating this “rim contact” in cells results in selective sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, raising the question how the rim contact contributes to TLS. Here, we show that the rim contact is critical for TLS past a strong replication block but barely necessary for a weak blocking lesion. Within the in vitro reconstituted E. coli replisome, the rim mutation compromises Pol IV-mediated TLS past 3-deaza-methyl dA, a strong block, whereas barely affecting TLS past N 2 -furfuryl dG, a weak block. Similar observations are also made in E. coli cells bearing a single copy of these lesions in the genome. At lesion-stalled replication forks, single-stranded DNA binding protein locally enriches Pol IV, enabling it to bind the low-affinity rim site. This interaction poises Pol IV to better compete with Pol III, the replicative polymerase, which competitively inhibits Pol IV from interacting with the clamp through its CBM. We propose that this bipartite clamp interaction enables Pol IV to rapidly resolve lesion-stalled replication at a strong block through TLS, which reduces damage-induced mutagenesis.",

          "abstract": "Female mosquitoes are vectors of many devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding to initiate reproduction. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms managing female mosquito reproduction is essential. Although the regulation of gene expression during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle has been studied in detail, how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains unclear. Chromatin must be accessible for transcription factors (TFs) governing gene expression. A specialized class of TFs, called pioneer factors (PFs), binds and remodels closed chromatin, permitting other TFs to bind DNA and activate the gene expression. Here, we identified a homolog of the vertebrate PF FoxA in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mosquitoes deficient in AaFoxA . We found that ovary development was severely retarded in mutant females. Multiomics and molecular biology analyses have shown that AaFoxA increased histone acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27 by controlling the chromatin accessibility of histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodelers. AaFoxA is bound to the loci of chromatin remodelers, changing their chromatin accessibility and modulating their temporal expression patterns. AaFoxA increased the accessibility of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and E74 loci, indicating the important role of AaFoxA in the hormonal regulation of mosquito reproductive events. Further, the CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq analyses revealed that AaFoxA temporarily bound closed chromatin, making it differentially accessible during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle. Hence, this study demonstrates that AaFoxA modulates chromatin dynamics throughout female mosquito reproduction.",

ATL has a very poor prognosis and lacks satisfactory treatments; therefore, it is critical to identify potential targets in ATL cells in order to develop effective targeted therapeutics. Here, we report the identification of two oncogenes, AK4 and RHOC, as target genes of miR-455-3p, a tumor-suppressive microRNA in ATL patients. Importantly, AK4 and RHOC are highly expressed in ATL and exhibit oncogenic potentials in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal a functional overlap of AK4 and RHOC, including activating oncogenic pathways such as Myc targets and deregulating lipid metabolism such as enhancing the production of sphingomyelin, a tumor-promoting lipid. In particular, compared to other types of T cell malignancy such as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), ATL is sensitive to sphingomyelin inhibition and AK4 or RHOC depletion. Altogether, we report a distinct dependency of ATL on AK4 and RHOC oncogenes and an oncometabolite sphingomyelin, which together represent targetable vulnerabilities of ATL that could be exploited for developing effective therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "The genome-wide association studies identified genes associated with many diseases, but the identification and verification of disease variants are still challenging due to small effects and large number of individual variants. In this paper, we propose a powerful method that first quantifies the strength of regional associations at each single nucleotide polymorphism and converts these measures into time series data before using a change point detection algorithm to identify significant regions. In our extensive simulation study, the proposed method consistently demonstrates greater power than existing alternatives, achieving a relative increase of over 20% in challenging scenarios where true causal variants are sparse and multiple association regions exist at the same time, while maintaining a lower false positive rate.",

We report an experimental ultrafast generation and detection of the coherent amplitude mode (AM) of its CDW state. A salient feature emerges: The coherent CDW mode AM exhibits an unusual T 3.56 temperature dependence below 65 K, in addition to the T 2 temperature dependence observed in the 65 to 200 K range. This behavior suggests the enhancement of in-gap electronic excitations below 65 K and the emergence of a new phase of matter. Consequently, the intriguing quantum state leads to a crossover. Our investigation provides insights into understanding the interplay among various degrees of freedom in quantum materials.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) promise unique electronic, optical, and chemical properties, which can be exquisitely tuned by controlling the composition, size, and morphology. Semiconductor QDs have been synthesized primarily via two approaches, namely, epitaxial growth and wet-chemical synthesis. However, the properties of epitaxial QDs (eQDs) are susceptible to wetting layer formation and substrate dislocations, while colloidal QDs (cQDs) face fluorescence intermittency issues. Here, we report on the synthesis of a class of QDs that can overcome the fundamental limitations of eQDs and cQDs. By exploiting the sp 2 bonding of layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we show that GaN QDs can be epitaxially grown through a weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction without two-dimensional wetting layer formation. The photoluminescence intensity of GaN van der Waals quantum dots (vQDs) is more than six times stronger than that of conventional GaN eQDs and no optical blinking was observed from vQDs. We show that the interadatom bond strength is about one order of magnitude stronger compared with that between the adatoms and the hBN substrate. This work shows that vQDs have unique properties that are difficult to achieve using existing QDs synthesis methods and thus can potentially enable new classes of high-performance optoelectronic and quantum devices.",

          "authors": "Spencer P. Alliston, Chris Dames, Matthew J. Powell-Palm",
          "abstract": "Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid–solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entropic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59% (to 5.6 K), eutectic temperature by 45% (to 9.7 K), and eutectic composition by 43% (to 4.7 mol%), as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that, for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.",

          "abstract": "Scaffold proteins are key players in many signaling pathways where they ensure spatial and temporal control of molecular interactions by simultaneous tethering of multiple signaling components. The protein JIP1 acts as a scaffold within the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by assembling three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, into a macromolecular complex that enables their specific activation. The recruitment of these kinases depends on the 450-amino acid intrinsically disordered tail of JIP1, however, the structural details of this tail and the molecular mechanisms by which it binds kinases have remained elusive. Here, we provide an atomic resolution structural description of the JIP1 tail, and we study its interaction with the kinase JNK1. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that JNK1 not only engages with the well-known docking site motif (D-motif) of JIP1, but also interacts with a noncanonical F-motif. We determine the crystal structure of the JIP1–JNK1 complex at 2.35 Å resolution revealing a bipartite binding mode of JIP1. Our work provides insights into the sequence determinants of F-motifs suggesting that these motifs may be more prevalent in JNK substrates than previously recognized. More broadly, our study highlights the power of NMR spectroscopy in uncovering kinase interaction motifs within disordered scaffold proteins, and it paves the way for atomic-resolution interaction studies of JIP1 with its multitude of interaction partners.",

          "abstract": "Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P , however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",

          "abstract": "Development of efficient cell factories that can compete with traditional chemical production processes is complex and generally driven by case-specific strategies, based on the product and microbial host of interest. Despite major advancements in the field of metabolic modeling in recent years, prediction of genetic modifications for increased production remains challenging. Here, we present a computational pipeline that leverages the concept of protein limitations in metabolism for prediction of optimal combinations of gene engineering targets for enhanced chemical bioproduction. We used our pipeline for prediction of engineering targets for 103 different chemicals using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host. Furthermore, we identified sets of gene targets predicted for groups of multiple chemicals, suggesting the possibility of rational model-driven design of platform strains for diversified chemical production.",

          "abstract": "Advances in sequencing technology have unveiled examples of nucleus-encoded polycistrons, once considered rare. Exclusively polycistronic transcripts are prevalent in green algae, although the mechanism by which multiple polypeptides are translated from a single transcript is unknown. Here, we used bioinformatic and in vivo mutational analyses to evaluate competing mechanistic models for translation of bicistronic mRNAs in green algae. High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides , revealed a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before the ORF 2 start codon, which are suitable conditions for leaky ribosome scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in A. protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.",

While surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy delays disease progression, these treatments do not lead to tumor control, and targeted therapies or biologics have failed to further improve survival. Utilizing a transient radiation-induced state of multipotency, we used the adenylcyclase activator forskolin to alter the fate of irradiated glioma cells. The effects of the combined treatment on neuronal marker expression, cell cycle distribution, and proliferation were studied. Gene expression profiling was conducted using bulk RNA-seq. Changes in cell populations were investigated using single-cell RNA-seq. Effects on glioma stem cells (GSCs) were studied in extreme limiting dilution assays, and the effects on median survival were studied in both syngeneic and PDOX mouse models of GBM. The combined treatment induced the expression of neuronal markers in glioma cells, reduced proliferation, and led to a distinct gene expression profile. scRNA-seq revealed that the combined treatment forced glioma cells into a microglia- and neuron-like phenotype. In vivo, this treatment led to a loss of GSCs and prolonged median survival. Collectively, our data suggest that revisiting a differentiation therapy with forskolin in combination with radiation could lead to clinical benefit.",

We share a set of visualization, histogram, and profiling tools for interpreting these positions and orientations.

We apply ODFs to create physics-informed models of image formation with spatio-angular point-spread and transfer functions. We use theory and experiment to conclude that light-sheet tilting is a necessary part of our design for recovering all three-dimensional orientations. We use our system to extend known two-dimensional results to three dimensions in FM1-43-labeled giant unilamellar vesicles, fast-scarlet-labeled cellulose in xylem cells, and phalloidin-labeled actin in U2OS cells.

          "abstract": "Chromatin architecture facilitates accurate transcription at a number of loci, but it remains unclear how much chromatin architecture is involved in global transcriptional regulation. Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture alters global chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multiomics analyses with sorted juvenile postmitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and we identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. CTCF depletion leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (&gt;3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (&gt;27,000 sites) before any prominent cellular or physiological phenotypes arise. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy at euchromatin, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility and frequently inhibits expression of these direct binding targets, which are enriched for binding motifs of transcription repressors. These findings provide different and sometimes opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cellular heterogeneity and cell-type specificity when performing multiomics analyses. CTCF knockout rods undergo complete degeneration by adulthood, indicating an essential role for their viability. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.",

Thereby they harbor great potential for being targeted in vaccination, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here, we use fate mapping, functional analyses, and comparative cross-species transcriptomics to show that RORγt + DCs are a conserved, functionally versatile, and transcriptionally distinct type of DCs. RORγt + DCs entail various populations described in different contexts including Janus cells/RORγt-expressing extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), subtypes of Thetis cells, RORγt + -DC (R-DC) like cells, cDC2C and ACY3 + DCs. We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt + DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4 + T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt + DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt + DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men. Thus, our work establishes RORγt + DCs as immune sentinel cells that exhibit a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing peripheral T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment.",

Structural variants (SVs), arising from copy-number-imbalanced and -balanced DNA rearrangements, are a major driver of tumor evolution, yet understudied posttherapy. Here, we adapted single-cell template-strand sequencing (Strand-seq) to a HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the formation of doxorubicin-induced de novo SVs. We coupled this approach with nucleosome occupancy (NO) measurements obtained from the same single cell to enable simultaneous SV detection and cell-type classification. Using organoids from TetO-CMYC/TetO-Neu/MMTV-rtTA mice modeling HER2+ breast cancer, we generated 459 Strand-seq libraries spanning various tumorigenesis stages, identifying a 7.4-fold increase in large chromosomal alterations post-doxorubicin. Complex DNA rearrangements, deletions, and duplications were prevalent across basal, luminal progenitor (LP), and mature luminal (ML) cells, indicating uniform susceptibility of these cell types to SV formation. Doxorubicin further elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicative of genomic stress persisting posttreatment. Altered nucleosome occupancy levels on distinct cancer-related genes further underscore the broad genomic impact of doxorubicin. The organoid-based system for single-cell multiomics established in this study paves the way for unraveling the most important therapy-associated SV mutational signatures, enabling systematic studies of the effect of therapy on cancer evolution.",

Here, we determined the spatial localization, protein carriers, and cellular function of O-GalNAc glycans in the mouse brain. We observed striking spatial enrichment of O-GalNAc glycans in neuronal tracts, and specifically at nodes of Ranvier, specialized structures involved in signal propagation in the brain. Glycoproteomic analysis revealed that more than half of the identified O-GalNAc glycans were present on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans termed lecticans, and display both domain enrichment and regional heterogeneity. Inhibition of O-GalNAc synthesis in neurons reduced binding of Siglec-4, a known regulator of neurite growth, and shortened the length of nodes of Ranvier. This work establishes a function of O-GalNAc glycans in the brain and will inform future studies on their role in development and disease.",

To identify molecular defects that take place in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of patients with C9orf72 ALS/FTD, we compared healthy controls with C9orf72 ALS/FTD donor samples staged based on the levels of cortical phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein (pTDP-43), a neuropathological hallmark of disease progression. We identified distinct molecular changes in different cell types that take place during FTD development. Loss of neurosurveillance microglia and activation of the complement cascade take place early, when pTDP-43 aggregates are absent or very low, and become more pronounced in late stages, suggesting an initial involvement of microglia in disease progression. Reduction of layer 2-3 cortical projection neurons with high expression of CUX2/LAMP5 also occurs early, and the reduction becomes more pronounced as pTDP-43 accumulates. Several unique features were observed only in samples with high levels of pTDP-43, including global alteration of chromatin accessibility in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes; higher ratios of premature oligodendrocytes; increased levels of the noncoding RNA NEAT1 in astrocytes and neurons, and higher amount of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from cortical neurogenesis to gliogenesis, and the subsequent fate determination of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons, remain unclear. Here, we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a fundamental role in promoting cortical gliogenesis and the generation of Tri-IPCs. Additionally, sonic hedgehog-smoothened-glioma-associated oncogene homolog (SHH-SMO-GLI) activator signaling has an auxiliary function to ERK during these processes. We further demonstrate that, from Tri-IPCs, NOTCH signaling is crucial for the fate determination of astrocytes, while ERK signaling plays a prominent role in oligodendrocyte fate specification, and SHH signaling is required for the fate determination of olfactory bulb interneurons. We provide evidence suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in both mice and humans. Finally, we propose a unifying principle of mammalian cortical gliogenesis.",

Recently, TMC1 and TMC2 (TMC1/2) have been recognized as the pore-forming subunit of the MT channel, but TMC1/2 functional expression in heterologous cells—which is critical for unequivocally identifying them as the bona fide pore-forming subunit of the MT channel—has not been achieved because ectopic TMC1/2 become trapped in the ER. Here, we report that adding a Fyn lipidation tag to mouse TMC1/2 (mTMC1/2) drove their cell-surface expression, and, importantly, full-length mTMC1/2 expressed alone functioned as mechanosensitive channels, underscoring the view that TMC1/2 constitute the sole pore-forming subunit of the MT channel. Moreover, mouse transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) (mTMIE) protein robustly stimulated TMC1/2 channel activity by modulating their gating. Intriguingly, the N-terminal 27 residues of mTMIE were dispensable for regulating TMC1/2 in our in vitro functional assay, whereas, in striking contrast, mutating mTMIE C76C77, the predicted palmitoylation sites, eliminated mTMIE stimulation of mTMC1/2, indicating a crucial role of the palmitoyl group in regulating TMC1/2 gating. mTMC1/2+mTMIE form 18 pS and 24 pS single channels, respectively. mTMC1/2+mTMIE single channels showed biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of the MT channel. Our findings provide insights into several fundamental and debated aspects of the function of TMC1/2 and TMIE, and our functional assay of TMC1/2 and TMIE in heterologous cells will facilitate further functional and structural characterization of these proteins and other MT-complex components.",

          "abstract": "Building differences between genetically equivalent units is a fundamental challenge for all multicellular organisms and superorganisms. In ants, reproductive or worker fate is typically determined during the larval stage, through feeding regimes managed by adult caretakers. However, the feeding care provided to larvae varies significantly across ants, as does phenotypic divergence between queen and worker castes. Here, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods and causal inference to investigate the relationships between larval feeding care, caste size dimorphism, and social complexity across ant diversity. We digitized the life’s work of George and Jeanette Wheeler, cataloging the larval morphology of over 700 species, and we compiled data on species diets and larval feeding behaviors from the literature and our own observations. We measured queen–worker size dimorphism in 392 species and gathered data for colony size, worker polymorphism, and worker reproduction. Our analyses revealed that ancestral active-feeding larvae evolved passive morphologies when adults began feeding them individually, typically with processed material and often following a shift to nonpredatory diets. Greater queen–worker size dimorphism coevolved with larval passiveness, alongside traits indicative of increased social complexity, including larger colony sizes, worker subcastes, and a reduction in workers’ reproductive potential. Likelihood comparisons of causal phylogenetic models support that extended alloparental care facilitated stronger caste dimorphism, which, in turn and along with increased colony sizes, promoted higher social complexity. Our results suggest that enhanced adult control over larval development enabled greater phenotypic specialization within colonies, with profound implications for social evolution.",

Though wild-type HUH protein has no detectable activity toward an RNA probe, we engineered an RNA-reactive variant, called “rHUH”, through 7 generations of yeast display–based directed evolution. Our 13.4 kD rHUH has 12 mutations relative to HUH and forms a covalent tyrosine-phosphate ester linkage with a 10-nucleotide RNA recognition sequence (“rRS”) within minutes. We engineered the sensitivity down to 1 nM of target RNA, shifted the metal ion requirement from Mn 2+ toward Mg 2+ , and demonstrated efficient labeling in mammalian cell lysate. This work paves the way toward a potentially powerful methodology for sequence-specific covalent protein–RNA conjugation in biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Proteins and the complexes they form are central to nearly all cellular processes. Their flexibility, expressed through a continuum of states, provides a window into their biological functions. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an ideal tool to study these dynamic states as it captures specimens in noncrystalline conditions and enables high-resolution reconstructions. However, analyzing the heterogeneous distributions of conformations from cryo-EM data is challenging. We present RECOVAR, a method for analyzing these distributions based on principal component analysis (PCA) computed using a REgularized COVARiance estimator. RECOVAR is fast, robust, interpretable, expressive, and competitive with state-of-the-art neural network methods on heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets. The regularized covariance method efficiently computes a large number of high-resolution principal components that can encode rich heterogeneous distributions of conformations and does so robustly thanks to an automatic regularization scheme. The reconstruction method based on adaptive kernel regression resolves conformational states to a higher resolution than all other tested methods on extensive independent benchmarks while remaining highly interpretable. Additionally, we exploit favorable properties of the PCA embedding to estimate the conformational density accurately. This density allows for better interpretability of the latent space by identifying stable states and low free-energy motions. Finally, we present a scheme to navigate the high-dimensional latent space by automatically identifying these low free-energy trajectories.

          "abstract": "Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical–genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.",

However, observed increases in algal biomass do not consistently correlate with air temperature or precipitation, and evidence is lacking for a causal effect of climate or the nonlinear dynamics needed to demonstrate regime shifts. We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.",

This study allows a rigorous determination of the electronic structure of a nonheme Fe IV =O center and its comparison to an Fe IV =O heme site using 1s2p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and Fe L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Further, variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT-MCD) of the ligand field transitions, combined with nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy of the two S=1 Fe IV =O systems show that the equatorial ligand field decreases from a nonheme to a heme Fe IV =O site. Alternatively, RIXS and Fe L-edge XAS combined with MCD show that the Fe d π orbitals are unperturbed in the Fe IV =O heme relative to the nonheme site because the strong axial Fe-O bond uncouples the Fe d π orbitals from the porphyrin π -system. As a consequence, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the H-atom abstraction reactions are actually very similar for heme compound II and nonheme Fe IV =O active sites.",

          "abstract": "A key limitation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy is their reduced efficacy toward cancers with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB). Since low-TMB tumors express fewer neoantigens, they are less responsive to ICI therapy like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of low-TMB melanoma, we recently demonstrated that exposure to 6-thioguanine (6TG) significantly improved tumor control by increasing TMB and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. The combination of 6TG with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, although it did not fully inhibit tumor growth. We here investigated additional ICI combinations, assessing anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-1 to improve efficacy. ICI eliminated tumors in 6TG-exposed mice when ICI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 20 mm 3 , stopped tumor growth at volumes of 120 mm 3 , and had no effect at volumes of 300 mm 3 . Finally, we showed that mice achieving complete tumor regression with 6TG and ICI treatment exhibited lasting immune memory, which effectively suppressed tumor growth at relapse upon re-exposure to tumor cells. These findings may pave the way to effective application of ICI to low-TMB cancers, when initiated at low tumor volume.",

          "abstract": "Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses.",

          "abstract": "Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R 2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R 2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P &lt; 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.",

          "abstract": "The cGAS–STING pathway mediates innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA. In addition to its well-established role in inducing inflammatory cytokines, activation of the cGAS–STING pathway also induces noncanonical autophagy, a process involving the conjugation of the ATG8 family of ubiquitin-like proteins to membranes of the endolysosomal system. The mechanisms and functions of STING-induced autophagy remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that STING activation induced formation of pH-elevated Golgi-derived vesicles that led to ATG16L1 and V-ATPase-dependent noncanonical autophagy. We showed that STING-induced noncanonical autophagy resulted in activation of the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors (TFEB, TFE3, and MITF), which regulate lysosome biogenesis. We found that lipidation of the ATG8 proteins, particularly GABARAPs, inhibited phosphorylation of MiT/TFE transcription factors by mTORC1. The lipidated GABARAPs bound to the Folliculin-interacting proteins (FNIPs), thereby sequestering the FNIP-folliculin protein complexes from activating mTORC1, resulting in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE transcription factors. Furthermore, we found that STING-induced autophagy activated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease, through GABARAPs lipidation. We further showed that STING-induced autophagy induced ALIX-mediated ESCRT machinery recruitment to mitigate endolysosomal perturbation. These results reveal the multifaceted functions of STING-induced noncanonical autophagy in regulating endolysosomal homeostasis.",

We found that neuropeptide Leucokinin (LK) inhibits female receptivity specifically during a sexual transition period in immature females, but not in younger or mature females. Moreover, the steroid hormone ecdysone, which is mainly synthesized in the female ovary during sexual maturation, acts on LK neurons via the ecdysone receptor to suppress sexual receptivity. We further found that LK suppresses female receptivity through its receptor LKR in central pC1 neurons, a decision center for female sexual behavior. These findings reveal a hormone-to-neuropeptide pathway that specifically inhibits sexual behavior during sexual maturation in female Drosophila , shedding light on how hormones and neuromodulators coordinate sexual development and behaviors.",

To understand the geometrical and topological complexity of the packings, we first deploy X-ray computerized tomography to unveil the structure of the packing. This allows us to directly visualize the spatial variations in density, orientational order, and the entanglement, a mesoscopic field that we define in terms of a local average crossing number, a measure of the topological complexity of the packing. We find that increasing the aspect ratio of the constituent rods in a packing leads to a proliferation of regions of strong entanglement that eventually percolate through the system and correlated with a sharp transition in the mechanical stability of the packing. To corroborate our experimental findings, we use numerical simulations of contacting elastic rods and characterize their stability to static and dynamic loadings. Our experiments and computations lead us to an entanglement phase diagram which we also populate using published experimental data from pneumatically tangled filaments, worm blobs, and bird nests along with additional numerical simulations using these datasets. Together, these show the regimes associated with mechanically stable entanglement as a function of the statistics of the packings and loading, with lessons for a range of systems from reconfigurable architectures and textiles to active morphable filamentous assemblies.",

The reflectors dip unidirectionally with inclinations in the range 6° to 20° and are imaged to a thickness of 10 to 35 m along an uninterrupted 1.3 km northward shoreline-perpendicular traverse. The consistent dip inclinations, absence of dissection by fluvial channels along the extended traverse, and low permittivity of the sediments are consistent with terrestrial coastal deposits—and discount fluvial, aeolian, or magmatic origins favored elsewhere on Mars. The structure, thickness, and length of the section support voluminous supply of onshore sediments into a large body of water, rather than a merely localized and short-lived melt event.

In contrast, more abstract behavioral variables that are independent of stimulus selection, such as stimulus–response mapping, are thought to be encoded by neurons outside of sensory cortex. We show that information about such mapping is robustly encoded in the responses of neurons in primate visual cortex. Monkeys were trained to alternate between two tasks that differed in the rule governing the mapping of a remembered visual cue onto an eye movement response. During the memory-delay period, neurons in area V4 reliably signaled the remembered cue location in both tasks. However, the encoding of cue location depended critically on the stimulus–response mapping rule. Thus, V4 delay activity encoded the mapping rule and signaled the preparation of the appropriate motor response rather than spatial working memory per se, contrary to previous assumptions. In addition, we probed the origins of motor-related delay activity and found that it was reduced during local inactivation of the frontal eye field (FEF). The results demonstrate that behavioral modulation of visual cortical activity is not solely related to the selection of sensory stimuli but instead reflects a distinct mechanism for sensory-guided motor output.",

Traditional theories link them to the Xiongnu, the founders of the first nomadic empire of the Mongolian steppe. The Xiongnu empire dissolved, however, ~300 y before the Huns appeared in Europe, and there is little archaeological and historical evidence of Huns in the steppe during this time gap. Furthermore, despite the rich 5th to 6th centuries current era (CE) archaeological record of the Carpathian Basin, the cultural elements of connections with the steppe are limited to few findings and even fewer solitary eastern-type burials. In this study, we coanalyze archaeological evidence with 35 newly sequenced and published genomic data for a total of 370 individuals—from 5th to 6th century CE contexts in the Carpathian Basin including 10 Hun-period eastern-type burials, 2nd to 5th century sites across Central Asia and 2nd c. before current era (BCE) to 1st c. CE Xiongnu period sites across the Mongolian steppe. We find no evidence for the presence of a large eastern/steppe descent community among the Hun- and post-Hun-period Carpathian Basin population. We also observe a high genetic diversity among the eastern-type burials that recapitulates the variability observed across the Eurasian Steppe. This suggests a mixed origin of the incoming steppe conquerors. Nevertheless, long-shared genomic tracts provide compelling evidence of genetic lineages directly connecting some individuals of the highest Xiongnu-period elite with 5th to 6th century CE Carpathian Basin individuals, showing that some European Huns descended from them.",

Herein, we synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and subsequently modified it with tributyl phosphate (TBP) to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the recovery of REEs. The distribution coefficients ( K d ) of ZIF-8-TBP for REEs (neodymium, Nd, and dysprosium, Dy) were orders of magnitude higher than the K d of main interfering ions (e.g., Mg, Ni Al, and Fe). Particularly, the maximum sorption capacities ( q m ) for Nd and Dy were 475 and 529 mg g −1 , respectively. In addition, the separation factor between Dy (a representative of heavy REE) and Nd (a representative of light REE) reached 24, greatly exceeding the figures reported previously. Importantly, the outstanding ability of ZIF-8-TBP for selective separation and recovery of REEs was demonstrated via its application to real samples including mining wastewater, and leaching solutions from REE filter cakes and discarded NdFeB magnets. Multiscale simulations reveal that ZIF-8-TBP possessed a stronger binding strength and greater sorption energy for REE ions. These results indicate that ZIF-8-TBP could effectively harvest REEs from wastes and offers an efficient alternative for industrial applications in REE recovery.",

          "abstract": "DNA is heterogeneously packaged into chromatin, which is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) with sharp boundaries. These boundary locations are critical for genome regulation. Here, we explore how the distribution of DNA-packing density across chromatin affects the TAD boundary locations. We develop a polymer-physics-based model that utilizes DNA accessibility data to parameterize DNA-packing density along chromosomes, treating them as heteropolymers, and simulates the stochastic folding of these heteropolymers within a nucleus to yield a conformation ensemble. Such an ensemble reproduces a subset (over 60%) of TAD boundaries across the human genome, as confirmed by Hi-C data. Additionally, it reproduces the spatial distance matrices of 2-Mb genomic regions provided by FISH experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that utilizing DNA accessibility data alone as input is sufficient to predict the emergence and disappearance of key TADs during early T cell differentiation. We show that stochastic folding of heteropolymers in a confined space can replicate both the prevalence of chromatin domain structures and the cell-to-cell variation in domain boundary positions observed in single-cell experiments. Furthermore, regions of lower DNA-packing density preferentially form domain boundaries, and this preference drives the emergence of TAD boundaries observed in ensemble-averaged Hi-C maps. The enrichment of TAD boundaries at CTCF binding sites can be attributed to the influence of CTCF binding on local DNA-packing density in our model. Collectively, our findings establish a strong link between TAD boundaries and regions of lower DNA-packing density, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying TAD formation.",

          "abstract": "The experience of human parenthood is near ubiquitous and can profoundly alter one’s body, mind, and environment. However, we know very little about the long-term neural effects of parenthood for parents themselves, or the implications of pregnancy and caregiving experience on the aging adult brain. Here, we investigate the link between the number of children parented and age on brain function in 19,964 females and 17,607 males from the UK Biobank. In both females and males, parenthood was positively correlated with functional connectivity, such that higher number of children parented was associated with higher connectivity, particularly within the somato/motor network. Critically, the spatial topography of parenthood-linked effects was inversely correlated with the impact of age on functional connectivity across the brain for both females and males, such that the connections that were positively correlated with number of children were negatively correlated with age. This result suggests that a higher number of children is associated with patterns of brain function in the opposite direction to age-related alterations. Overall, these results indicate that the changes accompanying parenthood may confer benefits to brain health across the lifespan, altering aging trajectories, consistent with animal models of parenthood and preliminary findings of “younger-looking” brain structure in human parents. Observing this effect in both females and males implicates the caregiving environment, rather than pregnancy alone, and highlights the importance of future work to disentangle the underlying mechanisms related to the direct impact of caregiving, the indirect impact of the environment, and the result of covarying sociodemographic factors.",

Our systems biology approach identified RNA binding protein, mRNA processing factor ( RBPMS ) as a conserved, VSMC-specific gene associated with VSMC modulation in atherosclerosis. RBPMS gene expression positively correlates with VSMC contractile markers in human and murine atherosclerotic arteries as well as in two vascular injury models during the postinjury intimal hyperplasia phase. RBPMS promotes contractile VSMC differentiation, reduces plaque cap development in high-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E-null ( ApoE −/− ) murine atherosclerotic arteries, and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. Mechanistically, the RBPMS protein interacts with the myocardin ( MYOCD ) pre-mRNA and enhances MYOCD_v3 / MYOCD_v1 transcript balance through alternative exon 2a splicing. RBPMS promotes the VSMC contractile phenotype and reduces their fibroproliferative activity in a MYOCD_v3a-dependent manner. RBPMS enhances Myocd_v3 / Myocd_v1 transcript balance in both atherosclerotic and injured vessels. RBPMS may inhibit VSMC-driven plaque cap development and intervention-induced restenosis.",

The direct generation of spin-polarized electrons at catalytic surfaces remains elusive, and the underlying mechanisms are still controversial due to the lack of intrinsically chiral catalysts. To address this challenge, we investigate topological homochiral PdGa (TH PdGa) crystals with intrinsically chiral catalytic surfaces for ORR. Through spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, we show that both structural chirality and spin–orbit coupling are critical for inducing spin polarization at the surface of TH PdGa. As a result, TH PdGa achieves a kinetic current density over 100 times higher than the achiral PdGa (AC PdGa) at 0.85 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. This work underscores the pivotal role of spin polarization in enhancing acidic ORR activity and lays the groundwork for the rational design of chiral catalysts for spin-dependent catalysis.",

At the same time, quantum computing likely will not supplant classical computing in the foreseeable future—after all, quantum computing architectures are best equipped to solve certain problems, but not every problem. Quantum computers almost certainly will work in concert with classical processing, where each computing architecture will handle those parts of a calculation that it is best suited to tackle. For that to happen, the quantum computing hardware will require software that combines quantum with classical computing. It also must be devised in a user-friendly way so that nonquantum scientists and software developers working on problems such as modeling molecules with unprecedented accuracy and calculating interesting properties of structured datasets can run quantum computational tasks without having in-depth knowledge of quantum computing.",

          "abstract": "Humans often take actions to assist others experiencing unresponsiveness, such as transient loss of consciousness. How other animals react to unresponsive conspecifics—and the neural mechanisms driving such behaviors—remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.",

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength.

The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states.

          "abstract": "Extreme heat is well-documented to adversely affect health and mortality, but its link to biological aging—a precursor of the morbidity and mortality process—remains unclear. This study examines the association between ambient outdoor heat and epigenetic aging in a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 56+ ( N = 3686). The number of heat days in neighborhoods is calculated using the heat index, covering time windows from the day of blood collection to 6 years prior. Multilevel regression models are used to predict PCPhenoAge acceleration, PCGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPACE. More heat days over short- and mid-term windows are associated with increased PCPhenoAge acceleration (e.g., B prior7-dayCaution+heat : 1.07 years). Longer-term heat is associated with all clocks (e.g., B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 2.48 years for PCPhenoAge, B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 1.09 year for PCGrimAge, and B prior6-yearExtremecaution+heat : 0.05 years for DunedinPACE). Subgroup analyses show no strong evidence for increased vulnerability by sociodemographic factors. These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings linking heat to aging-related morbidity and mortality risks.",

Now, there is no standard-of-care treatment for these patients. Reliable models that represent this disease and can be used for translational research are scarce. To model SCCOHTs, we have established eight patient-derived tumoroid lines from tumor lesions of three patients with SCCOHT. The tumoroids recapitulate genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the corresponding patient tumors and capture intrapatient tumor heterogeneity. Organoid drug profiling using a library of 153 clinical compounds identified methotrexate as an effective and selective drug against SCCOHTs with a clinically relevant IC 50 of 35 nanomolars. RNA sequencing demonstrated that methotrexate induced TP53 pathway activation and apoptosis. These data underscore that organoid technology can support the design of therapeutic strategies for rare cancers.",

In a liquid crystal (LC), the topological nature of disclination lines and colloids induces chiral colloidal entanglements. How the chirality of the entanglements is deterministically created and how the chirality conversion is actuated in the disclinations with Möbius strip topology have never been explored. Here, we create colloidal entanglements with designed chirality in the nematic disclination loops with Möbius topology. An irreversible process of chirality change is revealed if we move the colloidal entanglement along the loops. A nonreciprocal chirality conversion in the dynamical colloidal entanglements is demonstrated, which is induced by the interplay between topological profiles and the geometrical curvature of the disclination loop. Colloidal entanglements in opposite chirality are templated in arbitrary shapes of disclination lines. This work opens opportunities to design smart colloidal materials.",

          "abstract": "Transcription factor ubiquitination is a decisive regulator of growth and development. The DET1-DDB1-DDA1 (DDD) complex associates with the Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and a second ubiquitin ligase, COP1, to control ubiquitination of transcription factors involved in neurological, metabolic, and immune cell development. Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes. This work provides a clear architecture for regulation and cooperative CRL4 DET1-COP1 complex assembly, which can affect degradation of diverse targets by COP1 complexes.",

          "abstract": "From fundamental studies of light-matter interaction to applications in quantum networking and sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a toolbox to control interactions between atoms and photons. The coherence of interactions is determined by the single-pass atomic absorption and number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting 1 million roundtrips but with limited material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. Here, we present a high–numerical aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom single-photon absorption probability near its fundamental limit, reducing the mode size at the atom to order λ. This resonator provides a single-atom cooperativity of 1.6 in a cavity where the light circulates ∼10 times. We load single 87 Rb atoms into this cavity, observe strong coupling, and demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with fidelity of 99.55(6)% and survival of 99.89(4)% in 130 μs. Introducing intracavity imaging systems will enable cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are emerging as a promising platform for epitaxial growth, largely free from the constraints of lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient mismatches. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices. In this regard, developing a process for growing high-quality 3D epitaxial materials before and after the growth of 2D TMDs and understanding the 2D/3D interface are crucial. This study demonstrates the sequential growth of fully epitaxial ZnSe/MoSe 2 /ZnSe heterostructures using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. ZnSe and MoSe 2 , sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase. Multiscale analysis involving transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals lattice commensurability, van der Waals gaps, termination, and interfacial reconstruction. Understanding these interactions is crucial for advancing multidimensional integration of 2D and 3D materials.",

          "abstract": "Cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.",

          "abstract": "Repeated mRNA COVID-19 vaccination increases spike-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) titers. Here, we characterized the influence of increased IgG4 titers on a range of Fc-mediated responses. Elevated spike-specific IgG4 reduced binding to FcγRIIIa and decreased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, in individuals with lower total spike-specific IgG, IgG4 acted in synergy with other IgG subclasses to improve FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding and consequently antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, this trend was more pronounced with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants where vaccination induced comparably lower total spike-specific titers. These observations were further confirmed by in silico modeling where antibody subclass concentrations and FcγR polymorphisms were modulated. Collectively, we illustrate that the impact of elevated IgG4 titers upon Fc functions is dependent on multiple interconnected antibody and antigen factors, which should be taken into consideration when dissecting the mechanisms driving an effective Fc-mediated response following vaccination.",

However, their preparation methods remain a challenge. Here, we develop a gas-solid reactive sintering technique that successfully fabricates a variety of textured lithium ceramics, including electrolyte and electrode materials. These textured lithium ceramic electrolytes exhibit large columnar grains perpendicular to the surface. The textured electrodes indicate an out-of-plane crystallographic texture. As a result, the Li-ion transport pathways across the grain boundary plane are avoided in the textured lithium ceramic with low tortuosity, resulting in great ionic conductivity enhancement by 42 times compared to its traditional equiaxed counterpart. In addition, both Monte Carlo simulation and finite element analysis support the experimental results. This innovative gas-solid reactive sintering technique can extend to prepare various structured and functional ceramics with tailored structures and properties.",

While polaron formation is believed to facilitate efficient carrier transport, the elementary processes of the underlying electron-lattice coupling are yet poorly understood because of the multiscale chemical and structural heterogeneities. Here, we resolve in combined ground- and excited-state spatiospectral ultrafast nanoimaging how structural characteristics are related to both molecular cation and polaron dynamics. We use the observed nanoscale spatial variations of the formamidinium (FA) cation transient vibrational blue shifts as a local probe of the nonlocal polaron-cation coupling. From the correlation with nanomovies of the polaron dynamics, we then infer how a softer more polarizable lattice supports stable polarons and longer-lived residual carriers. This, together with a relative intragrain homogeneity in contrast to high intergrain heterogeneity, suggests pathways for improved synthesis and device engineering, and that perovskite photonics performance is still far from any fundamental limits.",

However, the mechanisms of force generation and transmission remain unclear. We determined the electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the dimeric F 1 -like ATPase complex. The structure revealed an assembly distinct from those of dimeric F 1 F O -ATPases. The F 1 -like ATPase unit associated by two subunits GliD and GliE was named G 1 -ATPase as an R 1 domain of rotary ATPases. G 1 -β subunit, a homolog of the F 1 -ATPase catalytic subunit, exhibited a specific N-terminal region that incorporates the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase into the complex. Structural features of the ATPase displayed strong similarities to F 1 -ATPase, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism.

We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels. Thus, functional tuning of the Pacinian corpuscle is enabled by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.",

Through a global network representing 38 countries, we leveraged 8.9 million mammalian observations to create a library of 14,587 standardized diel activity estimates for 445 species. We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal. Our findings provide essential knowledge of species behavior in an era of rapid global change and suggest the need for a new, quantitative framework that defines diel activity logically and consistently while capturing species plasticity.",

Yet, plasticity rules operating on one-shot episodic memory timescales rarely depend on both pre- and postsynaptic spiking, challenging Hebbian theory in this crucial regime. Here, we present an episodic memory model governed by a simpler rule depending only on presynaptic activity. We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model.",

Projections of how those hazards will change are affected by uncertainties in the climate sensitivity of climate models, among other factors. While the level-of-global-warming approach can circumvent model climate sensitivity uncertainties in some applications, practitioners faced with specific adaptation responsibilities often find such projections difficult to use because they generally require time-oriented information. Earth system projections following specified emissions scenarios can, however, be constrained by applying the level-of-global-warming approach to observationally constrained warming projections to yield more reliable time-oriented projections for adaption planning and implementation. This approach also allows individual groups to produce consistent and comparable assessments of multifaceted climate impacts and causal mechanisms, thereby benefiting climate assessments at national and international levels that provide the science basis for adaptation action.",

Aequorin-based examinations disclosed dual cytosolic Ca 2+ peaks shortly after flg22 application, which corresponded with two voltage shifts from the epidermis to SEs. These signals were converted into rapid long-range action potentials (APs) or slower short-range variation potentials (VPs). Modified phytohormone-levels demonstrated systemic AP effects. Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type than Atseor1/2 mutants. Abundant Ca 2+ influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent in Atseor1/2 and Atfls2 mutants.

Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity.

However, the cause of this trend in the BKS atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we show that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary driver of the strengthening of the BKS anticyclonic circulation, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role, both together accounting for about 86% of the observed circulation trend. Both forcings induce an amplified BKS low-tropospheric warming through coupling with strong sea ice loss. This amplified warming raises geopotential height aloft through thermal expansion, causing an anomalous anticyclonic anomaly, which in turn enhances warming and sea ice loss, forming a positive feedback loop. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding Arctic atmospheric circulation responses to anthropogenic warming and may have implications for climate and environment in the Arctic and beyond.",

We build a probability weight function based on the embedding energy of M in MN x sites as the descriptor for MN x formation statistics, and we predict that the alkali metals are prone to induce the formation of MVN 4 sites. By coordinating Co 2+ ions with AM-MVN x -C templates, we synthesize Co-N-C with CoN 4 sites, demonstrating remarkable oxygen reduction activity in anion exchange membrane fuel cells. These results highlight the statistical thermodynamics of MN x formation and open up the possibility for the rational design of complex M-N-C electrocatalysts with well-defined MN x sites.",

Recent substantial developments have poised the field to address emerging challenges related to sustainability, cost efficiency, and robust applicability in complex substrate settings. The transition from stoichiometric activation to metal-catalyzed methods promises enhanced chemoselectivity and greater precision in controlling glycosidic bond breakage and formation, key to overcoming existing obstacles. Here, we report a nitrene-mediated glycosylation strategy using regular aryl sulfide glycosyl donors and easily accessible 3-methyl dioxazolone as an activator under the catalysis of iron or ruthenium. The iron-catalyzed system demonstrates exceptional catalytic reactivity, requiring as little as 0.1 mole % of catalyst at room temperature, and works well for complex peptide substrates. The ruthenium-catalyzed system can accommodate acid-sensitive functional groups and challenging low-reactivity acceptors. Mechanistic investigations have unveiled unusual multistep pathways involving sulfur imidation of sulfide donors via nitrene transfer and sulfur-to-oxygen rearrangement of N -acyl sulfilimines for the nitrene-mediated activation of sulfide donors.",

Owing to the high Li affinity of Sn single atoms, Sn/CS@SC can promote storage of quasi-metallic Li within the inner void space other than direct plating of metallic Li on the outer surface.

They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible.",

We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca 2+ -dependent vesicle fusion.

Fortuitously, we discovered an anoxic deep-sea brine pool sited close enough to shore to chronicle floods, yet be otherwise undisturbed by animals. Cores retrieved from the pool delivered a 1600-year rainfall record. We merge these core-layer histories with modern rainfall statistics, satellite observations, and simulations to deliver a high-resolution quantitative Late Holocene hydroclimate record for Arabia. We find that the modern era is 2.5 times drier than the last 1.6 thousand years. The Little Ice Age stands out as particularly wet. That period experienced a fivefold increase in rainfall intensity compared to today.

This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques. In a proof-of-principle demonstration using weak coherent pulses, the system achieved a real-time secure transmission rate of 2.38 kilobits per second over a 104.8-kilometer standard telecommunication fiber, which set world records in both aspects.

We apply a statistical physics model—concurrence percolation—to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ( U , V ) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, ≤ V . This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they “superpose” parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.",

Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity.

Single-nuclei transcriptomics and FISH studies revealed that GLP-1Rs are expressed primarily on GABA neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the efficacy of a systemic GLP-1R agonist to attenuate cocaine seeking was associated with increased activity of VTA GABA neurons and decreased activity of VTA dopamine neurons.

Our geochemical data reveal that a thick tuffaceous interval at this site was deposited during OAE1a. Furthermore, multisite compilation of osmium isotopes, Pacific volcanic ash beds, and paleontological data just above OJN basalts illustrate that explosive OJN eruptions spanned ~5 million years, peaking around OAE1a. Their synchroneity strongly indicates that OJN volcanism most likely caused OAE1a and relevant late Barremian to mid-Aptian environmental perturbations.",

          "abstract": "Nonreciprocity is a phenomenon in which broken spatial inversion symmetry appears on a macroscopic scale and is an essential issue in condensed matter physics. Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader. Here, using electron spin resonance, we identify the specific absorption mode in a multiferroic material Sr 2 CoSi 2 O 7 with the spontaneous magnon decay accompanied by the maximum interference, achieving the broadband one-way transparency.",

However, the function and mechanism of posttranscriptional chemical modifications, especially the newly identified N 4 -acetylcytidine (ac 4 C) modification catalyzed by N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), are unknown. In this study, we developed a low-input ac 4 C sequencing technology, ac 4 C LACE-seq, and mapped 8241 ac 4 C peaks at the whole-transcriptome level using 50 mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage. Oocyte-specific Nat10 knockout wiped out ac 4 C signals in oocytes and caused severe defects in meiotic maturation and female infertility. Mechanically, Nat10 deletion led to a failure of ac 4 C deposition on mRNAs encoding key maternal factors, which regulate transcriptome stability and maternal-to-zygotic transition. Nat10 -deleted oocytes showed decreased mRNA translation efficiency due to the direct inhibition of ac 4 C sites on specific transcripts during meiotic maturation. In summary, we developed a low-input, high-sensitivity mRNA ac 4 C profiling approach and highlighted the important physiological function of ac 4 C in the precise regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation by enhancing translation efficiency.",

We uncovered a wide spectrum of differences in the nuclear architecture and 3D-genome organization among different cell types, ranging from the size of the cell nucleus to higher-order chromosome structures and radial positioning of chromatin loci within the nucleus. These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes. Moreover, we found that the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2 promotes active-inactive chromatin segregation and regulates transcription in a nuclear radial position–dependent manner that is highly correlated with its function in modulating active-inactive chromatin compartmentalization.",

We reveal that exceptional points always exist in the anapole regime, and diabolic points are associated with superscattering. We confirm our theoretical findings in the microwave experiment by measuring the extinction spectra of subwavelength Mie-resonant ceramic rings. Our study underpins the generic behavior of non-Hermitian singularities in the scattering spectra of subwavelength Mie resonators, uncovering their special applications in non-Hermitian nonlinear optics and topological photonics.",

However, its existence remains under debate despite several experimental reports. In this study, we investigated the infrared transitions of methane embedded in clusters of parahydrogen molecules at 0.4 K using high-resolution helium nanodroplet spectroscopy. Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H 2 molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity. This work provides strong experimental evidence for the existence of a superfluid phase of molecular hydrogen at 0.4 K, representing a major step forward in understanding quantum behaviors in molecular systems.",

In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons using a plasmonic metasurface strongly coupled to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material. By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system’s anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components. This approach enables simultaneous photon pair generation and quantum state engineering in a compact platform.",

Nevertheless, inherent shortcomings of short half-life, activation of regulatory T (T reg ) cells, and systemic toxicity limit its application. To tackle these, a circular RNA (cRNA)–based IL-2 therapy using immunomodulatory lipid nanoparticles [ursodeoxycholic acid lipid nanoparticles (ULNPs)] and sustained-release hydrogel was developed. Fusing fragment crystallizable (Fc) region into IL-2 and encoding this fusion protein IL-2-Fc (IL-2F) in cRNA (cRNA IL-2F ) greatly extend the half-life. ULNPs containing ursodeoxycholic acid, a transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitor, suppress the function of T reg cells. Consequently, the ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F formulation promotes CD8 + T cells and suppresses T reg cells, increasing the CD8 + /T reg ratio for effective immunotherapy. Furthermore, a locally administrated hydrogel loading with ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F sustains the release, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. This innovative approach achieves remarkable tumor inhibition in both melanoma and orthotopic glioma models with or without surgery, offering a promising future for cancer immunotherapy.",

Chromosomes are aligned through the assembly of a conserved interface, the synaptonemal complex, composed of a central region that forms between two parallel chromosomal backbones called axes. Here, we identify the axis-central region interface in C. elegans , containing a conserved positive patch on the axis component HIM-3 and the negative C terminus of the central region protein SYP-5. Crucially, the canonical ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex is altered upon weakening this interface using charge-reversal mutations. We developed a thermodynamic model that recapitulates our experimental observations, indicating that the liquid-like central region can assemble by wetting the axes without active energy consumption. More broadly, our data show that condensation drives tightly regulated nuclear reorganization during sexual reproduction.",

We previously proposed that the Escherichia coli S2P RseP unwinds helical substrate segments before cleavage, but the mechanism for accommodating a full-length membrane-spanning substrate remained unclear. Our present cryo-EM analysis of Aquifex aeolicus RseP ( Aa RseP) revealed that a substrate-like membrane protein fragment from the expression host occupied the active site while spanning a transmembrane cavity that is inaccessible via lateral diffusion. Furthermore, in vivo photocrosslinking supported that this substrate accommodation mode is recapitulated on the cell membrane. Our results suggest that the substrate accommodation by threading through a conserved membrane-associated region stabilizes the substrate-complex and contributes to substrate discrimination on the membrane.",

Here, we demonstrate a conceptually unique thermal diffusivity microscope capable of performing high-resolution local measurements of anisotropic thermal diffusivity. The microscope features a unique micro four-point probe for fast, nondestructive scanning without calibration or extra sample preparation. It measures anisotropic thermal diffusivity based on thermal delay from a single heater. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the anisotropy of the measured thermal diffusivity correlates excellently with the crystallographic direction of prototypical Bi 2 Te 3 .

Hematopoietic-specific Mto1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were embryonic lethal and showed niche-independent defect in erythroblast proliferation and terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes were severely impaired in the Mto1 cKO fetal liver, and this was followed by cytosolic iron accumulation. Overloaded cytosolic iron promoted heme biosynthesis, which induced an unfolded protein response (UPR) in Mto1 cKO erythroblasts.

Since the financialization of the US economy, American firms increasingly offered workers compensation based in part on company stock, and 23 per cent of private-sector employees now have stock-based compensation. Analysis of the Survey of Consumer Finances data suggests that stock-based compensation promotes greater wealth accumulation than regular wages, but its wealth benefits are higher among men than women, especially at the top of the wealth distribution. Also, this study finds that men, on average, receive more stock-based compensation than women, and the gender gap is explained by job characteristics and sociodemographic attributes. Finally, analysis of the National Bureau of Economic Research survey of employees with stock-based compensation shows that men are more likely to utilize its wealth-building potential than women, thus contributing to gender inequality in wealth.",
