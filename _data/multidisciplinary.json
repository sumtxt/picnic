          "abstract": "Low soil moisture and high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) cause plant water stress and lead to a variety of drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration and photosynthesis 1,2 . When soils dry below critical soil moisture thresholds, ecosystems transition from energy to water limitation as stomata close to alleviate water stress 3,4 . However, the mechanisms behind these thresholds remain poorly defined at the ecosystem scale. Here, by analysing observations of critical soil moisture thresholds globally, we show the prominent role of soil texture in modulating the onset of ecosystem water limitation through the soil hydraulic conductivity curve, whose steepness increases with sand fraction. This clarifies how ecosystem sensitivity to VPD versus soil moisture is shaped by soil texture, with ecosystems in sandy soils being relatively more sensitive to soil drying, whereas ecosystems in clayey soils are relatively more sensitive to VPD. For the same reason, plants in sandy soils have limited potential to adjust to water limitations, which has an impact on how climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems. In summary, although vegetation–atmosphere exchanges are driven by atmospheric conditions and mediated by plant adjustments, their fate is ultimately dependent on the soil.",

          "abstract": "The ability of stony corals to thrive in the oligotrophic (low-nutrient, low-productivity) surface waters of the tropical ocean is commonly attributed to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates 1,2 . The evolutionary history of this symbiosis might clarify its organismal and environmental roles 3 , but its prevalence through time, and across taxa, morphologies and oceanic settings, is currently unclear 4–6 . Here we report measurements of the nitrogen isotope ( 15 N/ 14 N) ratio of coral-bound organic matter (CB-δ 15 N) in samples from Mid-Devonian reefs (Givetian, around 385 million years ago), which represent a constraint on the evolution of coral photosymbiosis. Colonial tabulate and fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals have low CB-δ 15 N values (2.51 ± 0.97‰) in comparison with co-occurring solitary and (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals (5.52 ± 1.63‰). The average of the isotopic difference per deposit (3.01 ± 0.58‰) is statistically indistinguishable from that observed between modern symbiont-barren and symbiont-bearing corals (3.38 ± 1.05‰). On the basis of this evidence, we infer that Mid-Devonian tabulate and some fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals hosted active photosymbionts, while solitary and some (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals did not. The low CB-δ 15 N values of the Devonian tabulate and fasciculate rugose corals relative to the modern range suggest that Mid-Devonian reefs formed in biogeochemical regimes analogous to the modern oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Widespread oligotrophy during the Devonian may have promoted coral photosymbiosis, the occurrence of which may explain why Devonian reefs were the most productive reef ecosystems of the Phanerozoic.",

          "abstract": "Host–pathogen conflicts are crucibles of molecular innovation 1,2 . Selection for immunity to pathogens has driven the evolution of sophisticated immunity mechanisms throughout biology, including in bacterial defence against bacteriophages 3 . Here we characterize the widely distributed anti-phage defence system CmdTAC, which provides robust defence against infection by the T-even family of phages 4 . Our results support a model in which CmdC detects infection by sensing viral capsid proteins, ultimately leading to the activation of a toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase effector protein, CmdT. We show that newly synthesized capsid protein triggers dissociation of the chaperone CmdC from the CmdTAC complex, leading to destabilization and degradation of the antitoxin CmdA, with consequent liberation of the CmdT ADP-ribosyltransferase. Notably, CmdT does not target a protein, DNA or structured RNA, the known targets of other ADP-ribosyltransferases. Instead, CmdT modifies the N6 position of adenine in GA dinucleotides within single-stranded RNAs, leading to arrest of mRNA translation and inhibition of viral replication. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of anti-viral defence and a previously unknown but broadly distributed class of ADP-ribosyltransferases that target mRNA.",

          "abstract": "The brain processes an array of stimuli, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioural responses, but the neural pathways linking interoceptive inputs to outputs for feeding are poorly understood 1–3 . Here we delineate a subcortical circuit in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) directly connect interoceptive inputs to motor centres, controlling food consumption and jaw movements. VMH BDNF neuron inhibition increases food intake by gating motor sequences of feeding through projections to premotor areas of the jaw. When food is unavailable, VMH BDNF inhibition elicits consummatory behaviours directed at inanimate objects such as wooden blocks, and inhibition of perimesencephalic trigeminal area (pMe5) projections evokes rhythmic jaw movements. The activity of these neurons is decreased during food consumption and increases when food is in proximity but not consumed. Activity is also increased in obese animals and after leptin treatment. VMH BDNF neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from both agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), and constitutive VMH BDNF activation blocks the orexigenic effect of AgRP activation. These data indicate an Arc → VMH BDNF → pMe5 circuit that senses the energy state of an animal and regulates consummatory behaviours in a state-dependent manner.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic text, often indistinguishable from human-written content, at a scale that can markedly affect the nature of the information ecosystem 1–3 . Watermarking can help identify synthetic text and limit accidental or deliberate misuse 4 , but has not been adopted in production systems owing to stringent quality, detectability and computational efficiency requirements. Here we describe SynthID-Text, a production-ready text watermarking scheme that preserves text quality and enables high detection accuracy, with minimal latency overhead. SynthID-Text does not affect LLM training and modifies only the sampling procedure; watermark detection is computationally efficient, without using the underlying LLM. To enable watermarking at scale, we develop an algorithm integrating watermarking with speculative sampling, an efficiency technique frequently used in production systems 5 . Evaluations across multiple LLMs empirically show that SynthID-Text provides improved detectability over comparable methods, and standard benchmarks and human side-by-side ratings indicate no change in LLM capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of watermarking in large-scale-production systems, we conducted a live experiment that assessed feedback from nearly 20 million Gemini 6 responses, again confirming the preservation of text quality. We hope that the availability of SynthID-Text 7 will facilitate further development of watermarking and responsible use of LLM systems.",

          "abstract": "Complex multicellularity has emerged independently across a few eukaryotic lineages and is often associated with the rise of elaborate, tightly coordinated developmental processes 1,2 . How multicellularity and development are interconnected in evolution is a major question in biology. The hourglass model of embryonic evolution depicts how developmental processes are conserved during evolution, and predicts morphological and molecular divergence in early and late embryogenesis, bridged by a conserved mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period linked to the formation of the basic body plan 3,4 . Initially found in animal embryos 5–8 , molecular hourglass patterns have recently been proposed for land plants and fungi 9,10 . However, whether the hourglass pattern is an intrinsic feature of all complex multicellular eukaryotes remains unknown. Here we tested the presence of a molecular hourglass in the brown algae, a eukaryotic lineage that has evolved multicellularity independently from animals, fungi and plants 1,11,12 . By exploring transcriptome evolution patterns of brown algae with distinct morphological complexities, we uncovered an hourglass pattern during embryogenesis in morphologically complex species. Filamentous algae without canonical embryogenesis display transcriptome conservation in multicellular stages of the life cycle, whereas unicellular stages are more rapidly evolving. Our findings suggest that transcriptome conservation in brown algae is associated with cell differentiation stages, but is not necessarily linked to embryogenesis. Together with previous work in animals, plants and fungi, we provide further evidence for the generality of a developmental hourglass pattern across complex multicellular eukaryotes.",

While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs 4–8 . Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining COVID-19 vaccine demand was key to ending the global health emergency. To help do this, many governments used chatbots that provided personalized information guiding people on where, when and how to get vaccinated. We designed and tested a WhatsApp chatbot to understand whether two-way interactive messaging incorporating behaviourally informed functionalities could perform better than one-way message reminders. We ran a large-scale preregistered randomized controlled trial with 249,705 participants in Argentina, measuring vaccinations using Ministry of Health records. The behaviourally informed chatbot more than tripled COVID-19 vaccine uptake compared with the control group (a 1.6 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (1.36 pp, 1.77 pp)) and nearly doubled uptake compared with the one-way message reminder (a 1 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval, (0.83 pp, 1.17 pp)). Communications tools designed with behaviourally informed functionalities that simplify the vaccine user journey can increase vaccination more than traditional message reminders and may have applications to other health behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Executive function (EF) delays are well documented in paediatric neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs). There is no consensus about whether EF delay represents a transdiagnostic feature of NDCs. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized 180 studies reporting two or more NDC comparisons on EF, examined differences between NDCs, and the moderating effects of gender, age, publication year, DSM editions and assessment types. Studies using established EF measures across seven domains (attention, fluency, set-shifting, set-switching, response inhibition, planning and working memory) in participants under 18 were included. Summary effects were compared: (1) for all reported NDCs relative to control, (2) for each individual NDC relative to control and (3) between NDC groups. Results confirmed that EF delay was a transdiagnostic feature of neurodevelopmental delay, with a moderate effect size of delay across all NDCs ( g = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.63) compared with control. This effect increased with comorbidities ( g = 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.86), DSM-5 criteria and informant measures. Comparisons between NDCs revealed few differences: children with tic disorders (TD) showed smaller EF delays, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed larger delays in attention, response inhibition, planning and working memory compared with TD and specific learning disorders, while children with autism spectrum disorders showed greater delays on set-switching compared with ADHD. Findings support transdiagnostic models of neurodevelopment to further a developmentally sensitive science that can reveal how EF delays contribute to brain circuitry, symptom profiles and functioning, and ultimately support early interventions and outcomes for all children with NDCs.",

          "abstract": "Nuanced portrayals of stigmatized groups in media have been shown to reduce prejudice. In an online experiment (N = 749), we tested whether a feature film depicting incarcerated peoples’ experiences in the criminal justice system can increase a) empathic accuracy and compassion toward people who have been incarcerated and b) support for criminal justice reform. We measured baseline empathic accuracy via a well-validated task, where participants infer the emotions of people sharing stories about difficult life events. All storytellers were formerly incarcerated and students. However, in half the videos we labeled them as “formerly incarcerated” and in the remaining half as “college student.” We then surveyed people’s baseline attitudes toward criminal justice reform. Next, we assigned participants to watch one of three films. The intervention film chronicled the true stories of Black men on death row. Two docudramas of similar length served as control films. Finally, participants completed the empathic accuracy task and survey again and were given the opportunity to sign a petition. Compared to those who watched a control film, participants who watched the intervention film more accurately inferred the emotions of storytellers labeled “formerly incarcerated,” and increased their support for criminal justice reform. These effects held for conservative and liberal participants alike. However, the film had no effect on feelings of compassion. Together, these results demonstrate the power of narrative interventions to not only increase empathic accuracy for members of a severely stigmatized group, but to increase support for reforms designed to improve their lives.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between sociopolitical organization and violence remains an enduring question in anthropological research. Less studied is the articulation of gender with violence in societies of different sociopolitical organization. We investigate the frequency and type of violence experienced by adult males and females in pre-Hispanic Andean archaeological contexts, comparing exposure to antemortem (nonlethal) and perimortem (potentially lethal) violence across three categories of sociopolitical organization: autonomous communities, regional cultural formations, and states. Using a database of 8,607 adults from 169 publications and over 155 sites, we construct a multinomial logistic regression using Bayesian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to fit our model. The odds of antemortem and perimortem trauma were low for both sexes. However, the odds of antemortem trauma were consistently higher for males than females in all categories of sociopolitical organization, suggesting that men were more frequently exposed to violence. Males display similar odds of cranial trauma across all forms of sociopolitical organization, while females display slightly reduced odds of cranial trauma in states compared to autonomous communities. Perimortem trauma is especially strongly patterned by sex. In autonomous communities, the odds of potentially lethal cranial trauma are equivalent between the sexes; in states, they are consistent for males, but depressed for females. In the pre-Hispanic Andes, living in states dramatically reduced the chances of encountering lethal violence for females, but not males. Our study complicates the notion that increasing sociopolitical complexity leads to decreasing interpersonal violence and highlights the importance of gender in understanding the human history of violence.",

          "abstract": "Reducing hostility in social media interactions is a key public concern. Most extant research emphasizes how online contextual factors breed hostility. Here, we take a different perspective and focus on the offline roots of hostility, that is, offline experiences and stable individual-level dispositions. Using a unique dataset of Danish Twitter users (N = 4,931), we merge data from administrative government registries with a behavioral measure of online hostility. We demonstrate that individuals with more aggressive dispositions (as proxied by having many more criminal verdicts) are more hostile in social media conversations. We also find evidence that features of childhood environments predict online hostility. Time spent in foster care is a strong correlate, while other indicators of childhood instability (e.g., the number of moves and divorced parents) are not. Furthermore, people from more resourceful childhood environments—those with better grades in primary school and higher parental socioeconomic status—are more hostile on average, as such people are more politically engaged. These results offer an important reminder that much online hostility is rooted in offline experiences and stable dispositions. They also provide anuanced view of the core group of online aggressors. While these individuals display general antisocial personality tendencies by having many more criminal verdicts, they also come from resourceful backgrounds more often than not.",

To mediate cell-to-cell fusion, Syncytin-1 requires specific interaction with its cognate receptor. Two trimeric transmembrane proteins, Alanine, Serine, Cysteine Transporters 1 and 2 (ASCT1 and ASCT2), were suggested and widely accepted as Syncytin-1 cellular receptors. To quantitatively assess the individual contributions of human ASCT1 and ASCT2 to the fusogenic activity of Syncytin-1, we developed a model system where the ASCT1 and ASCT2 double knockout was rescued by ectopic expression of either ASCT1 or ASCT2. We demonstrated that ASCT2 was required for Syncytin-1 binding, cellular entry, and cell-to-cell fusion, while ASCT1 was not involved in this receptor interaction. We experimentally validated the ASCT1–ASCT2 heterotrimers as a possible explanation for the previous misidentification of ASCT1 as a receptor for Syncytin-1. This redefinition of receptor specificity is important for proper understanding of Syncytin-1 function in normal and pathological pregnancy.",

In this study, we utilize satellite-derived artificial light at night (ALAN) data to quantify the hotspots and the development of light-emitting human activity across the Arctic from 1992 to 2013. We find that out of 16.4 million km 2 analyzed a total area of 839,710 km 2 (5.14%) is lit by human activity with an annual increase of 4.8%. The European Arctic and the oil and gas extraction regions in Russia and Alaska are hotspots of ALAN with up to a third of the land area lit, while the Canadian Arctic remains dark to a large extent. On average, only 15% of lit area in the Arctic contains human settlement, indicating that artificial light is largely attributable to industrial human activity. With this study, we provide a standardized approach to spatially assess human industrial activity across the Arctic, independent from economic data. Our results provide a crucial baseline for sustainable development and conservation planning across the highly vulnerable Arctic region.",

          "abstract": "The dysfunction of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) facilitates the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While targeting the UPS for HCC therapy has been proposed, identifying effective targets has been challenging. In this study, we conducted a focused screen of siRNA libraries targeting UPS-related WD40 repeat (WDR) proteins and found that silencing WDR20, a deubiquitinating enzyme activating factor, selectively inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells without affecting normal hepatocytes. Moreover, the downregulation of WDR20 expression induced HCC cellular senescence and suppressed tumor progression in xenograft, sleeping beauty transposon/transposase, and hydrodynamic tail vein injection-induced HCC models, and Alb-Cre + / MYC + HCC transgenic mouse models. Mechanistically, we found that WDR20 silencing disturbed the protein stability of c-Myc, orchestrating the simultaneous USP12/46-mediated deubiquitination of c-Myc, thereby promoting the transcriptional activation of CDKN1A . Further investigation revealed a positive coexpression of WDR20 and c-Myc in a tissue microarray with 88 HCC clinical samples. By employing three patient-derived organoids from individuals with HCC, we have validated the decrease in c-Myc expression and the significant induction of senescence and growth inhibition following silencing of WDR20. This study not only uncovers the biological function of WDR20 and elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying its negative regulation of HCC cellular senescence but also highlight the potential of WDR20 as a promising target for HCC therapy.",

CYC was delivered into lipid bilayer vesicles as well as living cells, with a cellular uptake ratio approaching 90%. Mechanistic studies showed that CYC was internalized into cells through a permeation pathway directly into the cytoplasm, bypassing endosomal entrapment. Upon carrier-assisted internalization, CYC retained its bioactivity, as reflected by an induced cell apoptosis rate of 25% at low dose (1 µM).

          "abstract": "The eIF4F translation initiation complex plays a critical role in melanoma resistance to clinical BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In this study, we uncover a function of eIF4F in the negative regulation of the rat sarcoma (RAS)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. We demonstrate that eIF4F is essential for controlling ERK signaling intensity in treatment-naïve melanoma cells harboring BRAF or NRAS mutations. Specifically, the dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3, which acts as a negative feedback regulator of ERK activity, requires continuous production in an eIF4F-dependent manner to limit excessive ERK signaling driven by oncogenic RAF/RAS mutations. Treatment with small-molecule eIF4F inhibitors disrupts the negative feedback control of MAPK signaling, leading to ERK hyperactivation and EGR1 overexpression in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our quantitative analyses reveal a high spare signaling capacity in the ERK pathway, suggesting that eIF4F-dependent feedback keeps the majority of ERK molecules inactive under normal conditions. Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role of eIF4F in regulating ERK signaling flux and suggest that pharmacological eIF4F inhibitors can disrupt the negative feedback control of MAPK activity in melanomas with BRAF and NRAS activating mutations.",

          "abstract": "Antibody responses induced by current vaccines for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 often lack robust cross-reactivity. As hubs where diverse immune cells converge and interact, the alterations in the immune microenvironment within lymph nodes (LNs) are intricately linked to immune responses. Herein, we designed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) loaded with circular RNA (circRNA) and targeted to LNs, in which CXCL13 was directly integrated into antigen-encoding circRNA strands. We demonstrated that CXCL13 alters the transcriptomic profiles of LNs, especially the upregulation of IL-21 and IL-4. Meanwhile, CXCL13 promotes the formation of germinal center and elicits robust antigen-specific T cell responses. With the codelivery of CXCL13 and the antigen, CXCL13 enhances cross-reactive antibodies against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, achieving protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges in a mouse model. Notably, the targeted modification of LNP surfaces with antibodies helps address some of the challenges associated with lyophilized LNP vaccines, which is crucial for the long-term storage of LNP-circRNA vaccines. Overall, the circRNA-based antigen-CXCL13 coexpression system developed herein provides a simple and robust platform that enhances the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses against multiple viral glycoproteins, highlighting the potential utility of CXCL13 in inducing broad immune responses.",

Typically, the analysis assumes that the relaxation rate of a pure bending deformation is determined by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and viscous dissipation in the surrounding medium. Here, we reexamine this assumption and demonstrate that viscous flows within the membrane dominate the dynamics of bending fluctuations of nonplanar membranes with a radius of curvature smaller than the Saffman–Delbrück length. Using flickering spectroscopy of giant vesicles made of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC:cholesterol mixtures and pure diblock-copolymer membranes, we experimentally detect the signature of membrane dissipation in curvature fluctuations. We show that membrane viscosity can be reliably obtained from the short time behavior of the shape time correlations. The results indicate that the DPPC:cholesterol membranes behave as a Newtonian fluid, while the polymer membranes exhibit more complex rheology. Our study provides physical insights into the time scales of curvature remodeling of biological and synthetic membranes.",

Due to its gating by extracellular Zn 2+ , ZAC has been considered a Zn 2+ sensor, but it has undergone minimal structural and functional characterization since its molecular cloning. Among the families in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, only the structure of ZAC has yet to be determined. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of ZAC in the apo state and performed structure-based mutation analyses. We identified a few residues in the extracellular domain whose mutations had a mild impact on Zn 2+ sensitivity. The constriction site in the ion-conducting pore differs from the one in other Cys-loop receptor structures, and further mutational analysis identified a key residue that is important for ion selectivity. In summary, our work provides a structural framework for understanding the ion-conducting mechanism of ZAC.",

          "abstract": "The loss of wild plant populations is often assumed to lead to coextinctions, particularly among specialized insects. Despite global declines in both terrestrial insects and plants, the relationship between these trends remains elusive. Here, we address this gap by analyzing the relationship between population trends of insects and their host plants in Germany, encompassing over 150,000 interactions among 3,429 plant and 2,239 insect species, including both pollinators (bees and hoverflies) and herbivores (butterflies, moths, and sawflies). Our findings reveal parallel population declines of insects and host plants across taxa, except for more generalist hoverflies. However, simulated extinctions of threatened host plants led to limited coextinctions in insects. Notably, 96% of insect species retained over 25% of their host plant diversity, and among those, 98% still retained at least one common species in their interaction portfolio. Even highly specialized insects may persist because they tend to specialize in nonthreatened plant species. While uncertainties remain regarding the interchangeability of host plants, our findings suggest that insect coextinctions are far from a 1:1 match with plant extinctions. Our findings suggest the declining abundance of many plant species can contribute to insect decline yet challenge the common assumption that the extinction of threatened plant species will necessarily trigger an imminent extinction wave of associated insects.

However, extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions that inevitably limit their scope. Here, we propose a multilayer network model of competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how spatially structured environments impact species coexistence and ecosystem stability. We introduce the concept of landscape-mediated fitness, quantifying how fit a species is in a given environment in terms of colonization and extinction. We show that, when all environments are equivalent, one species excludes all the others—except the marginal case where species fitnesses are in exact trade-off. However, we prove that stable coexistence becomes possible in sufficiently heterogeneous environments by introducing spatial disorder in the model and solving it exactly in the mean-field limit. Crucially, coexistence is supported by the spontaneous localization of species through the emergence of ecological niches. We show that our results remain qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where topological features can improve species coexistence by buffering competition. Finally, we employ our model to study how correlated heterogeneity promotes spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and riverine landscapes. Our work provides a framework to understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological interactions.",

These measurements show that the record-high CH 4 growth in 2020–2022 was accompanied by a sharp decline in δ 13 C CH4 , indicating that the increase in CH 4 abundance was mainly driven by increased emissions from microbial sources such as wetlands, waste, and agriculture.

Studies that have attempted to quantify the impact of deforestation on malaria in the Brazilian Amazon have produced conflicting results. However, they varied in methodology and data sources. Most importantly, all studies used annual data, neglecting the subannual seasonal dynamics of malaria. Here, we fill the knowledge gap on the subannual relationship between ecological change in the Brazilian Amazon and malaria transmission. Using the highest spatiotemporal resolution available, we estimated the effect of deforestation on malaria cases between 2003 and 2022 using a stratified Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model fitted with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation. The model was also stratified by state. We found that a 1% increase in 1-mo lagged deforestation increased malaria cases in a given month and municipality by 6.3% [95% credible interval (Crl): 6.2, 6.5%]. Based on an interaction term included in the model, the effect of deforestation on malaria was even larger in areas with higher forest cover. We found that the coefficients for deforestation and mobility were highly variable when stratified by state. Our results provide detailed evidence that, on average, deforestation increases malaria transmission, but that the relationship is not spatiotemporally uniform. These results have implications for stratifying malaria control interventions based on ecological dynamics to help Brazil achieve its goal of malaria elimination by 2035.",

          "abstract": "Complement activation through antibody–antigen complexes is crucial in various pathophysiological processes and utilized in immunotherapies to eliminate infectious agents, regulatory immune cells, or cancer cells. The tertiary structures of the four IgG antibody subclasses are largely comparable, with the most prominent difference being the hinge regions connecting the Fab and Fc domains, providing them with unique structural flexibility. Complement recruitment and activation depend strongly on IgG subclass, which is commonly rationalized by differences in hinge flexibility and the respective affinities for C1, the first component of the classical complement pathway. However, a unifying mechanism of how these different IgG subclass properties combine to modulate C1 activation has not yet been proposed. We here demonstrate that complement activation is determined by their varying ability to form IgG oligomers on antigenic surfaces large enough to multivalently bind and activate C1. We directly visualize the resulting IgG oligomer structures and characterize their distribution by means of high-speed atomic force microscopy, quantify their complement recruitment efficiency from quartz crystal microbalance experiments, and characterize their ability to activate complement on tumor cell lines as well as in vesicle-based complement lysis assays. We present a mechanistic model of the multivalent interactions that govern C1 binding to IgG oligomers and use it to extract kinetic rate constants from real-time interaction data from which we further calculate equilibrium dissociation constants. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the parameters that govern complement activation by the different IgG subclasses, which may inform the design of future antibody therapies.",

A 98.96% lithium leaching rate with 99.60% product purity was demonstrated for lithium recovery from spent LiFePO 4 cathode materials. In-depth mechanism studies reveal that the electric field-driven electrode oxidation and in situ generated oxidative electrolyte synergetically contributes to lithium ions leaching via a structural framework elements oxidation and particle corrosion splitting synergy. This dual-oxidation mechanism facilitates rapid and efficient lithium extraction with broad universality, offering significant economic and environmental benefits.

Burmese pythons possess extreme intestinal regenerative capacity yet lack crypts, thus providing opportunities to identify noncanonical but potentially conserved mechanisms that expand our understanding of regenerative capacity in vertebrates, including humans. Here, we leverage single-nucleus RNA sequencing of fasted and postprandial python small intestine to identify the signaling pathways and cell–cell interactions underlying the python’s regenerative response. We find that python intestinal regeneration entails the activation of multiple conserved mechanisms of growth and stress response, including core lipid metabolism pathways and the unfolded protein response in intestinal enterocytes. Our single-cell resolution highlights extensive heterogeneity in mesenchymal cell population signaling and intercellular communication that directs major tissue restructuring and the shift out of a dormant fasted state by activating both embryonic developmental and wound healing pathways. We also identify distinct roles of BEST4+ enterocytes in coordinating key regenerative transitions via NOTCH signaling. Python intestinal regeneration shares key signaling features and molecules with mammalian gastric bypass, indicating that conserved regenerative programs are common to both. Our findings provide different insights into cooperative and conserved regenerative programs and intercellular interactions in vertebrates independent of crypts which have been otherwise obscured in model species where temporal phases of generative growth are limited to embryonic development or recovery from injury.",

Infection with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the strongest environmental risk factor, and HLA-DR15 is the strongest genetic risk factor for MS. We employed computational methods and in vitro assays for CD4 T cell activation to investigate the DR15-restricted response to EBV. Using a machine learning-based HLA ligand predictor, the EBV glycoprotein B (gB) was predicted to be enriched in epitopes restricted to presentation by DRB1*15:01. In DR15-positive individuals, two epitopes comprised the major CD4 T cell response to gB. Surprisingly, the expression of recombinant gB in a DR15-homozygous B cell line or primary autologous B cells elicited a CD4 T cell response, indicating that intracellular gB was loaded onto HLA class II molecules. By deleting the signal sequence of gB, we determined that this pathway for direct activation of CD4 T cells was dependent on trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within the B cell. We screened seven recombinant EBV antigens from the ER compartment for immune responses in DR15-negative vs. DR15-homozygous individuals. In addition to gB, gH was a key CD4 T cell target in individuals homozygous for DR15. Compared to non-DR15 controls, DR15-homozygotes had significantly higher T cell responses to both gB and gH but not to EBV latent or lytic antigens overall. Responses to gB and gH were slightly elevated in DR15 homozygotes with MS. Our results link MS environmental and genetic risk factors by demonstrating that HLA-DR15 dictates CD4 T cell immunity to EBV antigens.",

Large amounts of natural IFNλ4 are present in the secretory layer of the intestinal tracts of healthy piglets, which suggests that IFNλ4 is in direct physiological contact with microbial pathogens. We also identified two biochemical functions of mammalian IFNλ4, the induction of bacterial agglutination and direct microbial killing, which are not functions of the other IFNλs. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that after binding to the carbohydrate fraction of lipopolysaccharide, mammalian IFNλ4 self-assembles into bacteria-surrounding nanoparticles that agglutinate bacteria, and that its unique cationic amphiphilic molecular structure facilitates the destruction of bacterial membranes. Our data reveal features of IFNλ4 distinct from those of previously reported IFNλs and suggest that noncanonical IFNλ4 is deeply involved in intestinal immunity, beyond simply cytokine signaling.",

In contrast to other methods utilizing hydrogels as sorbents, we do not store water within hydrogels—we use them as a transport medium. Inspired by nature, we capture atmospheric water through a hydrogel membrane “skin” at an extraordinarily high rate of 5.50 kgm − 2 d − 1 at a low humidity of 35%. and up to 16.9 kgm − 2 d − 1 at higher humidities.

          "abstract": "Dormant cancer stem cells (DCSCs) exhibit characteristics of chemotherapy resistance and immune escape, and they are a crucial source of tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. We demonstrate that enriched Gzmk + CD8 + T cells within the niche of esophageal DCSCs restrict the outgrowth of tumor mass. Nonetheless, DCSCs can escape immune elimination by enhancing PD-L1 signaling, thereby maintaining immune equilibrium. Quiescent fibroblast-derived quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) promotes the expression of PD-L1 and its own expression in DCSCs by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, high QSOX1 in the dormant tumor niche contributes to the exclusion of CD8 + T cells. Conversely, blocking QSOX1 with Ebselen in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can effectively eradicate residual DCSCs by reducing PD-L1 expression and promoting CD8 + T cell infiltration. Clinically, high expression of QSOX1 predicts a poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby QSOX1 promotes PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exclusion, facilitating the immune escape of DCSCs, and QSOX1 inhibition, combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach for eliminating DCSCs and preventing recurrence.",

          "abstract": "The maintenance of lipid asymmetry on the plasma membrane is regulated by flippases, such as ATP8A2, ATP11A, and ATP11C, which translocate phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet. We previously identified a patient-derived point mutation (Q84E) in ATP11A at the phospholipid entry site, which acquired the ability to flip phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). This mutation led to elevated levels of sphingomyelin (SM) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We herein present two de novo ATP11A dominant mutations (E114G and S399L) in heterozygous patients exhibiting neurological and developmental disorders. These mutations, situated near the predicted phospholipid exit site, similarly confer the ability for ATP11A to recognize PtdCho as a substrate, resulting in its internalization into cells. Cells expressing these mutants had increased SM levels on their surface, attributed to the up-regulated expression of the sphingomyelin synthase-1 gene, rendering them more susceptible to SM phosphodiesterase-mediated cell lysis. Corresponding mutations in ATP11C and ATP8A2, paralogs of ATP11A, exerted similar effects on PtdCho-flipping activity and increased SM levels on the cell surface. Molecular dynamics simulations, based on the ATP11C structure, suggest that the E114G and S399L mutations enhance ATP11C’s affinity toward PtdCho. These findings underscore the importance of the well-conserved exit and entry sites in determining phospholipid substrate specificity and indicate that aberrant flipping of PtdCho contributes to neurological disorders.",

These loci are scattered throughout the genome and are individually responsible only for small fractions of the total heritable trait variance. The recently proposed omnigenic model provides a conceptual framework to explain these observations by postulating that numerous distant loci contribute to each complex trait via effect propagation through intracellular regulatory networks. We formalize this conceptual framework by proposing the “quantitative omnigenic model” (QOM), a statistical model that combines prior knowledge of the regulatory network topology with genomic data. By applying our model to gene expression traits in yeast, we demonstrate that QOM achieves similar gene expression prediction performance to traditional GWAS with hundreds of times less parameters, while simultaneously extracting candidate causal and quantitative chains of effect propagation through the regulatory network for every individual gene. We estimate the fraction of heritable trait variance in cis- and in trans- , break the latter down by effect propagation order, assess the trans- variance not attributable to transcriptional regulation, and show that QOM correctly accounts for the low-dimensional structure of gene expression covariance. We furthermore demonstrate the relevance of QOM for systems biology, by employing it as a statistical test for the quality of regulatory network reconstructions, and linking it to the propagation of nontranscriptional (including environmental) effects.",

In Arabidopsis , endosomal membrane constriction and scission are uncoupled, resulting in the formation of extensive concatenated ILV networks and enhancing cargo sequestration efficiency. Here, we used a combination of electron tomography, computer simulations, and mathematical modeling to address the questions of when concatenated ILV networks evolved in plants and what drives their formation. Through morphometric analyses of tomographic reconstructions of endosomes across yeast, algae, and various land plants, we have found that ILV concatenation is widespread within plant species, but only prevalent in seed plants, especially in flowering plants. Multiple budding sites that require the formation of pores in the limiting membrane were only identified in hornworts and seed plants, suggesting that this mechanism has evolved independently in both plant lineages. To identify the conditions under which these multiple budding sites can arise, we used particle-based molecular dynamics simulations and found that changes in ESCRT filament properties, such as filament curvature and membrane binding energy, can generate the membrane shapes observed in multiple budding sites. To understand the relationship between membrane budding activity and ILV network topology, we performed computational simulations and identified a set of membrane remodeling parameters that can recapitulate our tomographic datasets.",

We generated single- and double-knockout mutants targeting essential genes ( tssD and tssE ) in both T6SS-1 and T6SS-2 and assessed their colonization and competition capabilities in vivo. Our results indicate that T6SSs are nonessential for colonization of the bee gut, although T6SS-2 mutant strains exhibited significantly lower colonization levels compared to the wild-type (WT) strain. Further, a defined community experiment showed that S. alvi wkB2 T6SSs do not significantly impact interspecific competition among core gut bacteria. However, cocolonization experiments with closely related S. alvi strains demonstrated that T6SS-1 plays a role in mediating intraspecific competition. Transcriptomic analysis of bee guts monocolonized by WT or T6SS mutants revealed differential expression of host immunity-related genes relative to microbiota-deprived bees, such as upregulation of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin in the presence of WT S. alvi and the antimicrobial peptide defensin in the presence of T6SS-2 mutant S. alvi , suggesting that T6SSs contribute to shaping host immune responses.

          "abstract": "Bacteria power rotation of an extracellular flagellar filament for swimming motility. Thousands of flagellin subunits compose the flagellar filament, which extends several microns from the bacterial surface. It is unclear whether bacteria actively control filament length. Many polarly flagellated bacteria produce shorter flagellar filaments than peritrichous bacteria, and FlaG has been reported to limit flagellar filament length in polar flagellates. However, a mechanism for how FlaG may function is unknown. We observed that deletion of flaG in the polarly flagellated pathogens Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Campylobacter jejuni caused extension of flagellar filaments to lengths comparable to peritrichous bacteria. Using C. jejuni as a model to understand how FlaG controls flagellar filament length, we found that FlaG and FliS chaperone–flagellin complexes antagonize each other for interactions with FlhA in the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) export gate. FlaG interacted with an understudied region of FlhA, and this interaction appeared to be enhanced in Δ fliS and FlhA FliS-binding mutants. Our data support that FlaG evolved in polarly flagellated bacteria as an antagonist to interfere with the ability of FliS to interact with and deliver flagellins to FlhA in the fT3SS export gate to control flagellar filament length so that these bacteria produce relatively shorter flagella than peritrichous counterparts. This mechanism is similar to how some gatekeepers in injectisome T3SSs prevent chaperones from delivering effector proteins until completion of the T3SS and host contact occurs. Thus, flagellar and injectisome T3SSs have convergently evolved protein antagonists to negatively impact respective T3SSs to secrete their major terminal substrates.",

We identified 11 ML and 12 Toll genes in the S. litura genome. A series of experiments indicated that S. litura ML protein 11 (SlML-11) binds the budded form of AcMNPV and partners with S. litura Toll5 (SlToll5). SlML-11 also bound sphingomyelin (SPM), which is a component of the virion envelope. Disabling SlML-11 and SlToll5 increased susceptibility to infection, while priming larvae with SPM reduced susceptibility as measured by increased survival to the adult stage and clearance of AcMNPV from individuals that emerged as adults. We conclude that SPM is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule while SlML-11 and SlToll5 interact to function as a pattern recognition receptor that senses AcMNPV.",

Mechanically, CD73 can be secreted via the Golgi apparatus transport pathway. Then secreted CD73 may activate AXl by directly bind with site R55 located in Axl extracellular domain independently of GAS6. In addition, we proved that CD73 can stabilize Axl expression via inhibiting CBLB expression. We also identified the distinct function of CD73 activity in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings indicated a role of CD73 in mediating NSCLC metastasis and propose it as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.",

          "abstract": "Body fossils set limits on feasible reconstructions of functional capacity and behavior in theropod dinosaurs, but do not document in-life behaviors. In contrast, trace fossils such as footprints preserve in-life behaviors that can potentially test and enhance existing reconstructions. Here, we demonstrate how theropod trackways can be used as indirect evidence of pre-avian aerial behavior, expanding the approaches available to study vertebrate flight origins. This involved exploring the behavioral implications of a two-toed Cretaceous-aged theropod trackway produced by a small, bird-like microraptorine moving at high speed. Applying first principle running biomechanics, we were able to conclude that the trackway is atypical, indirectly evidencing pre-avian aerial behavior. This trackway documents the evidence of wing-assisted aerodynamic force production during locomotion, supporting a broader distribution of this behavior than currently known. These findings support previously proposed aerial behavior in early bird-like theropods, showing how trackways will help to deepen our understanding of theropod flight origins.",

          "abstract": "Large meteorite impacts must have strongly affected the habitability of the early Earth. Rocks of the Archean Eon record at least 16 major impact events, involving bolides larger than 10 km in diameter. These impacts probably had severe, albeit temporary, consequences for surface environments. However, their effect on early life is not well understood. Here, we analyze the sedimentology, petrography, and carbon isotope geochemistry of sedimentary rocks across the S2 impact event (37 to 58 km carbonaceous chondrite) forming part of the 3.26 Ga Fig Tree Group, South Africa, to evaluate its environmental effects and biological consequences. The impact initiated 1) a giant tsunami that mixed Fe 2+ -rich deep waters into the Fe 2+ -poor shallow waters and washed debris into coastal areas, 2) heating that caused partial evaporation of surface ocean waters and likely a short-term increase in weathering and erosion on land, and 3) injection of P from vaporization of the S2 bolide. Strata immediately above the S2 impact event contain abundant siderites, which are associated with organic matter and exhibit light and variable δ 13 C carb values. This is consistent with microbial iron cycling in the wake of the impact event. Thus, the S2 impact likely had regional, if not global, positive and negative effects on life. The tsunami, atmospheric heating, and darkness would likely have decimated phototrophic microbes in the shallow water column. However, the biosphere likely recovered rapidly, and, in the medium term, the increase in nutrients and iron likely facilitated microbial blooms, especially of iron-cycling microbes.",

However, the impacts of gut microbe–GPCR interactions on human physiology have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that GPR31, which is activated by the gut bacterial metabolite pyruvate, is specifically expressed on type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) in the lamina propria of the human intestine. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cDC1s and a monolayer human gut organoid coculture system, we show that cDC1s extend their dendrites toward pyruvate on the luminal side, forming transepithelial dendrites (TED). Accordingly, GPR31 activation via pyruvate enhances the fundamental function of cDC1 by allowing efficient uptake of gut luminal antigens, such as dietary compounds and bacterial particles through TED formation. Our results highlight the role of GPCRs in tuning the human gut immune system according to local metabolic cues.",

Although many animals routinely consume ethanol in low concentrations as part of their natural diets, its inherent toxicity can cause severe damage. Even species particularly well adapted to ethanol consumption face detrimental effects when exposed to concentrations above 4%. Here, we investigated the metabolism of ethanol and its impact on survival and behavior in the Oriental hornet ( Vespa orientalis ), a social wasp that naturally consumes ethanol. We show that chronic ethanol consumption, even at concentrations as high as 80%, had no impact on hornet mortality, construction behavior, or agonistic behavior. Using 13 C1 labeled ethanol, we show that hornets efficiently metabolized ingested ethanol and at a much higher rate than honey bees. The presence of multiple copies of the alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) gene in the Vespa genera suggests a potential mechanism for ethanol tolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that the mutualistic relationship between ethanol-producing organisms and vespid hosts may be at the origin of their remarkable capacity to utilize and metabolize ethanol.",

The mirror-image D- and L-ligases operate in concert to provide a system for cross-chiral replication, whereby they catalyze each other’s synthesis and undergo mutual amplification at constant temperature, with apparent exponential growth and a doubling time of about 1 h. Neither the D- nor the L-RNA components alone can achieve autocatalytic self-replication. Cross-chiral exponential amplification can be continued indefinitely through a serial-transfer process that provides an ongoing supply of the component D- and L-substrates. Unlike the familiar paradigm of semiconservative nucleic acid replication that relies on Watson–Crick pairing between complementary strands, cross-chiral replication relies on tertiary interactions between structured nucleic acids “across the mirror.” There are few examples, outside of biology, of autocatalytic self-replication systems that undergo exponential amplification and there are no prior examples, in either biological or chemical systems, of cross-chiral replication enabling exponential amplification.",

          "abstract": "The dominance of beneficial mutations is a key evolutionary parameter affecting the rate and genetic basis of adaptation, yet it is notoriously difficult to estimate. A leading method to infer it is to compare the relative rates of adaptive substitution for X-linked and autosomal genes, which—according to a classic model by Charlesworth et al. (1987)—is a simple function of the dominance of new beneficial mutations. Recent evidence that rates of adaptive substitution are faster for X-linked genes implies, accordingly, that beneficial mutations are usually recessive. However, this conclusion is incompatible with leading theories of dominance, which predict that beneficial mutations tend to be dominant or overdominant with respect to fitness. To address this incompatibility, we use Fisher’s geometric model to predict the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations and the relative rates of positively selected substitution on the X and autosomes. Previous predictions of faster-X theory emerge as a special case of our model in which the phenotypic effects of mutations are small relative to the distance to the phenotypic optimum. But as mutational effects become large relative to the optimum, we observe an elevated tempo of positively selected substitutions on the X relative to the autosomes across a broader range of dominance conditions, including those predicted by theories of dominance. Our results imply that, contrary to previous models, dominant and overdominant beneficial mutations can plausibly generate patterns of faster-X adaptation. We discuss resulting implications for genomic studies of adaptation and inferences of dominance.",

However, the growth of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and dendritic Li microstructure pose significant challenges for the long-term operation of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose the utilization of a suspension electrolyte with dispersed magnetically responsive nanosheets whose orientation can be manipulated by an external magnetic field during cell operation for realizing in situ regeneration in LMBs. The regeneration mechanism arises from the redistribution of the ion flux and the formation of an inorganic-rich SEI for uniform and compact Li deposition. With the magnetic-field-induced regeneration process, we show that a Li||Li symmetric cell stably operates for 350 h at 2 mA cm −2 and 2 mA h cm −2 , ~5 times that of the cell with the pristine electrolyte. Furthermore, the cycling stability can be significantly extended in the Li||NMC full cell of 3 mA h cm −2 , showing a capacity retention of 67% after 500 cycles at 1C. The dynamic Li metal regeneration demonstrated here could bring useful design considerations for reviving the operating cells for achieving high-energy, long-duration battery systems.",

          "abstract": "DNA repair processes modulate genotoxicity, mutagenesis, and adaption. Nucleotide excision repair removes bulky DNA damage, and in Escherichia coli , basal excision repair, carried out by UvrA, B, C, and D, with DNA PolI and DNA ligase, occurs genome-wide. In transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the Mfd protein targets template strand (TS) lesions that block RNA polymerase for accelerated repair by the basal repair enzymes. Accelerated repair is also seen with particular adducts. Notably, of the two major UV photoproducts, basal repair of (6-4) photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] is about 10× faster than repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). To better understand repair prioritization in E. coli , we used XR-seq to measure TCR of UV photoproducts genome-wide. With CPDs, we found that TCR occurred at early time points, increased with transcription level, and was Mfd dependent; later, with completion of TS repair, nontranscribed strand (NTS) repair predominated. With (6-4)PP, when analyzing all genes, TCR was not observed; in fact, among the most highly transcribed genes, slightly more repair of (6-4)PPs in the NTS was evident. Thus, the very rapid basal repair of (6-4)PP in the NTS was faster than TCR of (6-4)PPs in the TS. Overall, TCR is of limited importance in (6-4)PP repair, and TCR of CPDs is limited to the TS of more highly transcribed genes. These results are consistent with the significant role of Mfd in mutagenesis and the modest effect of mfd deletion on UV survival and bear upon the response of E. coli to bulky DNA damage.",

          "abstract": "Meta-learning enables us to learn how to learn the same or similar tasks more efficiently. Decision-making literature theorizes that a prefrontal network, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, underlies meta-learning of decision making by reinforcement learning. Recently, computationally similar meta-learning has been theorized and empirically demonstrated in motor adaptation. However, it remains unclear whether meta-learning of motor adaptation also relies on a prefrontal network. Considering hierarchical information flow from the prefrontal to motor cortices, this study explores whether meta-learning is processed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), which is situated upstream of the primary motor cortex, but downstream of the DLPFC. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to either PMd or DLPFC during a motor meta-learning task, in which human participants were trained to regulate the rate and retention of motor adaptation to maximize rewards. While motor adaptation itself was intact, TMS to PMd, but not DLPFC, attenuated meta-learning, impairing the ability to regulate motor adaptation to maximize rewards. Further analyses revealed that TMS to PMd attenuated meta-learning of memory retention. These results suggest that meta-learning of motor adaptation relies more on the premotor area than on a prefrontal network. Thus, while PMd is traditionally viewed as crucial for planning motor actions, this study suggests that PMd is also crucial for meta-learning of motor adaptation, processing goal-directed planning of how long motor memory should be retained to fit the long-term goal of motor adaptation.",

One of the principal challenges in solid tumor treatment is the physical barrier composed of a dense extracellular matrix, which prevents immune cells from penetrating the tissue to attack intratumoral cancer cells. Here, we improve immune cell infiltration into solid tumors by manipulating septin-7 functions in cells. Using protein allosteric design, we reprogram the three-dimensional structure of septin-7 and insert a blue light-responsive light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain 2 (LOV2), creating a light-controllable septin-7-LOV2 hybrid protein. Blue light inhibits septin-7 function in live cells, inducing extended cell protrusions and cell polarization, enhancing cell transmigration efficiency through confining spaces. We genetically edited human natural killer cell line (NK92) and mouse primary CD8 + T-cells expressing the engineered protein, and we demonstrated improved penetration and cytotoxicity against various tumor spheroid models. Our proposed strategy to enhance immune cell infiltration is compatible with other methodologies and therefore, could be used in combination to further improve cell-based immunotherapies against solid tumors.",

Here, we present a long-term record of CH 4 -fueled pelagic food webs across the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (~120 Mya) that serves as a geological analog to future warming. We show an exceptionally strong expansion of both methanogens and CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria (up to 87% of hopanoid-producing bacteria) during this Event. Grazing on CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria by zooplankton (up to 47% of ciliate diets) within the chemocline transferred substantial CH 4 -derived carbon to the higher trophic levels, representing an important CH 4 sink in the water column.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce PENGUIN, a principled framework for polygenic genetic confounding control based on variance component estimation. In addition, we present extensions of this approach that can estimate genetically unconfounded associations using GWAS summary statistics alone as input and between multiple generations of study samples. Through simulations, we demonstrate superior statistical properties of PENGUIN compared to the existing approaches. Applying our method to multiple population cohorts, we reveal and remove substantial genetic confounding in the associations of educational attainment with various complex traits and between parental and offspring education.

Four hundred seventeen (417) women aged 46 to 86 y residing at ≥3,500 m in Upper Mustang, Nepal, provided information on reproductive histories, sociocultural factors, physiological measurements, and DNA samples for this observational cohort study. Simultaneously assessing multiple traits identified combinations associated with lifetime reproductive success measured as the number of livebirths. Women with the most livebirths had distinctive hematological and cardiovascular traits. A hemoglobin concentration near the sample mode and a high percent of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin raised arterial oxygen concentration without risking elevated blood viscosity. We propose ongoing stabilizing selection on hemoglobin concentration because extreme values predicted fewer livebirths and directional selection favoring higher oxygen saturation because higher values had more predicted livebirths. EPAS1, an oxygen homeostasis locus with strong signals of positive natural selection and a high frequency of variants occurring only among populations indigenous to the Tibetan Plateau, associated with hemoglobin concentration. High blood flow into the lungs, wide left ventricles, and low hypoxic heart rate responses aided effective convective oxygen transport to tissues. Women with physiologies closer to unstressed, low altitude values had the highest lifetime reproductive success. This example of ethnic Tibetan women residing at high altitudes in Nepal links reproductive fitness with trait combinations increasing oxygen delivery under severe hypoxic stress and demonstrates ongoing natural selection.",

However, an understanding of how the ENSO might have evolved over geological timescales is still lacking, despite a well-accepted recognition that such an understanding has direct implications for constraining human-induced future ENSO changes. Here, using climate simulations, we show that ENSO has been a leading mode of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the past 250 My but with substantial variations in amplitude across geological periods. We show this result by performing and analyzing a series of coupled time-slice climate simulations forced by paleogeography, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and solar radiation for the past 250 My, in 10-My intervals. The variations in ENSO amplitude across geological periods are little related to mean equatorial zonal SST gradient or global mean surface temperature of the respective periods but are primarily determined by interperiod difference in the background thermocline depth, according to a linear stability analysis. In addition, variations in atmospheric noise serve as an independent contributing factor to ENSO variations across intergeological periods. The two factors together explain about 76% of the interperiod variations in ENSO amplitude over the past 250 My. Our findings support the importance of changing ocean vertical thermal structure and atmospheric noise in influencing projected future ENSO change and its uncertainty.",

To address this controversy, we first conducted a retrospective analysis of 28,796 newborns and revealed that maternal nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) exposure during the second trimester was positively associated with FGR, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.075 (95% confidence interval: 1.020-1.133) per 10 μg/m 3 NO 2 increase for small for gestational age. Then, by establishing an animal model of prenatal NO 2 exposure, we confirmed its adverse effects on embryonic growth and hematopoiesis in the yolk sac and fetal liver, primarily affecting the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and erythroid maturation. By applying internal exposure analyses coupled with 15 N isotope tracing, we found that maternal NO 2 inhalation induced acquired methemoglobinemia through its byproducts and placental hypoxia in pregnant mice. Importantly, by combining transcriptional profiling, bioinformatics analysis, and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP)/chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP), we clarified that placental-fetal hypoxia transmission activated hypoxia-inducible factors, disturbed hematopoiesis through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1β-long noncoding RNAs-CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha-proinflammatory signaling pathway, ultimately contributing to FGR progression.

          "abstract": "Biogenic isoprene emissions from herbaceous plants are generally lower than those from trees. However, our study finds widespread isoprene emission in herbaceous sedge plants, with a stronger temperature response surpassing current tree-derived models. We measured and compared isoprene emissions from sedges grown in different climatic zones, all showing an exponential temperature response with a Q10 range of 7.2 to 12, significantly higher than the Q10 of about 3 for other common isoprene emitters. The distinct temperature sensitivity of sedges makes them a hidden isoprene source, significant during heat waves but not easily detected in mild weather. For instance, isoprene emissions from Carex praegracilis can increase by 320% with a peak emission of over 100 nmol m −2 s −1 compared to preheat wave emissions. During heat waves, the peak isoprene emissions from C. praegracilis can match those from Lophostemon confertus , a commonly used street tree species which is considered the dominant urban isoprene source due to higher biomass and emission capacities. This surge in isoprene from globally distributed sedges, including those in urban landscapes, could contribute to peak ozone and aerosol pollutants during heat waves.",

          "abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR) engagement causes a global cellular response that entrains signaling pathways, cell cycle regulation, and cell death. The molecular regulation of mRNA translation in these processes is poorly understood. Using a whole-genome CRISPR screen for regulators of CD95 (FAS/APO-1)-mediated T cell death, we identified AMBRA1, a protein previously studied for its roles in autophagy, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and cyclin regulation. T cells lacking AMBRA1 resisted FAS-mediated cell death by down-regulating FAS expression at the translational level. We show that AMBRA1 is a vital regulator of ribosome protein biosynthesis and ribosome loading on select mRNAs, whereby it plays a key role in balancing TCR signaling with cell cycle regulation pathways. We also found that AMBRA1 itself is translationally controlled by TCR stimulation via the CD28–PI3K–mTORC1–EIF4F pathway. Together, these findings shed light on the molecular control of translation after T cell activation and implicate AMBRA1 as a translational regulator governing TCR signaling, cell cycle progression, and T cell death.",

          "abstract": "Atherosclerosis results from lipid-driven inflammation of the arterial wall that fails to resolve. Imbalances in macrophage accumulation and function, including diminished migratory capacity and defective efferocytosis, fuel maladaptive inflammation and plaque progression. The neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 has dichotomous roles in inflammation partly due to its multiple receptors; in atherosclerosis, netrin-1 promotes macrophage survival and retention via its receptor Unc5b. To minimize the pleiotropic effects of targeting netrin-1, we tested the therapeutic potential of deleting Unc5b in mice with advanced atherosclerosis. We generated Unc5b fl/fl Cx3cr1 creERT2/WT mice, which allowed conditional deletion of Un5b (∆ Unc5b MØ ) in monocytes and macrophages by tamoxifen injection. After inducing advanced atherosclerosis by hepatic PCSK9 overexpression and western diet feeding for 20 wk, Unc5b was deleted and hypercholesterolemia was normalized to simulate clinical lipid management. Deletion of myeloid Unc5b led to a 40% decrease in atherosclerotic plaque burden and reduced plaque complexity compared to Unc5b fl/fl Cx3cr1 WT/WT littermate controls (Ctrl MØ ). Consistently, plaque macrophage content was reduced by 50% in ∆ Unc5b MØ mice due to reduced plaque Ly6C hi monocyte recruitment and macrophage retention. Compared to Ctrl MØ mice, plaques in ∆ Unc5b MØ mice had reduced necrotic area and fewer apoptotic cells, which correlated with improved efferocytotic capacity by Unc5b -deficient macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Beneficial changes in macrophage dynamics in the plaque upon Unc5b deletion were accompanied by an increase in atheroprotective T cell populations, including T-regulatory and Th2 cells. Our data identify Unc5b in advanced atherosclerosis as a therapeutic target to induce pro-resolving restructuring of the plaque immune cells and to promote atherosclerosis regression.",

Using a well-established connectopic mapping technique on two large resting-state functional MRI datasets, we systematically quantified topographic organization of the hippocampal functional connectivity (hippocampal gradient) and its cortical interaction in developing brains. We revealed hippocampal functional hierarchy within the large-scale cortical brain systems, with the anterior hippocampus preferentially connected to an anterior temporal (AT) pathway and the posterior hippocampus embedded in a posterior medial (PM) pathway. We examined the developmental effects of the primary gradient and its whole-brain functional interaction. We observed increased functional specialization along the hippocampal long axis and found a general whole-brain connectivity shift from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus during development. Using phenotypic predictive modeling, we further delineated how the hippocampus is differentially integrated into the whole-brain cortical hierarchy underlying episodic memory and identified several key nodes within PM/AT systems. Our results highlight the importance of hippocampal gradient and its cortical interaction in development and for supporting episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is an essential behavior that supports lifelong brain health and cognition. Neuronal synapses are a major target for restorative sleep function and a locus of dysfunction in response to sleep deprivation (SD). Synapse density is highly dynamic during development, becoming stabilized with maturation to adulthood, suggesting sleep exerts distinct synaptic functions between development and adulthood. Importantly, problems with sleep are common in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, early life sleep disruption in animal models causes long-lasting changes in adult behavior. Divergent plasticity engaged during sleep necessarily implies that developing and adult synapses will show differential vulnerability to SD. To investigate distinct sleep functions and mechanisms of vulnerability to SD across development, we systematically examined the behavioral and molecular responses to acute SD between juvenile (P21 to P28), adolescent (P42 to P49), and adult (P70 to P100) mice of both sexes. Compared to adults, juveniles lack robust adaptations to SD, precipitating cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition task. Subcellular fractionation, combined with proteome and phosphoproteome analysis revealed the developing synapse is profoundly vulnerable to SD, whereas adults exhibit comparative resilience. SD in juveniles, and not older mice, aberrantly drives induction of synapse potentiation, synaptogenesis, and expression of perineuronal nets. Our analysis further reveals the developing synapse as a putative node of convergence between vulnerability to SD and ASD genetic risk. Together, our systematic analysis supports a distinct developmental function of sleep and reveals how sleep disruption impacts key aspects of brain development, providing insights for ASD susceptibility.",

Greenland ice cores provide key records of DO climate variability, but gas-calibrated estimates of the temperature change magnitudes have been limited to central and northwest Greenland. Here, we present ice-core δ 15 N-N 2 records from south (Dye 3) and coastal east Greenland (Renland) to calibrate the local water isotope thermometer and provide a Greenland-wide spatial characterization of DO event magnitude. We combine these data with existing records of δ 18 O, deuterium excess, and accumulation rates to create a multiproxy “fingerprint” of the DO impact on Greenland. Isotope-enabled climate models have skill in simulating the observational multiproxy DO event impact, and we use a series of idealized simulations with such models to identify regions of the North Atlantic that are critical in explaining DO variability. Our experiments imply that wintertime sea ice variation in the subpolar gyre, rather than the commonly invoked Nordic Seas, is both a sufficient and a necessary condition to explain the observed DO impacts in Greenland, whatever the distal cause. Moisture-tagging experiments support the idea that Greenland DO isotope signals may be explained almost entirely via changes in the vapor source distribution and that site temperature is not a main control on δ 18 O during DO transitions, contrary to the traditional interpretation. Our results provide a comprehensive, multiproxy, data-model synthesis of abrupt DO climate variability in Greenland.",

However, while schooling fish in both field and laboratory settings interact with domain boundaries, these effects are typically ignored. Here, we propose a model that incorporates geometric confinement, by accounting for both flow and wall interactions, into existing data-driven behavioral rules. We show that new collective phases emerge where the school of fish “follows the tank wall” or “double mills.” Importantly, confinement induces repeated switching between two collective states, schooling and milling. We describe the group dynamics probabilistically, uncovering bistable collective states along with unintuitive bifurcations driving phase transitions. Our findings support the hypothesis that collective transitions in fish schools could occur spontaneously, with no adjustment at the individual level, and opens venues to control and engineer emergent collective patterns in biological and synthetic systems that operate far from equilibrium.",

Through careful examination of inelastic neutron scattering powder spectra, we propose a modified Kitaev model to accurately describe the twisted chains of edge-sharing octahedra surrounding Co 2 + ions. The extended Kitaev–Heisenberg model, including a significant anisotropic bond-dependent exchange term with K / | J | = 0.96 , is identified as the key descriptor of the magnetic interactions in SrCoGe 2 O 6 . Furthermore, our heat capacity measurements reveal an effect of an external magnetic field (approximately 13 T) which shifts the system from a fragile antiferromagnetic ordering with T N = 9 K to a field-induced state. We argue that pyroxenes, particularly those modified by substituting Ge with Si and its less extended p orbitals, emerge as a platform for the Kitaev model. This opens up possibilities for advancing our understanding of Kitaev physics.",

The mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) has been shown to promote GSIS and β-cell proliferation in the clonal β-cell lines, yet its physiological relevance remains unknown. Here, we provide animal and human data showing a role of PC in protecting β-cells against senescence and maintaining GSIS under different physiological and pathological conditions. β-cell-specific deletion of PC impaired GSIS and induced β-cell senescence in the mouse models under either a standard chow diet or prolonged high-fat diet feeding. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that p53-related senescence and cell cycle arrest are activated in PC-deficient islets. Overexpression of PC inhibited hyperglycemia- and aging-induced p53-related senescence in human and mouse islets as well as INS-1E β-cells, whereas knockdown of PC provoked senescence. Mechanistically, PC interacted with MDM2 to prevent its degradation via the MDM2 binding motif, which in turn restricts the p53-dependent senescent program in β-cells. On the contrary, the regulatory effects of PC on GSIS and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) anaplerotic flux are p53-independent. We illuminate a function of PC in controlling β-cell senescence through the MDM2–p53 axis.",

          "abstract": "Fast, nondestructive three-dimensional (3D) imaging of live suspension cells remains challenging without substrate treatment or fixation, precluding scalable single-cell morphometry with minimal alterations. While optical sectioning techniques achieve 3D live cell imaging, lateral versus depth resolution differences further complicate analysis. We present a scalable microfluidic method capable of 3D fluorescent isotropic imaging of live, nonadherent cells suspended inside picoliter droplets with high-speed single-cell volumetric readout (800 to 1,200 slices in 5 to 8 s) and near-diffraction limit resolution (~216 nm). The platform features a droplet trap array that leverages flow-induced droplet interfacial shear to generate intradroplet microvortices, which rotate single cells on their axis to enable optical projection tomography (OPT)-based imaging. This allows gentle (~1 mPa shear stress) observation of cells encapsulated inside nontoxic isotonic buffer droplets, facilitating scalable OPT acquisition by simultaneous spinning of hundreds of cells. We demonstrate 3D imaging of live myeloid and lymphoid cells in suspension, including K562 cells, as well as naive and activated T cells—small cells prone to movement in their suspended phenotype. Our fully suspended, orientation-independent cell morphometry, driven by isotropic imaging and spherical harmonic analysis, enabled the study of primary T cells across various immunological activation states. This approach unveiled six distinct nuclear content distributions, contrasting with conventional 2D images that typically portray spheroid and bean-like nuclear shapes associated with lymphocytes. Our arrayed-droplet OPT technology is capable of isotropic, single live-cell 3D imaging, with the potential to perform large-scale morphometry of immune cell effector function states while providing compatibility with microfluidic droplet operations.",

          "abstract": "Guanine-rich DNA forms G-quadruplexes (G4s) that play a critical role in essential cellular processes. Previous studies have mostly focused on intramolecular G4s composed of four consecutive guanine tracts (G-tracts) from a single strand. However, this structural form has not been strictly confirmed in the genome of living eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the formation of hybrid G4s (hG4s), consisting of G-tracts from both DNA and RNA, in the genome of living yeast cells. Analysis of Okazaki fragment syntheses and two other independent G4-specific detections reveal that hG4s can efficiently form with as few as a single DNA guanine–guanine (GG) tract due to the participation of G-tracts from RNA. This finding increases the number of potential G4-forming sites in the yeast genome from 38 to 587,694, a more than 15,000-fold increase. Interestingly, hG4s readily form and even dominate at G4 sites that are theoretically capable of forming the intramolecular DNA G4s (dG4s) by themselves. Compared to dG4s, hG4s exhibit broader kinetics, higher prevalence, and greater structural diversity and stability. Most importantly, hG4 formation is tightly coupled to transcription through the involvement of RNA, allowing it to function in a transcription-dependent manner. Overall, our study establishes hG4s as the overwhelmingly dominant G4 species in the yeast genome and emphasizes a renewal of the current perception of the structural form, formation mechanism, prevalence, and functional role of G4s in eukaryotic genomes. It also establishes a sensitive and currently the only method for detecting the structural form of G4s in living cells.",

Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of EfpA complexed with lipids or the inhibitor BRD-8000.3 at resolutions of 2.9 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively. Unexpectedly, EfpA forms an antiparallel dimer. Functional studies reveal that EfpA is a lipid transporter and BRD-8000.3 inhibits its lipid transport activity. Intriguingly, the mutation V319F, known to confer resistance to BRD-8000.3, alters the expression level and oligomeric state of EfpA. Based on our results and the observation of other antiparallel dimers in the MFS family, we propose an antiparallel-function model of EfpA.

          "abstract": "How do people around the world define democracy? Answering this question is critical as countries face democratic backsliding and authoritarian governments promote alternative notions of democracy. Indeed, some scholars argue that people from different backgrounds understand democracy differently. By contrast, we discovered very consistent views about what constitutes a “democratic” country from conjoint survey experiments conducted in Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Thailand, and the United States. Across countries ( N = 6150) and diverse subgroups within countries, people similarly emphasized free and fair elections and civil liberties as being the key determinants of democracy. Countries that produce desirable social and economic outcomes are also considered more democratic, but these and other factors exert a smaller and less consistent effect than elections and civil liberties.",

We found that OH − donated ~8% more negative charge to the H-bond network of water and H 3 O + accepted ~4% less negative charge from the H-bond network of water. D 2 O had ~9% more H-bonds compared to H 2 O, and acidic solutions displayed more dominant NQEs than basic ones.",

          "abstract": "Rapid adaptation is thought to be critical for the survival of species under global change, but our understanding of human-induced evolution in the wild remains limited. We show that widespread deforestation has underpinned repeated color shifts in wild insect populations. Specifically, loss of forest has led to color changes across lineages that mimic the warning coloration of a toxic forest stonefly. Predation experiments suggest that the relative fitness of color phenotypes varies between forested and deforested habitats. Genomic and coloration analyses of 1200 specimens show repeated selection at the ebony locus controlling color polymorphism across lineages. These findings represent an example of human-driven evolution linked to altered species interactions, highlighting the possibility for populations to adapt rapidly in the wake of sudden environmental change.",

We developed a solvent affinity–induced assembly method that incorporates water-insoluble polymer semiconductors into double-network hydrogels. These semiconductors exhibited tissue-level moduli as soft as 81 kilopascals, stretchability of 150% strain, and charge-carrier mobility up to 1.4 square centimeters per volt per second. When they are interfaced with biological tissues, their tissue-level modulus enables alleviated immune reactions.

This delineation revealed that rapidly increasing forest fire emissions in extratropical pyromes, linked to climate change, offset declining emissions in tropical pyromes during 2001 to 2023. Annual emissions tripled in one extratropical pyrome due to increases in fire-favorable weather, compounded by increased forest cover and productivity.

Low expression, interspecies differences, and the existence of multiple EEC subtypes have posed challenges to the study of these sensors.

After close predator-prey contact is established, cryo–electron tomography and functional assays showed that puncturing by a type VI secretion system mediated killing. Single-cell analyses with stable isotope–labeled prey revealed that prey components are taken up by the attacker. Depending on nutrient availability, insertion sequence elements toggle the activity of ixotrophy. A marine metagenomic time series shows coupled dynamics of ixotrophic bacteria and prey. We found that the mechanism of ixotrophy involves multiple cellular machineries, is conserved, and may shape microbial populations in the environment.",

          "abstract": "Subjective well-being (SWB) is often described as being U-shaped over adulthood, declining to a midlife slump and then improving thereafter. Improved SWB in later adulthood has been considered a paradox given age-related declines in health and social losses. While SWB has mostly been studied in high-income countries, it remains largely unexplored in rural subsistence populations lacking formal institutions that reliably promote social welfare. Here, we evaluate the age profile of SWB among three small-scale subsistence societies ( n = 468; study 1), forest users from 23 low-income countries ( n = 6987; study 2), and Tsimane’ horticulturalists ( n = 1872; study 3). Across multiple specifications, we find variability in SWB age profiles. In some cases, we find no age-related differences in SWB or even inverted U-shapes. Adjusting for confounders reduces observed age effects. Our findings highlight variability in average well-being trajectories over the life course. Ensuring successful aging will require a greater focus on cultural and socioecological determinants of individual trajectories.",

          "abstract": "While it is often argued that continuous exposure to social feedback is specifically challenging for the hypersensitive developing brain, empirical evidence is lacking. Across three studies, we reveal the developmental differences and computational mechanisms that underlie the social media engagement and feedback processing of adolescents and adults. First, using a reinforcement learning model on a large Instagram trace dataset ( N = 16,613, 1.6+ million posts), we show that adolescents are more sensitive to social feedback than adults. Second, in an experimental study ( N = 194), we show that adolescents’ mood is affected more strongly by a reduction in likes than adults. Last, in a neuroimaging study ( N = 96), we show that social media feedback sensitivity is related to individual differences in subcortical-limbic brain volumes of emerging adults. Together, these findings highlight the need for digital competence programs to help youth manage the constant feedback they encounter on social media platforms.",

          "abstract": "Chiral structures and functions are essential natural components in biominerals and biological crystals. Chiral molecules direct inorganics through chiral growth of facets or screw dislocation of crystal clusters. As chirality promoters, they initiate an asymmetric hierarchical self-assembly in a quasi-thermodynamic steady state. However, achieving chiral assembly requires a delicate balance between intricate interactions. This complexity causes the roles of achiral-chiral and inorganic components in crystallization to remain ambiguous. Here, we elucidate a definitive mechanism using an achiral-chiral ligand strategy to assemble inorganics into hierarchical, self-organized superstructures. Achiral ligands cluster inorganic building blocks, while chiral ligands impart chiral rotation. Achiral and chiral ligands can flexibly modulate the chirality of superstructures by fully using their competition in coordination chemistry. This dual-ligand strategy offers a versatile framework for engineering chiroptical nanomaterials tailored to optical devices and metamaterials with optical activities across a broad wavelength range, with applications in imaging, detection, catalysis, and sensing.",

          "abstract": "Cartilage regeneration relies on adequate and continuous bioenergy supply to facilitate cellular differentiation and extracellular matrix synthesis. Chondrocytes frequently undergo energy stress under pathological conditions, characterized by disrupted cellular metabolism and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. However, there has limited progress in modulating energy metabolism for cartilage regeneration thus far. Here, we developed bioenergetic-active exosomes (Suc-EXO) to promote cartilage regeneration and homeostasis maintenance. Suc-EXO exhibited a 5.42-fold increase in ATP content, enabling the manipulation of cellular energy metabolism by fueling the TCA cycle. With continuous energy supply, Suc-EXO promoted BMSC chondrogenic differentiation via the P2X7-mediated PI3K-AKT pathway. Moreover, Suc-EXO improved chondrocyte anabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis via the P2X7-mediated SIRT3 pathway. In a rabbit cartilage defect model, the Suc-EXO–encapsulated hydrogel notably promoted cartilage regeneration and maintained neocartilage homeostasis, leading to 2.26 and 1.53 times increase in Col2 and ACAN abundance, respectively. These findings make a remarkable breakthrough in modulating energy metabolism for cartilage regeneration, offering immense potential for clinical translation.",

The inevitable sweating issue in all wearables creates a bottleneck for wearable haptics, as the sweat/moisture accumulated in the skin/device interface can substantially affect feedback accuracy, comfortability, and create hygienic problems. Nowadays, wearable haptics typically gain performance at the cost of sacrificing the breathability, comfort, and biocompatibility. Here, we developed a fully integrated breathable haptic textile (FIBHT) to solve these trade-off issues, where the FIBHT exhibits high-level integration of 128 pixels over the palm, great stretchability of 400%, and superior permeability of over 657 g/m 2 /day (moisture) and 40 mm/s (air). It is a stand-alone haptic system totally composed of stretchable, breathable, and bioadhesive materials, which empowers it with precise, sweating/movement-insensitive and dynamic feedback, and makes FIBHT powerful for virtual touching in broad scenarios.",

          "abstract": "It is demonstrated that the time evolution of the electron-nuclear polarization transfer process during pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can be reversed on a microsecond timescale, leading to the observation of DNP echoes. The DNP echoes are induced by consecutive application of two pulse trains that produce effective Hamiltonians that differ only in the sign of the effective hyperfine coupling. The experiments have been performed on a frozen solution of trityl radicals in water/glycerol on a homebuilt X-band electron paramagnetic resonance/DNP spectrometer at 80 kelvins. We envisage that DNP echoes will play an important role in future development of pulsed DNP for sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance, hyperfine spectroscopy, and quantum sensing.",

          "abstract": "Nonuniform local translation speed dictates diverse protein biogenesis outcomes. To unify known and uncover unknown principles governing eukaryotic elongation rate, we developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze RiboSeq datasets. We find that the chemical nature of the incoming amino acid determines how codon optimality influences elongation rate, with hydrophobic residues more dependent on transfer RNA (tRNA) levels than charged residues. Unexpectedly, we find that wobble interactions exert a widespread effect on elongation pausing, with wobble-mediated decoding being slower than Watson-Crick decoding, irrespective of tRNA levels. Applying our ribosome pausing principles to ribosome collisions reveals that disomes arise upon apposition of fast-decoding and slow-decoding signatures. We conclude that codon choice and tRNA pools are evolutionarily constrained to harmonize elongation rate with cotranslational folding while minimizing wobble pairing and deleterious stalling.",

          "abstract": "Optical imaging is a powerful tool for early disease detection and effective treatment planning, but its accuracy is often compromised by the uptake of imaging materials by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Herein, we leverage multivalent host-guest interactions between cyanine dyes and β-cyclodextrin polymers to develop supramolecular probes with enhanced stability, optical, and transport profiles for accurate in vivo imaging. These multivalent interactions not only ensure the stability of the probes but also enhance fluorescence efficiency by minimizing nonradiative decay. Our self-assembly approach effectively modulates probe size and surface properties, enabling evasion of MPS clearance and promoting prolonged bloodstream circulation, thereby improving the signal-to-background ratio for imaging. The effectiveness of our design is demonstrated by substantial advancements in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury and by providing high-contrast imaging and precise surgical navigation across various tumor models. Our strategy not only advances optical imaging materials toward clinical translation but also establishes a versatile platform applicable to multiple imaging modalities.",

This phenomenon is relatively well understood for inorganic materials but much less so for organic semiconductors (OSs). These materials present a challenge because the strong thermal fluctuations of electronic coupling between the molecules result in partially delocalized charge carriers that cannot be treated with traditional theories for thermoelectricity. Here, we develop a quantum dynamical simulation approach revealing in atomistic detail how the charge carrier wave function moves along a temperature gradient in an organic molecular crystal. We find that the wave function propagates from hot to cold in agreement with the experiment, and we obtain a Seebeck coefficient in good agreement with experimental measurements that are also reported in this work. Detailed analysis reveals that gradients in thermal electronic disorder play an important role in determining the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, opening unexplored avenues for the design of OSs with improved Seebeck coefficients.",

Here, we report the development of a chemoproteomic platform, single-cell activity-dependent proximity ligation, which uses automated, microfluidics-based single-cell capture and nanoliter volume manipulations to convert the interactions of family-wide chemical activity probes with native protein targets into multiplexed, amplifiable oligonucleotide barcodes. We demonstrate accurate, reproducible, and multiplexed quantitation of a six-enzyme (Ag-6) panel with known ties to cancer cell aggressiveness directly in single cells.

Micro- and nanoscale alignment of conductive pathways is achieved by in-plane thermal compression of a mat composed of co-electrospun Nafion and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers stabilizing the alignment. This translates to pronounced TP-enhanced proton conductivity, twice that of pure Nafion at high humidity, 13 times larger at low humidity, and 10 times larger water diffusivity. This remarkable improvement is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that stronger nanochannels alignment upon dehydration compensates for reduced water content.

Here, we report the observation of quantum superposition of topological defects in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. By engineering long-range spin-spin interactions, we observe a spin kink splitting into a superposition of kinks at different positions, creating a “Schrodinger kink” that manifests nonlocality and quantum interference.

Extensive chemical and enzymatic treatments can liberate fermentable carbohydrates from plant biomass, but microbial routes offer many advantages, including concomitant conversion to industrial chemicals. Here, testing of lignin content of nonpretreated biomass using the cellulolytic thermophilic bacterium, Anaerocellum bescii , revealed that the primary microbial degradation barrier relates to methoxy substitutions in lignin. This contrasts with optimal lignin composition for chemical pretreatment that favors high S/G ratio and low H lignin. Genetically modified poplar trees with diverse lignin compositions confirm these findings. In addition, poplar trees with low methoxy content achieve industrially relevant levels of microbial solubilization without any pretreatments and with no impact on tree fitness in greenhouse.",

The reorganization of activity is so profound that decoding of sound representation under anesthesia is not possible based on awake activity. However, population-level parameters, such as average tuning strength and population decoding accuracy, are weakly affected by anesthesia, explaining why its effect has previously gone unnoticed when comparing independently sampled neurons. Together, our results indicate that the functional organization of the auditory brainstem largely depends on the network state and is ill-defined under anesthesia. This demonstrates a remarkable sensitivity of an early sensory stage to anesthesia, which is bound to disrupt downstream processing.",

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of MBV on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in vitro and particulate-induced osteolysis in vivo. Results showed that MBV attenuated osteoclast differentiation and activity by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway and downstream NFATc1, DC-STAMP, c-Src, and cathepsin K expression.

This result is unexpected because GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events.

We show that direct contact with profibrotic but not proinflammatory macrophages triggers acute fibroblast contractions. The contractile response depends on αvβ3 integrin expression on macrophages and Piezo1 expression on fibroblasts. The touch of macrophages elevates fibroblast cytosolic calcium within seconds, followed by translocation of the transcription cofactors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and Yes-associated protein, which drive fibroblast activation within hours. Intriguingly, macrophages induce mechanical stress in fibroblasts on soft matrix that alone suppresses their spontaneous activation.

Here, we propose an alternative approach to solve the electronic structure problem using VQE with a single qudit. Our approach exploits a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum state of a heralded single photon and notably reduces the required quantum resources compared to conventional multi-qubit–based VQE. We experimentally demonstrate that our single-qudit–based VQE can efficiently estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecular systems corresponding to two- and four-qubit systems, respectively. We believe that our scheme opens a pathway to perform a large-scale quantum simulation for solving more complex problems in quantum chemistry and material science.",

          "abstract": "Human brains grasp the gists of visual scenes from a single glance, but to what extent is this possible for language? While we typically think of language in terms of sequential speech, our everyday experience involves numerous rapidly flashing written notifications, which we understand instantly. What do our brains detect in the first few hundred milliseconds after seeing such a stimulus? We flashed short sentences during magnetoencephalography measurement, revealing sentence-sensitive neural activity in left temporal cortex within 130 milliseconds. These signals emerged for subject-verb-object sentences regardless of grammatical or semantic well-formedness, suggesting that at-a-glance language comprehension begins by detecting basic phrase structure, independent of meaning or other grammatical details. Our findings unveil one aspect of how our brains process information rapidly in today’s visually saturated world.",

At overdose levels, opioid-induced respiratory depression becomes fatal without the administration of naloxone within minutes. Currently, overdose survival relies on bystander intervention, requiring a nearby person to find the overdosed individual and have immediate access to naloxone to administer. To circumvent the bystander requirement, we developed the Naloximeter: a class of life-saving implantable devices that autonomously detect and treat overdose while simultaneously contacting first responders. We present three Naloximeter platforms, for fundamental research and clinical translation, all equipped with optical sensors, drug delivery mechanisms, and a supporting ecosystem of technology to counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression. In small and large animal studies, the Naloximeter rescues from otherwise fatal opioid overdose within minutes.

Because of eigenstate broadening on solid substrates, resolving low-frequency vibronic states demands strong decoupling. This work designs a type II band alignment in STM junction to achieve effective charge-transfer state decoupling. This strategy enables the successful identification of the lowest-frequency H g (ω 1 ) (Raman-active H g mode) vibronic excitation within single C 60 molecules, which, despite being notably pronounced in electron transport of C 60 single-molecule transistors, has remained hidden at submolecular level. Our results show that the observed H g (ω 1 ) excitation is “anchored” to all molecules, irrespective of local geometry, challenging common understanding of structural definition of vibronic excitation governed by Franck-Condon principle. Density functional theory calculations reveal existence of molecule-substrate interfacial charge-transfer dipole, which, although overlooked previously, drives the dominant H g (ω 1 ) excitation. This charge-transfer dipole is not specific but must be general at interfaces, influencing vibronic coupling in charge transport.",

This heterogeneous behavior is initiated by a passive mechanism: stochastic activation of a master transcriptional regulator. Here, we identify a cell-cell communication pathway containing the proteins ShfA (YabQ) and ShfP (YvnB) that actively promotes phenotypic heterogeneity, wherein Bacillus subtilis cells that start sporulating early use a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase to release glycerol, which simultaneously acts as a signaling molecule and a nutrient to delay nonsporulating cells from entering sporulation. This produced a more diverse population that was better poised to exploit a sudden influx of nutrients compared to those generating heterogeneity via stochastic gene expression alone. Although conflict systems are prevalent among microbes, genetically encoded cooperative behavior in unicellular organisms can evidently also boost inclusive fitness.",

          "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is an abundant nuclear protein involved in DNA repair, chromatin structure, and transcription. However, the regulation of its different functions remains poorly understood. Here, we report the role of PARP1 acetylation status in modulating its DNA repair and transactivation functions. We demonstrate that histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) determines PARP1 acetylation at Lys498 and Lys521 sites. HDAC5-mediated deacetylation at Lys498 site regulates PARP1 DNA damage response and facilitates efficient recruitment of DNA repair factors at damaged sites, thereby promoting cell survival. Additionally, HDAC5-mediated deacetylation at Lys521 site promotes PARP1 coactivator function, resulting in induction of proliferative and metabolic genes in an activating transcription factor 4-dependent manner. Thus, PARP1 induces metabolic adaptation to spur malignant phenotype. Our studies in mouse tumor models suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity does not block tumor progression robustly as transactivation function remains unperturbed. These findings provide key mechanistic insights into PARP1 regulation and expand its role in tumor development.",

Here, we developed a strategy that limits the atomic diffusion within surface layers, fostering the phase transition and shape retention during thermal treatment. This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells. Density functional calculations suggest that the ordered intermetallic surface stabilizes morphology against rapid corrosion and improves the ORR activity.

Here, we set out to determine whether FGF21 has a major impact on Kupffer cells’ (KCs) ability during MASH-HCC transition. We found aberrant hepatic FGF21 and KC pool in human MASH-HCC. Lack of FGF21 up-regulated ALOX15, which converted the oxidized fatty acids to induce excessive KC death and mobilization of monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) for KC replacement. Lack of FGF21 oversupplied free fatty acids for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) cascade synthesis to mediate MASH-HCC transition via S1P-YAP signaling and cross-talk between tumor cells and macrophages. In conclusion, lack of FGF21 accelerated MASH-HCC transition via the S1P-AP signaling.

The qubit basis states correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two vortex states. By engineering the potential, we tune the coupling and coherent oscillations between the two circulating current states, control the energies of the qubit basis states, and initialize the qubit in the desired state.

While the progenitors are homogeneous at the time of transplantation, they give rise to heterogeneous grafts composed not only of therapeutic DA neurons but also of other mature cell types. The mechanisms for graft diversification are unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to profile DA progenitors before transplantation combined with molecular barcode-based tracing to determine origin and shared lineages of the mature cell types in the grafts.

By developing a machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture the deformation features of hexagonal indium selenide upon out-of-plane compression.

          "abstract": "Ex vivo or in vivo cell-hitchhiking has emerged as a potential means for efficient drug delivery and various disease therapies. However, many challenges remain, such as the complicated engineering process and dependence on ligand-receptor interaction. Here, we present a simple in vivo platelet-hitchhiking strategy based on self-assembling peptides without ligand modification. The engineered peptide nanofibers can hitchhike ultrafast (&lt;5 s) and efficiently on both resting and activated platelets in a receptor-independent and species-independent manner. Mechanistic studies showed that unique secondary structure of nanofibers, which lead to surface exposure of hydrophobic and hydrogen bond–forming groups, might primarily contribute to the selective and efficient platelet-hitchhiking behavior. After intravenous injection, these peptide nanofibers hitchhiked in situ on circulating platelets and achieved almost 20-fold lung accumulation. Our study provides not only a different paradigm of in vivo platelet-hitchhiking beyond ligand-receptor recognition but also a potential strategy for lung-targeted drug delivery and pulmonary disease therapy.",

          "abstract": "Under what conditions has corporatist policymaking become institutionalized in newly transitioned democracies? I argue that transitions have provided temporary opportunities for unions to push for laws they can later use to protect their place in economic councils. The relevant sets of legal rules, which I call compulsory deliberation, enable non-‘State official’ members to resist governmental disruption of such councils despite them composing the Executive’s structure. I compare South Africa and Brazil, two ‘most similar’ cases that featured sequences of chronically unstable labor-excluding councils under authoritarian regimes. I argue that the former broke out of this trajectory while the latter did not because South African unions developed aspirations for durable policy influence before the transition, whereas Brazilian ones only did so afterward and thus mobilized too late. Although Brazilian governments have enacted dozens of regulations covering as many councils, these have only served as short-term instruments for marketing policies.",
