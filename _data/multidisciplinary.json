          "abstract": "The quantum-mechanical nuclear-shell structure determines the stability and limits of the existence of the heaviest nuclides with large proton numbers Z ≳ 100 (refs. 1–3 ). Shell effects also affect the sizes and shapes of atomic nuclei, as shown by laser spectroscopy studies in lighter nuclides 4 . However, experimental information on the charge radii and the nuclear moments of the heavy actinide elements, which link the heaviest naturally abundant nuclides with artificially produced superheavy elements, is sparse 5 . Here we present laser spectroscopy measurements along the fermium ( Z = 100) isotopic chain and an extension of data in the nobelium isotopic chain ( Z = 102) across a key region. Multiple production schemes and different advanced techniques were applied to determine the isotope shifts in atomic transitions, from which changes in the nuclear mean-square charge radii were extracted. A range of nuclear models based on energy density functionals reproduce well the observed smooth evolution of the nuclear size. Both the remarkable consistency of model prediction and the similarity of predictions for different isotopes suggest a transition to a regime in which shell effects have a diminished effect on the size compared with lighter nuclei.",

          "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the tumour suppressor APC are an initial step in intestinal tumorigenesis 1,2 . APC -mutant intestinal stem cells outcompete their wild-type neighbours through the secretion of Wnt antagonists, which accelerates the fixation and subsequent rapid clonal expansion of mutants 3–5 . Reports of polyclonal intestinal tumours in human patients and mouse models appear at odds with this process 6,7 . Here we combine multicolour lineage tracing with chemical mutagenesis in mice to show that a large proportion of intestinal tumours have a multiancestral origin. Polyclonal tumours retain a structure comprising subclones with distinct Apc mutations and transcriptional states, driven predominantly by differences in KRAS and MYC signalling. These pathway-level changes are accompanied by profound differences in cancer stem cell phenotypes. Of note, these findings are confirmed by introducing an oncogenic Kras mutation that results in predominantly monoclonal tumour formation. Further, polyclonal tumours have accelerated growth dynamics, suggesting a link between polyclonality and tumour progression. Together, these findings demonstrate the role of interclonal interactions in promoting tumorigenesis through non-cell autonomous pathways that are dependent on the differential activation of oncogenic pathways between clones.",

          "abstract": "The Caucasus and surrounding areas, with their rich metal resources, became a crucible of the Bronze Age 1 and the birthplace of the earliest steppe pastoralist societies 2 . Yet, despite this region having a large influence on the subsequent development of Europe and Asia, questions remain regarding its hunter-gatherer past and its formation of expansionist mobile steppe societies 3–5 . Here we present new genome-wide data for 131 individuals from 38 archaeological sites spanning 6,000 years. We find a strong genetic differentiation between populations north and south of the Caucasus mountains during the Mesolithic, with Eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry 4,6 in the north, and a distinct Caucasus hunter-gatherer ancestry 7 with increasing East Anatolian farmer admixture in the south. During the subsequent Eneolithic period, we observe the formation of the characteristic West Eurasian steppe ancestry and heightened interaction between the mountain and steppe regions, facilitated by technological developments of the Maykop cultural complex 8 . By contrast, the peak of pastoralist activities and territorial expansions during the Early and Middle Bronze Age is characterized by long-term genetic stability. The Late Bronze Age marks another period of gene flow from multiple distinct sources that coincides with a decline of steppe cultures, followed by a transformation and absorption of the steppe ancestry into highland populations.",

          "abstract": "Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) replaces the stem cells responsible for blood production with those from a donor 1,2 . Here, to quantify dynamics of long-term stem cell engraftment, we sequenced genomes from 2,824 single-cell-derived haematopoietic colonies of ten donor–recipient pairs taken 9–31 years after HLA-matched sibling HCT 3 . With younger donors (18–47 years at transplant), 5,000–30,000 stem cells had engrafted and were still contributing to haematopoiesis at the time of sampling; estimates were tenfold lower with older donors (50–66 years). Engrafted cells made multilineage contributions to myeloid, B lymphoid and T lymphoid populations, although individual clones often showed biases towards one or other mature cell type. Recipients had lower clonal diversity than matched donors, equivalent to around 10–15 years of additional ageing, arising from up to 25-fold greater expansion of stem cell clones. A transplant-related population bottleneck could not explain these differences; instead, phylogenetic trees evinced two distinct modes of HCT-specific selection. In pruning selection, cell divisions underpinning recipient-enriched clonal expansions had occurred in the donor, preceding transplant—their selective advantage derived from preferential mobilization, collection, survival ex vivo or initial homing. In growth selection, cell divisions underpinning clonal expansion occurred in the recipient’s marrow after engraftment, most pronounced in clones with multiple driver mutations. Uprooting stem cells from their native environment and transplanting them to foreign soil exaggerates selective pressures, distorting and accelerating the loss of clonal diversity compared to the unperturbed haematopoiesis of donors.",

          "abstract": "The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is at present the largest single contributor to global-mass-induced sea-level rise, primarily because of Arctic amplification on an increasingly warmer Earth 1–5 . However, the processes of englacial water accumulation, storage and ultimate release remain poorly constrained. Here we show that a noticeable amount of the summertime meltwater mass is temporally buffered along the entire GrIS periphery, peaking in July and gradually reducing thereafter. Our results arise from quantifying the spatiotemporal behaviour of the total mass of water leaving the GrIS by analysing bedrock elastic deformation measured by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations. The buffered meltwater causes a subsidence of the bedrock close to GNSS stations of at most approximately 5 mm during the melt season. Regionally, the duration of meltwater storage ranges from 4.5 weeks in the southeast to 9 weeks elsewhere. We also show that the meltwater runoff modelled from regional climate models may contain systematic errors, requiring further scaling of up to about 20% for the warmest years. These results reveal a high potential for GNSS data to constrain poorly known hydrological processes in Greenland, forming the basis for improved projections of future GrIS melt behaviour and the associated sea-level rise 6 .",

          "abstract": "Leptin is an adipose tissue hormone that maintains homeostatic control of adipose tissue mass by regulating the activity of specific neural populations controlling appetite and metabolism 1 . Leptin regulates food intake by inhibiting orexigenic agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons and activating anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons 2 . However, whereas AGRP neurons regulate food intake on a rapid time scale, acute activation of POMC neurons has only a minimal effect 3–5 . This has raised the possibility that there is a heretofore unidentified leptin-regulated neural population that rapidly suppresses appetite. Here we report the discovery of a new population of leptin-target neurons expressing basonuclin 2 ( Bnc2 ) in the arcuate nucleus that acutely suppress appetite by directly inhibiting AGRP neurons. Opposite to the effect of AGRP activation, BNC2 neuronal activation elicited a place preference indicative of positive valence in hungry but not fed mice. The activity of BNC2 neurons is modulated by leptin, sensory food cues and nutritional status. Finally, deleting leptin receptors in BNC2 neurons caused marked hyperphagia and obesity, similar to that observed in a leptin receptor knockout in AGRP neurons. These data indicate that BNC2-expressing neurons are a key component of the neural circuit that maintains energy balance, thus filling an important gap in our understanding of the regulation of food intake and leptin action.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to augment humans, researchers have studied human–AI systems involving different tasks, systems and populations. Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and AI are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human–AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human–AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges’ g = −0.23; 95% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human–AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human–AI systems.",

          "abstract": "People often rely on numeric metrics to make decisions and form judgments. Numbers can be difficult to process, leading to their underutilization, but they are also uniquely suited to making comparisons. Do people decide differently when some dimensions of a choice are quantified and others are not? We explore this question across 21 preregistered experiments (8 in the main text, N = 9,303; 13 in supplement, N = 13,936) involving managerial, policy, and consumer decisions. Participants face choices that involve tradeoffs (e.g., choosing between employees, one of whom has a higher likelihood of advancement but lower likelihood of retention), and we randomize which dimension of each tradeoff is presented numerically and which is presented qualitatively (using verbal estimates, discrete visualizations, or continuous visualizations). We show that people systematically shift their preferences toward options that dominate on tradeoff dimensions conveyed numerically—a pattern we dub “quantification fixation.” Further, we show that quantification fixation has financial consequences—it emerges in incentive-compatible hiring tasks and in charitable donation decisions. We identify one key mechanism that underlies quantification fixation and moderates its strength: When making comparative judgments, which are essential to tradeoff decisions, numeric information is more fluent than non-numeric information. Our findings suggest that when we count, we change what counts.",

          "abstract": "To understand human learning and progress, it is crucial to understand curiosity. But how consistent is curiosity’s conception and assessment across scientific research disciplines? We present the results of a large collaborative project assessing the correspondence between curiosity measures in personality psychology and cognitive science. A total of 820 participants completed 15 personality trait measures and 9 cognitive tasks that tested multiple aspects of information demand. We show that shared variance across the cognitive tasks was captured by a dimension reflecting directed (uncertainty-driven) versus random (stochasticity-driven) exploration and individual differences along this axis were significantly and consistently predicted by personality traits. However, the personality metrics that best predicted information demand were not the central curiosity traits of openness to experience, deprivation sensitivity, and joyous exploration, but instead included more peripheral curiosity traits (need for cognition, thrill seeking, and stress tolerance) and measures not traditionally associated with curiosity (extraversion and behavioral inhibition). The results suggest that the umbrella term “curiosity” reflects a constellation of cognitive and emotional processes, only some of which are shared between personality measures and cognitive tasks. The results reflect the distinct methods that are used in these fields, indicating a need for caution in comparing results across fields and for future interdisciplinary collaborations to strengthen our emerging understanding of curiosity.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, economic activity has become increasingly concentrated in major global metropolises. Yet, the rise of working from home threatens this dominance of cities. Using multiple high-frequency datasets on spending, commuting, migration, and housing, we provide global evidence that remote work has dispersed economic activity away from city centers. We label this the “Donut Effect,” which is much larger and more persistent in cities with high levels of remote work. Using detailed household microdata from the United States, we show that three-fifths of households that left city centers in big cities moved to the suburbs of the same city. This is likely explained by the rise of hybrid work, in which employees still commute to the office a few days a week. The enduring popularity of hybrid work into 2024 suggests that the Donut Effect will persist while also leaving broader metropolitan areas intact.",

For instance, the expressive signals that causally modulate the emergence of romantic attraction during interactions remain unknown. To disentangle causality in the wealth of covarying factors that govern social interactions, we developed an open-source video-conference platform enabling researchers to covertly manipulate the social signals produced by participants during interactions. Using this platform, we performed a speed-dating experiment where we aligned or misaligned the facial smiles of participants in real time with face transformation algorithms. Even though participants remained totally unaware that their faces were being manipulated, aligning their smiles causally enhanced the romantic attraction they felt toward each other, compared to unaligned scenarios. Manipulations also influenced how participants synchronized and vocally reacted to each other. This paradigm causally manipulates the emergence of romantic attraction in free social interactions. Moreover, our methodology opens the possibility to perform causal inferences during free social interactions.",

          "abstract": "Do political practitioners have good intuitions about how to persuade the public? Longstanding theories that political elites’ messages have large effects on public opinion and the large sums spent to secure some practitioners’ messaging advice suggest they should. However, findings regarding the surprising limits of expert forecasts in other domains suggest they may not. In this paper, we evaluate how well political practitioners can predict which messages are most persuasive. We measured the effects of N = 172 messages about 21 political issues using a large-sample survey experiment ( N = 67 , 215 respondent-message observations). We then asked both political practitioners ( N = 1 , 524 practitioners, N = 22 , 763 predictions) and laypeople ( N = 21 , 247 respondents, N = 63 , 442 predictions) to predict the efficacy of these messages. The practitioners we surveyed ranged widely in their experience and expertise with persuasive message design. We find that: (a) political practitioners and laypeople both performed barely better than chance at predicting persuasive effects; (b) once accounting for laypeople’s inflated expectations about the average size of effects, practitioners did not predict meaningfully better than laypeople; (c) these results held even for self-identified issue experts and highly experienced practitioners; and (d) practitioners’ experience, expertise, information environment, and demographics did not meaningfully explain variation in their accuracy. Our findings have theoretical implications for understanding the conditions likely to produce meaningful elite influence on public opinion as well as practical implications for practitioners.",

          "authors": "Yida Li, Michael Gurnis",
          "abstract": "Subduction zones play a pivotal role in the mechanics of plate tectonics by providing the driving force through slab pull and weak megathrusts that facilitate the relative motion between tectonic plates. The initiation of subduction zones is intricately linked to the accumulation of slab pull and development of weakness at plate boundaries and, by consequence, the largest changes in the energetics of mantle convection. However, the transient nature of subduction initiation accompanied by intense subsequent tectonic activity, leaves critical evidence poorly preserved and making subduction initiation difficult to constrain. We overcome these limitations through a comprehensive analysis focused on Puysegur, a well-constrained extant example of subduction initiation offshore South Island, New Zealand. Through time-dependent, three-dimensional thermo-mechanical computations and quantitative comparison to new geophysical and geological observations, including topography, stratigraphy, and seismicity, we demonstrate that subduction initiation develops with a fast strain weakening described with a small characteristic displacement ( Δ s ≈ 4 to 8 km). Potential physical mechanisms contributing to the strain weakening are explored and we find that the observed fast weakening may arise through a combination of grain-size reduction within the lower lithosphere and fluid pressurization at shallower depths. With the shared commonality in the underlying physics of tectonic processes, the rapid strain weakening constrained at Puysegur offers insights into the formation of the first subduction during early Earth and the onset of plate tectonics.",

          "abstract": "Changes driven by both unanticipated human activities and management actions are creating wicked management landscapes in freshwater and marine ecosystems that require new approaches to support decision-making. By linking a predictive model of nutrient- and temperature-driven bottom hypoxia with observed commercial fishery harvest data from Lake Erie (United States–Canada) over the past century (1928–2022) and climate projections (2030–2099), we show how simple, yet robust models and routine monitoring data can be used to identify tradeoffs associated with nutrient management and guide decision-making in even the largest of aquatic ecosystems now and in the future. Our approach enabled us to assess planned nutrient load reduction targets designed to mitigate nutrient-driven hypoxia and show why they appear overly restrictive based on current fishery needs, indicating tradeoffs between water quality and fisheries management goals. At the same time, our temperature results show that projected climate change impacts on hypoxic extent will require more stringent nutrient regulations in the future. Beyond providing a rare example of bottom hypoxia driving changes in fishery harvests at an ecosystem scale, our study illustrates the need for adaptive ecosystem–based management, which can be informed by simple predictive models that can be readily applied over long time periods, account for tradeoffs across multiple management sectors (e.g., water quality, fisheries), and address ecosystem nonstationarity (e.g., climate change impacts on management targets). Such approaches will be critical for maintaining valued ecosystem services in the many aquatic systems worldwide that are vulnerable to multiple drivers of environmental change.",

          "abstract": "Elucidating details of biology’s selective uptake and trafficking of rare earth elements, particularly the lanthanides, has the potential to inspire sustainable biomolecular separations of these essential metals for myriad modern technologies. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize Methylobacterium ( Methylorubrum ) extorquens LanD, a periplasmic protein from a bacterial gene cluster for lanthanide uptake. This protein provides only four ligands at its surface-exposed lanthanide-binding site, allowing for metal-centered protein dimerization that favors the largest lanthanide, La III . However, the monomer prefers Nd III and Sm III , which are disfavored lanthanides for cellular utilization. Structure-guided mutagenesis of a metal-ligand and an outer-sphere residue weakens metal binding to the LanD monomer and enhances dimerization for Pr III and Nd III by 100-fold. Selective dimerization enriches high-value Pr III and Nd III relative to low-value La III and Ce III in an all-aqueous process, achieving higher separation factors than lanmodulins and comparable or better separation factors than common industrial extractants. Finally, we show that LanD interacts with lanmodulin (LanM), a previously characterized periplasmic protein that shares LanD’s preference for Nd III and Sm III . Our results suggest that LanD’s unusual metal-binding site transfers less-desirable lanthanides to LanM to siphon them away from the pathway for cytosolic import. The properties of LanD show how relatively weak chelators can achieve high selectivity, and they form the basis for the design of protein dimers for separation of adjacent lanthanide pairs and other metal ions.",

          "abstract": "Humans are widely exposed to semivolatile organic contaminants in indoor environments. Many contaminants have long lifetimes following partitioning to the large surface reservoirs present indoors, which leads to long exposure times to gas-phase oxidants and multiphase chemistry. Studies have shown selective multiphase oxidation of organics on indoor surfaces, but the presence of hydroxyl radicals with nonselective reactivity and evidence of multiphase OH radical reactivity toward common indoor contaminants indicates that there may be additional unknown transformation chemistry indoors. We screened genuine indoor samples for 60 OH radical oxidation products of the common plasticizer and endocrine-disrupting contaminant bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) identified in laboratory experiments using nontargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry. At least 30 and 10 of these products are observed in indoor dust and DEHP films exposed to ambient indoor conditions, respectively, indicating that multiphase OH reactions occur indoors. Using the PROTEX model and a multimedia indoor chemical fate model, we demonstrate that these products have long indoor lifetimes and cause a higher potential for human exposure than DEHP. Some of these products are more active endocrine disruptors than DEHP itself, but most have unknown toxicities. Coexposure to all oxidation products will likely have an additive effect, leading to higher human health risks from indoor organic contaminants than previously thought. Due to the nonselective reactivity of OH radicals, it is likely that most indoor contaminants follow similar chemistry, and further study is needed to understand the prevalence and human health implications of such multiphase chemistry.",

          "abstract": "Microplastic is globally regarded as an important factor impacting biogeochemical cycles, yet our understanding of such influences is limited by the uncertainties of intricate microbial processes. By multiomics analysis, coupled with soil chemodiversity characterization and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), we investigated how microbial responses to microplastics impacted soil carbon cycling in a long-term field experiment. We showed that biodegradable microplastics promoted soil organic carbon accrual by an average of 2.47%, while nondegradable microplastics inhibited it by 17.4%, as a consequence of the virus–bacteria coadaptations to the microplastics disturbance. In the relevant functional pathways, nondegradable microplastics significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) enhanced the abundance and transcriptional activity related to complex carbohydrate metabolism, whereas biodegradable microplastics significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) promoted functions involved in amino acid metabolism and glycolysis. Accordingly, viral lysis enhanced in nondegradable microplastics treatments to introduce more complex organic compounds to soil dissolved organic matters, thus benefiting the oligotrophs with high carbon metabolic capabilities in exploitation competition. In contrast, biodegradable microplastics enriched viral auxiliary metabolic genes of carbon metabolism through “piggyback-the-winner” strategy, conferring to dominant copiotrophs, enhanced substrate utilization capabilities. These virus–host interactions were also demonstrated in the corresponding soil plastisphere, which would alter microbial resource allocation and metabolism via CUE, affecting carbon storage consequently. Overall, our results underscore the importance of viral–host interactions in understanding the microplastics-dependent carbon storage in the soil ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "The hippocampus is a brain region that is essential for the initial encoding of episodic memories. However, the consolidation of these memories is thought to occur in the neocortex, under guidance of the hippocampus, over the course of days and weeks. Communication between the hippocampus and the neocortex during hippocampal sharp wave-ripple oscillations is believed to be critical for this memory consolidation process. Yet, the synaptic and circuit basis of this communication between brain areas is largely unclear. To address this problem, we perform in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the frontal neocortex and local field potential recordings in CA1 of head-fixed mice exposed to a virtual-reality environment. In mice trained in a goal-directed spatial task, we observe a depolarization in frontal principal neurons during hippocampal ripple oscillations. Both this ripple-associated depolarization and goal-directed task performance can be disrupted by chemogenetic inactivation of somatostatin-positive (SOM + ) interneurons. In untrained mice, a ripple-associated depolarization is not observed, but it emerges when frontal parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) interneurons are inactivated. These results support a model where SOM + interneurons inhibit PV + interneurons during hippocampal activity, thereby acting as a disinhibitory gate for hippocampal inputs to neocortical principal neurons during learning.",

          "authors": "L. Chimiak, E. Hara, A. Sessions, A.S. Templeton",
          "abstract": "Amino acids are present in all known life, so identifying the environmental conditions under which they can be synthesized constrains where life on Earth might have formed and where life might be found on other planetary bodies. All known abiotic amino acid syntheses require ammonia, which is only produced in reducing and neutral atmospheres. Here, we demonstrate that the Fe-bearing hydroxide mineral ferroan brucite [Fe 0.33 ,Mg 0.67 (OH) 2 ] can mediate the reaction of nitrate and glyoxylate to form glycine, the simplest amino acid used in life. Up to 97% of this glycine was detected only after acid digestion of the mineral, demonstrating that it had been strongly partitioned to the mineral. The dicarboxylic amino acid 3-hydroxy aspartate was also detected, which suggests that reactants underwent a mechanism that simultaneously produced mono- and dicarboxylic amino acids. Nitrate can be produced in both neutral and oxidizing atmospheres, so reductive amination of nitrate and glyoxylate on a ferroan brucite surface expands origins of life scenarios. First, it expands the environmental conditions in which life’s precursors could form to include oxidizing atmospheres. Second, it demonstrates the ability of ferroan brucite, an abundant, secondary mineral in serpentinizing systems where olivine is partly hydrated, to mediate reductive amination. Finally, the results demonstrate the need to consider mineral-bound products when analyzing samples for abiotic amino acid synthesis.",

          "abstract": "One of the first organizing processes during animal development is the assembly of embryonic cells into epithelia. Common features unite epithelialization across select bilaterians, however, we know less about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive epithelial emergence in early branching nonbilaterians. In sea anemones, epithelia emerge both during embryonic development and after cell aggregation of dissociated tissues. Although adhesion is required to keep cells together, it is not clear whether cell polarization plays a role as epithelia emerge from disordered aggregates. Here, we use the embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to investigate the evolutionary origins of epithelial development. We demonstrate that lateral cell polarization is essential for epithelial organization in both embryos and aggregates. With disrupted lateral polarization, cell contact in the aggregate is not sufficient to trigger epithelialization and further tissue development. Specifically, knockdown of the conserved lateral polarity and tumor suppressor protein Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) disrupts epithelia in developing embryos and impairs the capacity of dissociated cells to epithelialize from aggregates. In contrast to other systems, cells in Nematostella lgl knockdown embryos do not undergo excessive proliferation. Cells with reduced Lgl levels lose their columnar shape and proper positioning of their mitotic spindles and basal bodies. Due to misoriented divisions and aberrant shapes, cells arrange nonuniformly without forming a monolayer. Together our data show that, in Nematostella, Lgl drives epithelialization in embryos and cell aggregates through its effect on cell shape and organelle localization.",

          "abstract": "Mutations modification enzymes including the tRNA N 7 -methylguanosine (m 7 G) methyltransferase complex component WDR4 were frequently found in patients with neural disorders, while the pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic intervention strategies are poorly explored. In this study, we revealed that patient-derived WDR4 mutation leads to temporal and cell-type-specific neural degeneration, and directly causes neural developmental disorders in mice. Mechanistically, WDR4 point mutation disrupts the interaction between WDR4 and METTL1 and accelerates METTL1 protein degradation. We further uncovered that impaired tRNA m 7 G modification caused by Wdr4 mutation decreases the mRNA translation of genes involved in mTOR pathway, leading to elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and increases neural cell apoptosis. Importantly, treatment with stress-attenuating drug Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) significantly decreases neural cell death and improves neural functions of the Wdr4 mutated mice. Moreover, adeno-associated virus mediated transduction of wild-type WDR4 restores METTL1 protein level and tRNA m 7 G modification in the mouse brain, and achieves long-lasting therapeutic effect in Wdr4 mutated mice. Most importantly, we further demonstrated that both TUDCA treatment and WDR4 restoration significantly improve the survival and functions of human iPSCs-derived neuron stem cells that harbor the patient’s WDR4 mutation. Overall, our study uncovers molecular insights underlying WDR4 mutation in the pathogenesis of neural diseases and develops two promising therapeutic strategies for treatment of neural diseases caused by impaired tRNA modifications.",

          "abstract": "Active systems of self-propelled agents, e.g., birds, fish, and bacteria, can organize their collective motion into myriad autonomous behaviors. Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatial-temporal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion, so controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced-order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structures with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors such as maze navigation. These findings demonstrate that allowing and understanding changes in body morphology can enhance the capabilities of active matter systems and enable the design of robotic materials capable of space exploration, adaptation, and complex interactions with their surrounding environment.",

          "abstract": "Abundant proxy records suggest a profound reorganization of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21,000 y ago), with the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) shoaling significantly relative to the present-day (PD) and forming Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW). However, almost all previous observational and modeling studies have focused on the zonal mean two-dimensional AMOC feature, while recent progress in the understanding of modern AMOC reveals a more complicated three-dimensional structure, with NADW penetrating from the subpolar North Atlantic to lower latitude through different pathways. Here, combining 231 Pa/ 230 Th reconstructions and model simulations, we uncover a significant change in the three-dimensional structure of the glacial AMOC. Specifically, the mid-latitude eastern pathway (EP), located east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and transporting about half of the PD NADW from the subpolar gyre to the subtropical gyre, experienced substantial intensification during the LGM. A greater portion of the GNAIW was transported in the eastern basin during the LGM compared to NADW at the PD, resulting in opposite 231 Pa/ 230 Th changes between eastern and western basins during the LGM. Furthermore, in contrast to the wind-steering mechanism of EP at PD, the intensified LGM EP was caused primarily by the rim current forced by the basin-scale open-ocean convection over the subpolar North Atlantic. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for three-dimensional oceanographic changes to achieve more accurate reconstructions of past AMOC.",

However, the realization of this promise is hindered by the unavailability of generalizable ground-truth information, data incompleteness and heterogeneity, and the lack of generalization to multiple cohorts. We present here a data-driven approach to identify clinical states that we implement for 585 critical care patients with suspected pneumonia recruited by the SCRIPT study, which we compare to and integrate with 9,918 pneumonia patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. We extract and curate from their structured EHRs a primary set of clinical features (53 and 59 features for SCRIPT and MIMIC-IV, respectively), including disease severity scores, vital signs, and so on, at various degrees of completeness. We aggregate irregular time series into daily frequency, resulting in 12,495 and 94,684 patient-day pairs for SCRIPT and MIMIC, respectively. We define a “common-sense” ground truth that we then use in a semisupervised pipeline to optimize choices for data preprocessing, and reduce the feature space to four principal components. We describe and validate an ensemble-based clustering method that enables us to robustly identify five clinical states, and use a Gaussian mixture model to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignment. Demonstrating the clinical relevance of the identified states, we find that three states are strongly associated with disease outcomes (dying vs. recovering), while the other two reflect disease etiology.

The WRINKLED1 transcription factor (WRI1 TF) is a central regulator of lipid biosynthesis. We characterized the genome-wide binding profile of soybean (Gm)WRI1 and show that the TF directly regulates genes encoding numerous enzymes and proteins in the fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathways. GmWRI1 binds primarily to regions downstream of target gene transcription start sites. We showed that GmWRI1-bound regions are enriched for the canonical WRI1 DNA binding element, the ACTIVATOR of Spomin::LUC1/WRI1 (AW) Box (CNTNGNNNNNNNCG), and another DNA motif, the CNC Box (CNCCNCC). Functional assays showed that both DNA elements mediate transcriptional activation by GmWRI1. We also show that GmWRI1 works in concert with other TFs to establish a regulatory state that promotes fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In particular, comparison of genes targeted directly by GmWRI1 and by GmLEC1, a central regulator of the maturation phase of seed development, reveals that the two TFs act in a positive feedback subcircuit to control fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Together, our results provide unique insights into the genetic circuitry in which GmWRI1 participates to regulate storage lipid accumulation during seed development.",

Symptoms of shigellosis include bloody diarrhea, associated to colon hemorrhage; in more severe cases , Shigella bacteremia is induced. These clinical features indicate that Shigella are exposed and survive exposure to plasma, locally and systemically, although this has not yet been studied at a molecular level. In this report, we confirmed in a guinea pig model of shigellosis that both S. flexneri 5a and S. sonnei induced local hemorrhages and we demonstrated that Shigella reached CD31+/CD34+ blood vessels located in the mucosa during the late stages of infection, and further disseminated in the bloodstream. These results confirmed the exposure of Shigella to plasma components during its virulence cycle. We demonstrated that all the tested Shigella strains survived plasma exposure in vitro, and we showed that Serine Protease Autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) contribute to Shigella dissemination within the colonic mucosa and in the bloodstream. We have confirmed that SPATEs are expressed and secreted in poorly oxygenated environments encountered by Shigella during late infection stages. We further demonstrated that SPATEs promoted Shigella survival in plasma, by cleaving complement component 3 (C3), thereby impairing the complement system activation. We have shown here that the ability of Shigella to survive plasma exposure is a key factor in its virulence, both within primary foci and systemically.",

          "abstract": "How can a single protein domain encode a conformational landscape with multiple stably folded states, and how do those states interconvert? Here, we use real-time and relaxation-dispersion NMR to characterize the conformational landscape of the circadian rhythm protein KaiB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides . Unique among known natural metamorphic proteins, this KaiB variant spontaneously interconverts between two monomeric states: the “Ground” and “Fold-switched” (FS) states. KaiB in its FS state interacts with multiple binding partners, including the central KaiC protein, to regulate circadian rhythms. We find that KaiB itself takes hours to interconvert between the Ground and FS state, underscoring the ability of a single-sequence to encode the slow process needed for function. We reveal the rate-limiting step between the Ground and FS state is the cis–trans isomerization of three prolines in the fold-switching region by demonstrating interconversion acceleration by the prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A. The interconversion proceeds through a “partially disordered” (PD) state, where the C-terminal half becomes disordered while the N-terminal half remains stably folded. We found two additional properties of KaiB’s landscape. First, the Ground state experiences cold denaturation: At 4 °C, the PD state becomes the majorly populated state. Second, the Ground state exchanges with a fourth state, the “Enigma” state, on the millisecond-timescale. We combine AlphaFold2-based predictions and NMR chemical shift predictions to predict this Enigma state is a beta-strand register shift that relieves buried charged residues, and support this structure experimentally. These results provide mechanistic insight into how evolution can design a single-sequence that achieves specific timing needed for its function.",

          "abstract": "Abscission is the programmed separation of plant organs. It is widespread in the plant kingdom with important functions in development and environmental response. In Arabidopsis, abscission of floral organs (sepals, petals, and stamens) is controlled by two receptor-like protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA LIKE-2 (HSL2), which orchestrate the programmed dissolution of the abscission zone connecting floral organs to the developing fruit. In this work, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the core HAE/HSL2 abscission gene expression program. We identify the MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE-1/MKP1 gene as a negative regulator of this pathway. MKP1 acts prior to activation of HAE/HSL2 signaling to establish a signaling threshold required for the initiation of abscission. Furthermore, we use single-cell data to identify genes expressed in two subpopulations of abscission zone cells: those proximal and those distal to the plane of separation. We identify INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION/IDA family genes, encoding activating ligands of HAE/HSL2, as enriched in distal abscission zone cells at the base of the abscising organs. We show how this expression pattern forms a biophysical circuit breaker whereby, when the organ is shed, the source of the IDA peptides is removed, leading to cessation of HAE/HSL2 signaling. Overall, this work provides insight into the multiple control mechanisms acting on the abscission-signaling pathway.",

Under rapid environmental changes, it is important to understand the current and future trajectories of the CO 2 budget in high-latitude ecosystems. In this study, we present the importance of anomalous wet conditions and rising [CO 2 ] on the long-term CO 2 budget based on two decades (2003–2022) of quasicontinuous measurements of CO 2 flux at a poorly drained black spruce forest on permafrost peat in interior Alaska. The long-term CO 2 budget for the black spruce forest was a small sink of −53 ± 63 g C m −2 y −1 . The CO 2 sink increased from 49 g C m −2 y −1 for the first decade to 58 g C m −2 y −1 for the second decade. The increased CO 2 sink was attributed to an 11.3% increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) among which 9% increase in GPP was explained by a recent increase in precipitation. Furthermore, a 3% increase in GPP in response to a 37-ppm increase in [CO 2 ] was estimated from the data-model fusion. Our study shows that understanding the coupling between hydrological and carbon cycles and the CO 2 fertilization effect is important for understanding the current and future carbon budgets of high-latitude ecosystems in permafrost regions.",

          "abstract": "Globally, ocean dumping of chemical waste is a common method of disposal and relies on the assumption that dilution, diffusion, and dispersion at ocean scales will mitigate human exposure and ecosystem impacts. In southern California, extensive dumping of agrochemical waste, particularly chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants such as DDT, via sewage outfalls and permitted offshore barging occurred for most of the last century. This study compiled a database of existing sediment and fish DDT measurements to examine how this unique legacy of regional ocean disposal translates into the contemporary contamination of the coastal ocean. We used spatiotemporal modeling to derive continuous estimates of sediment DDT contamination and show that the spatial signature of disposal (i.e., high loadings near historic dumping sites) is highly conserved in sediments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proximity of fish to areas of high sediment loadings explained over half of the variation in fish DDT concentrations. The relationship between sediment and fish contamination was mediated by ecological predictors (e.g., species, trophic ecology, habitat use), and the relative influence of each predictor was context-dependent, with habitat exhibiting greater importance in heavily contaminated areas. Thus, despite more than half a century since the cessation of industrial dumping in the region, local ecosystem contamination continues to mirror the spatial legacy of dumping, suggesting that sediment can serve as a robust predictor of fish contamination, and general ecological characteristics offer a predictive framework for unmeasured species or locations.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical pH-swing strategies offer a promising avenue for cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture, surpassing the traditional thermally activated processes and humidity-sensitive techniques. The concept of elevating seawater’s alkalinity for scalable CO 2 capture without introducing additional chemical as reactant is particularly intriguing due to its minimal environmental impact. However, current commercial plants like chlor-alkali process or water electrolysis demand high thermodynamic voltages of 2.2 V and 1.23 V, respectively, for the production of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from seawater. These high voltages are attributed to the asymmetric electrochemical reactions, where two completely different reactions take place at the anode and cathode. Here, we developed a symmetric electrochemical system for seawater alkalization based on a highly reversible and identical reaction taking place at the anode and cathode. We utilize hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, where the generated hydrogen is looped to the anode for hydrogen oxidation reaction. Theoretical calculations indicate an impressively low energy requirement ranging from 0.07 to 0.53 kWh/kg NaOH for established pH differences of 1.7 to 13.4. Experimentally, we achieved the alkalization with an energy consumption of 0.63 kWh/kg NaOH, which is only 38% of the theoretical energy requirements of the chlor-alkali process (1.64 kWh/kg NaOH). Further tests demonstrated the system’s potential of enduring high current densities (~20 mA/cm 2 ) and operating stability over an extended period (&gt;110 h), showing its potential for future applications. Notably, the CO 2 adsorption tests performed with alkalized seawater exhibited remarkably improved CO 2 capture dictated by the production of hydroxide compared to the pristine seawater.",

Lava-by-lava paleomagnetic secular variation data, previously reported from Morocco and northeastern United States combined with our data for the North Mountain Basalt from the Fundy Basin of Canada show that the initial phase of CAMP volcanism occurred in only five directional groups or pulses each occupying less than a century. The first four directional groups occur during a ~40 kyr period based on available astrochronology and U-Pb geochronology. The coincidence of the initial major pulse of CAMP volcanism with the ETE points to short-lived volcanic winters albedo-induced by sulfate aerosols as a plausible key agent of the extinctions in the tropical continental realm, whereas looser correlations allow prolonged CO 2 emissions to contribute to more long-ranging effects in the marine realm via ocean acidification and longer-term warming.",

          "abstract": "Sexual reproduction requires the choreographed interaction of female cells and molecules with sperm and seminal fluid. In internally fertilizing animals, these interactions are managed by specialized tissues within the female reproductive tract (FRT), such as a uterus, glands, and sperm storage organs. However, female somatic reproductive tissues remain understudied, hindering insight into the molecular interactions that support fertility. Here, we report the identification, molecular characterization, and analysis of cell types throughout the somatic FRT in the premier Drosophila melanogaster model system. We find that the uterine epithelia is composed of 11 distinct cell types with well-delineated spatial domains, likely corresponding to functionally specialized surfaces that interact with gametes and reproductive fluids. Polyploidy is pervasive: More than half of lower reproductive tract cells are ≥4C. While seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are typically thought of as male products that are transferred to females, we find that specialized cell types in the sperm storage organs heavily invest in expressing SFP genes. Rates of amino acid divergence between closely related species indicate heterogeneous evolutionary processes acting on male-limited versus female-expressed seminal fluid genes. Together, our results emphasize that more than 40% of annotated seminal fluid genes are better described as shared components of reproductive transcriptomes, which may function cooperatively to support spermatozoa. More broadly, our work provides the molecular foundation for improved technologies to catalyze the functional characterization of the FRT.",

          "abstract": "The ability to remotely control the activity of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with small molecules can improve the safety and efficacy of gene-modified T cells. Split ON- or OFF-switch CARs involve the dissociation of tumor–antigen binding from T cell activation (i.e., CD3ζ) on the receptor (R-) and signaling (S-) chains, respectively, that either associate or are disrupted in the presence of a small molecule. Here, we have developed an inducible (i)ON-CAR comprising the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma protein 2 protein in the ectodomain of both chains which associate in the presence of venetoclax. We showed that inducible ON (iON)-CAR T cells respond to target tumors cells in the presence of venetoclax or the BH3 mimetic navitoclax in a dose-dependent manner, while there is no impact of the drugs on equivalent second generation-CAR T cells. Within 48 h of venetoclax withdrawal, iON-CAR T cells lose the ability to respond to target tumor cells in vitro as evaluated by Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production, and they are reliant upon the presence of venetoclax for in vivo activity. Finally, by fusing a degron sequence to the endodomain of the iON-CAR S-chain we generated an all-in-one ON/OFF-switch CAR, the iONØ-CAR, down-regulated by lenalidomide within 4 to 6 for functionally inactive T cells (no IFNγ production) within 24 h. We propose that our remote-control CAR designs can reduce toxicity in the clinic. Moreover, the periodic rest of iON and iONØ-CAR T cells may alleviate exhaustion and hence augment persistence and long-term tumor control in patients.",

          "abstract": "It is broadly recognized that intramolecular electric fields, produced by the protein scaffold and acting on the active site, facilitate enzymatic catalysis. This field effect can be described by several theoretical models, each of which is intuitive to varying degrees. In this contribution, we show that a fundamental effect of electric fields is to generate electrostatic potentials that facilitate the energetic alignment of reactant frontier orbitals. We apply this model to demystify the impact of electric fields on high-valent iron–oxo heme proteins: catalases, peroxidases, and peroxygenases/monooxygenases. Specifically, we show that this model easily accounts for the observed field-induced changes to the spin distribution within peroxidase active sites and explains the transition between epoxidation and hydroxylation pathways seen in Cytochrome P450 active site models. Thus, for the intuitive interpretation of the chemical effect of the field, the strategy involves analyzing the response of the orbitals of active site fragments, and their energetic alignment. We note that the energy difference between fragment orbitals involved in charge redistribution acts as a measure for the chemical hardness/softness of the reactive complex. This measure, and its sensitivity to electric fields, offers a single parameter model from which to quantitatively assess the effects of electric fields on reactivity and selectivity. Thus, the model provides an additional perspective to describe electrostatic preorganization and offers ways for its manipulation.",

In this study, we validated that de novo DDX3X variants are enriched in female developmental delay (DD) patients and mainly affect the evolutionarily conserved amino acids based on a meta-analysis of 46,612 NDD trios. We generated a ddx3x deficient zebrafish allele, which exhibited reduced survival rate, DD, microcephaly, adaptation defects, anxiolytic behaviors, social interaction deficits, and impaired spatial recognitive memory. As revealed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing and biological validations, ddx3x deficiency leads to reduced neural stem cell pool, decreased total neuron number, and imbalanced differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which are responsible for the behavioral defects. Indeed, the supplementation of L-glutamate or glutamate receptor agonist ly404039 could partly rescue the adaptation and social deficits. Mechanistically, we reveal that the ddx3x deficiency attenuates the stability of the crebbp mRNA, which in turn causes downregulation of Notch signaling and defects in neurogenesis. Our study sheds light on the molecular pathology underlying the abnormal neurodevelopment and behavior of NDD patients with DDX3X mutations, as well as providing potential therapeutic targets for the precision treatment.",

Here, we develop CRISPR-Translate, a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening method that uses translation levels as a readout and identifies IRF2 as a key regulator of OAS3. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that IRF2 promotes basal expression of OAS3 in unstressed cells, allowing a rapid activation of RNase L following viral infection. Furthermore, IRF2 works in concert with the interferon response through STAT2 to further enhance OAS3 expression. We propose that IRF2-induced RNase L is critical in enabling cells to mount a rapid antiviral response immediately after viral infection, serving as the initial line of defense. This rapid response provides host cells the necessary time to activate additional antiviral signaling pathways, forming secondary defense waves.",

Yet most studies and fracture models focus on steady-state propagation and damage is assumed to be decoupled from the local stress and strain fields near the crack tip. We report an in situ spatial-temporally resolved 3D measurement of molecular damage in mechanophore-labeled MNE just before a crack propagates. This technique, complemented by digital image correlation, allows us to compare the spatial distribution of both damage and deformation in single network (SN) elastomers and in MNE. Compared to SN, MNE have a wide-spread damage in front of the crack and, surprisingly, delocalize strain concentration. A continuum model, where damage distribution is fully coupled to the crack tip fields, is proposed to explain these results. Additional measurements of time-dependent molecular damage during fixed grips relaxation in the presence of a crack reveal that the less localized damage distribution delays fracture initiation. The observations and exploratory modeling reveal the dynamic fracture mechanism of MNE, providing guidance for rational design of high-performance tough elastomers.",

          "abstract": "The female reproductive lifespan is highly dependent on egg quality, especially the presence of a normal number of chromosomes in an egg, known as euploidy. Mistakes in meiosis leading to egg aneuploidy are frequent in humans. Yet, knowledge of the precise genetic landscape that causes egg aneuploidy in women is limited, as phenotypic data on the frequency of human egg aneuploidy are difficult to obtain and therefore absent in public genetic datasets. Here, we identify genetic determinants of reproductive aging via egg aneuploidy in women using a biobank of individual maternal exomes linked with maternal age and embryonic aneuploidy data. Using the exome data, we identified 404 genes bearing variants enriched in individuals with pathologically elevated egg aneuploidy rates. Analysis of the gene ontology and protein–protein interaction network implicated genes encoding the kinesin protein family in egg aneuploidy. We interrogate the causal relationship of the human variants within candidate kinesin genes via experimental perturbations and demonstrate that motor domain variants increase aneuploidy in mouse oocytes. Finally, using a knock-in mouse model, we validate that a specific variant in kinesin KIF18A accelerates reproductive aging and diminishes fertility. These findings reveal additional functional mechanisms of reproductive aging and shed light on how genetic variation underlies individual heterogeneity in the female reproductive lifespan, which might be leveraged to predict reproductive longevity. Together, these results lay the groundwork for the noninvasive biomarkers for egg quality, a first step toward personalized fertility medicine.",

          "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. C. difficile proliferates and produces toxins that damage the colonic epithelium, leading to symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis. The host’s innate response to CDI occurs in two phases: an early phase in which neutrophils reduce the bacterial load and a late phase involving repair mechanisms to restore epithelial integrity. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are crucial in protecting the gut from CDI. Previous studies have shown that ILC3-derived IL-22 is essential in the late phase of CDI for epithelial repair and maintaining an intestinal microbiota that competes with C. difficile , preventing its expansion. Our study finds that ILC3s also protect during the early stages of CDI by sustaining neutrophils through GM-CSF. Less neutrophil production, accumulation, and activation was evident in ILC3-deficient mice than in wild-type (WT) mice, which led to exacerbated symptoms, impaired pathogen clearance, a compromised epithelial barrier, and increased mortality. The adoptive transfer of ILC3s into ILC3-deficient mice restored neutrophil responses and improved disease outcomes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that GM-CSF production by ILC3s is crucial for neutrophil production and effective resistance during CDI. Using mice lacking NKp46 + ILC3s, we found that this subset significantly contributes to GM-CSF production in CDI. These findings highlight the critical role of the ILC3-neutrophil connection in early innate responses to CDI. Enhancing ILC3 production of GM-CSF could be a promising strategy for improving host defense against CDI and other enteric infections.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells and hold great promise as a class of biomarkers. This promise has led to increased interest in measuring EV proteins from both total EVs as well as brain-derived EVs in plasma. However, measuring cargo proteins in EVs has been challenging because EVs are present at low levels, and EV isolation methods are imperfect at separating EVs from free proteins. Thus, knowing whether a protein measured after EV isolation is truly inside EVs is difficult. In this study, we developed methods to measure whether a protein is inside EVs and quantify the ratio of a protein in EVs relative to total plasma. To achieve this, we combined a high-yield size-exclusion chromatography protocol with an optimized protease protection assay and Single Molecule Array (Simoa) digital enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) for ultrasensitive measurement of proteins inside EVs. We applied these methods to analyze α-synuclein and confirmed that a small fraction of the total plasma α-synuclein is inside EVs. Additionally, we developed a highly sensitive Simoa assay for phosphorylated α-synuclein (phosphorylated at the Ser129 residue). We found enrichment in the phosphorylated α-synuclein to total α-synuclein ratio inside EVs relative to outside EVs. Finally, we applied the methods we developed to measure total and phosphorylated α-synuclein inside EVs from Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia patient samples. This work provides a framework for determining the levels of proteins in EVs and represents an important step in the development of EV diagnostics for diseases of the brain, as well as other organs.",

While prior work has elucidated the mechanisms underlying the first two processes, biomechanical processes driving the postfiltration phagocytosis of RBCs retained at interendothelial slits (IES) are still poorly understood. We present here a unique computational model of macrophages to study the role of cell biomechanics in modulating the kinetics of phagocytosis of aged and diseased RBCs retained in the spleen. After validating the macrophage model using in vitro phagocytosis experiments, we employ it to probe the mechanisms underlying the kinetics of phagocytosis of mechanically altered RBCs, such as heated RBCs and abnormal RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Our simulations show pronounced deformation of the flexible and healthy RBCs in contrast to minimal shape changes in altered RBCs. Simulations also show that less deformable RBCs are engulfed faster and at lower adhesive strength than flexible RBCs, consistent with our experimental measurements. This efficient sensing and engulfment by macrophages of stiff RBCs retained at IES are expected to temper splenic congestion, a common pathogenic process in malaria, HS, and SCD. Altogether, our combined computational and in vitro experimental studies suggest that mechanical alterations of retained RBCs may suffice to enhance their phagocytosis, thereby adapting the kinetics of their elimination to the kinetics of their mechanical retention, an equilibrium essential for adequately cleaning the splenic filter to preserve its function.",

These feathers have been observed to deploy passively during high angle of attack maneuvers and are suggested to play an aerodynamic role. However, there have been limited attempts to capture their underlying flow physics or assess the function of multiple covert rows. Here, we first identify two flow control mechanisms associated with a single covert-inspired flap and their location sensitivity: a pressure dam mechanism and a previously unidentified shear layer interaction mechanism. We then investigate the additivity of these mechanisms by deploying multiple rows of flaps. We find that aerodynamic benefits conferred by the shear layer interaction are additive, whereas benefits conferred by the pressure dam effect are not. Nevertheless, both mechanisms can be exploited simultaneously to maximize aerodynamic benefits and mitigate stall. In addition to wind tunnel experiments, we implement multiple rows of covert-inspired flaps on a bird-scale remote-controlled aircraft. Flight tests reveal passive deployment trends similar to those observed in bird flight and comparable aerodynamic benefits to wind tunnel experiments. These results indicate that we can enhance aircraft controllability using covert-inspired flaps and form insights into the aerodynamic role of covert feathers in avian flight.",

Our understanding of the large-scale dynamics of phytoplankton biomass has greatly benefited from, and is largely based on, satellite ocean color observations from which chlorophyll-a (Chla), a commonly used proxy for carbon biomass, can be estimated. However, ocean color satellites only measure a small portion of the surface ocean, meaning that subsurface phytoplankton biomass is not directly monitored. Chla is also an imperfect proxy for carbon biomass because cellular physiology drives large variations in their ratio. The global network of Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo floats now makes it possible to complement satellite observations by addressing both these issues at once. In our study, we use ~100,000 water-column profiles from BGC-Argo to describe Earth’s phytoplankton carbon biomass and its spatiotemporal variability. We estimate the global stock of open ocean phytoplankton biomass at ~314 Tg C, half of which is present at depths not accessible through satellite detection. We also compare the seasonal cycles of carbon biomass stocks and surface Chla visible from space and find that surface Chla does not accurately identify the timing of the peak annual biomass in two-thirds of the ocean. Our study is a demonstration of global-scale, depth-resolved monitoring of Earth’s phytoplankton, which will be crucial for understanding future climate-related changes and the effects of geoengineering interventions if implemented.",

          "abstract": "Historically, economic growth has been closely coupled to carbon emissions responsible for climate change, but to stabilize global mean temperature, net-zero carbon emissions are necessary. Some economies have begun to reduce emissions while continuing to grow, but this decoupling is not fast enough to achieve global climate targets. Subnational climate actions seem to be crucial for the achievement of these targets. Here, we uncover the effectiveness of subnational efforts by estimating decoupling rates and CO2 emission intensities over the last three decades for over 1,500 subnational regions, encompassing 85% of global emissions, using global data on reported economic output and gridded production-based emissions. Thirty percent of regions with available data have fully decoupled, with higher-income and historically carbon-intensive regions exhibiting higher rates of decoupling and declining emission intensity. Countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development with greater spending on subnational climate actions show higher decoupling rates, as do subnational regions in EU countries where climate policies have been implemented, highlighting the effectiveness of subnational policies. Moreover, subnational analysis reveals greater variance of decoupling rates within national boundaries than between them and that countries with weaker governance typically show higher variance of decoupling within their borders. If recent rates of production-based carbon decoupling continue, less than half of subnational regions would reach net-zero before 2050, even when accounting for observed acceleration via socioeconomic development and assuming no interregional carbon leakage.",

It has also become of increasing practical importance over the last half-century as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded. Importantly, real-world computers obey multiple physical constraints on how they work, which affects their thermodynamic properties. Moreover, many of these constraints apply to both naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, and digital systems. Most obviously, all such systems must finish their computation quickly, using as few degrees of freedom as possible. This means that they operate far from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, many computers, both digital and biological, are modular, hierarchical systems with strong constraints on the connectivity among their subsystems. Yet another example is that to simplify their design, digital computers are required to be periodic processes governed by a global clock. None of these constraints were considered in 20th-century analyses of the thermodynamics of computation. The new field of stochastic thermodynamics provides formal tools for analyzing systems subject to all of these constraints. We argue here that these tools may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental thermodynamic properties of physical systems are related to the computation they perform.",

          "abstract": "Selective attention relies on neural mechanisms that facilitate processing of behaviorally relevant sensory information while suppressing irrelevant information, consistently linked to alpha-band oscillations in human M/EEG studies. We analyzed cortical alpha responses from intracranial electrodes implanted in eight epilepsy patients, who performed a visual spatial attention task. Electrocorticographic data revealed a spatiotemporal dissociation between attention-modulated alpha desynchronization, associated with the enhancement of sensory processing, and alpha synchronization, associated with the suppression of sensory processing, during the cue-target interval. Dorsal intraparietal areas contralateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited a delayed and sustained alpha desynchronization, while ventrolateral extrastriatal areas ipsilateral to the attended hemifield primarily exhibited an earlier and sustained alpha synchronization. Analyses of cross-frequency coupling between alpha phase and broadband high-frequency activity (HFA) further revealed cross-frequency interactions along the visual hierarchy contralateral to the attended locations. Directionality analyses indicate that alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas modulated HFA power in downstream visual areas, thus potentially facilitating the feedforward processing of an upcoming, spatially predictable target. In contrast, in areas ipsilateral to the attended locations, HFA power modulated local alpha phase in early and extrastriatal visual areas, with suppressed interareal interactions, potentially attenuating the processing of distractors. Our findings reveal divergent alpha-mediated neural mechanisms underlying target enhancement and distractor suppression during the deployment of spatial attention, reflecting enhanced functional connectivity at attended locations, while suppressed functional connectivity at unattended locations. The collective dynamics of these alpha-mediated neural mechanisms play complementary roles in the efficient gating of sensory information.",

We report that biallelic COX15 pathogenic variants cause human oocyte ferroptosis and female infertility in a recessive inheritance pattern. COX15 variants impaired mitochondrial respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and led to reduced protein levels in HeLa cells. Oocyte-specific deletion of Cox15 led to impaired Fe 2+ and reactive oxygen species homeostasis that caused mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately sensitized oocytes to ferroptosis. In addition, ferrostatin-1 (an inhibitor of ferroptosis) could rescue the oocyte ferroptosis phenotype in vitro and ex vivo.

We highlight 20 hotspot regions where terrestrial water storage exhibits strong nonstationarity, impacting 35% of the global population and 45% of the area covered by irrigated agriculture. Emerging long-term trends dominate the most often (48.2%), followed by seasonal shifts (32.8%) and changes in extremes (19%). Notably, in mid-latitudes, this encompasses 34% of Asia and 27% of North America. The patterns of nonstationarity and their dominant types differ across other water cycle components, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and gross primary production. These differences also manifest uniquely across hotspot regions, illustrating the intricate ways in which each component responds to climate change and human water management.

Pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acids are promising alternatives with chemical structures similar to widely used petroleum-based aromatic dicarboxylic acids. However, their use in polyester synthesis has been limited due to production challenges. Here, we report the fermentative production of five pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acids, including 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) and pyridine dicarboxylic acids (PDCAs: 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, and 2,6-PDCA), from glucose using five engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum strains. A platform C. glutamicum chassis strain was constructed by modulating the expression of nine genes involved in the synthesis and degradation pathways of precursor protocatechuate (PCA) and the glucose-uptake system. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the engineered strain against wild-type C. glutamicum identified iolE ( NCgl0160 ) as a target for PDC production. Optimized fed-batch fermentation conditions enabled the final engineered strain to produce 76.17 ± 1.24 g/L of PDC. Using this platform strain, we constructed 2,3-, 2,4-, and 2,5-PDCA-producing strains by modulating the expression of key enzymes. Additionally, we demonstrated a previously uncharacterized pathway for 2,3-PDCA biosynthesis. The engineered strains produced 2.79 ± 0.005 g/L of 2,3-PDCA, 494.26 ± 2.61 mg/L of 2,4-PDCA, and 1.42 ± 0.02 g/L of 2,5-PDCA through fed-batch fermentation. To complete the portfolio, we introduced the 2,6-PDCA biosynthetic pathway to an L-aspartate pathway–enhanced C. glutamicum strain, producing 15.01 ± 0.03 g/L of 2,6-PDCA in fed-batch fermentation.

We demonstrate by use of a “categorical Jacobian” calculation that ESM-2 stores statistics of coevolving residues, analogously to simpler modeling approaches like Markov Random Fields and Multivariate Gaussian models. We further investigated how ESM-2 “stores” information needed to predict contacts by comparing sequence masking strategies, and found that providing local windows of sequence information allowed ESM-2 to best recover predicted contacts. This suggests that pLMs predict contacts by storing motifs of pairwise contacts. Our investigation highlights the limitations of current pLMs and underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of these models.",

Here, we develop macroporous alginate hydrogels that have an order of magnitude increase in the rate of stress relaxation as compared to bulk hydrogels. The increased rate of stress relaxation occurs across a wide range of polymer molecular weights (MWs), which enables the use of high MW polymer for improved mechanical stability of the hydrogel. The rate of stress relaxation in macroporous hydrogels depends on the volume fraction of pores and the concentration of bovine serum albumin, which is added to the hydrogels to stabilize the macroporous structure during gelation. Relative to cell spheroids encapsulated in bulk hydrogels, spheroids in macroporous hydrogels have a significantly larger area and smaller circularity because of increased cell migration. A computational model provides a framework for the relationship between the macroporous architecture and morphogenesis of encapsulated spheroids that is consistent with experimental observations.

          "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites invade and multiply inside red blood cells (RBCs), the most iron-rich compartment in humans. Like all cells, P. falciparum requires nutritional iron to support essential metabolic pathways, but the critical mechanisms of iron acquisition and trafficking during RBC infection have remained obscure. Parasites internalize and liberate massive amounts of heme during large-scale digestion of RBC hemoglobin within an acidic food vacuole (FV) but lack a heme oxygenase to release porphyrin-bound iron. Although most FV heme is sequestered into inert hemozoin crystals, prior studies indicate that trace heme escapes biomineralization and is susceptible to nonenzymatic degradation within the oxidizing FV environment to release labile iron. Parasites retain a homolog of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a known mammalian iron transporter, but its role in P. falciparum iron acquisition has not been tested. Our phylogenetic studies indicate that P. falciparum DMT1 (PfDMT1) retains conserved molecular features critical for metal transport. We localized this protein to the FV membrane and defined its orientation in an export-competent topology. Conditional knockdown of PfDMT1 expression is lethal to parasites, which display broad cellular defects in iron-dependent functions, including impaired apicoplast biogenesis and mitochondrial polarization. Parasites are selectively rescued from partial PfDMT1 knockdown by supplementation with exogenous iron, but not other metals. These results support a cellular paradigm whereby PfDMT1 is the molecular gatekeeper to essential iron acquisition by blood-stage malaria parasites and suggest that therapeutic targeting of PfDMT1 may be a potent antimalarial strategy.",

          "abstract": "At the nearly pristine hydrothermal vents of the deep sea, highly endemic animals depend upon bacteria nourished by hydrothermal fluids that emerge as outflows from the seafloor. These animals are remarkable in tolerating extreme conditions, including high heat, toxic reduced sulfide, and low oxygen. Here, we test whether the extreme vent environment has selected for functionally similar species across the world’s deep ocean, despite well-established global geographic patterns of high phylogenetic distinctness. High functional redundancy in species pools within regions suggests that the extreme environments select for species with specific traits. Yet, some regions emerge as functional hotspots where species pools with distinct functional trait compositions may represent geological idiosyncrasies of the habitats. Moreover, many species are functionally unique, an outcome of low species richness in a system where the species pool is small at all scales. Given the high proportion of functionally unique species, simulated species extinctions indicate that species losses would rapidly translate to the elimination of functionally irreplaceable species and could tip vent systems to functional collapse. Ocean changes and human-induced threats are expected to significantly impact many vent species as human activities expand in the remote deep sea. The opportunity exists now to take precautionary actions to limit the rates of extinction now ubiquitous in more accessible areas of Earth.",

          "abstract": "Approximately half of mammalian genomes are occupied by retrotransposons, highly repetitive interspersed genetic elements expanded through the mechanism of reverse transcription. The evolution of this “retrobiome” involved a series of explosive amplifications, presumably associated with high mutation rates, interspersed with periods of silencing. A by-product of retrotransposon activity is the formation of processed pseudogenes (PPGs)—intron-less, promoter-less DNA copies of messenger RNA (mRNA). We examined the proportion of PPGs with varying degrees of deviation from their ancestor mRNAs as an indicator of the intensity of retrotranspositions at different times in the past. Our analysis revealed a high proportion of “young’’ (recently acquired) PPGs in the DNA of mice and rats, indicating significant retrobiome activity during the recent evolution of these species. The ongoing process of new PPG entries in mouse germ line DNA was confirmed by identifying diversity in PPG content within the single strain of mice, C57BL/6. In contrast, the highly abundant PPGs of the naked mole rat (NMR) exhibited substantial deviation from their mRNAs, with a near-complete lack of PPGs without mutations, indicative of the silencing of the retrobiome in the most recent evolutionary past, preceded by a period of high activity. This distinctive feature of the NMR genome was confirmed through the analysis of a broad range of mammalian species. The peculiar evolutionary dynamics of PPGs in the NMR, an organism with exceptional longevity and resistance to cancer, may reflect the role played by the retrobiome in aging and cancer.",

We explore the potential interpretation of these results, including the intriguing possibility that ToM-like ability, previously considered unique to humans, may have emerged as an unintended by-product of LLMs’ improving language skills.

          "abstract": "The extensive deposits of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) generated by marine organisms constitute the largest and oldest carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reservoir. These organisms utilize macromolecules like peptides and proteins to facilitate the nucleation and growth of carbonate minerals, serving as an effective method for CO 2 sequestration. However, the precise mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. In this study, we report the use of sequence-defined peptoids, a class of peptidomimetics, to achieve the accelerated calcite step growth kinetics with the molecular level mechanistic understanding. By designing peptoids with hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, we systematically investigated the acceleration in step growth rate of calcite crystals using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), varying peptoid sequences and concentrations, CaCO 3 supersaturations, and the ratio of Ca 2+ / HCO 3 − . Mechanistic studies using NMR, three-dimensional fast force mapping (3D FFM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) were conducted to reveal the interactions of peptoids with Ca 2+ and HCO 3 − ions in solution, as well as the effect of peptoids on solvation and energetics of calcite crystal surface. Our results indicate the multiple roles of peptoid in facilitating HCO 3 − deprotonation, Ca 2+ desolvation, and the disruption of interfacial hydration layers of the calcite surface, which collectively contribute to a peptoid-induced acceleration of calcite growth. These findings provide guidelines for future design of sequence-specific biomimetic polymers as crystallization promoters, offering potential applications in environmental remediation (such as CO 2 sequestration), biomedical engineering, and energy storage where fast crystallization is preferred.",

Known triggers for infection-independent NETs release exist, yet a comprehensive understanding of the conditions prompting such responses is lacking. In this study, we identify hyponatremia as an independent inducer of NETs release, a common clinical condition that disrupts sodium/calcium exchange within neutrophils. This disruption leads to an excess of intracellular calcium, subsequent elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the citrullination of histone H3, culminating in the activation of NETs-release pathways. Notably, under hyponatremic conditions, this mechanism is exacerbated during infectious states, leading to the deposition of NETs in the lungs and increasing the risk of life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Our findings underscore the critical role of sodium and calcium homeostasis in neutrophil functionality and provide insights into the pathogenesis of hyponatremia-associated diseases, highlighting potential therapeutic interventions targeting NETs dynamics.",

We evaluated and quantified the performance of 90 biomarker candidates, including various cellular and molecular species, at different cutoffs by a cutoff-based biomarker testing algorithm combined with machine learning–based feature selection. Combinations of pretreatment biomarkers improved the specificity compared to single biomarkers at the cost of reduced sensitivity. On the other hand, early on-treatment biomarkers, such as the relative change in tumor diameter from baseline measured at two weeks after treatment initiation, achieved remarkably higher sensitivity and specificity. Further, blood-based biomarkers had a comparable ability to tumor- or lymph node–based biomarkers in identifying a subset of responders, potentially suggesting a less invasive way for patient selection.",

          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the statistics of certain observables. Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar trade-offs also exist for the simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities. In the simplest case of three observers, it has been shown that if two observers violate a Bell inequality, then none of them can violate any Bell inequality with the third observer, a property called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to the no-signaling principle, and the inability of simultaneous violations of all inequalities is regarded as their fundamental property. Here, we show that the Bell monogamy does not hold universally and that in fact the only monogamous situation exists for only three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for identifying quantum states, measurements, and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified polygamous inequalities enable any subset of ( N − 1 ) observers to reveal nonlocality, which is also shown experimentally by measuring Bell-type correlations of six-photon Dicke states. Our findings may be exploited for multiparty quantum key distribution as well as simultaneous self-testing of multiple nodes in quantum networks.",

          "abstract": "The rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance threatens human health. While more sophisticated strategies for antibiotic discovery are being developed, target elucidation of new chemical entities remains challenging. In the postgenomic era, expression profiling can play an important role in mechanism-of-action (MOA) prediction by reporting on the cellular response to perturbation. However, the broad application of transcriptomics has yet to fulfill its promise of transforming target elucidation due to challenges in identifying the most relevant, direct responses to target inhibition. We developed an unbiased strategy for MOA prediction, called perturbation-specific transcriptional mapping (PerSpecTM), in which large-throughput expression profiling of wild-type or hypomorphic mutants, depleted for essential targets, enables a computational strategy to address this challenge. We applied PerSpecTM to perform reference-based MOA prediction based on the principle that similar perturbations, whether chemical or genetic, will elicit similar transcriptional responses. Using this approach, we elucidated the MOAs of three molecules with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by comparing their expression profiles to those of a reference set of antimicrobial compounds with known MOAs. We also show that transcriptional responses to small-molecule inhibition resemble those resulting from genetic depletion of essential targets by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) by PerSpecTM, demonstrating proof of concept that correlations between expression profiles of small-molecule and genetic perturbations can facilitate MOA prediction when no chemical entities exist to serve as a reference. Empowered by PerSpecTM, this work lays the foundation for an unbiased, readily scalable, systematic reference-based strategy for MOA elucidation that could transform antibiotic discovery efforts.",

In this article, we address this issue by reporting on an experimental investigation of cell proliferation on all time- and length-scales of the development of a model tissue, grown on collagen-coated glass or deformable substrates. Through extensive data analysis, we demonstrate the relation between mechanoresponse and probability for cell division, as a function of the local cell density. Motivated by these results, we construct a minimal model of cell division in tissue environment that can recover the data. By parameterizing the growth and the dividing phases of the cell cycle, and introducing such a proliferation model in dissipative particle dynamics simulations, we recover the mechanoresponsive, time-dependent density profiles in 2D tissues growing to macroscopic scales. The importance of separating the cell population into growing and dividing cells, each characterized by a particular time scale, is further emphasized by calculations of density profiles based on adapted Fisher–Kolmogorov equations. Together, these results show that the mechanoresponse on the level of a constitutive cell and its proliferation results in a matrix-sensitive active pressure. The latter evokes massive cooperative displacement of cells in the invading tissue and is a key factor for developing large-scale structures in the steady state.",

Among these structurally diverse alterations, exon 20 insertions represent a unique subset that rarely respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Therefore, there is a significant need to develop inhibitors that are active against this class of activating mutations. Here, we conducted biochemical analysis of the two most frequent exon 20 insertion variants, V769_D770insASV (insASV) and D770_N771insSVD (insSVD) to better understand their drug sensitivity and resistance. From kinetic studies, we found that EGFR insASV and insSVD are similarly active, but have lower K m, ATP values compared to the L858R variant, which contributes to their lack of sensitivity to 1st-3rd generation EGFR TKIs. Biochemical, structural, and cellular studies of a diverse panel of EGFR inhibitors revealed that the more recently developed compounds BAY-568, TAS6417, and TAK-788 inhibit EGFR insASV and insSVD in a mutant-selective manner, with BAY-568 being the most potent and selective versus wild-type (WT) EGFR. Cocrystal structures with WT EGFR reveal the binding modes of each of these inhibitors and of poziotinib, a potent but not mutantselective inhibitor, and together they define interactions shared by the mutant-selective agents. Collectively, our results show that these exon20 insertion variants are not inherently inhibitor resistant, rather they differ in their drug sensitivity from WT EGFR. However, they are similar to each other, indicating that a single inhibitor should be effective for several of the diverse exon 20 insertion variants.",

We apply this framework to sample the conformational space of six proteins transitioning from completely disordered states to folded states, as well as to model the chemical synthesis process of C60, achieving conformations that perfectly match the standard C60 structure. The results demonstrate Adaptive CVgen’s effectiveness in exploring new conformations and escaping local minima, achieving both sampling efficiency and exploration accuracy.

Disruption of ErbB signaling, which is essential for peripheral myelination, has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and WM lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used an in vivo pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulated ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the myelinating capacity of newly formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, ErbB inhibition attenuates K-Ras activities, leading to the reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase A that promotes aerobic glycolysis in mature oligodendrocytes.

Mammalian cells are known to sense and respond to sterol status changes to maintain them within strict limits, a process associated with various human diseases. However, this process is not understood in oomycete pathogens, most of which are sterol auxotrophic and must obtain sterols from host plants. Here, we report that Phytophthora sojae SSRK1 (sterol-sensing receptor kinase 1) detects host sterols by coupling with elicitins, thereby controlling signaling and sterol absorption. Sterols are recruited by extracellular soluble elicitins, and these complexes then bind to SSRK1 to form trimolecular complexes. These complexes subsequently trigger downstream calcium influx, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transcriptome reprogramming through the receptor’s kinase activity. Our data demonstrate a unique sterol sensing pathway where elicitins and a transmembrane receptor kinase SSRK1 act as coreceptors for extracellular sterols. These findings also portray a sterol-based war between oomycetes and plants, providing a unique perspective on how a pathogen detects host signals during infection.",

Maternal oxycodone (OXY) exposure of pregnant mice leads to disturbances in the layer of invasive parietal trophoblast giant cells (pTGC) that forms the interface between the placenta and uterus. These cells are analogous to extravillous trophoblasts of the human placenta. They are crucial to coordinating the metabolic needs of the conceptus with those of the mother and are primary participants in the placenta–brain axis. Their large nuclear size, however, has precluded both single-cell (sc) and single-nucleus (sn) RNA-seq analyses beyond embryonic day (E) 8.5. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of placentas from pregnant mice exposed to OXY with unexposed controls at E12.5, with particular emphasis on the pTGC. The nonfluidic Parse snRNA-seq approach permitted characterization of the nuclear transcriptomes of all the major placental cell lineages and their presumed progenitors at E12.5. OXY exposure had a negligible effect on components of the placental labyrinth, including the two syncytial cell layers, but caused transcriptomic changes consistent with metabolic stress throughout the spongiotrophoblast. Most notably, there was loss of the majority of pTGC, whose normal gene expression is consistent with elevated energy demand relating to biosynthesis of multiple secretory products, especially hormones, and endoduplication of DNA. This unusual sensitivity of pTGC presumably puts the pregnancy and future health of the offspring at particular risk to OXY exposure.",

Mitigating this strain-induced loss in mechanical integrity is a significant challenge, especially in the development of active and shape-memory materials. We report the additive manufacturing of mechanical metamaterials made with a protein-based polymer that undergo a unique stiffening and strengthening behavior after shape recovery cycles. We utilize a bovine serum albumin-based polymer and show that cyclic tension and recovery experiments on the neat resin lead to a ~60% increase in the strength and stiffness of the material. This is attributed to the release of stored length in the protein mechanophores during plastic deformation that is preserved after the recovery cycle, thereby leading to a “strain learning” behavior. We perform compression experiments on three-dimensionally printed lattice metamaterials made from this protein-based polymer and find that, in certain lattices, the strain learning effect is not only preserved but amplified, causing up to a 2.5× increase in the stiffness of the recovered metamaterial. These protein–polymer strain learning metamaterials offer a unique platform for materials that can autonomously remodel after being deformed, mimicking the remodeling processes that occur in natural materials.",

          "abstract": "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , exit from mitosis is coupled to spindle position to ensure successful genome partitioning between mother and daughter cells. This coupling occurs through a GTPase signaling cascade known as the mitotic exit network (MEN). The MEN senses spindle position via a Ras-like GTPase Tem1 which localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast equivalent of centrosomes) during anaphase and signals to its effector protein kinase Cdc15. How Tem1 couples the status of spindle position to MEN activation is not fully understood. Here, we show that Cdc15 has a relatively weak preference for Tem1 GTP and Tem1’s nucleotide state does not change upon MEN activation. Instead, we find that Tem1’s nucleotide cycle establishes a localization-based concentration difference in the cell where only Tem1 GTP is recruited to the SPB, and spindle position regulates the MEN by controlling Tem1 localization to the SPB. SPB localization of Tem1 primarily functions to promote Tem1–Cdc15 interaction for MEN activation by increasing the effective concentration of Tem1. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that artificially tethering Tem1 to the SPB or concentrating Tem1 in the cytoplasm with genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles could bypass the requirement of Tem1 GTP and correct spindle position for MEN activation. This localization/concentration-based GTPase signaling mechanism for Tem1 differs from the canonical Ras-like GTPase signaling paradigm and is likely relevant to other localization-based signaling scenarios.",

Their unique ability to filter water, provide habitat, and contribute to nutrient cycling has remained underused in many parts of Europe following the destruction of vast oyster beds in the 19th and 20th centuries. The burgeoning field of oyster restoration for aquaculture has recognized the potential of these bivalves in promoting ecosystem resilience and enhancing biodiversity. Restoring oysters to previous levels requires the establishment of ecological baselines that ideally take into account the long-term changes of animal behavior as well as the surrounding environment prior to significant human intervention, an extremely challenging task. Archaeological shell middens are invaluable baseline archives and provide exclusive insights into past ecosystems. Here, we use demographic information from over 2,000 analyzed European oyster ( Ostrea edulis ) shells dating from ~5,660 to 2,600 cal BCE (calibrated years BCE), the largest archaeological growth rate dataset of mollusks yet. Through the analysis of size as well as ontogenetic age, we decouple anthropogenic from environmental impacts throughout Denmark. Our data show definitive influence of oyster size–age structure through human harvesting during the Mid-Holocene, with older oysters in the Mesolithic (mean: 4.9 y) than the Neolithic (mean: 3.7 y), irrespective of changes in growth rate. Furthermore, we present the metrics for long-term sustainable harvesting of oysters across environmental and socioeconomic transitions, providing demographic targets for current oyster restoration projects and valuable context in mitigating the impact of modern climatic change.",

          "abstract": "Current research on memory indicates that learning is most effective when it involves spaced retrieval practice of study materials. Here, we investigated whether the benefits of both retrieval practice and spacing can be further boosted when variability is introduced across practice sessions. Across six experiments, participants learned translations of foreign vocabulary, with foreign words embedded in contextual sentences hinting at the meaning of these words. These sentences were then either kept constant or varied from one learning cycle to another. Whenever repeated practice took the form of retrieval from long-term memory with contextual sentences serving as cues (with or without feedback after retrieval attempts), variable sentences led to better learning of the meanings of the embedded foreign words than constant sentences. The benefits of variable retrieval were observed both immediately after study and after a 24-h delay, and they were larger when retrieval practice was spaced rather than massed. However, these benefits were not appreciated by the learners who judged learning to be more effective with constant rather than variable cues. This metacognitive illusion, misaligning the effectiveness of learning and its appraisal by learners, was confirmed in the seventh experiment which focused on learning lecture content. Thus, while spaced retrieval practice employing variable cues clearly produces robust benefits for memory performance, such benefits may be severely underappreciated by the learners.",

Despite the many bacterial defenses and phage counterdefenses, in most environments, bacteria and phage coexist, with neither driving the other to extinction. How is coexistence realized in the context of the bacteria/phage arms race, and how are immune repertoire sizes determined in conditions of coexistence? Here we develop a simple mathematical model to consider the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of competing bacteria and phage with different immune/counterimmune repertoires. We find an ecologically stable fixed point exhibiting coexistence, in agreement with the experimental observation that each individual bacterium typically carries multiple defense systems, though fewer than the maximum number possible. However, in simulations, the populations typically remain dynamic, exhibiting chaotic fluctuations around this fixed point. These dynamics enable coexistence even when phage (predator) strains outnumber bacteria (prey) strains. We obtain quantitative predictions for the mean, amplitude, and timescale of these dynamics. Our results provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the bacteria/phage arms race and demonstrate how bacteria/phage coexistence can stably arise from the coevolution of bacterial defense systems and phage counterdefense systems.",

They transduce signals across membranes, scaffold signaling complexes, and mediate vesicular traffic. Their functions are regulated by constraining conformational ensembles through specific intra- and intermolecular interactions, physical tethering, and posttranslational modifications. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptor FAM134B/RETREG1, known for its reticulon homology domain (RHD), includes a substantial C-terminal IDR housing the LC3 interacting motif. Beyond engaging the autophagic machinery, the function of the FAM134B-IDR is unclear. Here, we investigate the characteristics of the FAM134B-IDR by extensive modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We present detailed structural models for the IDR, mapping its conformational landscape in solution and membrane-anchored configurations. Our analysis reveals that depending on the membrane anchor, the IDRs collapse onto the membrane and induce positive membrane curvature to varying degrees. The charge patterns underlying this Janus-like behavior are conserved across other ER-phagy receptors. We found that IDRs alone are sufficient to sense curvature. When combined with RHDs, they intensify membrane remodeling and drive efficient protein clustering, leading to faster budding, thereby amplifying RHD remodeling functions. Our simulations provide a perspective on IDRs of FAM134B, their Janus-like membrane interactions, and the resulting modulatory functions during large-scale ER remodeling.",

However, the increasing cases of rat HEV infection in humans since 2018 challenged this dogma, posing increasing health threats. Herein, we investigated the underlying mechanisms dictating the zoonotic potentials of different HEV species and their possible cross-protection relationships. We found that rat HEV virus-like particles (HEV VLPs ) bound to human liver and intestinal cells/tissues with high efficiency. Moreover, rat HEV VLPs and infectious rat HEV particles penetrated the cell membrane and entered human target cells postbinding. In contrast, ferret HEV VLPs showed marginal cell binding and entry ability, bat HEV VLPs and avian HEV VLPs exhibited no binding and entry potency. Structure-based three-dimensional mapping identified that the surface spike domain of rat HEV is crucial for cell binding. Antigenic cartography indicated that rat HEV exhibited partial cross-reaction with HEV-A. Intriguingly, sera of HEV-A infected patients or human HEV vaccine Hecolin® immunized individuals provided partial cross-protection against the binding of rat HEV VLPs to human target cells. In summary, the interactions between the viral capsid and cellular receptor(s) regulate the distinct zoonotic potentials of different HEV species. The systematic characterization of antigenic cartography and serological cross-reactivity of different HEV species provide valuable insights for the development of species-specific diagnosis and protective vaccines against zoonotic HEV infection.",

A natural question arises: Is it possible to expand the 2D correlated moiré physics to one-dimensional (1D) that electron–electron correlation is expected to be further enhanced? This requires selectively doping of 1D moiré chain, which seems to be not within the grasp of today’s technology. Therefore, an experimental demonstration of the 1D moiré chain with partially filled electronic states remains absent. Here, we show that we can introduce 1D boundaries, separating two regions with different twist angles, in twisted bilayer WSe 2 (tWSe 2 ) by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and demonstrate that the electronic states of 1D moiré sites along the boundaries can be selectively filled. The strong localized charge states of correlated moiré electrons in the 1D moiré chain can be directly imaged and manipulated by combining a back-gate voltage with the STM bias voltage.

For class Ia RNRs, the radical species is stored in a separate subunit (β2) from the subunit housing the active site (α2), requiring the formation of a short-lived α2β2 complex and long-range radical transfer (RT). RT occurs via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) over a long distance (~32-Å) and involves the formation and decay of multiple amino acid radical species. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy and a mechanism-based inhibitor 2′-azido-2′-deoxycytidine-5′-diphosphate (N 3 CDP) to trap a wild-type α2β2 complex of Escherichia coli class Ia RNR. We find that one α subunit has turned over and that the other is trapped, bound to β in a midturnover state. Instead of N 3 CDP in the active site, forward RT has resulted in N 2 loss, migration of the third nitrogen from the ribose C2′ to C3′ positions, and attachment of this nitrogen to the sulfur of cysteine-225. In this study, an inhibitor has been visualized as an adduct to an RNR. Additionally, this structure reveals the positions of PCET residues following forward RT, complementing the previous structure that depicted a preturnover PCET pathway and suggesting how PCET is gated at the α–β interface. This N 3 CDP-trapped structure is also of sufficient resolution (2.6 Å) to visualize water molecules, allowing us to evaluate the proposal that water molecules are proton acceptors and donors as part of the PCET process.",

ABOs have been known since 1924, and conventional wisdom maintains that ABOs are difficult or impossible to access. We provide a solution to this long-standing problem. Our study also highlights the strategic manipulation of compounds that display considerable distortion arising from the presence of geometrically constrained π-bonds.",

We present velocity-resolved kinetics measurements for catalytic hydrogen oxidation on palladium over a wide range of surface concentrations and at high temperatures. The rates exhibit a complex dependence on oxygen coverage and step density, which can be quantitatively explained by a density functional and transition-state theory–based kinetic model involving a cooperatively stabilized configuration of at least three oxygen atoms at steps. Here, two oxygen atoms recruit a third oxygen atom to a nearby binding site to produce an active configuration that is far more reactive than isolated oxygen atoms. Thus, hydrogen oxidation on palladium provides a clear example of how reactivity can be enhanced on a working catalyst.",

ILC2s expanded and produced IL-13 in the developing brain meninges. Loss of ILC2s or IL-13 signaling to interneurons decreased inhibitory, but not excitatory, cortical synapses.

Although fundamental for plant multicellularity, the molecular events leading to bridge stabilization, as opposed to severing, remain unknown. Using electron tomography, we mapped the transition from cell plate fenestrae to plasmodesmata. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) connects daughter cells across fenestrae, and as the cell plate matures, fenestrae contract, causing the plasma membrane (PM) to mold around constricted ER tubes. The ER’s presence prevents fenestrae fusion, forming plasmodesmata, whereas its absence results in closure. The ER-PM protein tethers MCTP3, MCTP4, and MCTP6 further stabilize nascent plasmodesmata during fenestrae contraction. Genetic deletion in Arabidopsis reduces plasmodesmata formation.

Through genetic mapping, biochemical assays, and single-cell genomics, we identified a critical player in this process, the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 , which oxidizes aldehyde psittacofulvins into carboxyl forms in late-differentiating keratinocytes during feather development. The simplicity of the underlying molecular mechanism, in which a single enzyme influences the balance of red and yellow pigments, offers an explanation for the exceptional evolutionary lability of parrot coloration.",

PBP2a can replace the transpeptidase activity of the endogenous and essential PBP2 but not that of PBP1, which is responsible for the distinctive native septal peptidoglycan architecture. Successful division without PBP1 activity requires the alternative division mode and is enabled by several possible chromosomal potentiator ( pot ) mutations.

In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90°-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.",

DCP5 harbors a plant-specific intramolecular crowding sensor (ICS) that undergoes conformational change and drives phase separation in response to osmotically intensified molecular crowding. Upon hyperosmolarity exposure, DCP5 rapidly and reversibly assembles to DCP5-enriched osmotic stress granules (DOSGs), which sequestrate plenty of mRNA and regulatory proteins, and thus adaptively reprograms both the translatome and transcriptome to facilitate plant osmotic stress adaptation.

          "abstract": "Engineering the structure of grain boundaries (GBs) by solute segregation is a promising strategy to tailor the properties of polycrystalline materials. Solute segregation triggering phase transitions at GBs has been suggested theoretically to offer different pathways to design interfaces, but an understanding of their intrinsic atomistic nature is missing. We combined atomic resolution electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (“cages”) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of iron at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.",

Here, we report a “hallucination”-based protein design approach that functions in relaxed sequence space, enabling the efficient design of high-quality protein backbones over multiple scales and with broad scope of application without the need for any form of retraining. We experimentally produced and characterized more than 100 proteins. Three high-resolution crystal structures and two cryo–electron microscopy density maps of designed single-chain proteins comprising up to 1000 amino acids validate the accuracy of the method. Our pipeline can also be used to design synthetic protein-protein interactions, as validated experimentally by a set of protein heterodimers. Relaxed sequence optimization offers attractive performance with respect to designability, scope of applicability for different design problems, and scalability across protein sizes.",

In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipient’s genome. In this work, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative conjugative element (ICE) encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS) shuts down the native T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis . Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS. DNA transfer causes the strain to change allegiances so that it no longer targets ecosystem members with the same element yet is armed for communal defense.",

Synthesis science breakthroughs have been key to the realization of quantum dot technologies, but important group III–group V semiconductors, including colloidal gallium arsenide (GaAs), still cannot be synthesized with existing approaches. The high-temperature molten salt colloidal synthesis introduced in this work enables the preparation of previously intractable colloidal materials. We directly nucleated and grew colloidal quantum dots in molten inorganic salts by harnessing molten salt redox chemistry and using surfactant additives for nanocrystal shape control. Synthesis temperatures above 425°C are critical for realizing photoluminescent GaAs quantum dots, which emphasizes the importance of high temperatures enabled by molten salt solvents. We generalize the methodology and demonstrate nearly a dozen III-V solid-solution nanocrystal compositions that have not been previously reported.",

In this work, we used a chemical library of 1024 molecules—covering insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors—to assess the impact of sublethal pesticide doses on insects. In Drosophila melanogaster , 57% of chemicals affected larval behavior, and a higher proportion compromised long-term survivability. Exposure to sublethal doses also induced widespread changes in the phosphoproteome and changes in development and reproduction. The negative effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the temperature was increased. We observed similar behavioral changes across multiple insect species, including mosquitoes and butterflies. These findings suggest that widespread sublethal pesticide exposure can alter insect behavior and physiology, threatening long-term population survival.",

Using satellite data, we analyzed the daily growth rates of more than 60,000 fires from 2001 to 2020 across the contiguous US. Nearly half of the ecoregions experienced destructive fast fires that grew more than 1620 hectares in 1 day. These fires accounted for 78% of structures destroyed and 61% of suppression costs ($18.9 billion). From 2001 to 2020, the average peak daily growth rate for these fires more than doubled (+249% relative to 2001) in the Western US. Nearly 3 million structures were within 4 kilometers of a fast fire during this period across the US.

          "abstract": "Tardigrades are captivating organisms known for their resilience in extreme environments, including ultra-high-dose radiation, but the underlying mechanisms of this resilience remain largely unknown. Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov. , we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 ( DODA1 ), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains—a type of plant pigment with free radical–scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.",

There is widespread concern that they do, but little systematic evidence that search engine algorithms, rather than user-expressed preferences, are driving current exposure to and engagement with unreliable information sources. Using two datasets totaling roughly 14 billion search engine result pages (SERPs) from Bing, the second most popular search engine in the U.S., we show that search exposes users to few unreliable information sources. The vast majority of engagement with unreliable information sources from search occurs when users are explicitly searching for information from those sites, despite those searches being an extremely small share of the overall search volume. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for user preference when examining engagement with unreliable sources from web search.",

However, most curiosity research relies on small, Western convenience samples. Here, we analyze a naturalistic population of 482,760 readers using Wikipedia’s mobile app in 14 languages from 50 countries or territories. By measuring the structure of knowledge networks constructed by readers weaving a thread through articles in Wikipedia, we replicate two styles of curiosity previously identified in laboratory studies: the nomadic “busybody” and the targeted “hunter.” Further, we find evidence for another style—the “dancer”—which was previously predicted by a historico-philosophical examination of texts over two millennia and is characterized by creative modes of knowledge production. We identify associations, globally, between the structure of knowledge networks and population-level indicators of spatial navigation, education, mood, well-being, and inequality. These results advance our understanding of Wikipedia’s global readership and demonstrate how cultural and geographical properties of the digital environment relate to different styles of curiosity.",

          "abstract": "Coherent interaction between light fields and matter has led to many exotic physical phenomena, one of which is the Autler-Townes splitting originating from the optical Stark effect of a three-level system. It has been well documented for atoms, molecules, and low-dimensional, epitaxial-grown semiconductors but rarely for solution-processed samples. Here, we report on Autler-Townes splitting observed in CdSe nanoplatelets. The strong intersubband transition of these nanoplatelets situated in the near-infrared allows us to coherently drive it with femtosecond near-infrared pulses, and meanwhile, their strong interband transition in the visible records the resultant spectral changes. The splitting is most prominent with cross-polarized, linear pump-probe pulses, consistent with the orthogonal polarizations of interband and intersubband transition dipoles. When the nanoplatelets are driven from tilted incident angles, we observe anomalous spectral lineshapes arising from a competition between interband and intersubband drivings, which are nevertheless quantitatively captured by our dressed-state model simulation.",

          "abstract": "Supersonic turbulence occurs in many environments, particularly in astrophysics. In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, s , is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track s and ds dt in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of s and ds dt decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is ≈ 1 / 6 the eddy turnover time. The behaviors of the conditional averages of ds dt and d 2 s dt 2 are also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.",

In this work, we exploit the inherent confocal effect of second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy to acquire highly resolved three-dimensional (3D) images of the chiral nematic phase of CNCs in a label-free manner. An in-depth analysis revealed a direct link between the observed variations in SHG intensity and the pitch. The highly contrasted 3D images provided unprecedented detail into liquid crystal’s native structure. Local alignment, morphology, as well as the presence of defects are readily revealed, and a provisional framework relating the SHG response to the orientational distribution of CNC nanorods within the liquid crystal structure is presented. This paper illustrates the numerous benefits of using SHG microscopy for visualizing CNC chiral nematic systems directly in the suspension-liquid phase and paves the road for using SHG microscopy to characterize other types of aligned CNC structures, in wet and dry states.",

          "abstract": "Random noise in information processing systems is widely seen as detrimental to function. But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to conditions with uncertainty during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, constitutive of general intelligence, remains elusive. Here, we show that moderate levels of computation noise in artificial neural networks promote zero-shot generalization for decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike networks featuring noise-free computations, but like human participants tested on similar decision problems (ranging from probabilistic reasoning to reversal learning), noisy networks exhibit behavioral hallmarks of optimal inference in uncertain conditions entirely unseen during training. Computation noise enables this cognitive ability jointly through “structural” regularization of network weights during training and “functional” regularization by shaping the stochastic dynamics of network activity after training. Together, these findings indicate that human cognition may ride on neural variability to support adaptive decisions under uncertainty without extensive experience or engineered sophistication.",

Early-replicated vDNA segregated from the viral replication compartment (VRC). Single object tracking, superresolution microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and correlative light-electron microscopy revealed a stepwise assembly program involving vDNA and capsid intermediates. Depending on replication and the scaffolding protein 52K, late-replicated vDNA with rapidly exchanging green fluorescent protein–tagged capsid linchpin protein V and incomplete virions emerged from the VRC periphery. These nanogel-like puncta exhibited restricted movements and were located with the capsid proteins hexon, VI, and virions in the nuclear periphery, suggestive of sites for virion formation. Our findings identify VRC dynamics and assembly intermediates, essential for stepwise productive adenovirus morphogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Single molecule x-ray scattering experiments using free-electron lasers hold the potential to resolve biomolecular structures and structural ensembles. However, molecular electron density determination has so far not been achieved because of low photon counts, high noise levels, and low hit rates. Most approaches therefore focus on large specimen like entire viruses, which scatter sufficiently many photons to allow orientation determination of each image. Small specimens like proteins, however, scatter too few photons for the molecular orientations to be determined. Here, we present a rigorous Bayesian approach to overcome these limitations, additionally taking into account intensity fluctuations, beam polarization, irregular detector shapes, incoherent scattering, and background scattering. We demonstrate using synthetic scattering images that electron density determination of small proteins is possible in this extreme high noise Poisson regime. Tests on published virus data achieved the detector-limited resolution of 9 nm, using only 0.01% of the available photons per image.",

Electrohydrodynamic aerosolizing and in situ electrical poling allow instantaneous tuning of the spatial organization of biomolecular inks. We demonstrate TEA printing of β-glycine/polyvinylpyrrolidone films, and such films exhibit the piezoelectric voltage coefficient of 190 × 10 −3 volt-meters per newton, surpassing that of industry-standard lead zirconate titanate by approximately 10-fold.

Here, we demonstrate that loss of cortical actin filaments generated by the formins mDia1 and mDia3 drastically compromises cell migration and mechanics in highly adherent fibroblasts. Biophysical analysis of the mechanical properties of the mutant cells revealed a markedly softened cell cortex in the poorly adherent state. Unexpectedly, in the highly adherent state, associated with a hyperstretched morphology with exaggerated focal adhesions and prominent high-strain stress fibers, they exhibited even higher cortical tension compared to control. Notably, misguidance of intracellular forces, frequently accompanied by stress-fiber rupture, culminated in the formation of tension- and contractility-induced macroapertures, which was instantly followed by excessive lamellipodial protrusion at the periphery, providing critical insights into mechanotransduction of mechanically stressed and highly adherent cells.",

We minimize the effects of fiber photon loss by quantum frequency conversion of the qubit-native photons to the telecom L-band and by embedding the link in an extensible phase-stabilized architecture enabling the use of the loss-resilient single-click entangling protocol. By capitalizing on the full heralding capabilities of the network link in combination with real-time feedback logic on the long-lived qubits, we demonstrate the delivery of a predefined entangled state on the nodes irrespective of the heralding detection pattern.

However, it remains unknown whether this pathophysiological mechanism is conserved in humans. Here, we used an invasive in vivo mechanistic approach to interrogate muscle insulin action while selectively manipulating the mitochondrial redox state in humans. To this end, we conducted insulin clamp studies combining intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mitoquinone). Under lipid overload, selective modulation of mitochondrial redox state by mitoquinone enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, mitoquinone did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation while reducing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Complementary ex vivo studies in human muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels revealed that mitoquinone improves features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H 2 O 2 emission. These findings provide translational and mechanistic evidence implicating mitochondrial oxidants in the development of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans.",

The long-standing vision of lakes as solely respirators of the organic matter leaking from the soils has been challenged by evidence that inorganic carbon produced by weathering of the catchment bedrock could also support lake CO 2 emissions. How inorganic carbon inputs ultimately generate lake CO 2 outgassing remains a blind spot. We develop and introduce a calcite module in a coupled one-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model that we use to simulate the carbon cycle of the large Lake Geneva over the past 40 years. We mechanistically demonstrate how the so-far neglected process of calcite precipitation boosts net CO 2 emissions at the annual scale.

We reconstruct patterns in mineral aerosol flux from East Asia, the second largest global dust source, in a peat mire in northern Japan. Using geochemical fingerprinting, we show for the past ~3600 years that high but variable tephra flux dominated regional aerosol loads. A human signal was discernible as elevated pollutant metals, along with East Asian mainland dust, identifiable by its geochemical signature. After ~700 years before the present, dust flux increased as the westerly jet intensified and moved south, the summer monsoon strength reduced, and agriculture expanded. From the 20th century, dust flux increased by two times. Attributable largely to human activity, this demarks a major change in aerosol export to the northwestern Pacific with accompanying increases in fluxes for key micronutrients and increased pollution flux by 16 times.",

In this study, we introduce a 15-mm-long legged microrobot, BHMbot-B, which is capable of rapid forward and backward locomotion through vibration mode transition control. By properly arranging the vibratory motions of the magnet, cantilever, and linkages, the pitching movement of the body and the vibration of the forelegs are in phase during the first-order vibration mode of the cantilever and in antiphase during the second-order mode, which induces the forward and backward movement of the microrobot. Owing to its outstanding load-bearing capacity, the BHMbot-B equipped with dual electromagnetic actuators, an onboard battery, and a control circuit, can execute complex running trajectories under wireless command. Its maximum untethered running speeds are evaluated as 18.0 BL/s (360 mm/s) in the forward direction and 16.9 BL/s (338 mm/s) in the backward direction.",

          "abstract": "Social dominance is essential for maintaining a stable society and has both positive and negative impacts on social animals, including humans. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing social dominance, as well as the crucial regulators and biomarkers involved, remain poorly understood. We discover that mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 2 (ASIC2) exhibit persistently higher social dominance than their wild-type cagemates. Conversely, overexpression of ASIC2 in the medial prefrontal cortex reverses the dominance hierarchy observed in ASIC2 knockout ( Asic2 −/− ) mice. Asic2 −/− neurons exhibit increased synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially mediated by protein kinase A signaling pathway. Furthermore, ASIC2 plays distinct functional roles in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, thereby modulating the balance of neuronal activities underlying social dominance behaviors—a phenomenon suggestive of a cell subtype–specific mechanism. This research lays the groundwork for understanding the mechanisms of social dominance, offering potential insights for managing social disorders, such as depression and anxiety.",

While the proneural factor achaete-scute complex-like 1 ( Ascl1 ) is widely used for neuronal reprogramming, in the early postnatal mouse cortex, Ascl1 fails to induce the glia-to-neuron conversion, instead promoting the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). Since Ascl1 activity is posttranslationally regulated, here, we investigated the consequences of mutating six serine phospho-acceptor sites to alanine (Ascl1SA6) on lineage reprogramming in vivo. Ascl1SA6 exhibited increased neurogenic activity in the glia of the early postnatal mouse cortex, an effect enhanced by coexpression of B cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl2 ). Genetic fate-mapping revealed that most induced neurons originated from astrocytes, while only a few derived from OPCs. Many Ascl1SA6/Bcl2-induced neurons expressed parvalbumin and were capable of high-frequency action potential firing. Our study demonstrates the authentic conversion of astroglia into neurons featuring subclass hallmarks of cortical interneurons, advancing our scope of engineering neuronal fates in the brain.",

Toxoplasma gondii macrophage migration inhibitory factor (TgMIF), a protein homolog of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, has been explored for its potential to modulate immune responses during MTB infections. We observed that TgMIF that interacts with CD74, antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) modulates endocytosis, restoration of mitochondrial function, and macrophage polarization, respectively. These interactions promote therapeutic efficacy in mice infected with MTB, thereby presenting a potential route to host-directed therapy development. Furthermore, TgMIF, in combination with first-line TB drugs, significantly inhibited drug-resistant MTB strains, including multidrug-resistant TB.

Here, we demonstrate that intracellular S. aureus surviving well even in the presence of vancomycin can be effectively eliminated using an emerging cell-mimicking therapeutic strategy. These cell mimics with natural killer cell–like activity (NKMs) are composed of a redox-responsive degradable carrier, and perforin and granzyme B within the carrier.

We investigated how migrations of diverse fish community from Lake Biwa, Japan contribute to nutrient inputs in one of the lake’s tributary rivers and how they influence the ecosystem. Sequential migration of six fish species continued for 8 months of a year, causing high-level nutrient concentration and primary production. The fish-derived resources were taken up by diverse members of the river community.

Epithelial injury during colitis is associated with transient stem cell reprogramming from the adult, homeostatic to a “fetal-like” regenerative state. Here, we use murine and organoid-based models to study the role of Trp53 during epithelial reprogramming. We find that p53 signaling is silent and dispensable during homeostasis but strongly up-regulated in the epithelium upon DSS-induced colitis. While in WT cells this causes termination of the regenerative state, crypts that lack Trp53 remain locked in the highly proliferative, regenerative state long-term. The regenerative state in WT cells requires high Wnt signaling to maintain elevated levels of glycolysis. Instead, Trp53 deficiency enables Wnt-independent glycolysis due to overexpression of rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. Our study reveals the context-dependent relevance of p53 signaling specifically in the injury-induced regenerative state, explaining the high abundance of clones lacking p53 signaling in UC and UC-associated CRC.",

While the nonlinear current-voltage ( I - V ) characteristics of the former two categories have been extensive research topics recently, those of the last category remains unexplored. Among them, the quantum Hall current is a representative example. Realized in two-dimensional electronic systems under a strong magnetic field, the topological protection quantizes the Hall conductance in the unit of e 2 / h ( e , elementary charge; and h , Planck constant), of which the edge transport picture gives a good account. Here, we theoretically study the nonlinear I - V H characteristic of the edge transport up to third order in V H . We find that nonlinearity arises in the Hall response from electron-electron interaction between the counterpropagating edge channels with the nonlinear energy dispersions.

We find that brain areas critically involved in observing conspecifics interacting (i) develop in clusters, (ii) have prolonged developmental trajectories, (iii) differentiate during the period of negotiations between immatures and multiple caregivers, and (iv) do not share stronger connectivity than with other regions. Overall, developmental timing of social brain areas correlates with social and behavioral milestones in marmosets and, as in humans, extends into adulthood.

We have investigated the structure and bonding of Bi 18 − to understand its remarkable resistance to oxidation. We find that the most stable structure of Bi 18 − consists of two Bi 8 cages linked by a Bi 2 dimer, where each atom is bonded to three neighboring atoms. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that each Bi uses its three 6 p electrons to form three covalent bonds with its neighbors, resulting in a Bi 18 − cluster without any dangling bonds. We find that the robust Bi 18 framework along with the totally delocalized unpaired electron is responsible for the surprising inertness of Bi 18 − toward O 2 .

Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB.

Many stresses, such as telomere shortening and oncogene activation, induce senescence by damaging nuclear DNA. However, the mechanisms linking DNA damage to senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to mitochondria triggers senescence. A genome-wide small interfering RNA screen implicated the outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein BNIP3 in senescence induction. We found that BNIP3 is phosphorylated by the DDR kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and contributes to an increase in the number of mitochondrial cristae. Stable isotope labeling metabolomics indicated that the increase in cristae enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). This promotes histone acetylation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a . Notably, pharmacological activation of FAO alone induced senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, mitochondrial energy metabolism plays a critical role in senescence induction and is a potential intervention target to control senescence.",

Nanoscale imaging supported by atomic-scale molecular simulations tracked the adsorption and proliferation of oligomeric assemblies at nonperiodically spaced catalytic sites on the fibril surface. Upon confirming that fibril edges are preferential binding sites for oligomers during embryonic stages, the secondary fibrillar size changes were quantified during the growth stages.

          "abstract": "Insects have evolved diverse ecological flight behaviors and adaptations that played a key role in their large-scale evolutionary patterns. However, the evolution of their flight performance is poorly understood because reconstructing flight abilities of extinct insects is highly challenging. Here, we propose an integrated approach to reveal the evolution of flight performance of Palaeontinidae (giant cicadas), a Mesozoic arboreal insect clade with large bodies and wings. Our analyses unveil a faunal turnover from early to late Palaeontinidae during the latest Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous, accompanied by a morphological adaptive shift and remarkable improvement in flight abilities including increased flight speed and enhanced maneuverability. The adaptive aerodynamic evolution of Palaeontinidae may have been stimulated by the rise of early birds, supporting the hypothesis of an aerial evolutionary arms race (Air Race) between Palaeontinidae and birds. Our results provide a potential example of predator-induced morphological and behavioral macroevolution and contribute to our understanding of how powered flight has shaped animal evolution.",

We show that a locus containing two CBASS and one type III-B CRISPR-Cas system, regulated by the transmembrane anti-σ DdvA and its cognate extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ DdvS, can defend Myxococcus xanthus against a phage. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals DdvA-DdvS pairs assemble as arrow-shaped transmembrane dimers. Each DdvA periplasmic domain adopts a separase/craspase-type tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)–caspase HetF–associated with TPR (TPR-CHAT) architecture with an incomplete His-Cys active site, lacking three α-helices conserved among CHAT domains. Each active site faces the dimer interface, raising the possibility that signal-induced caspase-like DdvA autoproteolysis in trans precedes RseP-mediated intramembrane proteolysis and DdvS release. Nuclear magnetic resonance reveals a DdvA cytoplasmic CHCC-type zinc-bound three-helix bundle that binds to DdvS σ 2 and σ 4 domains, undergoing σ 4 -induced helix extension to trap DdvS.

Among these, two ALS-causing mutants, histidine-46→arginine (H46R) and glycine-85→arginine (G85R), exhibit a decreased capacity to bind metal ions. Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of amyloid fibrils formed by H46R and G85R. These mutations lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils with unique structures distinct from those of the native fibril. The core of these fibrils features a serpentine arrangement with seven or eight β strands, secured by a hydrophobic cavity and a salt bridge between arginine-85 and aspartic acid–101 in the G85R fibril. We demonstrate that these mutant fibrils are notably more toxic and capable of promoting the aggregation of wild-type SOD1 more effectively, causing mitochondrial impairment and activating ferroptosis in cell cultures, compared to wild-type SOD1 fibrils. Our study provides insights into the structural mechanisms by which SOD1 mutants aggregate and induce cytotoxicity in ALS.",

Here, we aimed to better elucidate this relationship in healthy volunteers, using transcranial temporal interference electric stimulation (tTIS), a noninvasive technique allowing to selectively neuromodulate deep brain structures. We applied tTIS to the right HC-EC in either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation patterns (cTBS or iTBS), compared to a control condition, during a virtual reality–based spatial navigation task and concomitant functional magnetic resonance imaging. iTBS improved spatial navigation performance, correlated with hippocampal activity modulation, and decreased grid cell–like activity in EC. Collectively, these data provide the evidence that human HC-EC activity can be directly and noninvasively modulated leading to changes of spatial navigation behavior. These findings suggest promising perspectives for patients suffering from cognitive impairment such as following traumatic brain injury or dementia.",

We show that acetylations at two sites, K373 and K382, were reduced in the second pulse, and these acetylations differentially affected p53 target genes, resulting in changes in gene expression programs over time.

          "abstract": "The evolutionary transition from early synapsids to therian mammals involved profound reorganization in locomotor anatomy and function, centered around a shift from “sprawled” to “erect” limb postures. When and how this functional shift was accomplished has remained difficult to decipher from the fossil record alone. Through biomechanical modeling of hindlimb force-generating performance in eight exemplar fossil synapsids, we demonstrate that the erect locomotor regime typifying modern therians did not evolve until just before crown Theria. Modeling also identifies a transient phase of increased performance in therapsids and early cynodonts, before crown mammals. Further, quantifying the global actions of major hip muscle groups indicates a protracted juxtaposition of functional redeployment and conservatism, highlighting the intricate interplay between anatomical reorganization and function across postural transitions. We infer a complex history of synapsid locomotor evolution and suggest that major evolutionary transitions between contrasting locomotor behaviors may follow highly nonlinear trajectories.",

However, reducing the camera thickness faces challenges primarily due to the thick lens systems. Current lens systems, composed of stacked refractive lenses, are fundamentally constrained from becoming thinner due to the presence of empty spaces between lenses and the excessive volume of each lens. Here, we present a lens system using metasurface folded optics to overcome these pervasive issues. In our design, metasurfaces are arranged horizontally on a glass wafer and direct light along multifolded paths inside the substrate. This approach achieves an ultra-slim lens system with a thickness of 0.7 millimeters and 2× thinner relative to the EFL, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional optical platforms. It delivers quasi-diffraction–limited imaging quality with a 10° field of view and an f number of 4 at an operational wavelength of 852 nanometers.

Here, we report that caspase-2–driven apoptosis is elicited in blood cells failing cytokinesis and that extra centrosomes are necessary to trigger this cell death. Activation of caspase-2 depends on the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, and priming of PIDD1 at extra centrosomes is necessary for pathway activation. Accordingly, loss of its centrosomal adapter, ANKRD26, allows for cell survival and unrestricted polyploidization in response to cytokinesis failure. Mechanistically, cell death is initiated upstream of mitochondria via caspase-2–mediated processing of the BCL2 family protein BID, driving BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Remarkably, BID-deficient cells enforce apoptosis by engaging p53-dependent proapoptotic transcriptional responses initiated by caspase-2. Consistently, BID and MDM2 act as shared caspase-2 substrates, with BID being kinetically favored. Our findings document that the centrosome limits its own unscheduled duplication by the induction of PIDDosome-driven mitochondrial apoptosis to avoid potentially pathogenic polyploidization events.",

Dosing with interleukin-15 (IL-15) enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity in hypoxia, but preactivation with feeder cells bearing IL-21 and 4-1BBL was even better. Preactivation resulted in less perturbed metabolism in hypoxia; greater resistance to oxidative stress; and no hypoxia-induced loss of transcription factors (T-bet and Eomes), activating receptors, adhesion molecules (CD2), and cytotoxic proteins (TRAIL and FasL). There remained a deficit in CD122/IL-2Rβ when exposed to hypoxia, which affected IL-15 signaling.

Nonetheless, despite the vast advancement of olefination methodologies, the broadly applicable stereoselective synthesis remained elusive for geminal bromofluoroalkenes before our work. In particular, the seemingly straightforward Wittig-type approach with interhalogenated phosphorus ylide has been unsuccessful because of the difficulty in the diastereoselective oxaphosphetane formation. Here, we describe a conceptually distinctive strategy, by which the stereoselectivity is gained via the selective decomposition of the oxaphosphetane intermediates. The suitably identified phosphorus(III) reagent and reaction medium enabled efficient kinetic differentiation, which was supported by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and density functional theory calculation. Through our method, the highly diastereoselective synthesis of geminal E -bromofluoroalkenes was accomplished in one step.

Alderenes comprise only 0.1% of slug wet weight, yet rendered live slugs or dead flesh unpalatable to three co-occurring consumers, making a potential food resource unavailable and redirecting energy flow in critical nursery habitat.
