          "abstract": "Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut 1–3 . However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations 4,5 . We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.",

          "abstract": "Quantum computers promise to tackle quantum simulation problems that are classically intractable 1 . Although a lot of quantum algorithms 2–4 have been developed for simulating quantum dynamics, a general-purpose method for simulating low-temperature quantum phenomena remains unknown. In classical settings, the analogous task of sampling from thermal distributions has been largely addressed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 5,6 . Here we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for thermal simulation that—akin to MCMC methods—exhibits detailed balance, respects locality and serves as a toy model for thermalization in open quantum systems. The enduring impact of MCMC methods suggests that our new construction may play an equally important part in quantum computing and applications in the physical sciences and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail 1 . However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water 2,3 , in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered 4,5 . The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes 6–9 . Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM) 10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m −1 , close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.",

          "abstract": "Recalled memories become transiently labile and require stabilization 1–3 . The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear 4 . Here we identify an astrocytic ensemble that is transcriptionally primed by emotional experience and functionally triggered by repeated experience to stabilize labile memory. Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams 5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.",

The antigenic evolution of the A(H5) haemagglutinin (HA) poses challenges for pandemic preparedness and vaccine design 6 . Here the global antigenic evolution of the A(H5) HA was captured in a high-resolution antigenic map. The map was used to design immunogenic and antigenically central vaccine HA antigens, eliciting antibody responses that broadly cover the A(H5) antigenic space. In ferrets, a central antigen protected as well as homologous vaccines against heterologous infection with two antigenically distinct viruses. This work showcases the rational design of subtype-wide influenza A(H5) pre-pandemic vaccines and demonstrates the value of antigenic maps for the evaluation of vaccine-induced immune responses through antibody profiles.",

          "abstract": "All mammalian organs depend on resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair and facilitate tissue-specific functions 1–3 . Functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through a combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment 4,5 . Declines in macrophage abundance and function have been linked to age-associated pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegeneration 6–8 . However, the mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within ageing tissues remain largely unclear. Here we show that capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behaviour in vivo, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in live mice to non-invasively image the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined vascular niche that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost at a rate exceeding capillary loss, resulting in macrophage-deficient vascular niches in both mice and humans. CAM phagocytic activity was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-deficient niches selectively vulnerable under homeostatic and injury conditions. Our study demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is less precisely regulated than previously suggested 9–11 . Specifically, neighbouring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize to compensate for macrophage loss without injury or increased growth factors, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). These limitations in macrophage renewal may represent early and targetable contributors to tissue ageing.",

          "abstract": "Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2 ), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces 3,4 . Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering 5–11 .",

          "abstract": "The site-specific encoding of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides a powerful tool for expanding the functional repertoire of proteins 1–4 . Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by the low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. Here we reveal poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 5 to actively import easily synthesizable isopeptide-linked tripeptides that are processed into ncAAs within the cell. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal 6 and crosslinker 7 moieties, post-translational modifications 8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that engineering of uptake systems is a powerful strategy for programmable import of chemically diverse building blocks.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying physical mechanisms driving sea-level change—including global mean sea level (GMSL) and regional-to-local components (that is, sea-level budget)—is essential for reliable future projections and effective coastal management 1,2 . Although previous research has attempted to resolve China’s sea-level budget from the 1950s 3,4 , these studies capture short timescales and lack the long-term context necessary to fully assess modern sea-level rise in southeastern China 5 —one of the world’s most densely populated regions with immense socioeconomic importance 6 . Here we show that GMSL followed three distinct stages from 11,700 years before present (BP) to the modern day: (1) rapid early Holocene rise driven by the deglacial melt of land ice; (2) 4,000 years of stability from around 4200 BP to the mid-nineteenth century when regional processes dominated sea-level change; and (3) accelerating rise from the mid-nineteenth century. Our results arise from spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data to produce site-specific sea-level budget estimates with uncertainty quantification. It is extremely likely ( P ≥ 0.95) that the GMSL rise rate since 1900 (1.51 ± 0.16 mm year −1 , 1 σ ) has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia. Moreover, our analysis indicates that at least 94% of rapid modern urban subsidence is attributable to anthropogenic activities, with localized subsidence rates often exceeding GMSL rise. Such concurrent acceleration of global sea-level rise and rapid localized subsidence has not been observed in our Holocene geological record.",

          "authors": "Ari Winbush, Daniel McDuff, John Hernandez, Andrew Barakat, Allen Jiang, Conor Heneghan, Benjamin W. Nelson, Nicholas B. Allen",
          "abstract": "Smartphones are essential tools in daily life yet concerns persist about their potential effects on mental health and well-being. Research on these relationships often relies on subjective measures of smartphone use, which can lack validity. These studies are also often limited by small, homogenous samples and the inability to differentiate between types of smartphone activities (e.g., social media vs. other applications). In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance. These findings suggest that smartphone use has a limited or negligible impact on mood and well-being over a 4-wk period and do not support claims of a strong or causal relationship between smartphone use and mental well-being across this timeframe.",

          "abstract": "The statistical properties of data are often communicated using visual graphs, like scatterplots. However, decision makers make systematic errors when processing these graphs, with important consequences for statistical communication in science, medicine, and policy. We propose that decision makers are Bayesian learners, who learn optimally given the data points that they attend to. Accordingly, judgment errors arise from biased sampling of information from graphs. We tested our theory in four eye-tracking experiments (total N = 421), in which participants made correlation judgments from scatterplots of both experimentally manipulated data (Experiment 1) and real data (Experiment 2), as well as plots with different display formats (Experiments 3 and 4). Participants’ judgments displayed several known biases, including underestimation of absolute correlations and sensitivity to irrelevant visual features. Importantly, the (optimal) Bayesian belief updating model, trained on the sensory inputs from visual information search, predicted both participants’ judgments and associated biases with high accuracy in all the experiments. Additionally, a computational model of participants’ information sampling processes, combined with the Bayesian model, reproduced all behavioral regularities. These results shed light on the cognitive mechanisms of belief formation, show how statistical judgments can be quantitatively predicted and manipulated, and provide insights for data visualization and statistical communication.",

          "abstract": "Humans start new friendships and social connections throughout their lives and such relationships foster mental and physical well-being. While friendship initiation may depend on alignment of subtle and complex personal variables, here we investigated whether it also depends on basic features of social environments. In a preregistered online study (n = 783) using a novel social-affiliation seeking paradigm, we found people were more likely to send friend requests as the density of friendship opportunities decreased and frequency of success increased. Further, we found task-related measures, like overall friend requests, were correlated with mental health dimensions like social thriving and anhedonia. Next, in an ultra-high-field fMRI study (n = 24), we found that both fundamental features of social environments--opportunity density and frequency of success--affected neural activity across a network of regions linked to foraging including dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and anterior insula. Thus, humans consider the background statistics of an environment while making social decisions and these decisions are linked to activity in cortico-subcortical circuits mediating the influence of environmental statistics on other aspects of behavior. Moreover, individual differences in how environmental features influence social behavior are associated with variation in mental health dimensions, offering key insights into interindividual variability in social functioning.",

          "abstract": "The digital revolution has ushered in many societal and economic benefits. Yet access to digital technologies such as mobile phones and internet remains highly unequal, especially by gender in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While national-level estimates are increasingly available for many countries, reliable, quantitative estimates of digital gender inequalities at the subnational level are lacking. These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,075 regions in 117 LMICs from 2015 through 2025, a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large. We construct these estimates by applying machine-learning algorithms to Facebook user counts, geospatial data, development indicators, and population composition data. We calibrate and assess the performance of these algorithms using ground-truth data from subnationally representative household survey data from 33 LMICs. Our results reveal striking disparities in access to mobile and internet technologies between and within LMICs. These disparities imply that as of 2025, women are 19% less likely to use the internet and 8% less likely to own a mobile phone in LMICs, corresponding to over 190 million fewer women owning a mobile phone and over 320 million fewer women using the internet.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings—NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check—and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability—a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.",

          "abstract": "Common workplace challenges such as feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or disengaged often remain hidden due to fear of judgment or social norms, contributing to rising mental health crises and organizational dysfunction. This study presents a brain-based framework for predicting these hidden and persistent psychological states through noninvasive neuroimaging. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record neural activity from 67 executives in the field as they watched a video about workplace attitudes. We then applied a multitimepoint pattern analysis (MTPA) approach to reduce timeseries dimensionality and successfully classify whether individuals were feeling overwhelmed (72.8% accuracy) or in need of a new or different challenge (79.1% accuracy) in their careers using the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), respectively. The MTPA framework also allowed us to reverse-engineer specific thematic properties of the stimulus that evoked differential neural responses linked to these predicted outcomes. Emotional content in the video (e.g., reported distress) corresponded to the selected TPJ features that predicted whether someone was overwhelmed, while socially relevant content (e.g., missing social gatherings) aligned with the selected features from the dmPFC that predicted the need for a new or different challenge. These findings demonstrate the ability of neural measures to unobtrusively identify hidden and persistent psychological states in real-world settings, enabling targeted interventions that can improve well-being and engagement.",

Our methodology integrates four well-documented models to estimate changes in power outage rates, sociodemographic inequities, and economic costs due to tropical cyclone projections. Synthetic tropical cyclones were generated using data from seven global climate models (GCMs), used to compare power outage risks at the census tract level along two periods: hindcast (1995–2014) and late-century (2071–2100) using the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The late-century results from each model were scaled to align with a global warming scenario of 3 °C. We evaluated the uncertainty of these projections by considering the agreement among the GCMs outage projections. Results highlight a significant increase in power outage risks and high agreement in northern Florida, Georgia, the mid-Atlantic, and the North Atlantic coast. Distributional impact analyses indicate higher outage risks for Hispanic, non-White, and low-income populations, while economic projections show annual costs rising from $6.2 billion in the hindcast to over $11 billion for the 3 °C scenario. The findings highlight the need for adaptive strategies and equitable resource allocation to mitigate these growing risks due to future climate projections.",

Here, we explore how DNA segregation and division are mechanistically coupled in archaeal relatives of eukaryotes, which lack Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/Cyclins. Using live cell imaging, we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organization that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modeling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembled a division ring—which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depend, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.",

          "abstract": "Pathogenic threats to reproductive individuals pose a profound challenge to the stability of insect societies. In honey bees ( Apis mellifera L.), severe virus infections in queens can trigger worker-initiated supersedure, a socially coordinated replacement of the queen that, while risky, is essential when her reproductive competence is compromised. How viruses impact the physiology of queen hosts, who bear unique reproductive burdens within their colonies, and how this perturbs colony social order remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the supersedure response is mediated by pathogen-induced, intensity-dependent changes in queen pheromonal signaling. Laboratory infection experiments revealed that queens challenged with deformed wing virus B and black queen cell virus infections demonstrated a reduction in methyl oleate, a key component of the queen retinue pheromone, and field data corroborated this association. Lipidomics analysis demonstrated that infection coincides with a systemic lipid deficiency, especially in triacylglycerides (major energy reserves), providing a physiological link among viral stress, ovarian atrophy, and altered pheromone output. Notably, artificial suppression of ovary investment via restricted laying also caused methyl oleate production to decline; therefore, high virus infection likely indirectly suppresses methyl oleate production by reducing ovary mass. In field trials, we further show that synthetic pheromone blends containing methyl oleate significantly suppressed queen cell rearing compared to no-pheromone controls, whereas blends lacking this compound yielded an intermediate effect. These results demonstrate that virus-induced reproductive decline disrupts pheromone signaling, revealing a plausible mechanistic pathway by which pathogens can erode social cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Sperm motility is essential for male fertility and is tightly controlled by signaling events in the flagellum. Slc9c1 encodes a sperm-specific Na + /H + exchanger (sNHE/SLC9C1) that localizes to the flagellum and is indispensable for sperm motility and male fertility. SLC9C1 is unique among Na + /H + exchangers in that it possesses a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), the physiological function of which remains poorly understood in mammals. Here, by analyzing coevolving genes with Slc9c1 , we identified Tmem217 , which encodes a transmembrane protein that is localized in the sperm flagellum. Knockout (KO) of Tmem217 in mice resulted in sperm motility defects and male infertility, phenocopying Slc9c1 KO mice. Coimmunoprecipitation and structural prediction analyses indicated that TMEM217 binds to SLC9C1 via its VSD. Further analyses indicated that the amounts of SLC9C1 and its associated protein, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), were lost in mature Tmem217 KO spermatozoa, leading to disrupted 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Remarkably, cAMP analogs restored the impaired motility and fertilizing ability of Tmem217 KO spermatozoa in vitro, validating the essential role of TMEM217 in regulating cAMP production. Our findings indicate that the association of TMEM217 with SLC9C1 via its VSD is critical for the proper organization and function of the SLC9C1–sAC–cAMP axis in mature spermatozoa.",

It is widely assumed that the content of Ca 2+ in the glutamate-elicited ionic flux is determined by the molecular composition of the NMDA receptors, whose expression varies developmentally and across brain regions and can change on a scale of minutes to hours. Here, we report that rather than being a fixed property of a given receptor assembly, the amount of Ca 2+ in the NMDA receptor current can fluctuate in real time over a wide dynamic range in response to endogenous and synthetic allosteric modulators. We identify the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor as a structural modulator of its Ca 2+ permeability and demonstrate that the mechanism involves changes in the receptor’s unitary Ca 2+ conductance. These results reveal an unsuspected lever controlling the NMDA receptor–mediated Ca 2+ transients and, implicitly, the many physiological and pathological processes influenced by these currents.",

Given that M. tb, M. bovis, and M. orygis pose significant threats to the health of humans and animals, we sought to understand fundamental differences in pathogenicity among these closely related organisms. Building upon historical observations, we conducted a comparative virulence assessment of these pathogens using both bovine and murine infection models. Holstein calves were infected via aerosol with M. tb, M. bovis, or M. orygis , and pathology was analyzed through macroscopic and microscopic assessments of lungs and lymph nodes, along with quantitative tissue bacterial burden measurements. In C57BL/6 mice, we compared virulence using three readouts, namely survival, lethal dose determination, and detailed pathological assessments. Despite genomic similarity, animal-adapted MTBCs consistently showed dramatically enhanced virulence compared to M. tb with distinct immunopathology and, in the murine model, mortality within 24 days. Using gene disruption studies guided by proteomic comparisons, we determined that these infection outcomes were dependent on shared (ESAT-6) and lineage-associated (MPT70) virulence factors, the route of infection, and prior infection or immunization. Our findings reveal unexpected virulence hierarchies within the MTBC, with fundamental and translational implications for tuberculosis research.",

          "abstract": "The Earth’s earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surrounding the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10 4 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surpassing the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron’s incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth’s basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity, to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth’s basal magma ocean over time.",

Although spontaneous Ca 2+ MDs are present throughout the brain, their putative role is unknown. Here, we question whether, owing to their recurring signaling mode, spontaneous Ca 2+ MDs contribute to slowly evolving phenomena in the brain, such as memory consolidation. We demonstrate that, in the perirhinal cortex, a central region in recognition memory, these events promote Ca 2+ -dependent gliotransmission and modulate synaptic strengthening. Their recurring activity extends the release of the gliotransmitter brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) over time, ensuring the sustained Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase B (TrkB)-signaling required for the consolidation of long-term synaptic potentiation and lasting memories. We also show that Ca 2+ MDs, which are stochastic events, preserve their random behavior during gliotransmission, introducing an element of unpredictability into the process of memory retention. Our study assigns to spontaneous, stochastic activity in astrocytes a unique functional role in shaping and stabilizing memory circuits.",

These conditions are often devastating and lack effective therapies. In this study, we developed precise base editing (BE) strategies targeting the human LMNA gene variants L35P and R249Q, which cause congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (DCM-CD), respectively. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) carrying the R249Q mutation displayed nuclear aberrations, DNA damage, and abnormal Ca 2+ transients. Similarly, L35P iPSC-CMs exhibited abnormal contraction, DNA damage, and reduced Lamin A/C protein expression. We also generated “humanized” mouse models carrying these pathogenic human mutations. R249Q homozygous mice exhibited cardiac conduction abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and premature death. Mice with the homozygous L35P mutation displayed severe muscle-wasting and reduced lifespan, while heterozygous L35P mice displayed DCM. We developed an adenine base editing (ABE) approach for correcting the R249Q mutation and a cytosine base editing (CBE) strategy for the L35P variant. Precise correction of these mutations in iPSC-CMs successfully rescued all of the in vitro abnormalities. Furthermore, delivery of the BE components using adeno-associated virus prevented the pathological phenotypes and extended longevity of mice carrying the LMNA L35P and the R249Q mutations. These results demonstrate the efficacy of ABE and CBE in correcting pathogenic LMNA mutations that cause cardiac disease, highlighting BE as a promising therapeutic approach for human laminopathies.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, the connection between physics and topology has resulted in the discovery of several new phenomena. A celebrated example is the field of topological insulators [X.-L. Qi, S.-C. Zhang, Rev. Mod. Phys. 83 , 1057–1110 (2011)]., in which topological quantities describing the bulk medium response in reciprocal space dictate the presence of protected transport states at the boundary of a finite sample. Broken symmetries in the microscopic structure of a material play a prominent role in determining its topological features relevant to these phenomena. As another landmark phenomenon driven by broken symmetries, twistronics leverages the rotation angle between coupled layers to control in extreme ways the dispersion topology, leading to flat-band superconductivity [Y. Cao et al. , Nature 556 , 43–50 (2018)] and topological transitions for polaritons [G. Hu et al. , Nature 582 , 209–213 (2020)]. Here, we apply these concepts to elastodynamic waves, and exploit the twist degree-of-freedom to control broken symmetries in the microscopic structure of elastic metasurfaces, demonstrating extreme wave control. We predict and experimentally demonstrate topological transitions within twisted elastodynamic metasurfaces, which we harness for broadband, reconfigurable, and robust manipulation of phonons. Our twist-elastic approach opens alternative directions in microelectronics, microfluidics, and ultrasound sensing, leveraging precise multifunctional engineering of mechanical vibrations of relevance to many modern technologies.",

Here, we identify TMEM16F, a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase, as a driver of tumor-intrinsic PS externalization. TMEM16F-mediated PS scrambling polarized macrophages to an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, which promotes TGF-β1 secretion and regulatory T cell expansion to suppress cytotoxic lymphocytes. Genetic ablation of TMEM16F abolished PS exposure, systemically reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment and primary immune organs toward immune activation, and suppressed tumor growth across cancer models.

          "abstract": "Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a Tec-family tyrosine kinase, resembles the Src and Abl kinases in that an SH2-SH3 module regulates the activity of the kinase domain, principally through an inhibitory interaction between the SH3 and kinase domains. In Src-family kinases, phosphorylation of a C-terminal tail latches the SH2 domain onto the kinase domain, stabilizing the inhibitory conformation of the SH3 domain; in Abl, interaction between the kinase domain and a myristoyl group on the N-terminal segment provides a similar latching function. The structure of autoinhibited BTK resembles that of the Src and Abl kinases, but BTK lacks an obvious SH2-kinase latch. To assess the role of the SH2 domain in autoinhibition of BTK, we generated hundreds of chimeric BTK molecules in which the native SH2 domain is replaced by other SH2 domains. We measured the fitness of these chimeric proteins using a high-throughput assay in T and B cells. Surprisingly, many SH2 domains increased fitness when substituted into BTK. Analysis of one set of chimeric proteins indicates that the increase in fitness stems from the ability of the substituted SH2 domains to disrupt BTK autoinhibition while maintaining phosphotyrosine targeting. Thus, although BTK lacks a specialized latch, distributed interactions between the SH2 and kinase domains stabilize the autoinhibitory conformation of BTK. While phosphotyrosine recognition can be conferred on BTK by evolutionarily distant SH2 domains, autoinhibition requires specific interactions with the kinase domain that arose through evolutionary refinement of the regulatory mechanism, and is less easily mimicked by heterologous SH2 domains.",

          "abstract": "Structure elucidation via single-crystal methods has historically lacked experimental access to real-space information, instead relying exclusively on diffraction-space measurements of Bragg reflections. Here we exploit the dual-space imaging power of 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy to meaningfully integrate real-space information into the crystallographic workflow. We show that virtual apertures assembled by segmentation of high-angle annular dark-field images enable i) pixel-by-pixel separation of coherent Bragg signal from clusters of closely spaced nanocrystals and ii) selective extraction of integrated intensities from thinner subregions of individual specimens, facilitating retroactive tuning of multiple scattering artifacts. This strategy empowers us to simply pick and choose whichever nanoscale regions of interest generate the highest-quality diffraction patterns, allowing us to solve several independent structures of the metal-organic framework UiO-66 from specimens whose agglomerated morphology proved intractable for conventional microcrystal electron diffraction. Our method is compatible with both rotational and serial approaches to data processing, ultimately divulging the first scanning nanobeam electron diffraction structures determined by direct methods at subangstrom resolution.",

          "abstract": "Altered psychomotor behavior in psychosis is poorly understood. Novel insights into the physiology of the motor cortex prompted a revision of the motor homunculus. Next to core motor effector areas, the primary motor cortex (M1) contains intereffector regions with more integrative connectivity patterns, suggestive of serving psychomotor behavior. Here, we test whether patterns of connectivity differ between patients with and without psychomotor slowing and which cortical areas are associated with aberrant motor behavior in psychosis. This resting-state functional MRI study included 83 patients with psychosis and psychomotor slowing, 43 patients without psychomotor slowing, and 63 matched healthy subjects. We tested group differences in connectivity and regressed motor behavior measures with connectivity in patients with psychomotor slowing. Across subjects, we found distinct rs-fMRI connectivity profiles of the intereffector areas in M1, extending to premotor cortices and cerebellum. Patients with psychomotor slowing had stronger connectivity from the intereffectors than controls or patients without slowing. Finally, motor behavior correlated with connectivity from M1 intereffector regions in patients. Connectivity profiles of intereffectors suggest a role in planning and controlling complex behavioral repertoires. Collectively, these findings in patients with psychomotor slowing stress the importance of intereffector regions in shaping psychomotor behaviors in mental disorders.",

Here, we report the map-based cloning of TaWUSCHEL-D1 ( WUS-D1 ) as the gene responsible for the multiovary phenotype in wheat, which produces three fertile ovaries and grains per floret. We generated a 14.5 Gbp chromosome-level assembly of multiovary wheat line “MOV” that shows unique structural variation in the Mov-1 physical region, resulting in widespread gene upregulation. High-resolution genetic mapping refined the locus to a 135 kbp region that contains two genes. We used nine independent deletion mutants, eight TILLING mutants, and genetic complementation of these genotypes to show that a WUSCHEL ortholog, WUS-D1 , is the causal gene of the Mov-1 locus. Expression studies showed that WUS-D1 is highly expressed during early inflorescence development in MOV, whereas the gene is inactive in wild-type wheat. The higher WUS-D1 expression is associated with the formation of larger meristems and floret primordia that are competent to produce multiple ovaries. These insights provide a foundation to manipulate floral organ numbers to enhance breeding capabilities of bread wheat.",

          "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus species complex (encompassing Cryptococcus neoformans , Cryptococcus deneoformans , and the Cryptococcus gattii species complexes) exhibits diversity in sexual reproduction, including α- a mating, pseudosexual reproduction, as well as unisexual reproduction initiated from a single isolate or between isolates of the same mating type. A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant α mating-type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far, unisexual reproduction has never been directly observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans . Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in both chaperoning and activating Gα proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans . Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, we found that deletion of both GPA2 and GPA3 in the MAT α background leads to self-filamentation without sporulation, suggesting that differential modulation of the Gα proteins, likely involving Ric8, could underlie the switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus . Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and could modulate sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungi and microbial eukaryotes as well.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescent labeling approaches are crucial for elucidating protein function and dynamics. While robust methods to monitor gene transcription are widespread, the visualization of proteins in vivo is more elusive. To meet this challenge, we developed Fluorescent Endogenous Tagging with a Covalent Hook (FETCH) to label cell surface proteins (CSPs) in vivo through a stable covalent bond mediated by the DogTag-DogCatcher peptide partner system. FETCH leverages a spontaneous covalent isopeptide bond that forms between the 23-amino acid DogTag and the 15-kDa DogCatcher. Unlike most tags that work best at protein termini, DogTag functions well in protein loops, expanding the range of sites that can be targeted in proteins. In FETCH, DogTag is introduced into extracellular loops of CSPs through genome engineering, enabling covalent bond formation with a genetically encoded DogCatcher-GFP fusion protein that can be secreted from a variety of cell types in intact animals. To identify optimal DogTag insertions into CSPs, we describe a flow cytometry–based platform for rapidly screening candidates in vitro. We demonstrate the ability to tag and visualize three members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) in vivo: the transmembrane protein mCD8 and two GPI-anchored proteins belonging to the DIP-Dpr interactome that interact biophysically to facilitate neuronal target recognition at Drosophila neuromuscular and brain synapses. FETCH enables precise temporal and spatial control to visualize tagged proteins in vivo, features that are adaptable to a multitude of applications for modifying any cell surface protein.",

          "abstract": "Nutrient intake drives secretion of insulin and insulin-like peptides that stimulate anabolic metabolism and tissue growth. Eight Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are encoded in the Drosophila genome; whether these Dilps respond uniformly to changes in dietary nutrients is unknown. Here, we investigate the endocrine responses of Dilp2, secreted by brain insulin-producing cells, and Dilp6, produced by the fat body, to dietary sugar and protein in mid-third instar Drosophila larvae. Starvation leads to a profound reduction in circulating Dilp2 without affecting circulating Dilp6 levels. Diets containing sugar alone drive nutrient storage and increase hemolymph Dilp6, but do not promote Dilp2 release. In contrast, dietary protein drives growth and restores hemolymph Dilp2 but strongly reduces circulating Dilp6. Furthermore, circulating levels of Dilp2 and Dilp6 are modulated by the ratio of sugar to protein in the diet. We find that depleting circulating Dilp6 via fat body specific knockdown or increasing insulin receptor (InR) levels in fat body leads to increased levels of triglyceride storage but decreased peripheral growth. Our results suggest that Dilp6, a hormone produced in response to dietary sugar, may direct the use of sugar for growth instead of fat storage at the end stage of larval development. Our findings reveal different modes of regulation for Dilp2 and Dilp6 and raise the question of how the single known Drosophila InR integrates divergent signals from distinct Dilps to control growth and metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive differences in the thermal stabilities of enzyme structure and function play critical roles in establishing the thermal optima and limits of all organisms. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying these adaptations can yield insights into protein structure–function relationships, protein evolution, and the consequences of temperature shifts on species distributions. Past studies have suggested that only a small number of amino acid substitutions are needed for adaptive change, but whether similar sites in the sequence, which we term thermal adaptation–related sequence sites (TRSS), and similar changes in amino acid content at these TRSS occur across widely different taxa remains to be elucidated. For detecting TRSS among orthologs of species adapted to a wide range of temperatures, we investigated 277 lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) orthologs in marine fish from diverse habitats. We validated the importance of several TRSS variants using site-directed mutagenesis on zebrafish LDH-A, effectively recreating the variants in the zebrafish ortholog. Our results indicate that enzyme thermal adaptation arises primarily from a few substitutions that influence hydrophobicity in functionally important regions of secondary structures. These findings reveal striking convergence in the sites (the TRSS) of temperature-adaptive evolution of LDH-As and provide insights into the types of amino acid substitutions that foster adaptation to temperature. Furthermore, the patterns of convergent evolution identified in this study supported development of a deep learning model for predicting thermal limits. This model can provide an important tool for predicting thermal ranges of species and the potential effects of temperature change on distribution patterns.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the regulatory role of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated citrullination on the tumor suppressor protein p53. We demonstrate that p53 serves as a substrate for PAD4, undergoing citrullination at multiple arginine residues, including critical sites within its DNA-binding domain. Mass spectrometry identified eight citrullination sites, notably R158, R282, and R283, which were further validated in various cancer cell lines. Functional studies revealed that citrullination significantly impairs p53’s ability to form stable tetramers, essential for high-affinity DNA binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed reduced binding to consensus sequences in the p21 and MDM2 promoters. As a result, citrullination led to marked reductions in p21 and MDM2 transcriptional activation and altered regulation of ME2, as demonstrated by reporter assays and quantitative PCR. In addition, citrullination compromised p53’s roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Supporting these findings, citrulline-mimic mutants (arginine-to-glutamine substitutions) exhibited diminished transcriptional activity relative to wild-type p53. Furthermore, citrullination disrupted the interaction between p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, reducing p53 ubiquitination and degradation, as shown by in vitro ubiquitination assays and cycloheximide chase experiments. Importantly, replacing glutamine with lysine at these key sites largely restored p53 activity, indicating that the loss of positive charge is central to the functional consequences of citrullination. Together, these findings identify PAD4-catalyzed citrullination as a regulatory mechanism that modulates p53 function and highlight PAD4 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The T cell receptor (TCR), a master regulator of adaptive immunity, serves as a molecular transducer that converts antigen recognition into precisely modulated intracellular signals, orchestrating both T cell development and effector functions. In this study, we leveraged a germline CD3ε I173A mutation, a previously characterized alteration that amplifies TCR signaling through the disruption of inhibitory lipid interactions, to dissect how thymocyte-intrinsic TCR signaling amplification influences the fate of mature T cells. Remarkably, thymic double-positive cells in CD3ε I173A mice with altered TCR repertoires demonstrated a significant downregulation of the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase homolog gene AC149090.1 . This modulation triggered a comprehensive rewiring of lipid metabolic pathways, establishing a systemic compensatory mechanism to counterbalance excessive TCR signaling. These metabolic adaptations culminated in functionally compromised mature T cells, characterized by diminished activation potential, reduced proliferative capacity, and impaired antitumor efficacy in CD3ε I173A mice. Our results underscore the critical role of thymic TCR signaling in T cell development for sustaining immune homeostasis and orchestrating mature T cell functionality, unveiling the lipid metabolic plasticity during thymocyte development that acts as a critical regulatory checkpoint for maintaining immune homeostasis.",

How the local physical properties of the matrix (density, stiffness, orientation) affect cellular forces remains, however, poorly understood. Existing approaches to measure cell three-dimensional (3D) traction forces within fibrous substrates lack control over the local properties and rely on continuum approaches, not suited for measuring forces at the scale of individual fibers. Herein, an approach is proposed to fabricate multilayer arrays of suspended deformable fibers spanning a wide range of fine-tunable geometrical and mechanical properties using two-photon polymerization. Atomic Force Microscopy is used to thoroughly investigate the properties of individual fibers, including Young’s modulus and stiffness. This approach is combined with a reference-free method for measuring traction forces in 3D, which relies on automated segmentation of the fibers coupled with finite element modeling. The force measurement pipeline is applied to study forces exerted by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or macrophages, and reveals how these forces are influenced by fiber density and stiffness. Additionally, coupling to fast volumetric imaging with lattice light-sheet microscopy enables the measurement of the low-intensity and short-lived tractions exerted by amoeboid cells, such as dendritic cells. Our technology will be instrumental for monitoring and studying cell behavior at the single-fiber level at extracellular matrix density interfaces, which play a crucial role in both physiological and pathological contexts, such as tumor boundaries.",

NADK2, a chloroplast-localized NAD kinase, supplies NADP + to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant of NADK2 ( nadk2 ) exhibits a reduced NADP + /NAD + ratio, slow growth, and pale green leaves. To gain further insights into NAD(P)(H) metabolism in chloroplasts, nadk2 revertant mutants ( nkr ) were screened from the M2 generation of EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate)-treated nadk2 seeds. Among them, nkr1 displayed greener leaves and improved growth compared to nadk2 . Genetic mapping and genomic sequencing identified At3g18500 ( CCR4C ) as the causal gene. The nkr1 mutant carried a single nucleotide substitution, introducing a stop codon within the predicted N-terminal chloroplast localization signal, resulting in the loss of CCR4C protein function. The nadk2 ccr4c double mutant restored leaf color and growth to near wild-type levels. To investigate the function of CCR4C, recombinant CCR4C protein was purified and shown to directly convert NADP(H) to NAD(H). Localization analysis with CCR4C-GFP fusion proteins confirmed chloroplast targeting. Furthermore, ccr4c single mutants exhibited disrupted NAD(P)(H) balance and enhanced tolerance to ROS stress (e.g., H 2 O 2 , methyl viologen).

          "abstract": "Deep learning on micro-Fourier transform infrared (µFTIR) spectra has the potential to provide a reliable, automated approach to classify and identify microplastics. However, deep learning models often come with certain limitations, including exhaustive dataset requirements, overfitting, and the need to retrain when new classes are introduced or new data are substantially different from the training set. This work explores a similarity learning approach to training deep learning models to address these issues for microplastic classification. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by similarity learning on a dataset of µFTIR spectra acquired from 45 manufactured microplastic samples of 11 plastic compositions and compared with cross-entropy training of the same CNN architecture as well as classical machine learning algorithms. The CNN trained by similarity learning consistently yielded the highest accuracies (up to a 0.973 F1-score) across the multiple classes of microplastics. Notably, despite only training on microplastic spectra collected under pristine conditions, the CNN trained via similarity learning maintained the highest accuracy (up to a 0.905 F1-score) on a “noisy” dataset consisting of microplastics spiked onto filters with high amounts of exogenous background material. Furthermore, similarity learning combined with support-vector classifiers also allowed for the detection and separation of microplastic polymer-composition classes not contained in the training set. Overall, this approach is able to achieve high accuracy in microplastic classification despite challenges posed by the diversity of microplastic polymer compositions, limited time and resources for dataset preparation, and high amounts of background noise that are common in FTIR spectra collected from real-world microplastic samples.",

They have been found to show a negative phototactic response to blue light, mediated by an as-yet unidentified photoreceptive system. Here, by screening available apusomonad omics data we found genes of a distinct group of microbial rhodopsins, apusomonad rhodopsins (ApuRs). ApuRs, heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, absorbed near-UV or violet light, suggesting that ApuRs could be involved in apusomonads’ photoavoidance response toward short-wavelength light. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that ApuRs are anion-selective rhodopsin channels which evolved independently of the family of channelrhodopsins widespread in other unicellular eukaryotes. In ApuRs, channel opening is triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal from its all- trans form to 13- cis and 11- cis forms. We found that intracellular proton transfer is involved in channel opening and determines the channel’s open/close kinetics. These findings expand our understanding of the photobiology of heterotrophic flagellates and demonstrate that UV-absorbing ApuRs are in fact the most blue-shifted rhodopsin channels known to date.",

          "abstract": "Mot1 in budding yeast regulates transcription by dissociating general initiation factor TBP (TATA-binding protein) from DNA. Previous studies suggested that Mot1 preferentially removes TBP from stress-responsive promoters containing consensus TATA elements that utilize coactivator SAGA while enhancing TBP binding at “house-keeping” genes with TATA-like elements that employ TFIID for TBP recruitment. In stress conditions of amino acid starvation, by contrast, we found that Mot1 promotes TBP binding at genes activated by transcription factor Gcn4, enriched for TATA/SAGA-dependent promoters, and at SAGA-dependent genes expressed constitutively at high-levels, while suppressing TBP binding at SAGA-dependent genes only expressed at lower levels. Importantly, Mot1’s influence on genes induced by starvation or oxidative stress switches from increased to decreased TBP binding when transcribed at low levels in nonstressed cells. Mot1’s role at TFIID-dependent promoters also scales with transcription level, enhancing TBP binding only for the highly expressed subset. Notably, reduced TBP binding on Mot1 depletion impairs transcription of highly expressed TFIID genes but not highly expressed SAGA/stress-activated genes, suggesting that SAGA produces a surfeit of incomplete preinitiation complexes dependent on Mot1 for assembly.",

          "abstract": "Jumping can be hazardous for entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) as those that fail to attach to an insect host face death by predation or starvation. Recently, it has been shown that electrostatic charges on large insects can prompt a close-range detachment of free-living nematodes, which are nonparasitic and unable to jump. However, it remains unclear if static electricity can influence aerial interactions between parasitic jumping worms and their insect hosts. Here, we analyze and model the trajectories of jumping EPNs in still air as they approach fruit flies with varying electrostatic charge. We find that the nematodes’ attachment to the host is facilitated by an electrical potential of a few hundred volts, a magnitude commonly found in flying insects. A model combining electrostatics, aerodynamics, and Bayesian inference indicates that the electrostatic charge on jumping nematodes is ∼ 0.1 pC, which aligns with theoretical predictions for electrostatic induction. Drag coefficients based on host–nematode interactions in the presence of horizontal wind show differences at both low and high jumping velocities. Numerical simulations show that intermediate wind speeds ( ∼ 0.2 m/s) can further increase the likelihood of host attachment, as wind-driven aerial drifting allows the worms to reach hosts at greater distances. Our results suggest that submillimeter parasites that become airborne may exploit the electric charge carried by their host to facilitate attachment and thus enhance survival. The use of quantitative physical models provides valuable insights into understanding complex airborne infectious diseases mediated by natural environmental forces.",

          "abstract": "De novo gene birth—the emergence of genes from nongenic sequences—drives biological innovation, yet its adaptive potential remains poorly understood. To investigate this issue, we screened libraries of ~100 million short (semi-)random sequences, mimicking early stages of gene birth, for genes that promote Escherichia coli survival during phage infection. This selection uncovered thousands of functional genes that confer viral resistance through at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) activation of a bacterial regulatory system that remodels the outer membrane, which provides broad-spectrum defense, and 2) transcriptional repression of bacterial outer membrane receptors required for phage adsorption, which provides phage-specific protection. Remarkably, unrelated random genes with no sequence similarity produced similar protective phenotypes, revealing that diverse sequences can converge on equivalent functions. We further showed that T4 phage rapidly evolves to counter these novel defenses, acquiring baseplate mutations that enhance adsorption to resistant hosts. Together, these findings demonstrate that random sequences can rapidly evolve into functional genes with direct fitness benefit, highlighting the evolutionary potential of de novo gene birth in the microbial world.",

In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry—the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company’s dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.",

          "abstract": "Sedimentary basins host high-grade gold mineralization at intersections of auriferous hydrothermal fluids and hydrocarbons. However, the precise mechanism of native gold formation associated with organic matter remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate gold precipitation at oil–water interfaces through in situ thermal experiments using various combinations of oil and HAuCl 4 -bearing solutions. Our results reveal that gold particles form spontaneously following the extensive generation and evolution of water microdroplets at oil–water interfaces at temperatures of 140 to 400 °C. We propose that electrons (e − ), released from the conversion of hydroxide ions (OH − ) to hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in water microdroplets, together with H atoms (·H) formed through electron transfer involving H 3 O + , and spontaneously generated H 2 O 2 from·OH recombination, drive the reduction of Au 3+ to Au 0 . The atomic gold progressively aggregates into Au 0 clusters and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), ultimately forming micrometer-scale gold particles and wires. This precipitation process occurs within minutes at temperatures above 350 °C and within hours below 200 °C. The experimentally produced gold particles exhibit textures like those in natural ore deposits. This interfacial microdroplet–induced mechanism provides a unique perspective on native gold formation in hydrocarbon-rich geosystems. Beyond its geological significance, this mechanism offers a potentially simplified approach for gold recovery from electronic waste without the need to introduce complex adsorbents or reducing agents into the waste stream.",

However, interactions between Fe nutrition of microbes, including both heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton, and viral lysis are not well known. Here, we present viral infection dynamics under Fe-limited and Fe-replete conditions for isolates of three types of marine picoplankton, the photosynthetic picoeukaryote Ostreococcus , the cyanobacterium Synechococcus , and the heterotrophic bacterium Vibrio . Iron limitation of Ostreococcus resulted in slowed growth and reduced viral burst sizes; this is similar to prior results from studies of larger eukaryotic phytoplankton, where reduced viral replication under Fe limitation is attributed to the viral reliance on host metabolism and replication machinery. Fe limitation of one Vibrio impacted dynamics of its virus similarly, lengthening the latent period before infected cells burst to release new viruses, and reducing the number of infective particles released upon lysis. In contrast, for another Vibrio isolate, Fe limitation had no discernible effect on replication of its virus. Furthermore, dynamics of three cyanophages that infect the same Synechococcus isolate were not affected by Fe limitation of the host, either in terms of latent period or burst size. The results show that some marine viruses, particularly cyanophages, can replicate efficiently even when host growth is compromised. These findings have implications for marine ecology and carbon cycling in Fe-limited regions of the global ocean.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation to different environments is thought to play a key role in speciation. However, speciation typically begins in allopatry, where reproductive isolation can also arise through neutral processes or selection unrelated to ecological differences. Disentangling the role of adaptive ecological divergence in the early stages of speciation therefore remains an important challenge in understanding the origin of new species. Here, we study threespine stickleback populations that have recently evolved in isolated postglacial lakes either in the presence or absence of prickly sculpin—a resource competitor that also shares ubiquitous trout predators with stickleback. We simulated secondary contact between several stickleback populations from these two ecological contexts in large, seminatural ponds, and genotyped offspring from 411 mating events to assess the strength of premating isolation associated with this biotic factor. Assortative mating between populations of the same ecological type (i.e., both sculpin-sympatric or both solitary) was moderate on average but ranged from weak to complete. Strikingly, and in line with a central premise of ecological speciation, the strength of premating isolation increased with increasing morphological and genomic population divergence shaped by sculpin-mediated selection. In contrast, overall phenotypic and genomic population divergence agnostic to sculpin presence/absence only poorly explained premating isolation, highlighting how ecological speciation in allopatry can be obscured by other sources of divergence. More broadly, our findings demonstrate how interactions with other ecologically similar species can play a major role in initiating and driving evolutionary trajectories toward new species, even in allopatry.",

          "abstract": "T cells play a key role in adaptive immunity by mounting specific responses against diverse pathogens. Effective bindings between T cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen derived peptides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) mediate immune responses. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC-I alleles, and to design immunogenic peptides for specified TCR–MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, HERMES’s implicit physical reasoning enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR–pMHC binding affinities and T cell activities across diverse viral and cancer epitopes, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR–MHC systems, we demonstrate that our designs—with up to five substitutions from the native sequence—activate T cells at success rates of up to 50%. Last, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR–MHC’s, offering key insights into T cell specificity. Our approach provides a platform for immunogenic peptide and neoantigen design, as well as for evaluating TCR specificity, offering a computational framework to inform design of engineered T cell therapies and vaccines.",

However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying these interactions remain poorly characterized, and novel microscopy strategies are needed to specifically address the biointerface. In this study, we employ fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with the tension reporter Flipper-TR to investigate membrane tension in live bacteria interacting with various surfaces. We show that Flipper-TR stains both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial membranes, exhibiting fluorescence lifetimes shorter than those in eukaryotic cells, with slight variations between bacterial types and likely reflecting differences in membrane composition. Flipper-TR displays lifetime variations along the vertical axis of bacterial cells, suggesting spatial differences in membrane tension influenced by cell wall architecture. Our results further demonstrate that Flipper-TR is responsive to the nature of bacterial interactions with surfaces. By comparing bacterial immobilization on surfaces with different coatings, we show that Flipper-TR can sensitively distinguish differences in membrane tension arising from distinct adhesion mechanisms. Additionally, Flipper-TR detects changes in membrane tension when bacteria are exposed to engineered nanostructured substrates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox to study the mechanical aspects of bacterial–material interactions and contributes to providing design rules for novel materials that influence bacterial behavior.",

Using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging, we found that free citrate in the cytosol of neurons in acute mouse brain slices declines two-to-threefold within seconds of neuronal activation and then returns to baseline over a few minutes.

          "abstract": "Rapid and accurate estimation of protein–ligand binding affinities is crucial for early-stage drug discovery, yet hindered by a trade-off between the accuracy of gold-standard physics-based methods and the speed of simpler empirical scoring functions. Machine learning (ML) promised to bridge this gap, but its potential is unrealized due to limited model generalizability. Current ML models often fail when predicting affinities for novel proteins or chemical series unseen during training. We hypothesize that this failure stems from a competition within these models during training, where the learning of spurious correlations from structural motifs prevalent in the training data competes with the learning of transferable, physicochemical principles governing molecular interaction. Here, we introduce COnvolutional Representation of Distance-dependent Interactions with Attention Learning (CORDIAL), a deep learning framework designed with an inductive bias toward learning the distance-dependent physicochemical interaction signatures between proteins and ligands, explicitly avoiding direct parameterization of their chemical structures. This interaction-only approach proves effective. Through leave-superfamily-out validation that simulates encounters with novel protein families, we demonstrate that CORDIAL maintains predictive performance and calibration. This contrasts with diverse contemporary ML models, whose predictive ability is degraded under these conditions. Our results highlight the value of encoding appropriate task-specific physicochemical principles into ML architectures and offer a validated strategy for developing generalizable models for structure-based drug discovery.",

Although various global conformations have been captured in static structural models, dynamic transitions between these conformations and their biological relevance remain unclear. Here, we visualize the global conformation of the Rag GTPase heterodimer using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. By tracking the movement of individual protein molecules, we found that the two subunits explore a wide conformational space, which is strictly dictated by the bound nucleotides, regulators, and mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that proper modulation of the global conformation is crucial for correctly interpreting amino acid signals.

          "abstract": "The precise timing of flowering is critical to ensure reproductive success in plants. This process is coordinated by both endogenous and environmental cues. Light is a pivotal environmental cue fundamentally regulating plant growth and development. In temperate grasses, how light regulates flowering time remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize a blue-light photoreceptor, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1), which functions as a flowering promoter in Brachypodium distachyon . Loss-of-function mutations in FKF1 result in delayed flowering under long-day conditions, whereas overexpression of FKF1 strongly accelerates flowering. We show that FKF1 controls the stability of floral repressor EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) in response to blue light. FKF1 directly interacts with and catalyzes the ubiquitination of ELF3, leading to protein degradation of ELF3 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Blue light can strengthen the interaction between FKF1 and ELF3, thereby accelerating degradation of ELF3. Moreover, ELF3 physically interacts with SWINGER and CURLY LEAF, two core subunits of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and mediates the subsequent deposition of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) for stable transcriptional silencing of the flowering activator PHOTOPERIOD 1 . Remarkably, the FKF1–ELF3–PRC2 regulatory module-mediated flowering time control in response to light is likely conserved across temperate grasses. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which light modulates H3K27me3 deposition to regulate flowering time in temperate grasses. This mechanism also allows plants to adapt to dynamically changing environments.",

It also contributes significantly to satellite-observed tropospheric NO 2 columns, which should be considered when using these columns to quantify surface emissions of nitrogen oxide radicals (NO x ≡ NO + NO 2 ). But large uncertainties remain in the sources and chemistry of FT NO 2 because observations are sparse. Here, we construct a cloud-sliced FT NO 2 (700 to 300 hPa) product from the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) geostationary satellite instrument over North America. This product provides higher data density and quality than previous products from low Earth orbit instruments, including the first observations of the FT NO 2 diurnal cycle in different seasons. Combined with coincident observations from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, the TEMPO data imply that lightning is the dominant source of FT NO x in nonwinter seasons. Comparison of TEMPO FT NO 2 data with the Goddard Earth Observation System-Composition Forecasts (GEOS-CF) atmospheric chemistry model shows overall consistent magnitudes, seasonality, and diurnal variation, with a midday minimum in nonwinter seasons from photochemical loss. However, there are major discrepancies that we attribute to GEOS-CF’s use of a standard cloud-top-height-based scheme for the lightning NO x source. We find that this scheme underestimates offshore lighting flash density and misrepresents the diurnal cycle of lightning over land. Our FT NO 2 product provides a unique resource for improving the lightning NO x parameterization in atmospheric models and the ability to use NO 2 observations from space to quantify surface NO x emissions.",

In this study, we identified the protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) PDIA1 and PDIA5, which play a critical role in folding of client proteins in the ER, as important regulators of prostate cancer growth and response to therapy. PDIA1 and PDIA5 are upregulated in prostate cancer and induced by the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis. Genetic or pharmacological disabling of PDIA1/PDIA5 caused redox stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, growth inhibition, and death of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The critical functions of these enzymes in redox homeostasis and cell survival were observed in both AR-driven and AR-independent models of prostate cancer. Loss of PDIA1/PDIA5 activity led to ubiquitination and degradation of the AR, revealing a feedback loop between these chaperones and the AR pathway. Mechanistically, PDIA1/PDIA5 regulated AR stability by mediating disulfide bond formation, an activity that required cysteines 669 and 844 in AR’s ligand-binding domain. Importantly, targeting PDIAs sensitized prostate cancer cells to the AR antagonist, enzalutamide. This study reveals a mechanism governing AR proteostasis in prostate cancer and positions PDIA1/5 as viable therapeutic targets.",

However, despite aging being the primary risk factor for AD, it remains unclear whether men and women differ in the extent of brain decline with age. Using 12,638 longitudinal brain MRIs from 4,726 participants aged 17 to 95 y across 14 cohorts, we examined sex differences in structural brain changes over time, controlling for differences in head size. Men showed greater cortical thickness (CT) decline in the cuneus, lingual, parahippocampal, and pericalcarine regions; surface area decline in the fusiform and postcentral regions; and in older adults, greater subcortical decline in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and pallidum. In contrast, women only showed greater surface area decline in the banks of the superior temporal sulcus and greater ventricular expansion in older adults. These results suggest that sex differences in age-related brain decline are unlikely to contribute to the higher AD diagnosis prevalence in women, necessitating research into alternative explanations.",

The phase diagram contains three distinct superconducting phases: SC 1 in which φ and θ extend from 0 to 90° and H ≤ ~15 T; SC 2 for φ ≤ ~7°, θ ≤ ~4° and ~15 T ≤ H ≤ H m = ~35 T, the onset of the magnetic field polarized (FP) phase, and SC FP which resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from θ ≈ 20° to 40° and from ~40 T to above 60 T. We studied the evolution of the H vs. θ phase diagram for Th concentrations 0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.047 in the U 1-x Th x Te 2 system at ~0.6 K. Within this range of x values, SC 1 extends over 0 ≤ θ ≤ 90° and H ≤ ~10 T for x = 0.047, while SC 2 is suppressed. The SC FP and FP phases are unaffected to x = 0.02 but are completely suppressed in the region x = 0.025 to 0.047 where the residual resistance ratio RRR ~3 indicates a significant amount of disorder. These results complement recent studies of nonsuperconducting disordered UTe 2 single crystals in which the SC 1 and SC 2 phases are absent, but the FP and so-called “orphan” SC FP phases are retained.",

The mechanisms regulating CMS protein accumulation remain unclear. Here, we explored this process using wild-abortive CMS (CMS-WA) rice ( Oryza sativa ). We show that WA352, the causal protein of CMS-WA, is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). Structural analysis and protein truncation assays revealed that the N terminus of WA352 is critical for its anchoring to the inner mitochondrial membrane and its UPS-mediated degradation. Functional complementation confirmed that WA352 151–352 , lacking the N-terminal domain, accumulates constitutively in vegetative tissues, causing a reactive oxygen species burst and retarding rice growth. We further identified three mitochondrion-localized F-box proteins that participate in WA352 ubiquitination and degradation. Our findings demonstrate that UPS-mediated regulation restricts WA352 accumulation to anthers, allowing it to specifically disrupt anther development, thus helping to explain the male-specific effects of CMS genes in plants.",

          "abstract": "In arthropods, bacterial infection activates dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) to produce extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), while stimulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) through immune deficiency (Imd)/Relish pathway. Although both strategies contribute significantly to antibacterial immunity, the Duox2/ROS system and Relish/AMPs pathway are generally considered separate branches. In the present study, we report that these two branches are connected by an aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) in a crustacean, the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii . Aqp4 is found to be critical for the crayfish antibacterial response. The significance of Aqp4 is achieved by transporting extracellular ROS into the intracellular compartment after bacterial infection. The increase in intracellular ROS levels, mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, promotes the nuclear translocation and thereby the transcriptional activity of FoxO. As the key transcription factor of Relish, FoxO regulates the upregulation of Relish and ultimately the expression of Relish-targeting AMPs. By linking ROS production to AMP expression, the sequential ROS/Aqp4/FoxO/Relish/AMPs axis makes a relatively significant, yet previously unnoticed, contribution to the antibacterial response. Therefore, this study reveals the intriguing association between ROS production and AMP expression, the two central antibacterial strategies and provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of arthropod immunity.",

Their architectural scale, complexity, and integration with the terrain suggest a high degree of communal organization, landscape knowledge, and planning. Although direct dating remains inconclusive, associated stratigraphy indicates they were abandoned before the Late Bronze Age, pointing to a potentially earlier origin. These structures may represent the westernmost examples of a broader tradition of large-scale hunting installations previously known only from the arid zones of Southwest Asia and North Africa.

Previous studies have suggested that cortical disinhibition is a feature of PD, but there has been little direct evidence of the changes in cortical neuronal spiking activity to support this hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that activity in the motor cortex is enhanced in PD, we investigated the effects of parkinsonism on movement-related neuronal activity in the primary motor cortex (M1). Microelectrode arrays were chronically implanted in M1 of two nonhuman primates and populations of cells were collected before and after the induction of parkinsonism using the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. In both animals, we found that during the reaching task in the parkinsonian state, the proportion of M1 neurons that were activated (excited) during movement were increased, while those that were suppressed (inhibited) decreased. These data support the concept that dopaminergic loss in parkinsonism promotes a loss of inhibition in the motor cortex, leading to overactivity in M1 and a disruption in spatial-temporal processing of information within the BGTC circuit that contributes to the motor dysfunction observed in PD.",

Structures of substrate-bound AAA+ complexes suggest that these enzymes employ a conserved hand-over-hand mechanism to thread substrates through their central pore. However, the fundamental aspects of the mechanisms governing motor function and substrate processing within specific AAA+ families remain unresolved. We used cryoelectron microscopy to structurally interrogate reaction intermediates from in vitro biochemical assays to inform the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the human mitochondrial AAA+ protease, LONP1. Our results demonstrate that substrate binding, rather than nucleotide binding, activates the assembly and allosterically regulates proteolytic activity. The N-terminal domain plays a critical role in this process and facilitates the initial stages of substrate selection and engagement. Moreover, structures of LONP1 actively degrading a substrate in the presence of ATP provide important context to the conventional understanding of the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is likely not limited to a single position in the right-handed spiral during the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Head movements are sensed by the vestibular organs. Unlike classical senses, signals from vestibular organs are not selectively conveyed to a dedicated cortical area but are broadcast throughout the cortex. This distributed processing pattern reflects the fundamental role of vestibular information in contextual modulation across diverse cortical computations. Surprisingly, the routes taken by vestibular signals to reach the cortex are still largely uncharted. Here, we show that the primary visual cortex (V1) receives real-time head movement signals—direction, velocity, and acceleration—from the ipsilateral pulvinar and contralateral visual cortex (VC). The ipsilateral pulvinar provides the main head movement signal, with a bias toward contraversive movements (e.g., clockwise movements in left V1). Conversely, the contralateral VC provides head movement signals during ipsiversive movements. Crucially, head movement variables encoded in V1 are already encoded in the pulvinar, suggesting that those variables are computed subcortically. Thus, the convergence of inter- and intrahemispheric signals endows V1 with a rich representation of the animal’s head movements.",

          "abstract": "While deep learning has advanced protein sequence and function design, engineering highly active and stable proteins still requires labor-intensive iterative computational design and experimentation. There is a critical need for methods capable of directly generating protein sequences with the required properties. Here, we present GeoEvoBuilder, an advanced deep learning framework that adaptively integrates structural and evolutionary constraints for protein sequence design. GeoEvoBuilder accurately recapitulates functional sites and generates sequences that fold correctly with enhanced activity and thermal stability. GeoEvoBuilder has been applied to redesign green fluorescent protein, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), yielding variants with significantly improved thermal stability and activity. Notably, the top DHFR design demonstrated a 20-fold increase in catalytic efficiency and a 10 °C gain in thermal stability. Crystal structure determination confirmed that the designed proteins form correct structures. Further analysis of residue dynamic correlations in GPX4 variants provides insights into how remote sites regulate enzymatic activity. Unlike conventional methods that focus on single mutation and their combinations with iterative design and experiment cycles, GeoEvoBuilder explores a large sequence space that enables successful designs with over 30% residue changes in one run. GeoEvoBuilder not only provides a transformative tool for protein engineering but also can be applied to uncover the intricate relationships between protein sequence, structure, function, and evolution.

          "abstract": "Brain-wide association studies using functional MRI have advanced our understanding of how behavioral traits relate to individual variability in brain function. These studies typically identify functional connectivity (FC) patterns linked to behavioral traits using either whole-brain or region-wise predictive models. However, whole-brain models often struggle with generalizability and interpretability due to the high dimensionality of FC data, while region-wise models isolate predictions, limiting their ability to capture the integrated contributions of brain-wide FC patterns. In this study, we introduce an interpretable predictive model that learns fine-grained FC patterns predictive of behavioral traits, jointly at the regional and participant levels, to characterize the overall association of FC patterns with a target trait. Our model jointly learns a relevance score and a dedicated prediction function for each brain region, then integrates the regional predictions using the relevance scores as weights to generate a participant-level prediction, capturing the collective association of FC patterns with the trait. We validated our method using FC data from 6,798 participants in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to predict cognition. Our model identified the cingulo-parietal, retrosplenial-temporal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular networks as collectively predictive of cognitive traits, achieved competitive prediction accuracy, and enabled detailed characterization of fine-grained FC differences across cognitive domains. The learned relevance scores enhanced region-wise predictions of longitudinal cognitive measures in the ABCD cohort and cognitive traits in the Human Connectome Project Development cohort. These findings suggest that our method effectively characterizes generalizable and fine-grained FC patterns linked to cognition in youth.",

Here, we seek to address this challenge by building a deep learning framework that incorporates information related to protein dynamics. Namely, we build a neural network architecture using a physics-based metric called the Asymmetric Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI asym ), which quantifies the degree to which each member of a pair of residues influences the flexibility of the other. DCI asym enables us to train models through an allosteric Graph Neural Network (GNN) in which each residue is linked to its distant dynamic influencers. Despite not being trained on experimental epistasis data, our GNN consistently outperforms existing approaches on deep mutational scanning datasets across four distinct proteins, highlighting its enhanced capacity to model epistatic interactions. Our GNN model was then challenged to predict the functions of 37 novel, computationally designed TEM-1 β-lactamase variants of unknown function, and it demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy for these variants. Thus, our GNN provides a pathway for better assessing the impact of multiple mutations on protein function, including epistatic relationships and mutations that have profound effects on activity despite being spatially far from the active site.",

DMD treatment requires a body-wide approach to target all diseased striated muscles: limb, respiratory, and heart.

Here, data show the remarkable potency of a synthetic poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(propylene oxide) side chain–based bottlebrush block copolymer, ~150,000 times more potent than linear polymers, to rapidly restore contractile function to DMD skeletal muscle fibers in vitro. Strikingly, upon bottlebrush polymer delivery to DMD animals, results show highly efficacious prevention of the onset of skeletal and diaphragm muscle damage and the blocking of stress-induced cardiac injury and death in vivo. These data suggest bottlebrush polymers as a potent stand-alone muscle membrane-stabilizing therapeutic for DMD. Given DMD’s early childhood onset, together with newborn screening for DMD, bottlebrush macromolecules could be envisioned as an early therapy to preserve and protect viable muscle and potentially for other acquired or inherited diseases involving membrane damage.",

          "abstract": "Pathogens are major drivers of cancer globally and the processes of infection and carcinogenesis unfold over decades making them difficult to observe in human or natural populations. We investigate these hidden dynamics for the foodborne trematode Opisthorchis viverrini , which is a primary cause of biliary cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) and infects 12 million people in Southeast Asia. In tumors from patients exposed to O. viverrini , we find that the earliest chromosomal amplifications carrying driver genes occurred at 30 y old on average, two to four decades before cancer diagnosis, and disproportionately contain TP53 , PTEN and FGFR2 genes. We then fitted transmission models to parasitological data from Thailand spanning 27 y ( n = 11,517) finding that, for people born between 1960 and 1989, first exposure occurred at two years old and by 30 y individuals had been cumulatively infected with a median of 72 worms. Trematodes are long-lived and our analysis quantifies the average lifespan of O. viverrini as 13 y (90% credible interval [CrI] 7 to 26 y) within human hosts. The lifetime probability of diagnosis with cholangiocarcinoma is 4.9% (90% CrI 4.7 to 5.0%) given prior exposure to O. viverrini , which is fourteen-fold higher than in populations nonendemic for the parasite. We find strong evidence for a dramatic decline in parasite transmission from 1990 onward in Thailand, suggesting that the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma will decline over the coming decades. Our study demonstrates how pathogen exposure drives patterns of cancer within a population and provides evidence for public health and therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Hydrothermal vent temperatures fluctuate in response to transient magmatic and tectonic activity at the axis of mid-ocean ridges (MORs) and modulate energy fluxes from the deep Earth to the ocean. Such fluctuations have thus far only been documented on time scales of minutes to years, because of the scarcity of long, continuous observations. Here, we assemble a ~35-year-long time series of exit fluid temperatures from five hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise axis, between 9°46’-51’N. This dataset reveals a steady increase in maximum venting temperatures atop the central part of the axial magma lens (AML), from ~350 °C to ~390 °C between the 1991–92 and 2005–06 eruptions. Temperatures decreased back to ~350 °C shortly after the 2005–06 eruption and have been rising ever since. We interpret the temperature increase as a result of a steady decrease in upflow zone permeability caused by the steady inflation of the AML compressing the oceanic upper crust. Using laboratory-determined pressure–permeability relations, we estimate crustal pressurization rates of 0.38 MPa/y (1992–2005) and 0.33 MPa/y (post-2006), consistent with geodetic observations from 2009–2011. Decadal fluctuations in hydrothermal vent temperatures likely mimic the rate of AML pressurization, yielding valuable new constraints on the dynamics of magmatic replenishment and eruptions at MORs. Notably, this temperature time series underpinned our forecast of the April 2025 eruption at the study site.",

          "abstract": "Microbial fermentation facilitates the initial breakdown of organic matter into small molecules and is thought to be the rate-limiting step of anoxic organic mineralization. However, fermentation is understudied in modern and ancient biogeochemistry due to a lack of environmental biomarkers. It has long been assumed that fermentation, like respiration, does not express significant carbon isotope fractionations, precluding isotopic signals as a means of studying it in nature. Here, we tested this idea by growing pure cultures of four fermenting bacteria on glucose and measuring the carbon isotope compositions of the organic acids and alcohols produced. We found that fermentation exhibits a strong carbon isotope fractionation, ranging from − 6‰ to + 16‰, depending on the fermentation product. With bioisotopic models that track site-specific isotope enrichments through metabolism, we constrained the enzymes responsible for these fractionations. Our models reproduced in vivo organic acid δ 13 C values in all four organisms. These findings demonstrate that acetate 13 C-enrichment is likely a widespread signature of fermentation. They also challenge traditional notions of controls on the isotope composition of lipids. Finally, our study suggests that fermentation imposes a trophic carbon isotope fractionation as organic carbon is passed from fermenters to secondary degraders like sulfate reducers. Looking to the geologic past, this trophic fractionation could have imprinted isotopic signals on the three billion year record of sedimentary organic carbon, specifically the inverse δ 13 C pattern of Precambrian acyclic isoprenoid and n-alkane biomarkers. Pervasive evidence of fermentation in the rock record would suggest its underappreciated role in biogeochemical cycles throughout Earth history.",

          "abstract": "Foraging and food consumption are fundamental for the survival of animals. In natural environments, wild rodents feed on insects, including moth larvae, and odor-guided evaluation of potential food resources is a critical step in initiating feeding behavior. However, the mechanisms by which rodents seek and feed on insect prey remain poorly understood. Herein, we employed a laboratory-based predator–prey interaction system using mice and cotton bollworm larvae to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying food-seeking and feeding behaviors at both cellular and neural circuit levels. We demonstrate that mice exhibit a strong preference for consuming fed larvae, and this preference is dependent on the main olfactory system. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant differences in the chemical profiles of fed and unfed larvae, with fed larvae containing a higher level of linoleic acid (LA) and a lower level of (Z)-9-tricosene [(Z)-9-TE]. Behavioral assays showed that mice, as well as Brand’s voles and brown rats, are attracted to LA but avoid (Z)-9-TE in a two-choice odor preference test. Furthermore, we identified that the dopaminergic pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the medial olfactory tubercle (mOT) plays a central role in mediating this preference. Chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway abolished the preference for LA over (Z)-9-TE, while chemogenetic activation reversed this effect. Additionally, fiber photometry recordings and pharmacology revealed that mOT D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons preferentially mediate attraction to LA and avoidance of (Z)-9-TE, respectively. These findings uncover a neurobiological system in rodents that supports insect predation based upon chemosignals.",

          "abstract": "Methane is ubiquitous in groundwater, and its release to surface environments through pumping, discharge, or diffusion is an emerging environmental concern. Microbial oxidation consumes methane and mitigates its release, but quantitative constraints in groundwater remain unknown. Using ultra-low-level 14 C-labeling, we estimate in situ microbial methane oxidation rates in shallow carbonate and sandy aquifers from central and northern Germany with methane concentrations spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 0.15 ± 0.04 to 36,250 ± 1,390 µg L −1 . Oxidation rates ranged from 0.001 ± 0.0003 to 74.28 ± 46.94 µgC L −1 d −1 and were highly correlated with groundwater methane concentrations. Oxidation-based methane turnover was rapid at low methane concentrations, with complete consumption requiring days to weeks. In contrast, microbial oxidation at high methane sites required months to decades for complete methane turnover, indicating the potential for unconsumed methane to leak into local streams or wetlands. High oxidation rates were associated with gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs that typically thrive in suboxic conditions and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea, while uncultivated methanotrophs of the Methylomirabilota and Verrucomicrobiota dominated low-rate sites. Based on globally distributed groundwater methane concentration data, we extrapolated the strong observed correlation between methane concentrations and oxidation rates to global groundwater volumes, estimating that microbial oxidation removes ~66% of groundwater methane globally, equivalent to 167 to 778 Tg CH 4 y −1 . This highlights the groundwater microbiome as a crucial subsurface methane filter that reduces methane release to surface waters, soils, and the atmosphere.",

Yet, in a handful of species, females cease reproduction long before death, highlighting an apparent evolutionary paradox. We used over three decades of life-history and behavioral data to examine the prevalence of postreproductive lifespan in wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei ). Almost one third of females in our study population (7/25) have been “postreproductive” according to a commonly used criterion and have lived more than a decade past their age of last reproduction, representing at least a fourth of their adult lifespan. Additionally, using conservative estimates of female ages, we found a significant post-reproductive representation (a common population-level measure of post-reproductive lifespan) equal to 0.10. Our results add to observations of postreproductive lifespan in chimpanzees and humans and thus, they represent a critical addition to our understanding of hominid life-history evolution.",

Although these genomic alterations are often attributed to the action of error-prone DNA polymerases on UV-induced DNA lesions during replicative DNA synthesis, UV damage can also result in mutagenic and recombinogenic DNA damage in nondividing cells. We examined the effects of UV on cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrested in G 1 of the cell cycle. By mating an irradiated haploid with an unirradiated haploid, we found that recombination was initiated only on the irradiated chromosome. This result indicates that trans effects of UV on recombination (for example, induction of recombinogenic proteins stimulating DNA breaks on the unirradiated homolog) are small or negligible. In addition, we show that most of the UV-induced mutations produced in G 1 -irradiated cells result in mutations at identical positions in both strands of the duplex. As observed for recombination events, mutations are almost exclusively on the irradiated chromosome, indicating the near absence of a trans effect on mutations.",

To explain how transport emerges from the system components and their interactions, we used experimental data and theoretical information to construct an integrative Brownian dynamics model of transport through an NPC, coupled to a kinetic model of transport in the cell. The model recapitulates key aspects of transport for a wide range of molecular cargoes, including preribosomes and viral capsids. Our model quantifies how flexible phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat proteins create an entropic barrier to passive diffusion and how this barrier is selectively lowered in facilitated diffusion by the many transient interactions of nuclear transport receptors with the FG repeats. Selective transport is enhanced by “fuzzy” multivalent interactions, redundant FG repeat mass, coupling to the energy-dependent RanGTP concentration gradient, and exponential dependence of transport kinetics on the transport barrier. Our model will facilitate rational modulation of the NPC and its artificial mimics.",

Here, we report that both PRC1 and USP16 are also localized in mitochondria and influence mitochondrial function directly. Our findings are based on immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays, cell fractionation, and biochemical analyses of isolated or affinity-purified mitochondria. We further showed that PRC1 and USP16 function with the ubiquitin pathway. Auxin-induced, mitochondria-specific depletion of the PRC1 subunit RING2 altered the ubiquitination status of mitochondrial proteins, including H2Aub. Disruption of PRC1, either through double knockout (KO) of RING1 and RING2 or through mitochondria-specific deletion of RING2 in the RING1 KO background, caused profound alterations in mitochondrial proteome and led to disturbances in mitochondrial integrity and impaired respiratory function. Thus, in addition to their canonical functions in the nucleus, PRC1 and USP16 also translocate into mitochondria and directly impact mitochondrial integrity and function.",

          "abstract": "Current optical memory technologies face critical challenges, including limited precision in multistate control, energy inefficiency, and inadequate adaptability across diverse material platforms. To directly address these issues, this study introduces a noncontact approach by exploiting the unique properties of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. The distinctive longitudinal electric field generated by OAM light substantially enhances the density of trap states in materials such as molybdenum disulfide, as the primary material for investigation, and others as supplementary examples. This enhancement enables precise modulation of key device characteristics, including readout current, hysteresis window, and charge storage capacity, with quantitative behavior accurately modeled by the Poole-Frenkel effect. Our results reveal the transformative potential of OAM light in enabling multilevel memory states with exceptional tunability and versatility across different material systems. This work underscores the viability of OAM-driven memory as a platform for the next generation of highly functional, optically responsive memory devices.",

Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and an athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.",

Under acidic conditions, a previously unidentified class of β-carbolines (βCs), termed secofumitremorgins (SFs), with potent antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish models was found and identified via nuclear magnetic resonance, Marfey’s analysis, and quantum calculations. Using gene knockout, heterologous expression, precursor feeding, isotope tracing, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis, a unique biosynthetic pathway for SFs was characterized, beyond the Pictet-Spenglerase–mediated biosynthetic process. Furthermore, an unreported pH-regulated mechanism was unveiled, where P450 (FtmG) facilitated new fumitremorgin intermediate formation, enabling spontaneous, nonenzymatic generation of βCs and spirotryprostatins under distinct pH conditions. Notably, this work provides detailed experimental evidence and reaction mechanisms for synergistic enzymatic and nonenzymatic catalysis driving metabolite diversification under pH stress. The findings expand biosynthetic paradigms for indole alkaloids and highlight the therapeutic potential of pH-elicited βCs, advancing strategies for natural product discovery.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans , chromosome pairing centers (PCs) and PC-recruited proteins mediate homolog recognition and pairing. Here, we further dissect the molecular characteristics of this system and reveal the involvement of a phase-separated compartment in pairing. Focusing on the PC protein HIM-8, we explored its functional domains in vivo and its self-multimerizing properties in vitro. We find that the amino-terminal domain facilitates PC chromatin binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas the middle unstructured region is essential for PC association with the nuclear envelop (NE). Integrated analyses suggest that PC-NE association is mediated by a DNA-containing phase-separated compartment that is spatially distinct from, but connected to, the chromosome axis—likely through flexible linkages. We propose that homology evaluation occurs within this compartment, where direct DNA-DNA interactions could play a role.",

Myeloid cells enriched at CC sites increased AIBP expression postischemia. Genetic deletion of AIBP expanded CXCR4⁺ capillary endothelial cells ( CECs) with stemlike and proliferative properties that remodeled into functional collaterals, a process blocked by CXCR4 inhibition. Mechanistically, AIBP bound the endocytic receptor LRP2 to promote endothelial uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–associated miR-223, a repressor of CXCR4. Disruption of this AIBP–LRP2–HDL–miR-223 axis restored CXCR4 and rescued CC growth.

This study examines how rifting-induced tilting of an escarpment-plateau landscape led to changes in drainage area and water divide positions. Combining topographic analysis and erosion rates inferred from cosmogenic isotope concentrations, we document a westward-tilted low-relief plateau with sinuous remnant escarpments along the western margin and a linear, high-relief escarpment corresponding to the modern drainage divide on the eastern margin. Our numerical modeling demonstrates that landscape asymmetry and contrasting escarpment morphology can result from a shift in the main water divide across the island during the second rifting event. These mechanistic processes allow us to reconstruct the landscape evolution of Madagascar over more than 100 million years with profound implications for the topography, hydrology, and biodiversity development of passive continental margins.",

Bringing these two material flows together, we show that arsenic removed during groundwater treatment can be transformed into pure amorphous As(0) nanoparticles via a two-stage process of alkali extraction and selective reduction. The creation of valuable CRMs from carcinogenic treatment by-products is a potentially disruptive technology for the water sector that can alter global As(0) supply chains.

The spatial distribution and absolute velocity of the high-velocity body and the adjacent ring-shaped swarm cluster indicate that the high-velocity body is a solidified ancient magma. It initially acted as an impermeable barrier to the fluid migrations that triggered swarm earthquakes, eventually rupturing as an asperity of the 2024 earthquake.

By embedding calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) microparticles in alginate/polyacrylamide double-network hydrogels, we create a system where localized calcium release and thus ionic cross-linking can be programmed in both space and time. Spatial control is achieved by direct ink writing of CaCO 3 , while temporal activation is triggered by glucono-δ-lactone, a biocompatible acidifier that releases calcium on demand. This strategy allows user-defined tuning of stiffness and toughness, enabling fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels with tailored mechanical profiles.

Our analyses reveal that diversity is consistently linked to stability through dual pathways: positively associated with resistance and resilience via indirect structural mediation, yet negatively correlated with local stability unless interaction strength is accounted for. Critically, omitting structural mediation yields a net negative diversity-stability correlation, whereas integrating food web structure uncovers context-dependent positive relationships, underscoring structural metrics as pivotal explanatory variables.

          "abstract": "Network methods capture the interplay between structure and dynamics of complex systems across scales by modeling indirect interactions as random walks. However, path data from real-world systems frequently exhibit memory effects that this first-order Markov model fails to capture. Although higher-order Markov models can capture these effects, they grow rapidly in size and require large amounts of data, making them prone to overfitting some parts and underfitting others in systems with uneven coverage. To address this challenge, we construct concise networks from path data by interpolating between first-order and second-order Markov models. We prioritize simplicity and interpretability by creating state nodes that capture prominent second-order effects and by proposing a transparent measure that balances model size and quality. Our concise networks reveal large-scale memory patterns in both synthetic and real-world systems while remaining far simpler than full second-order models.",

Long thought to require full machinery spatiotemporal coordination to drive the flat-to-round vesicle transformations, we reveal a notably simple initiation mechanism in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells involving only the final step, the pore closure. During calcium-triggered exocytosis, calcium activates the phosphatase synaptojanin, rapidly converting PI(4,5)P 2 to PI4P. Elevated PI4P drives the fission enzyme dynamin to close the pores of preexisting and exocytosis-generated Ω-profiles, which are sufficient to generate slow, fast, ultrafast, overshoot, and bulk endocytosis, and kiss-and-run (fusion pore closure). These findings resolve the long-standing mystery of endocytosis and fission initiation and reveal PI4P, not the widely assumed PI(4,5)P 2 , as the key lipid for dynamin-mediated fission. This pathway is clinically important, as it is impaired by synaptojanin mutations associated with Parkinson’s disease and seizures, and is likely disrupted in other disorders involving PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2 dysregulation.",

This study presents a general catalyst design strategy to control MW-induced heating of single metal ions by tuning the zeolite framework and electrostatic interactions. Key structural and electronic factors governing atomic-scale energy localization are identified. Applying this approach to the reverse water-gas shift reaction results in energy efficiency improvements via targeted heating of single-ion sites.

We addressed this issue by acquiring functional near-infrared spectroscopy data from infants aged 3 to 9 months with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The SNHL infants showed efficient small-world characteristics within each hemisphere. However, unlike typically developing controls, who showed an age-related leftward lateralization of network efficiencies, SNHL infants did not exhibit the emergence of hemispheric asymmetry. Intriguingly, lateralization of frontal efficiency was preserved in SNHL infants with mild hearing loss but declined significantly with increasing severity of hearing impairment. These findings suggest that even SNHL infants with some residual hearing experience disruption in the development of functional lateralization. This underscores the importance of providing early auditory access to SNHL infants to support robust functional integration during early development.",

We demonstrate that shear stress generated by fluid flow beneath a rising bubble is the primary mechanism for cell detachment. This strategy, relying solely on physical forces and independent of cell or surface chemistry, can therefore work with a large range of the media, surfaces, and cells. We successfully implement this discovery at the lab-scale by designing a prototype for on-demand cell detachment that maintains high cell viability.

Existing theories propose different mechanisms for these patterns, but no single mechanism has successfully explained both. However, the planetary parameters of the four Solar System giant planets suggest that a fundamentally different mechanism is unlikely. In this study, we show that convection-driven columnar structures can account for both eastward and westward equatorial jets, framing the phenomenon as a bifurcation. Consequently, both superrotation and subrotation emerge as stable branches of the same mechanistic solution. Our analysis of these solutions uncovers similarities in the properties of equatorial waves and the leading-order momentum balance. This study suggests that the fundamental dynamics governing equatorial jet formation may be more broadly applicable across the Jovian planets than previously believed, offering a unified explanation for their two distinct zonal wind patterns.",

          "abstract": "Hearing relies upon speedy synaptic transmission of sound information from inner hair cells (IHCs) to spiral ganglion neurons. To accomplish this, IHCs use a sophisticated presynaptic machinery including the multi-C 2 domain protein otoferlin that is affected by human deafness mutations. Otoferlin is essential for IHC exocytosis, but how it binds Ca 2+ and the target membrane to serve synaptic vesicle (SV) tethering, docking, and fusion remained unclear. Here, we obtained cryo–electron microscopy structures of otoferlin and employed molecular dynamics simulations of membrane binding. We show that membrane binding by otoferlin involves C 2 B-C 2 G domains and repositions C 2 F and C 2 G domains. Disruption of Ca 2+ -binding sites of the C 2 D domain in mice altered synaptic sound encoding and eliminated the Ca 2+ cooperativity of IHC exocytosis, indicating that it requires the binding of several Ca 2+ -ions by otoferlin. Together, our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying otoferlin-mediated SV docking and support the role of otoferlin as Ca 2+ sensor of SV fusion in IHCs.",

Unlike conventional approaches that avoid hysteresis, HasMorph intentionally exploits friction-induced shape hysteresis, the difference in robot shape during loading and unloading, to enable numerous reversible shape changes using only two sequentially controlled actuators via an inverted zigzag tendon-sheath mechanism. Integrated with tip growth, the robot achieves complex, reversible morphologies and frictionless follow-the-leader navigation. Mechanics and kinematics models reveal how friction and input sequences govern shape evolution and expand the robot’s configuration space. Experiments validate dexterous morphing and robust navigation in unstructured environments. HasMorph enables direct, fine-grained actuation of hyperredundant soft bodies with minimal actuation, offering a scalable approach to soft robot design.

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the α7 nAChR in complex with nicotine in both an open state and multiple desensitized states. Comparative analyses reveal progressive conformational changes during recovery from nicotine-induced desensitization and show that asymmetric nicotine binding disrupts the symmetry of the channel pore at the 16′ and 17′ sites.

First, pIOD induces westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial Atlantic, causing thermocline deepening along the TSEA coast through oceanic Kelvin waves, favoring development of MHWs. Second, pIOD enhances rainfall over central Africa, increasing Congo River discharge and resulting in a shallower mixed layer in the TSEA coastal region, also promoting MHW formation. We further develop an empirical model using pIOD as the predictor for TSEA MHWs, demonstrating high predictive skill with a 3-month lead time. In a warming climate, the remote influence of pIOD on TSEA MHWs may be further exacerbated, underscoring critical need to incorporate this factor into marine hazard forecasting for the region.",

          "abstract": "The recent adaptation of the cereal crop sorghum to a global aphid outbreak was a fortuitous case of evolutionary rescue, but the pangenomic and molecular basis is not known. We show that RMES1 disrupts phloem feeding via activation of conserved immunity networks, with a growth-to-defense transition mediated by phytohormone signaling and activated by nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) resistance genes on a structural variant. The causative NLRs [resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1A (RMES1A) and RMES1B] lack signaling domains and have adenosine triphosphatase mutations expected to abrogate function, suggesting that RMES1 NLRs regulate immunity via a noncanonical mechanism. The RMES1 NLR family is ancient, orthologous to phloem-feeding resistance genes in rice and syntenic across the grass superpangenome. Thus, gene birth-and-death processes at an ancient gene cluster created rare standing variation and provided the adaptive allele for evolutionary rescue.",

          "abstract": "Monoubiquitinated histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub) is a modification associated with transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin formation. Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21), one of four major H2AK119-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes. However, the mechanisms by which USP21 specifically deubiquitinates H2AK119ub and is regulated are unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of the USP21 catalytic domain bound to an H2AK119ub nucleosome, which revealed a recognition mode that differs from that of other H2AK119-specific DUBs. We unexpectedly found that the N-terminal IDR of USP21 inhibits the enzyme’s activity. Using AlphaFold-Multimer to perform a virtual screen of USP21 interactors, we identified kinases that phosphorylate the USP21 IDR and thereby relieve autoinhibition. AlphaFold3 modeling of USP21 suggests a structural model for autoinhibition. AlphaFold analysis suggests that phosphorylation-regulated autoinhibition may be a feature of various USP enzymes. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of H2AK119 deubiquitination and reveal a previously unexplored mode of phosphorylation-dependent DUB autoregulation.",

In contrast, a third pathway, which leverages the two-electron nucleophilic potential of alkyl–Co III , has remained unexplored because of the inherently low polarization of the C–Co bond. Here, we report an axial-coordination activation strategy to unlock this reactivity space in Co-MHAT catalysis. Through stoichiometric organometallic studies using well-defined alkyl–Co III complexes, we demonstrate that an alkoxide ligand can render alkyl–Co III sufficiently nucleophilic to displace a suitable leaving group, via a stereospecific backside-backside approach. This pathway is further applied in catalysis, enabling a diastereoselective redox neutral Co-MHAT cyclopropanation reaction.",

NLPs disrupt plant membranes through interactions with glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), but the specificity of these interactions remains unclear. We studied binding and pore formation of NLPs in model membranes with GIPCs derived from dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. Using the cytotoxic NLP 2 from fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa (MpNEP2), we show that membrane binding and damage extend beyond previously studied oomycetal NLPs. Furthermore, NLP Pya from the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum exhibits promiscuous binding with a marked preference for branched GIPC series B lipids. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the structural plasticity of NLP Pya provides a rational basis for its interaction with a variety of GIPC headgroups. These results clarify the molecular basis of NLP cytotoxicity and emphasize their role in broad-spectrum pathogenicity.",

Its frontline treatment uses the BH3 mimetic venetoclax to trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, drug resistance nearly always develops, calling for therapies to circumvent it. Advanced microscopy and genome-wide CRISPRi screen analyses pinpointed mitochondrial adaptations primarily mediated by the master regulator of cristae shape optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) as critical for BH3 mimetics resistance. Resistant AML cells up-regulate OPA1 to modify their mitochondrial structure and evade apoptosis. MYLS22 and Opitor-0, two specific and nontoxic OPA1 inhibitors, promote apoptotic cristae remodeling and cytochrome c release, synergizing with venetoclax in AML cells and xenografts derived from AML patients ex vivo and in vivo. Mechanistically, OPA1 loss renders AML cells dependent on glutamine and sensitizes them to ferroptosis by activating ATF4-regulated integrated stress responses. Overall, our data clarify how OPA1 up-regulation allows AML cells' metabolic flexibility and survival and nominates specific OPA1 inhibitors as efficacious tools to overcome venetoclax resistance in leukemia.",

We demonstrate a strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids by incorporating ultrasmall silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice constants of Ag and Au allow dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with coupling strength ~15 meV∙Å, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and show up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the combined effect of charge transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization enhances the SOI.",

Through coculturing for 30 to 120 days, we observed the presence of tubular blood vessels at the center of vROs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the vascularization in ROs was associated with angiogenesis and immune response. Furthermore, we observed that MGs in VOs migrated and integrated into the vROs as VOs and ROs fused, with the vROs exhibiting responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. The vROs expressed tight junction protein claudin-5 and displayed similar characteristics to the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB).

We additionally show that synchronization can be enhanced with the help of squeezing perpendicular to the direction of the drive and, counterintuitively, linear dissipation.

We provide an observational verification of the physical link between global precipitation and net atmospheric radiative cooling.

Trends of longwave cooling and shortwave heating are 0.76 ± 0.48 and 0.64 ± 0.27 Wm −2 dec -1 , respectively. The longwave trend is a result of partial cancelation among contributions from increasing surface skin temperature, air temperature, and water vapor. Increasing shortwave absorption is caused by increasing water vapor. The trend of global mean diabatic heating by precipitation is 0.03 ± 0.61 Wm −2 dec −1 . These results observationally confirm that an absence of current global precipitation trends is consistent with net atmospheric radiative cooling trends explained by nearly balanced changes between longwave cooling and shortwave heating.",

We show that NP decoration enhances MDSC immunomodulatory function, facilitates their trafficking to inflamed CNS regions, and increases NP accumulation within CNS. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, CITED exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy, resulting in reduced disease progression, improved motor function, and diminished myelin damage. Mechanistic studies reveal that CITED exerts its therapeutic effects by targeted reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS. Specifically, CITED inhibits immune cell infiltration, rebalances CD4 T cell phenotypes, and promotes the polarization of myeloid cells toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Collectively, CITED could provide a broadly effective approach for targeted immune restoration in multiple sclerosis and potentially other autoimmune diseases.",

Here, we investigate ciliary metachronism in larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerelii , using whole-body high-speed imaging and physical and biological manipulations. The results reveal an unexpected wave structure featuring strong coupling within multiciliated cells that breaks down across cell boundaries. Using laser ablation to selectively remove parts of the ciliary band, we establish the necessity and sufficiency of ciliary band continuity for wave transmission and the importance of nonreciprocal steric interactions.

Here, we uncover a critical role for the ATM-TRMT10A-BRCA1 signaling axis in regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARPi sensitivity. We demonstrate that ATM phosphorylates TRMT10A at serine-28 after DNA damage, promoting BRCA1 recruitment and efficient HR repair. TRMT10A deletion disrupts HR repair, sensitizing cells to PARPis. Moreover, TRMT10A is up-regulated in mCRPC through stabilization by USP10. Targeting USP10 with spautin-1 induces TRMT10A degradation and enhances tumor sensitivity to PARPis in cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings identify TRMT10A as a therapeutic vulnerability in mCRPC and demonstrate that combined inhibition of PARP and USP10 offers a promising synthetic lethal strategy for a broader group of patients lacking classical BRCA mutations.",

This work enables high-performance, spatially multiplexed multiwavelength emission for on-chip photonics, facilitating advances in broadband signal processing, optical computing, and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Accommodation, the space available for potential sediment deposition, is a central concept for stratigraphic heterogeneity prediction and deciphering Earth history. We define accommodation quantitatively as mean thickness of potential deposition per unit of time, calculated per unit area based on a maximum deposition rate and slope-controlled probabilities of erosion and deposition. Testing this definition in a simple numerical stratigraphic forward model reproduces key stratal geometries and behaviors, suggesting basic predictive power. However, the model output is missing much stratigraphic detail, and it is difficult to see how this can be added through extension of the accommodation definition. This suggests that accommodation has less predictive power than typically assumed; many important elements of stratal prediction must come instead from independent calculation of sediment erosion, routing, and depositional processes.",

          "abstract": "Chiral electromagnetic materials, with their unique spatial configurations, can regulate the propagation and polarization of electromagnetic waves, serving as powerful tools for tailoring electromagnetic behavior. However, their functional potential is often limited by the intrinsic constraints of conventional host materials, which typically lack sufficient flexibility in defect engineering, magnetic modulation, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement. To address this challenge, we introduce high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs) into carbon-based chiral frameworks, constructing HEMO and carbon nanocoil (HEMO@CNC) composites. By combining advanced microscopy, electromagnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that increasing entropy and helical strain jointly induce nonlinear changes in SOC strength and defect-related localized states. Benefiting from these effects, the HEMO@CNC system achieves an ultrawide bandwidth, outperforming linear structures and low-entropy systems. This work provides a potential paradigm for integrating topological defect engineering and high-entropy quantum modulation, offering deeper insights into advancing electromagnetic functional materials from macroscopic design toward geometry-defect-spin synergistic regulation.",

However, the “livingness” of cells poses a short life span and low tolerance to harsh conditions, limiting the practical use of such materials. Here, we developed materials with programmable and dormant functionalities, grown from a mixture of Komagataeibacter rhaeticus and Bacillus endospores under engineered medium conditions. K. rhaeticus produces the bacterial cellulose (BC) matrix that integrates Bacillus spores within, whereas the confined spores keep dormant and are resistant to harsh conditions in the environment. Bacillus spores can germinate and confer desired functions to the materials. Modulating the binding affinity of spores to the BC matrix with genetic engineering can improve cell loading and therefore enhance the material functionality. These materials can serve as a versatile on-demand platform for applications as biosensors, biocatalytic materials, and in situ transformation of mechanically robust cellulose-based composites.",

We introduce the Quantum Attention Network (QuAN), a classical artificial intelligence (AI) framework leveraging attention mechanisms tailored for learning quantum complexity. Inspired by large language models, QuAN treats measurement snapshots as tokens while respecting permutation invariance. Combined with our parameter-efficient miniset self-attention block, this enables QuAN to access high-order moments of bit-string distributions and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We test QuAN across three quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data. In regimes inaccessible to existing theory, QuAN unveils the complete phase diagram for noisy toric code data as a function of both noise types, highlighting AI’s transformative potential for assisting quantum hardware.",

Here, we use the high-resolution Earth System Model EC-Earth3, coupled with a dynamic vegetation model, to simulate climate and vegetation responses to East African uplift across three key Miocene intervals (25, 20, and 15 Ma) under varying atmospheric CO 2 levels. Our results show that tectonic uplift, combined with declining CO 2 during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, substantially reduced forest cover and promoted grassland expansion across East and Central Africa. These environmental transitions likely facilitated faunal dispersals and ecological turnover, including among large mammals and early crown hominoids. By integrating geodynamic reconstructions, paleoclimate modeling, and fossil data, this study provides insight into how large-scale Earth system processes shaped Miocene biodiversity and altered the environmental context for mammalian evolution in Africa.",

Here, we report the high-quality germline genome assembly of a marine ciliate Euplotes vannus , where ~80% are transposons and other germline-specific DNA that has to be precisely eliminated during soma development. We demonstrate that a class of soma-derived 30-nucleotide small RNAs precisely targets nontransposon DNA against elimination during this process. Small RNA–mediated targeting remains functional across varying small RNA lengths and is compatible with heterozygous sites. These small RNAs are cleaved by Dicer-like ribonuclease from long noncoding RNAs, which are bidirectionally transcribed of somatic chromosomes, initiated at subtelomeric chromosome breakage sequences (5′-TTGAA-3′). On the basis of these findings and time-course transcriptomic profiling, we propose a model elucidating the molecular mechanism of DNA elimination in Euplotes . These findings provide insights into the role of small RNAs in transmitting genetic information across generations and maintaining genome stability.",

However, the ultrafast dynamics limit of UC has yet to be addressed, preventing its integration into the nonlinear optical regime. Here, we find a giant single-step UC of ~200 milli–electron volts via sub–35-femtosecond phonon dynamics in two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in the nonlinear regime. The single-step UC approaches the phonon dynamics limit of ~23 femtoseconds and gains energy about eight times the room-temperature thermal energy (~25 milli–electron volts), enabling its synergistic integration into the nonlinear regime. Benefiting from the unique electron-phonon coupling between organic vibrations and excitons in inorganic lattices, the UC demonstrates distinctive signatures of Raman anisotropy and strong nonlinearity. This work opens new avenues for studying uncharted phonon dynamics and nonlinear optical mechanisms, offering substantial advantages in optical refrigeration, upconverting energy harvesting and optical microscopy.",

          "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) limitation severely affects crop yields. To address the molecular basis of inorganic phosphate (Pi) specific transport within the sulfate transporter (SULTR) family, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of Oryza sativa SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (OsSPDT), a key Pi transporter for grain allocation, in apo- and Pi-binding states. OsSPDT forms a domain-swapped homodimer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (NTD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) divided into core and gate subdomains, and a C-terminal sulfate transporter and antisigma factor (STAS) domain. The structure adopts a cytoplasm-facing conformation with Pi coordinated at the core-gate interface. Key residues, including SPDT-unique Ser 170 , mediate Pi specificity within the binding pocket, distinguishing it evolutionarily from sulfate transporters within the SULTR family. Domain-swapping and mutational studies demonstrate functional interdependence of the NTD, TMD, and STAS domains. This work elucidates Pi selectivity in plant SULTR transporters and provides a molecular basis for developing low-phytate rice via OsSPDT gene editing.",

These multistable metastructures are constructed by cutting and bonding thin polymer sheets with patterned cutouts, enabling programmable prestored elastic energy. A single unit achieves up to 20 stable configurations, while a four-unit assembly yields 256 reconfigured states, through simple folding of dynamic virtual creases. When integrated with thin sheet–based, multiresponsive soft actuators, these metastructures become highly adaptive metabots, including universal, noninvasive bistable soft grippers; magnetic multigait jumpers; and dual-responsive crawlers powered by magnetic and electroactive actuation. These systems exhibit high adaptability and maneuverability, capable of navigating complex terrains and confined environments via on-demand shape transformations, paving the way for energy-efficient, reconfigurable soft robotic platforms.",

Nineteen microscopic ferropericlase grains with different Mg#s were released from Juína and Kankan diamonds with mantle-like carbon, for Mg and Fe isotopic analysis. Two groups of ferropericlase inclusions can be distinguished with respect to diamond growth: high-Mg# inclusions with mantle-like Mg and Fe (δ 26 Mg = −0.23 ± 0.22‰; δ 56 Fe = 0.00 ± 0.14‰) inferred to be preexisting and lower Mg# inclusions with non–mantle-like heavy Fe (δ 56 Fe up to +0.3‰) and light Mg (δ 26 Mg down to −1.4‰) inferred to be coeval. We propose that coeval ferropericlase inclusions formed by melting of hydrated and carbonated peridotitic slab components subducted to lower mantle depths. Continuous reaction of these melts with surrounding reduced, dry slab harzburgite can produce the large range in Mg# and Ni contents of our ferropericlase suite—a heretofore unexplained feature of global ferropericlase data.",

How can we better understand the concentration of insider control in Tech? Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data to examine the rise of US start-up investments post-dotcom, this article demonstrates that a small group of new venture capital (VC) entrants played a key role in advancing founder control in Tech to win deals against established VC firms and make outsized capital gains. I argue that the VC market follows a winners-take-all logic, which facilitated the uptake of founder control in Tech via dual-class shares because of the success of new VC entrants and early founder-controlled tech firms exiting between 2010 and 2014, and the growing investments by nontraditional, “passive” investors post-2010. This matters because the winners-take-all logic reinforces capital concentration among leading VCs while many Tech monopolies are now controlled by a small tech elite fraction.",

With limited centralized transfers, the ability to provide these services is determined by the base of taxable wealth that is contained within contested municipal boundaries. We document how jurisdictional fragmentation and economic segregation interact to create tax base fragmentation, the unequal allocation of taxable property wealth across jurisdictional boundaries. The level of tax base fragmentation varies across the country, but is substantial in many large metros, and is associated with both the amount and type of revenue raised by local governments. We also identify hundreds of individual jurisdictions that disproportionately benefit from or are harmed by tax base fragmentation, showing how the institutional structure of US fiscal federalism allows some jurisdictions to function as tax shelters for wealthy residents and corporations, while conversely subjecting other jurisdictions to severe fiscal stress, even in broadly prosperous metropolitan areas.",
