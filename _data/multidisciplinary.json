          "abstract": "Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR )-driven lung cancers 1,2 . We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort 3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies.",

          "abstract": "The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development 1–6 . P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (&gt;80%) 7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties 8 . Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum . Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L ( Pf Snf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200 ) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that Pf Snf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. Pf Snf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of Pf Snf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation.",

          "abstract": "Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change 1 . Their melting leads to increased local geohazards 2 , and impacts marine 3 and terrestrial 4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources 6 , and both global water and energy cycles 7,8 . Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present 9,10 and future 11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series 14–16 . Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet 17 . Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments 14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles 12,16,18 , which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century 11,12,18 .",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1,2 . HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that accumulate progressive driver mutations 3 , with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin 2 . However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies 4 . Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations 5,6 . Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC 7 . Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.",

However, their efficacy is limited in tumours with few somatic mutations and substantial intratumoural heterogeneity 2–4 . Here we introduce a previously uncharacterized class of tumour-wide public neoantigens originating from RNA splicing aberrations in diverse cancer types. We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22 . In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Moreover, our study highlights a role for dysregulated splicing factor expression in specific cancer types, leading to recurrent patterns of neojunction upregulation. These findings establish a molecular basis for T cell-based immunotherapies addressing the challenges of intratumoural heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "When two insulating, neutral materials are contacted and separated, they exchange electrical charge 1 . Experiments have long suggested that this ‘contact electrification’ is transitive, with different materials ordering into ‘triboelectric series’ based on the sign of charge acquired 2 . At the same time, the effect is plagued by unpredictability, preventing consensus on the mechanism and casting doubt on the rhyme and reason that series imply 3 . Here we expose an unanticipated connection between the unpredictability and order in contact electrification: nominally identical materials initially exchange charge randomly and intransitively, but—over repeated experiments—order into triboelectric series. We find that this evolution is driven by the act of contact itself—samples with more contacts in their history charge negatively to ones with fewer contacts. Capturing this ‘contact bias’ in a minimal model, we recreate both the initial randomness and ultimate order in numerical simulations and use it experimentally to force the appearance of a triboelectric series of our choosing. With a set of surface-sensitive techniques to search for the underlying alterations contact creates, we only find evidence of nanoscale morphological changes, pointing to a mechanism strongly coupled with mechanics. Our results highlight the centrality of contact history in contact electrification and suggest that focusing on the unpredictability that has long plagued the effect may hold the key to understanding it.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic recombination starts with SPO11 generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1 . SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic 2 and gametocidal 3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks 4 —how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage 5 . In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation.",

          "abstract": "SPO11 initiates meiotic recombination through the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1,2 , but this catalytic activity has never been reconstituted in vitro 3,4 . Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Scholars and practitioners widely posit that listening to other people enhances efforts to persuade them. Listening may enhance persuasion by promoting cognitive processing, reducing defensiveness, and improving perceptions of the persuader. However, empirical tests of this widely theorized hypothesis are surprisingly scarce. We review the case for and against this hypothesis, arguing previous research has not sufficiently attended to reasons why listening may not enhance persuasion. We test this hypothesis using a preregistered, well-powered field experiment in which trained professional canvassers, acting as confederates, had ∼10 min video conversations with U.S. participants ( N = 1,485) about unauthorized immigration, a salient topic of disagreement. We independently randomized whether confederates shared a persuasive narrative about an undocumented immigrant and whether they practiced high-quality nonjudgmental listening to participants’ opinions. We measured outcomes immediately after the conversation and again five weeks later. Sharing a persuasive narrative meaningfully and durably reduced prejudice and changed policy attitudes. The listening manipulation also successfully improved perceptions of the persuader and increased processing.

          "abstract": "Groundwater is essential to urban water supplies throughout the world, but we do not understand how quantity and quality issues may jeopardize the ability of cities to meet their water needs. Here, we present a national analysis of both quantity and quality challenges facing China’s urban groundwater supply security, using high-resolution groundwater depletion modeling and a recently compiled dataset detailing quality violations in drinking groundwater sources. We estimate that 180 cities (about half of the prefecture-level-and-above cities), accounting for 311 million urban residents, face at least one groundwater pressure between 2016 and 2021. Cities that face dual quantity and quality pressures pinpoints hotspots of intense groundwater threats— Specifically, 40 cities, mainly situated in Northeast China and the middle to lower reaches of the Yellow River, are exposed to dual groundwater pressures. The results highlight the interconnected and possibly mutually reinforcing nature of groundwater depletion and quality issues. The logistic regression models indicate that groundwater depletion and quality violations are associated with natural water endowment and anthropogenic factors. Particularly, drinking groundwater quality issues are clustered in relation to socioeconomic gaps, with larger, wealthier cities being less prone to such problems. We argue that securing drinking water sources in small and poor cities through integrated groundwater management and economic assistance should be an important national priority for achieving groundwater supply sustainability.",

          "abstract": "An enormous body of literature argues that recommendation algorithms drive political polarization by creating “filter bubbles” and “rabbit holes.” Using four experiments with nearly 9,000 participants, we show that manipulating algorithmic recommendations to create these conditions has limited effects on opinions. Our experiments employ a custom-built video platform with a naturalistic, YouTube-like interface presenting real YouTube videos and recommendations. We experimentally manipulate YouTube’s actual recommendation algorithm to simulate filter bubbles and rabbit holes by presenting ideologically balanced and slanted choices. Our design allows us to intervene in a feedback loop that has confounded the study of algorithmic polarization—the complex interplay between supply of recommendations and user demand for content—to examine downstream effects on policy attitudes. We use over 130,000 experimentally manipulated recommendations and 31,000 platform interactions to estimate how recommendation algorithms alter users’ media consumption decisions and, indirectly, their political attitudes. Our results cast doubt on widely circulating theories of algorithmic polarization by showing that even heavy-handed (although short-term) perturbations of real-world recommendations have limited causal effects on policy attitudes. Given our inability to detect consistent evidence for algorithmic effects, we argue the burden of proof for claims about algorithm-induced polarization has shifted. Our methodology, which captures and modifies the output of real-world recommendation algorithms, offers a path forward for future investigations of black-box artificial intelligence systems. Our findings reveal practical limits to effect sizes that are feasibly detectable in academic experiments.",

Previous studies showed that therapeutic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies with α2,6-sialyl complex type (SCT) glycan attached to Fc-Asn297 exhibited optimal binding to the Fc receptors on effector cells associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE. However, the production of antibodies with homogeneous Fc-SCT glycan requires multiple in vitro enzymatic and purification steps. In this study, we report two cell-based methods to produce Fc-GlcNAc antibody and Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies with improved effector functions. First, we expressed endoglycosidase S2 in Expi293F GnT1- cells to trim all N-glycans to Fc-GlcNAc antibody for in vitro transglycosylation to generate homogeneous antibodies with well-defined Fc glycan. Second, we engineered the glycosylation pathway of HEK293T cells through knock-out of undesired glycosyltransferases and knock-in of desired glycosyltransferases to produce Fc-SCT-enriched antibodies and evaluated their binding to Fc receptors, and we found that the Fc-SCT-enriched antibody is like or better than the homogeneous Fc-SCT antibody in binding to the Fc receptors associated with ADCC, ADCP, and ADVE.",

          "abstract": "Cell populations must adjust their phenotypic composition to adapt to changing environments. One adaptation strategy is to maintain distinct phenotypic subsets within the population and to modulate their relative abundances via gene regulation. Another strategy involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. We found that the migrating populations became enriched with high-performing swimming phenotypes in each environment, allowing the populations to adapt without requiring mutations or gene regulation. This adaptation is dynamic and rapid, reversing in a few doubling times when migration ceases. By measuring the chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration toward different attractants, we demonstrated that adaptation acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. These measurements are consistent with a general mechanism in which adaptation results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating underperforming phenotypes. Thus, collective migration enables cell populations with continuous, multidimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions.",

SARM1 exists in an inactive form and is activated following nerve injury. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying SARM1 activation remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we report the identification of a potent proactivator of SARM1, G10, which is converted into a direct activator (M1) by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Cryoelectron microscopy structures of SARM1 bound to M1, as well as to M1 and a nonhydrolyzable NAD + analog (1AD), captured two intermediate activation states and the fully active state, revealing a stepwise mechanism of SARM1 activation. Further, introducing a disulfide bond to prevent conformational transitions between the two intermediate states mediated by M1 stabilized SARM1 in its inactive form and blocked M1-induced cell death. Together, these findings propose a sequential, stepwise activation model for SARM1 and offer a framework for developing potential SARM1 inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the two-domain capsid protein dimerizes, and this dimer connects individual chains in the mature capsid lattice. Previous NMR studies have shown that different dimer arrangements can be formed by isolated capsid protein chains and in assembled capsid lattices; however, the dynamics and functional relevance of these alternate dimers are unknown. To explore the conformational landscape of the CA-CTD dimer, we carried out atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using the weighted ensemble path sampling strategy, generating an ensemble of conformations. Focusing on the two dimer forms previously observed via solution NMR, we refined the conformational ensemble to highlight two metastable states using a Markov state model. Experimentally, we measured the interconversion rates between the two alternate dimers using 19 F NMR, and these rates showed good agreement with the interconversion rates derived from the simulations. After identifying the key interactions that distinguish the dimer states, the alternate dimer was further experimentally verified through disulfide crosslinking. Our results demonstrate the advantages of pairing weighted ensemble path sampling with 19 F NMR to gain atomistic insights into the hidden dimer state of the HIV-1 capsid protein.",

          "abstract": "While advances in genome editing technologies have simplified gene disruption in many organisms, the study of essential genes requires development of conditional disruption or knockdown systems that are not available in most organisms. Such is the case for Trypanosoma cruzi , a parasite that causes Chagas disease, a severely neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America that is often fatal. Our knowledge of the identity of essential genes and their functions in T. cruzi has been severely constrained by historical challenges in very basic genetic manipulation and the absence of RNA interference machinery. Here, we describe the development and use of self-cleaving RNA sequences to conditionally regulate essential gene expression in T. cruzi . Using these tools, we identified essential roles for Polo-like and Aurora kinases in T. cruzi cell division, mirroring their functions in Trypanosoma brucei . Importantly, we demonstrate conditional knockdown of essential genes in intracellular amastigotes, the disease-causing stage of the parasite in its human host. This conditional knockdown system enables the efficient and scalable functional characterization of essential genes in T. cruzi and provides a framework for the development of conditional gene knockdown systems for other nonmodel organisms.",

          "abstract": "The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multiscale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multiscale data are characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, nonstationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multiscale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multiresolution coherent spatio-temporal scale separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multiscale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of dynamic mode decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multiscale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multiscale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multiscale datasets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multiscale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.",

In this study, we introduce a machine learning-based approach that accurately predicts dynamic three-dimensional protein structures from 2DIR descriptors. Our method establishes a robust “spectrum-structure” relationship, enabling the recovery of three-dimensional structures across a wide variety of proteins. It demonstrates broad applicability in predicting dynamic structures along different protein folding trajectories, spanning timescales from microseconds to milliseconds. This approach also shows promise in identifying the structures of previously uncharacterized proteins based solely on their spectral descriptors.

While most of these peptides are further processed into amino acids, a subset evades complete degradation and plays key roles in biological processes such as antigen presentation, signaling, and apoptosis. However, the variability in peptide lengths and the diverse composition of proteasomes make their comprehensive identification and characterization particularly challenging. Here, we present a method that enables real-time identification of generated peptides, as well as uncleaved and partially cleaved protein substrates, revealing the processive nature of protein proteasomal degradation. Our intact degradomics workflow is based on intact mass spectrometry measurements and treats the enzymatically produced peptides as if they were generated within the mass spectrometer, akin to top–down products. We applied this approach to determine the kinetic profile of proteasome degradation and compare the real-time activity of proteasomes isolated from different mouse organs, uncovering distinct functionalities of the complex. Overall, this method offers a valuable tool for studying peptide degradation products across various proteasome configurations, while also enabling the investigation of how interacting proteins, inhibitors, and activators influence proteasome activity. Furthermore, its adaptability makes it applicable to a wide range of other proteolytic complexes, broadening its potential impact in the field.",

          "abstract": "G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate various physiological functions by rewiring cellular gene expression in response to extracellular signals. Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific posttranscriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity for which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal β2-ARs and report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets, we find significant enrichment of genes with 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal β2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. This site-selective crosstalk between the pathways is observed in multiple cell models with native β2-ARs, across a range of endogenous and synthetic adrenergic agonists, and for other GPCRs with intracellular activity. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape.",

Here, we show that there are alarming disparities across individuals in different racial and ethnic groups in how much binding data are associated with their MHC alleles. We introduce a machine learning framework to assess the impact of this data imbalance for predicting binding for any given MHC allele, and apply it to develop a state-of-the-art MHC binding prediction model that additionally provides per-allele performance estimates. We demonstrate that our MHC binding model successfully mitigates much of the data disparities observed across racial groups.

Here, we used biochemistry and mass spectrometry to define PSKH1’s consensus substrate motif, protein interactors, and how interactors, including Ca 2+ sensor proteins, promote or suppress activity. Intriguingly, despite the absence of a canonical Calmodulin binding motif, Ca 2+ -Calmodulin activated PSKH1 while, in contrast, the ER-resident Ca 2+ sensor of the Cab45, Reticulocalbin, Erc55, Calumenin (CREC) family, Reticulocalbin-3, suppressed PSKH1 catalytic activity. In addition to antagonistic regulation of the PSKH1 kinase domain by Ca 2+ sensing proteins, we identified UNC119B as a protein interactor that activates PSKH1 via direct engagement of the kinase domain. Our findings identify complementary allosteric mechanisms by which regulatory proteins tune PSKH1’s catalytic activity and raise the possibility that different Ca 2+ sensors may act more broadly to tune kinase activities by detecting and decoding extremes of intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations.",

          "abstract": "Anti-CTLA-4 Abs (ACAs) are a breakthrough for cancer therapy, but their potential is limited by immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAE). We previously reported that ACAs with acidic pH-sensitive binding to CTLA-4 exhibit higher antitumor activity with fewer irAE. We now test a panel of variants of Ipilimumab (Ipi), the first ACA cancer therapeutic, for tumoricidal efficacy and irAE. Surprisingly, not all pH-sensitive Ipi variants exhibited an enhanced therapeutic index. Ipi13, which retained binding to CTLA-4 at pH 6.0 but dissociated at lower pH, showed no enhancement. By contrast, Ipi25, which dissociates from CTLA-4 at pH 6.0, the pH of the early endosome (EE), showed greater tumor regression and less severe irAE. Confocal microscopy showed that Ipi13 maintained colocalization with CTLA-4 at the late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes resulting in lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4. Conversely, Ipi25 did not colocalize with CTLA-4 in LE or lysosomes after endocytosis but allowed both proteins to transfer to recycling endosomes. EE dissociation was also characteristic of variants of Tremelimumab (Treme), another clinical ACA, that showed better efficacy and fewer side effects. Thus, our data reveal the significance of early intracellular dissociation from CTLA-4 to improve ACAs for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is the most important essential nutrient required by plants. Most land plants have evolved two N uptake pathways, a direct root pathway and a symbiotic pathway, via association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, the interaction between the two pathways is ambiguous. Here, we report that OsNAR2.1–OsNRT2s, the nitrate (NO 3 − ) transporter complexes with crucial roles in direct NO 3 − uptake, are also recruited for symbiotic NO 3 − uptake. OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.1/2.2 are coregulated by NIN-like protein 3 (OsNLP3), a key regulator in NO 3 − signaling, and OsPHR2, a major regulator of phosphate starvation responses. More importantly, AM symbiosis induces expression of OsNAR2.1 – OsNRT2s, OsNLP3, and OsSPX4 , encoding an intracellular Pi sensor, in arbuscular-containing cells, but weakens their expression in the epidermis. OsNAR2.1 and OsNLP3 can activate both mycorrhizal NO 3 − uptake and mycorrhization efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that OsNLP3 and OsPHR2 orchestrate the direct and mycorrhizal NO 3 − uptake pathways by regulating the NAR2.1–NRT2s complexes in rice.",

          "abstract": "The Red Sea, a nascent ocean basin connected to the Indian Ocean via a shallow strait, is assumed to have experienced significant environmental changes during the last glacial period due to a sea-level drop likely exceeding 110 m. This study investigates the hypothesis that hydrodynamic restriction led to severe ecological impacts, including basin-wide extinction due to elevated salinity followed by a short time of oxygen depletion. Uranium–Thorium dating of deep-water corals (DWCs) from 26 northern Red Sea sites reveals coral growth during and after the Last Glacial sea-level lowstand, indicating tolerable seawater chemistry. Additional geochemical data show no significant difference in Red Sea chemistry or temperature between the Latest Pleistocene and Holocene. A meta-analysis of 27 deep-sea cores reveals that while planktonic foraminifera experienced local extinction, other microfossil groups seemingly persisted. These findings suggest that the Red Sea survived the last sea-level lowstand, challenging the paradigm of a complete ecological collapse and providing insights into the resilience of marine ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Longitudinal imaging data are routinely acquired for health studies and patient monitoring. A central goal in longitudinal studies is tracking relevant change over time. Traditional methods remove nuisance variation with custom pipelines to focus on significant changes. In this work, we present a machine learning–based method that automatically ignores irrelevant changes and extracts the time-varying signal of interest. Our method, called Learning-based Inference of Longitudinal imAge Changes (LILAC), performs a pairwise comparison of longitudinal images in order to make a temporal difference prediction. LILAC employs a convolutional Siamese architecture to extract feature pairs, followed by subtraction and a bias-free fully connected layer to learn meaningful temporal image differences. We first showcase LILAC’s ability to capture key longitudinal changes by simply training it to predict the temporal ordering of images. In our experiments, temporal ordering accuracy exceeded 0.98, and predicted time differences were strongly correlated with actual changes in relevant variables (Pearson Correlation Coefficient r = 0.911 with embryo phase change, and r = 0.875 with time interval in wound healing). Next, we trained LILAC to explicitly predict specific targets, such as the change in clinical scores in patients with mild cognitive impairment. LILAC models achieved over a 40% reduction in root mean square error compared to baseline methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that LILAC effectively localizes and quantifies relevant individual-level changes in longitudinal imaging data, offering valuable insights for studying temporal mechanisms or guiding clinical decisions.",

          "abstract": "Electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of furfural represents a sustainable route for biomass valorization. Unfortunately, traditional Cu-catalyzed ECR suffers from diversified product distribution and industrial-incompatible production rates, mainly caused by the intricate mechanism−performance relationship. Here, we manipulate hydrogenation pathways on Cu by introducing ceria as an auxiliary component, which enables the mechanism switching from proton-coupled electron transfer to electrochemical hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and thus high-speed furfural-to-furfuryl alcohol electroconversion. Theoretical and kinetic analyses show that oxygen-vacancy-rich ceria delivers an efficient formation−diffusion−hydrogenation chain of H* by diminishing H* adsorption. Spectroscopic characterizations indicate that Cu/ceria interfacial perimeter enriches the local furfural, synergistically lowering the barrier of the rate-determining HAT step across the perimeter. Our Cu/ceria catalyst realizes high-rate HAT-dominated ECR for electrosynthesis of single-product furfuryl alcohol, achieving a high production rate of 19.1 ± 0.4 mol h −1 m −2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97 ± 1% at an economically viable partial current density of over 0.1 A cm −2 . Our results demonstrate a highly efficient route for biofeedstock valorization with enhanced techno-economic feasibility.",

Here, we propose an “ on-demand release ” model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is an important step. A coculture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, G protein-coupled receptor-based (GRAB) eCB2.0 , and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by protein kinase C, Diacylglycerol lipase, Adenosinediphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2,000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. The “ on-demand release ” model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB trafficking at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids in their membrane regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.",

To investigate whether measurement disturbance is a viable explanation for these counterintuitive phenomena, we employ a we employ variable-strength nonlocal measurements. As we decrease the measurement strength, we find the violation of the sum rule decreases, yet the pigeonhole principle remains violated. In the weak limit, the sum rule is restored due to the cancellation between two weak values with equal and opposite imaginary parts.

          "abstract": "Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, pose significant public health threats globally. Extensive efforts have led to the development of promising highly active compounds against DENV targeting viral non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) protein. However, due to the cocirculation of flaviviruses and to prepare for emerging flaviviruses, there is a need for more broadly acting antivirals. Host-directed therapy where one targets a host factor required for viral replication may be active against multiple viruses that use similar replication strategies. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 library that we designed to target the druggable genome and identified signal peptide peptidase (SPP, encoded by Histocompatibility Minor 13, HM13), as a critical host factor in DENV infection. Genetic knockout or introducing mutations that disrupt the proteolytic activity of SPP markedly reduced the replication of multiple flaviviruses. Although their substrates differ, SPP has structural homology with γ-secretase, which has been pursued as a pharmacological target for Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, SPP-targeting compounds exhibited potent anti-DENV activity at low nanomolar concentrations across multiple primary and disease-relevant cell types, acting specifically through SPP inhibition rather than γ-secretase inhibition. Importantly, SPP inhibitors were active at low nanomolar concentrations against flaviviruses other than DENV including ZIKV while DENV NS4B inhibitors lost activity. This study emphasizes the strong potential of SPP as a pan-flaviviral target and provides a framework for identifying host druggable targets to screen for broad-spectrum antivirals.",

          "abstract": "Inverse design of complex flows is notoriously challenging because of the high cost of high dimensional optimization. Usually, optimization problems are either restricted to few control parameters, or adjoint-based approaches are used to convert the optimization problem into a boundary value problem. Here, we show that the recent advances in automatic differentiation (AD) provide a generic platform for solving inverse problems in complex fluids. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we solve an array of optimization problems related to active matter motion in Newtonian fluids, dispersion in structured porous media, and mixing in journal bearing. Each of these problems highlights the advantages of AD in ease of implementation and computational efficiency to solve high-dimensional optimization problems involving particle-laden flows.",

          "abstract": "The often-distinctive pigment patterns of vertebrates are varied in form and function and depend on several types of pigment cells derived from embryonic neural crest or latent stem cells of neural crest origin. These cells and the patterns they produce have been useful for uncovering features of differentiation and morphogenesis that underlie adult phenotypes, and they offer opportunities to discover how patterns and the cell types themselves have diversified. In zebrafish, a body pattern of stripes arises by self-organizing interactions among three types of pigment cells. Yet these fish also exhibit white ornamentation on their fins that depends on the transdifferentiation of black melanophores to white cells, “melanoleucophores.” To identify mechanisms underlying this conversion we used ultrastructural, transcriptomic, mutational, and other approaches. We show that melanophore–melanoleucophore transition depends on regional BMP signals transduced through noncanonical receptors (Rgmb-Neo1a-Lrig2) as well as BMP-dependent signaling by Agouti genes, asip1 and asip2b . These signals lead to expression of transcription factor genes including foxd3 and runx3 that are necessary to induce loss of melanin, curtail new melanin production, and deploy a pathway for accumulating guanine crystals that, together, confer a white phenotype. These analyses uncover an important role for positional information in specifying ornamentation in zebrafish and show how tissue environmental cues and an altered gene regulatory program have allowed terminal addition of a distinct phenotype to a preexisting cell type.",

CircVP28, which contains an internal ribosome entry site, was further characterized to determine its potential as a template for protein translation. We observed the presence of a truncated, circRNA-encoded VP28 (ceVP28) in infected shrimp. Both ceVP28 and its parental counterpart, VP28, share the same host cell binding partner Rab7, which is a host receptor for WSSV. Coadministration of recombinant ceVP28 protein and WSSV to penaeid shrimps reduced both viral copy numbers and mortality upon WSSV challenges. These findings uncovered a host defense mechanism by which a protein encoded by a viral circRNA modulates virus–receptor interactions, resulting in blocking of viral entry.",

Using mice lacking K ATP channel activity (e.g., Kir6.2 −/− mice), we explored how changes in glucose utilization affect cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activity and sleep/wake homeostasis. In the brain, Kir6.2 −/− mice shunt glucose toward glycolysis, reducing neurotransmitter biosynthesis and dampening cortical EEG activity. Kir6.2 −/− mice spent more time awake at the onset of the light period due to altered ISF lactate dynamics.

          "abstract": "Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are electromotile and implicated in amplification of responses to sound that enhance sound sensitivity and frequency tuning. They send afferent information through glutamatergic synapses onto type II spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). These synapses are weaker than those from cochlear inner hair cells onto type I SGN, suggesting that type II SGNs respond only to intense sound levels. OHCs also receive efferent innervation from medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC neurons are cholinergic yet inhibit OHCs due to the functional coupling of alpha9/alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to calcium-activated SK potassium channels. The resulting hyperpolarization reduces OHC activity-evoked electromotility and is implicated in cochlear gain control, protection against acoustic trauma, and attention. MOC neurons also label for markers of GABA and GABA synthesis. GABA B autoreceptor (GABA B R) activation on MOC terminals has been demonstrated to reduce ACh release, confirming important negative feedback roles. However, the full complement of GABAergic activity in the cochlea is not currently understood, including mechanisms of GABA release from MOC axons, whether GABA diffuses from MOC axons to other postsynaptic cells, and the location and function of GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs). We used optical neurotransmitter detection, immunohistochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that in addition to presynaptic GABA B autoreceptor activation, MOC efferent terminals release GABA onto type II SGN afferent dendrites with postsynaptic activity mediated by GABA A Rs. This synapse may have roles including developmental regulation of cochlear innervation, fine-tuning of OHC activity, or providing feedback to the brain about MOC and OHC activity.",

We employed advanced time-series analysis at the brain region level and machine learning to predict age. While traditional spectral features achieved low to moderate accuracy, over a hundred time-series features proved superior.

At the downstream ends of these pathways, effector oligomerization by DDFs brings the enzyme domains into proximity for their dimerization and activation. Hundreds of structures of these domains have been solved. However, a comprehensive understanding of DDFs is lacking. In this article, we report the curation of a DDF structural atlas as a public website (deathdomain.org) and deduce the common and distinct principles of DDF-mediated oligomerization among the four families (death domain or DD, death effector domain or DED, caspase recruitment domain or CARD, and pyrin domain or PYD).

KAI2 is believed to recognize an endogenous butenolide (KAI2 ligand; KL), but the identity of this compound remains unknown. Recent studies have suggested that ligand hydrolysis by KAI2 is a prerequisite for receptor activation to induce interaction with the target proteins, similar to the situation with D14. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we designed KAI2 ligands (carba-dMGers) whose butenolide rings were modified so that they cannot be hydrolyzed or dissociated from the original ligand molecule by KAI2, by structurally modifying dMGer, a potent and selective KAI2 agonist. Using these dMGer analogs, we found that the strongly bioactive ligand, (+)-dMGer, was hydrolyzed by KAI2 at a lower enzymatic rate compared with the weakly bioactive ligand, (+)-1′-carba-dMGer, and the hydrolyzed butenolide ring of (+)-dMGer was transiently trapped in the catalytic pocket of KAI2. Additionally, structural analysis revealed that (+)-6′-carba-dMGer bound to the catalytic pocket of KAI2 in the unhydrolyzed state. However, this binding did not induce the interaction between KAI2 and SMAX1, indicating that ligand binding to the receptor alone was not sufficient for KAI2 signaling. This study showed experimental data from a ligand structure–activity study that ligand hydrolysis and subsequent covalent adduct formation with the catalytic triad plays a key role in KAI2 activation, providing insight into the chemical structure of the Arabidopsis KL.",

The diversification of quinones, from low redox potential (LPQ) in anaerobes to HPQs in aerobes, is assumed to have followed Earth’s surface oxygenation ~2.3 billion years ago. However, the evolutionary origins of HPQs remain unresolved. Here, we characterize the structure and biosynthetic pathway of an ancestral HPQ, methyl-plastoquinone (mPQ), that is unique to bacteria of the phylum Nitrospirota . mPQ is structurally related to the two previously known HPQs, plastoquinone from Cyanobacteriota /chloroplasts and ubiquinone from Pseudomonadota /mitochondria, respectively. We demonstrate a common origin of the three HPQ biosynthetic pathways that predates the emergence of Nitrospirota , Cyanobacteriota , and Pseudomonadota . An ancestral HPQ biosynthetic pathway evolved ≥ 3.4 billion years ago in an extinct lineage and was laterally transferred to these three phyla ~2.5 to 3.2 billion years ago. We show that Cyanobacteriota and Pseudomonadota were ancestrally aerobic and thus propose that aerobic metabolism using HPQs significantly predates Earth’s surface oxygenation. Two of the three HPQ pathways were later obtained by eukaryotes through endosymbiosis forming chloroplasts and mitochondria, enabling their rise to dominance in modern oxic ecosystems.",

The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity cosimulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.",

Our understanding of Enterobacter virulence is limited, hindering the development of new prophylactics and therapeutics targeting infections caused by Enterobacter species. In this study, we assessed the virulence of contemporary clinical Enterobacter hormaechei isolates in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection and used comparative genomics to identify genes promoting virulence. Through mutagenesis and complementation studies, we found two porin-encoding genes, ompC and ompD , to be required for E. hormaechei virulence. These porins imported clinically relevant carbapenems into the bacteria, and thus loss of OmpC and OmpD desensitized E. hormaechei to the antibiotics. Our genomic analyses suggest porin-related genes are frequently mutated in E. hormaechei , perhaps due to the selective pressure of antibiotic therapy during infection. Despite the importance of OmpC and OmpD during infection of immunocompetent hosts, we found the two porins to be dispensable for virulence in a neutropenic mouse model. Moreover, porin loss provided a fitness advantage during carbapenem treatment in an ex vivo human whole blood model of bacteremia. Our data provide experimental evidence of pathogenic Enterobacter species gaining antibiotic resistance via loss of porins and argue antibiotic therapy during infection of immunocompromised patients is a conducive environment for the selection of porin mutations enhancing the multidrug-resistant profile of these pathogens.",

OPN3 was first identified in the brain (and named encephalopsin) and subsequently found to be expressed in other tissues. In adipocytes, OPN3 is necessary for light responses that modulate lipolysis and glucose uptake, while OPN3 in human skin melanocytes regulates pigmentation in a light-independent manner. Despite its initial discovery in the brain, OPN3 functional mechanisms in the brain remain elusive. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of OPN3 function in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. We show that Opn3 is coexpressed with the melanocortin 4 receptor ( Mc4r ) in a population of PVN neurons, where it negatively regulates MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling in a specific and Gα i/o -dependent manner. Under baseline conditions, OPN3 via Gα i/o potentiates the activity of the inward rectifying Kir7.1 channel, previously shown to be closed in response to agonist-mediated activation of MC4R in a Gα s -independent manner. In mice, we found that Opn3 in Mc4r -expressing neurons regulates food consumption. Our results reveal the first mechanistic insight into OPN3 function in the hypothalamus, uncovering a unique mechanism by which OPN3 functions to potentiate Kir7.1 activity and negatively regulate MC4R-mediated cAMP signaling, thereby promoting food intake.",

Elevated expression of CCND1 is linked to enhanced invasiveness, poorer prognosis, and resistance to drug therapies in ER-positive breast cancer. In this study, we identify a highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) derived from FOXK2 , called circFOXK2, which plays a key role in stabilizing CCND1 mRNA, thereby promoting cell cycle progression, cell growth, and endocrine therapy resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, circFOXK2 binds directly to CCND1 mRNA via RNA–RNA pairing and recruits the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1/HuR, stabilizing the CCND1 mRNA and enhancing CCND1 protein levels. This results in activation of the CCND1–CDK4/6–p-RB–E2F signaling axis, driving the transcription of downstream E2F target genes and facilitating the G1/S transition during cell cycle progression. Notably, targeting circFOXK2 with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-circFOXK2) suppresses ER-positive breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, combination therapy with ASO-circFOXK2 and tamoxifen exhibits synergistic effects and restores tamoxifen sensitivity in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Clinically, high circFOXK2 expression is positively correlated with CCND1 levels in both ER-positive breast cancer cell lines and patient tumor tissues. Overall, our findings reveal the critical role of circFOXK2 in stabilizing the oncogene CCND1 and promoting cancer progression, positioning circFOXK2 as a potential therapeutic target for ER-positive breast cancer in clinical settings.",

The stability and activity of VISA are tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications, among which polyubiquitination plays important roles. Various E3 ubiquitin ligases, including atrophin interacting protein 4 (AIP4), mediate polyubiquitination of VISA and result in its degradation. However, how polyubiquitination of VISA is regulated remains unclear. Here, we uncovered a dual function for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis and a well-known therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases, modulating host responses to RNA viruses both extracellularly and intracellularly. Secreted PCSK9 inhibited sendai virus (SeV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, while the intracellular PCSK9 potentiated RLRs-mediated interferons (IFNs) induction by stabilizing VISA on mitochondria. Viral infection induced the translocation of PCSK9 to mitochondria where it competed with AIP4 for VISA, thereby inhibiting its polyubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, overexpression of PCSK9 enhanced VISA-mediated innate immune response against RNA viral infection, whereas its deficiency had the opposite effects and resulted in more robust replication of the virus. Pcsk9 −/− mice produced lower levels of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, rendering the increased sensitivity to VSV and influenza A virus infection. Altogether, our findings uncovered an important and unexpected role of PCSK9 in virus–host interaction and contribute to the understanding of the sophisticated mechanism governing the proper and efficient immune response to viral infection.",

          "abstract": "Developmental transitions require precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression. In plants, such regulation is critical for flower formation, which involves the progressive maturation of stem cell populations within shoot meristems to floral meristems, followed by rapid sequential differentiation into floral organs. Across plant taxa, these transitions are orchestrated by the F-box transcriptional cofactor gene UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS ( UFO ). The conserved and pleiotropic functions of UFO offer a useful framework for investigating how evolutionary processes have shaped the intricate cis- regulation of key developmental genes. By pinpointing a conserved promoter sequence in an accessible chromatin region of the tomato ortholog of UFO , we engineered in vivo a series of cis- regulatory alleles that caused both loss- and gain-of-function floral defects. These mutant phenotypes were linked to disruptions in predicted transcription factor binding sites for known transcriptional activators and repressors. Allelic combinations revealed dosage-dependent interactions between opposing alleles, influencing the penetrance and expressivity of gain-of-function phenotypes. These phenotypic differences support that robustness in tomato flower development requires precise temporal control of UFO expression dosage. Bridging our analysis to Arabidopsis , we found that although homologous sequences to the tomato regulatory region are dispersed within the UFO promoter, they maintain similar control over floral development. However, phenotypes from disrupting these sequences differ due to the differing expression patterns of UFO . Our study underscores the complex cis- regulatory control of dynamic developmental genes and demonstrates that critical short stretches of regulatory sequences that recruit both activating and repressing machinery are conserved to maintain developmental robustness.",

In vitro evolution and whole genome analysis in Plasmodium falciparum with the most potent member, NPDG-F (EC 50 of 550 nM in Dd2; 290 nM in 3D7), shows that parasite resistance to methyldeoxaphomins is strongly associated with mutations in PfActin1 (PF3D7_1246200), a critically essential ATPase needed for all stages of parasite development. Molecular docking study with available PfActin1 crystal structure shows NPDG-F occupies the same allosteric binding pocket as the known actin inhibitor cytochalasin D. The direct PfActin1 target engagement in the allosteric site was supported by cross-resistance studies, isobologram analysis with other PfActin1 inhibitors, and the structure–activity relationships for the methyldeoxaphomin family. When added to in vitro culture, NPDG-F induced morphological abnormalities in merozoite cellularization during schizogony in both the Plasmodium blood and liver stages.

          "abstract": "The ability of parasitic plants to withdraw nutrients from their hosts depends on the formation of an infective structure known as the haustorium. How parasites regulate their haustoria numbers is poorly understood, and here, we uncovered that existing haustoria in the facultative parasitic plants Phtheirospermum japonicum and Parentucellia viscosa suppressed the formation of new haustoria located on distant roots. Using Phtheirospermum, we found that this effect depended on the formation of mature haustoria and could be induced through the application of external nutrients. To understand the molecular basis of this root plasticity, we analyzed hormone response and found that existing infections upregulated cytokinin-responsive genes first at the haustoria and then more distantly in Phtheirospermum shoots. We observed that infections increased endogenous cytokinin levels in Phtheirospermum roots and shoots, and this increase appeared relevant since local treatments with exogenous cytokinins blocked the formation of both locally and distantly formed haustoria. In addition, local overexpression of a cytokinin-degrading enzyme in Phtheirospermum prevented this systemic interhaustoria repression and increased haustoria numbers locally. We propose that a long-distance signal produced by haustoria negatively regulates future haustoria, and in Phtheirospermum , such a signaling system is mediated by a local increase in cytokinin to regulate haustoria numbers and balance nutrient acquisition.",

We show that this analysis allows determination of the structure of both mycobacterial ATP synthase and the supercomplex of respiratory complexes III and IV in their native membrane. The latter structure reveals that the enzyme malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo) physically associates with the respiratory supercomplex, an interaction that is lost on extraction of the proteins from the lipid bilayer. Mqo catalyzes an essential reaction in the Krebs cycle, and in vivo survival of mycobacterial pathogens is compromised when its activity is absent. We show with high-speed spectroscopy that the Mqo:supercomplex interaction enables rapid electron transfer from malate to the supercomplex. Further, the respiratory supercomplex is necessary for malate-driven, but not NADH-driven, electron transport chain activity and oxygen consumption. Together, these findings indicate a connection between the Krebs cycle and aerobic respiration that directs electrons along a single branch of the mycobacterial electron transport chain.",

          "abstract": "Generation of membrane curvature is fundamental to cellular function. Recent studies have established that the glycocalyx, a sugar-rich polymer layer at the cell surface, can generate membrane curvature. While there have been some theoretical efforts to understand the interplay between the glycocalyx and membrane bending, there remain open questions about how the properties of the glycocalyx affect membrane bending. For example, the relationship between membrane curvature and the density of glycosylated proteins on its surface remains unclear. In this work, we use polymer brush theory to develop a detailed biophysical model of the energetic interactions of the glycocalyx with the membrane. Using this model, we identify the conditions under which the glycocalyx can both generate and sense curvature. Our model predicts that the extent of membrane curvature generated depends on the grafting density of the glycocalyx and the backbone length of the polymers constituting the glycocalyx. Furthermore, when coupled with the intrinsic membrane properties such as spontaneous curvature and a line tension along the membrane, the curvature generation properties of the glycocalyx are enhanced. These predictions were tested experimentally by examining the propensity of glycosylated transmembrane proteins to drive the assembly of highly curved filopodial protrusions at the plasma membrane of adherent mammalian cells. Our model also predicts that the glycocalyx has curvature-sensing capabilities, in agreement with the results of our experiments. Thus, our study develops a quantitative framework for mapping the properties of the glycocalyx to the curvature generation capability of the membrane.",

          "abstract": "Natural selection often acts on multiple traits simultaneously. For example, the virus HIV-1 faces pressure to evade host immunity while also preserving replicative fitness. While past work has studied selection during HIV-1 evolution, as in other examples where selection acts on multiple traits, it is challenging to quantitatively separate different contributions to fitness. This task is made more difficult because a single mutation can affect both immune escape and replication. Here, we develop an evolutionary model that disentangles the effects of escaping CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity, which we model as a binary trait, from other contributions to fitness. After validation in simulations, we applied this model to study within-host HIV-1 evolution in a clinical dataset. We observed strong selection for immune escape, sometimes greatly exceeding past estimates, especially early in infection. Conservative estimates suggest that roughly half of HIV-1 fitness gains during the first months to years of infection can be attributed to T cell escape. Our approach is not limited to HIV-1 or viruses and could be adapted to study the evolution of quantitative traits in other contexts.",

Impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane was the most common cause of LOF across all channel domains, often but not always coinciding with protein instability. However, many LOF variants, particularly in transmembrane domains, trafficked normally, but when coexpressed with KCNE1 exhibited impaired conductance, altered voltage dependence, or abnormal gating kinetics, highlighting diverse pathogenic mechanisms.

Herein, we report a strategy, coined self-assembled proteomimetic (SAP), to mimic such three-helix bundle architecture with a hybridization-enforced two-helix coiled coil that is obtained by templated native chemical ligation (T-NCL) of PNA–peptide conjugates. This SAP strategy stands out by its synthetic accessibility, reducing the length on the longest synthetic peptide to less than 30 amino acids which is readily attainable by standard SPPS methodologies. We show that the T-NCL dramatically accelerates the ligation, enabling this chemistry to proceed in a combinatorial fashion at low micromolar concentrations. We demonstrate that small combinatorial libraries of SAPs can be prepared in one operation and used directly in affinity selections against a target of interest with an LC–MS analysis of the fittest binders. Moreover, we show that the underlying design paradigm is functional for SAPs based on structurally distinct three-helix peptides aimed at different therapeutic targets, namely HER2 and spike’s RBD, reaching picomolar affinities. We further illustrate that the affinity of the SAP can be allosterically regulated using a toehold displacement of the hybridizing PNAs to disrupt the coiled coil stabilization. Finally, we show that an RBD-targeting SAP effectively inhibits viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with an IC 50 of 2.8 nM.",

The scaling behavior of superfluid weight with the band gap is studied in detail, and the effect on the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition temperature is explored.

How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning organism that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state, a process known as fixation. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.",

The gelation dynamics and adhesive properties can be systematically tuned by varying the hydrogel composition, polymer architecture, and thiol availability, with gelation timescales adjustable from seconds to hours, and values of elastic modulus, failure stress, and debonding work spanning orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the functionality of these gels in two applications: as tissue adhesives, using porcine skin as a proxy for human skin, and as bioactive surface coatings to prevent bacterial colonization.

          "abstract": "Arp2/3 complex generates branched actin networks essential for numerous motile functions of the cell. It comprises seven subunits: actin-related proteins (Arps) 2 and 3 and five scaffolding subunits (ArpC1-5). The complex adopts two major conformations: inactive, with the Arps interacting end-to-end, and active, with the Arps aligned side-by-side like subunits in the actin filament. Activation involves several cofactors, including ATP, WASP-family nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), actin monomers, and the mother actin filament. NPFs bind to two sites, one on Arp2–ArpC1 and one on Arp3, delivering actin subunits at the barbed end of the Arps to initiate branch elongation. However, the mechanisms by which each NPF drives the equilibrium toward activation remain unclear. We present two cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Arp2/3 complex at 2.9-Å resolution: one with NPFs bound to Arp3 and ArpC1 but not Arp2 and another with NPFs bound to Arp3 and Arp2–ArpC1. The structures reveal that NPF binding to Arp2 is allosterically linked to the release of ArpC5’s N-terminal tail from Arp2 and conformational changes in Arp2, including closure of its ATP-binding cleft and partial rotation and translation toward its position in the active complex at the branch. Previous work identified another allosteric switch linking NPF binding to Arp3 with the release of its inhibitory C-terminal tail, which we also observe. In summary, both NPF-binding sites induce allosteric changes in Arp2/3 complex, collectively shifting the equilibrium toward activation.",

          "abstract": "Modern ecosystems display complex associations of plants–insects that underwent a long evolutionary process since the appearance of mid-Paleozoic vascular plants. Although several major hypotheses explain the evolution of these plant–insect associations, the initial pattern of modern insect herbivory is poorly understood. To understand the antiquity of modern patterns of terrestrial arthropod herbivory, functional feeding group–damage type (FFG-DT) data were used to analyze a 305 My interval from Late Pennsylvanian to present, in which 134 plant assemblages were used to assess turnover (replacement of some species by other species between sites) and nestedness (difference in composition when no species are replaced between sites) in pairwise comparisons of DTs. Results of beta diversity analyses indicate that the prototype pattern for modern insect herbivory was established on gymnosperm-dominated plant assemblages by late Middle Jurassic, antedating angiosperm dominance by 60 My. Turnover among plant groups and FFGs declined in earlier late Paleozoic, whereas during the later Cenozoic, nestedness generally increased. Insect feeding on gymnosperms showed one pattern of change with low turnover and high nestedness, whereas a bimodal pattern characterized angiosperms. Ferns and angiosperms exhibited less DT functional breadth (host-plant “specificity” by herbivores) than gymnosperms, reflecting major differences in links between insect herbivores and their host plants. This fundamental trophic shift is consistent with the Mid-Mesozoic Parasitoid Revolution, implying top–down control of herbivores by their consumers rather than bottom–up regulation of food sources that shaped the modern herbivory pattern. These findings provide a data-rich account of the ecological origins of modern herbivory.",

Here, we investigated in adolescents the independent roles of the endogenous circadian system and of the behavioral sleep/wake cycle (sleep/wake, fasting/eating, rest/activity, dark/dim light, social interaction, posture, etc.) on self-selected caloric intake using a Forced Desynchrony protocol. Fifty-one male and female adolescents across three weight status categories (24 with healthy weight, 13 with overweight, and 14 with obesity) completed the protocol where participants lived on seven 28-h sleep/wake cycles in dim light during wake and complete darkness during sleep. Results suggest that the circadian system and the behavioral cycle each affected caloric intake, with a decrease across the wake episode and an increase from circadian morning to circadian evening in caloric intake. The endogenous circadian rhythm in caloric intake showed a circadian peak-to-trough difference of 196 [CI 95% 164, 226] kcal per meal with peak timing of 296° [288°, 304°; equivalent to ~17:30 in these participants]. In those with overweight/obesity, more calories were consumed later in the waking episode and later in the circadian cycle, and with blunted amplitudes compared to those with healthy weight. Results implicate both the endogenous circadian system and the behavioral cycle in shaping the daily rhythm of food intake. Furthermore, these results help explain the increased drive for caloric intake toward the evening, especially in those at risk for obesity.",

          "abstract": "Spacecraft using combustion engines require substantial amounts of oxygen for their propellant. The Moon could be a source of oxygen for rocket propellant, since the material composing the lunar surface can be processed to extract oxygen. However, little is known about overall energy requirements of the processes described in the literature for oxygen extraction from lunar regolith. This knowledge gap constrains the planning of lunar missions, since the scale of energy infrastructure required for oxygen production facilities is not well characterized. This study presents an energy consumption model for oxygen production via hydrogen reduction of the mineral ilmenite (FeTiO 3 ). We consider an end-to-end production chain starting from dry regolith as the feedstock. The production includes the following process steps: excavation, transportation, beneficiation, hydrogen reduction, water electrolysis, liquefaction, and zero boil-off storage. The model predicts the energy demand per kilogram oxygen produced based on adjustable parameters for each process step. As expected, the model indicates a strong dependence on feedstock composition. For regolith composed of 10 wt% ilmenite, the model predicts that a total of 24.3 (± 5.8) kWh is needed per kg of liquid oxygen produced. This study confirms that the hydrogen reduction and electrolysis steps have the highest energy requirements in the production chain. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the enrichment factor of the beneficiation process is the most critical parameter for optimizing energy utilization. Overall, this study provides a parameterized end-to-end model of energy consumption that can serve as a foundation for various production systems on the Moon.",

          "abstract": "Viral proteins frequently mutate to evade host innate immune responses, yet the impact of these mutations on the molecular energy landscape remains unclear. Epistasis, the intramolecular communications between mutations, often renders the combined mutational effects unpredictable. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a major virulence factor of the influenza A virus (IAV) that activates host PI3K by binding to its p85β subunit. Here, we present a deep analysis of the impact of evolutionary mutations in NS1 that emerged between the 1918 pandemic IAV strain and its descendant PR8 strain. Our analysis reveals how the mutations rewired interresidue communications, which underlie long-range allosteric and epistatic networks in NS1. Our findings show that PR8 NS1 binds to p85β with approximately 10-fold greater affinity than 1918 NS1 due to allosteric mutational effects, which are further tuned by epistasis. NMR chemical shift perturbation and methyl-axis order parameter analyses revealed that the mutations induced long-range structural and dynamic changes in PR8 NS1, relative to 1918 NS1, enhancing its affinity to p85β. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations and graph theory-based network analysis for conformational dynamics on the submicrosecond timescales uncover how these mutations rewire the dynamic network, which underlies the allosteric epistasis. Significantly, we find that conformational dynamics of residues with high betweenness centrality play a crucial role in communications between network communities and are highly conserved across influenza A virus evolution. These findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the allosteric and epistatic communications between distant residues and provide insight into their role in the molecular evolution of NS1.",

          "abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are sets of often heterologous genes that are genetically and functionally linked. Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi and ensure the coexpression of the different enzymes coordinating the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Here, we report the identification of a withanolide BGC in Physalis grisea (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family ( Solanaceae ). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolic analyses revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed subclusters, containing several pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this subfunctionalization is tightly associated with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two subclusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the structural chromatin level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomics, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the Solanaceae family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific subfunctionalization is common to species of the Physalideae tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on an instance of an epigenetically modulated subfunctionalization within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids important in plant defense and amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, and anticancer properties.",

          "abstract": "Dark-field microscopy is a technique used in optical microscopy to increase the contrast in unstained samples, making it possible to observe details that would otherwise be difficult to see under bright-field microscopy; thus, it has been widely employed in biological research, material science, and medical diagnostics. However, most dark-field microscopy methods cannot overcome the optical diffraction limit and require a bulky dark-field condenser and precise alignment of each optical element. In this study, we introduce a planar photonic device that can produce random speckles for dark-field illumination and improve the optical resolution. This planar device is made of random distribution fibers for injection of a laser beam, a scattering layer to produce random speckles, a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) to produce a hollow cone of light, and a metallic film to increase the energy efficiency. This planar device can work as a substrate for conventional microscopy. Taking advantage of the hollow cone of light with random speckles generated by the proposed planar device, we achieve a high-contrast, label-free image with a 1.55-fold improvement in spatial resolution. Furthermore, random evanescent speckles can be generated on the 1DPC just through tuning the incident wavelength, which demonstrates the ability for optical surface imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The advantage of this technique is that it does not require complex optical system or precise knowledge of the illumination pattern. This study will expand the potential applications of dark-field microscopy and provide insights into samples that might otherwise be invisible under traditional dark-field microscopy.",

As they have advanced, it has become difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found some differences in features such as word choice and punctuation and developed classifiers to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs. Using several variants of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber’s set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This observation of differences demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human stylistic variation. Attention to more advanced linguistic features can hence detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.",

          "abstract": "In aqueous ammonium-ion storage, hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in the reversible insertion/extraction of NH 4 + within transition metal oxides/hydroxides. Although fluorine (F) is known for its strong electronegativity and potential to form robust hydrogen bonds with NH 4 + , its specific influence on NH 4 + storage remains unexplored. Herein, we systematically investigate the effects of F-based hydrogen bond chemistry within a layered double hydroxide matrix, where F species are introduced and subsequently partially removed via an electrochemical method. Our findings demonstrate that while increasing F doping content accelerates NH 4 + diffusion due to F’s strong electronegativity, it also triggers crystal shrinkage and depresses storage capacity. To this end, controlled partial removal of F, employing a lye-assistant electrochemical strategy, induces expanded interlayer spacing and distinct edge lattice tearing, thereby facilitating improved NH 4 + accommodation. The retained F sites couple with emerging exposed O sites maintain a high hydrogen bonding capability, which is further enhanced by the formation of highly active, curved hydroxyl groups centered around F sites. These manipulations significantly boost the NH 4 + storage performance of the electrode, providing insights into leveraging the strongest F-based hydrogen bond chemistry in developing high-performance ammonium-ion energy storage devices.",

The chemical potential measurement provides a local probe of the thermodynamic gap of quantum Hall ferromagnets and fractional quantum Hall states.

          "abstract": "The collective influence of animals on the processes shaping the Earth’s surface remains largely unknown, with most studies limited to individual species and well-known exemplars. To establish the global geomorphic significance of animals, we systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence across freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Over 600 animal taxa had reported geomorphic effects. For the 495 wild animals and 5 livestock identified to species level, we estimated their global abundance, and collective biomass and energy. While our census is global in scope, a lack of research in the tropics and subtropics, and on less visible animals, leaves them underrepresented in analyses. Most reported species are globally widespread, but some are rare, endemic, and/or threatened, leading to risks that key geomorphic processes cease before we fully understand them. We estimate the collective biomass in wild animal geomorphic agents at ≈0.2 Mt Carbon, equating to a biological energy content of ≈7.6 million GJ. If a conservative minimum 1% of this energy contributes to geomorphic work annually, this yields an energy contribution from wild animal geomorphic agents of ≈76,000 GJ—equivalent to the energy of hundreds of thousands of extreme floods. Uncertainties in biomass estimates and energy partitioning mean this value could credibly be an order of magnitude higher, and countless species remain unreported or undiscovered. The livestock estimates exceed the wild animals estimates by three orders of magnitude. The geomorphic energy of animals is far more influential than previously recognized and future losses, dispersal and introductions of zoogeomorphic species may induce substantive landscape changes.",

We use theory and simulations to show how tuning interreceptor attraction can enhance or suppress the binding of multivalent ligand-coated particles to surfaces. The changes in the interreceptor attraction less than the thermal energy k B T can selectively switch the receptor-clustering and activation on or off in an almost step-wise fashion, which we explain by near-critical receptor density fluctuations. We also show that the same mechanism can efficiently regulate the onset of endocytosis for, e.g. , drug delivery vehicles.",

          "abstract": "Modern machine learning has achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifices interpretability, a critical consideration in high-stakes domains such as medicine. In such settings, practitioners often use highly interpretable decision tree models, but these suffer from inductive bias against additive structure. To overcome this bias, we propose Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS), which generalizes the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in summation. By combining logical rules with addition, FIGS adapts to additive structure while remaining highly interpretable. Experiments on real-world datasets show FIGS achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of FIGS in high-stakes domains, we adapt FIGS to learn clinical decision instruments (CDIs), which are tools for guiding decision-making. Specifically, we introduce a variant of FIGS known as Group Probability-Weighted Tree Sums (G-FIGS) that accounts for heterogeneity in medical data. G-FIGS derives CDIs that reflect domain knowledge and enjoy improved specificity (by up to 20% over CART) without sacrificing sensitivity or interpretability. Theoretically, we prove that FIGS learns components of additive models, a property we refer to as disentanglement. Further, we show (under oracle conditions) that tree-sum models leverage disentanglement to generalize more efficiently than single tree models when fitted to additive regression functions. Finally, to avoid overfitting with an unconstrained number of splits, we develop Bagging-FIGS, an ensemble version of FIGS that borrows the variance reduction techniques of random forests. Bagging-FIGS performs competitively with random forests and XGBoost on real-world datasets.",

Parvoviruses are simple molecular structures that display 60 repeated motifs on their capsid surface, and rapidly induce strong antibody responses that protect animals from infection. We recently showed that following canine parvovirus infection of its natural host, the polyclonal response in the sera contained only two or three dominant antibodies that bound two epitopes on the capsid. Here, we characterize key antibodies present in that immune response, identifying their sequences, defining their binding properties on the capsid by cryoelectron microscopic (cryoEM) analysis, and testing their effects on viral infectivity. Two antibodies sharing the same heavy chain bound to the side of the capsid threefold spike (B-site), while another distinct antibody bound close to the threefold axis (A-site). The epitopes of these antibodies overlapped the binding site of the host receptor, the transferrin receptor type-1, but to varying degrees. The antibodies varied widely in their neutralization efficiencies as either immunoglobulins (IgGs) or monomeric antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), which was consistent with their ability to compete for the receptor. The monoclonal antibodies characterized here matched the structures from the cryoEM analysis of polyclonal sera, including those present in a different dog than the monoclonal source. This shows that after infection, a focused response to the viral antigen is produced that protects against infection.",

Traditional approaches primarily focus on microscopic strategies such as bandgap engineering, chemical potential adjustments, and entropy engineering.

Additionally, the efficiencies achieved remain modest, constrained by the interdependent nature of electrical and thermal conductivities, which typically vary concurrently. Inspired by the thermoregulation mechanisms in biological organisms, we propose here a macroscopic strategy based on an expanded-plane (EP) meta-structure. Such a meta-structure, of the thermal gradient regulator type, exploits the temperature gradient concentrating effect to significantly boost TCE. We prove, both numerically and experimentally, how the proposed device can achieve temperature gradient concentration under diverse conditions. Remarkably, under undistorted temperature background conditions, we measured an striking efficiency enhancement of 59.0 % .

          "abstract": "Poststroke inflammation critically influences functional outcomes following ischemic stroke. Arginase-1 (Arg1) is considered a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages, associated with the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair in various pathological conditions. However, its specific role in poststroke recovery remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the functional impact of Arg1 expressed in macrophages on poststroke recovery and inflammatory milieu. We observed a time-dependent increase in Arg1 expression, peaking at 7 d after photothrombotic stroke in mice. Cellular mapping analysis revealed that Arg1 was predominantly expressed in LysM-positive infiltrating macrophages. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we examined the role of Arg1 expressed in infiltrating macrophages. Contrary to its presumed beneficial effects, Arg1 cKO in LysM-positive macrophages significantly improved skilled forelimb motor function recovery after stroke. Mechanistically, Arg1 cKO attenuated fibrotic scar formation, enhanced peri-infarct remyelination, and increased synaptic density while reducing microglial synaptic elimination in the peri-infarct cortex. Gene expression analysis of fluorescence-activated single cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD45 low microglia revealed decreased transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and proinflammatory cytokine activity in peri-infarct microglia from Arg1 cKO animals. In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that Arg1 activity in macrophages modulates microglial synaptic phagocytosis, providing evidence for macrophage–microglia interaction. These findings present unique insights into the function of Arg1 in central nervous system injury and highlight an interaction between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia in shaping the poststroke inflammatory milieu. Our study identifies Arg1 in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for modulating poststroke inflammation and improving functional recovery.",

However, there is another, often overlooked side to science communication—how scientists respond when questions arise about the integrity of their research. Often, the tendency has been to stay silent and wait for any controversy to pass or be resolved in professional forums. But in an age of growing, intense attacks on science, silence can be detrimental to both public trust and the careers of scientists who are under scrutiny. For better or worse, journalists, social media professionals, and the public may take a response of “no comment” as a concession that the critics are correct, so forthright communication about research questions is more urgent than ever.",

We used birthdating analysis, single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling to compare the development and evolution of known pallial circuits across birds (chick), lizards (gecko), and mammals (mouse). We reveal that neurons within these circuits’ stations are generated at varying developmental times and brain regions across species and found an early developmental divergence in the transcriptomic progression of glutamatergic neurons. Our research highlights developmental distinctions and functional similarities in the sensory circuit between birds and mammals, suggesting the convergence of high-order sensory processing across amniote lineages.",

However, direct measurements of stream network variability have been limited to a handful of small drainage basins. We estimated the variability of stream network length for 14,765 gauged basins across the contiguous United States using measured streamflow distributions and topography-based estimates of how sensitive each stream network is to changing landscape wetness (the network’s elasticity). We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. Stream networks are more dynamic in some regions than in others, driven by regional differences in both hydroclimatology and the networks’ elasticity in response to hydroclimatic forcing.",

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry.

On a decadal scale, we find substantial depletion in aquifers below 50-meter depth, with only limited storm-related recovery. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor deep aquifers for a more complete assessment of total water deficits, using high-resolution tools such as seismic sensing.",

We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment. Worsening oceanographic conditions could shift predator population trajectories from current growth to sharp declines. As ocean integrators, wide-ranging predators could reveal impacts of future anthropogenic change on open ocean ecosystems.",

Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.",

We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes in meningiomas and diverse breast cancers is consistent with histone production being rate-limiting for S-phase progression and histone gene hypertranscription driving overproliferation and aneuploidy in cancer, with general implications for precision oncology.",

The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance.

Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.",

Neurons in the avian mesopallium display gene expression profiles akin to the mammalian claustrum and deep cortical layers, while certain nidopallial cell types resemble neurons in the piriform cortex. Lastly, we observed substantial gene expression convergence between the dorsally located hyperpallium and ventrally located nidopallium during late development, suggesting that topological location does not always dictate gene expression programs determining functional properties in the adult avian pallium.",

Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation.

HARMONI operates at subsecond resolution, estimating 3D mesh representations and spatial interactions of humans, and adapts to challenging natural environments using an environment-targeted synthetic data generation module. Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

Here, we demonstrate that a coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) pulses can find solutions to large-scale maximum independent set problems, which is an essential optimization problem that is closely related to real-world optimization tasks. We implemented a stable external field for each Ising spin as an interaction between a DOPO pulse and a group of ferromagnetically coupled auxiliary pulses. Consequently, the CIM delivered independent sets for dense graphs with up to 40,000 nodes. We compared the performance of the CIM with that of optimized simulated annealing algorithm implemented on a digital computer and found that the CIM outperformed the central processing unit (CPU) in terms of the time needed to obtain good approximate solutions when the graph size exceeded several thousand nodes.",

          "abstract": "Marine photoautotrophs have evolved to exploit the ocean’s variable light conditions, with chromatic acclimators being able to adjust their pigment content to better match the ambient light color. The impact of chromatic acclimation on phytoplankton distribution and competition is not well understood despite its global importance. This study explores chromatic acclimation’s role in shaping the biogeography of Synechococcus , a widespread cyanobacterium. We integrated three pigment types into a global ecosystem model: a green-light specialist, a blue-light specialist, and a chromatic acclimator. Laboratory studies defined each type’s specific absorption properties. Our results indicate that chromatic acclimation offers an evolutionary advantage by enabling Synechococcus to adapt to varying light environments. This ability to mimic blue- and green-light specialists and enhance absorption at intermediate states, particularly in areas with high seasonal light variations, increases Synechococcus distribution and biomass. Thus, chromatic acclimation affects ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical processes in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Most wounds form scars without hair follicles. However, in the wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) model of skin regeneration, wounds regenerate hair follicles if tissue rigidity is optimal. Although WIHN depends on Wnt signaling, whether Wnt performs a mechanoregulatory role that contributes to regeneration remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis. Collectively, our findings unveil Wnt signaling’s mechanoregulatory role that manipulates the machinery of mechanotransduction to drive regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Internal tides profoundly influence diapycnal mixing and marine ecosystems in oceans worldwide. Previous estimates on internal tides focused regionally spanning a decade, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their long-term global behavior, especially over centuries. Because of limited long-term observations, a critical question arises: How will global warming affect internal tides? Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role. Our findings suggest that internal tides propagate faster in a warming climate, potentially influencing energy cascade and marine biological productivity.",

We demonstrated efficient LEDs with controllably tailored emission from n = 3, 4, 5, and ≥7 ALN perovskite NPs with specific and discrete major peaks at 607, 638, 669, and 728 nanometers. These LEDs demonstrated peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.8% and high wavelength reproducibility with less than 1 to 2 nm difference between batches. High color stability without observable EL spectral change and operating stability with the best T 50 of 267 minutes at 1.0 milliampere per square centimeter was also achieved.

Recently, this concept has been realized in classical photonic and acoustic systems. However, these implementations are constrained by adiabatic conditions, necessitating long operation distances and hindering practical applications. Here, we conceive and demonstrate shortcut to adiabatic (STA) braiding of light in three-dimensional silicon photonic chips. Our device comprises trilayer silicon waveguides embedded in the SU-8 polymer, using an STA strategy to expedite the braiding operations, resulting in compact devices that function as photonic quantum X, Y, and Z gates. We further experimentally observed non-Abelian braiding behaviors based on this STA-braiding scheme. Our work represents a compact braiding apparatus with a size reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude compared to previous works. This work presents a feasible approach to accelerating adiabatic braiding evolutions, paving the way for compact, CMOS-compatible non-Abelian photonic devices.",

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) contributes to back pain and disability.

An association of pathological tissue remodeling with a biglycan fragment 344 YWEVQPATFR, termed Bgm1, has been reported, however its role is yet to be defined. Using a custom antibody, we detected Bgm1 in human and mouse nucleus pulposus, with prominent intracellular expression in notochordal cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that Bgm1 interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a key player in ribosome biogenesis. Bgm1 dysregulates eIF6 localization in notochordal cells, affecting nucleocytoplasmic transport. Induced IDD in mice showed elevated nuclear eIF6 expression and reduced Bgm1 in degenerating nucleus pulposus. Transcriptome analysis suggests that Bgm1 regulates fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis in a transforming growth factor–β–dependent manner, highlighting its potential role in metabolic control in spinal joint homeostasis.",

We leverage this insight to propose a precise definition of a gene regulatory relationship and implement a new tool, CIMLA (Counterfactual Inference by Machine Learning and Attribution Models), to identify differences in gene regulatory networks between biological conditions, a problem that has received great attention in recent years. Using extensive benchmarking on simulated data, we show that CIMLA is more robust to confounding variables and is more accurate than leading methods.

In this study, we developed a chimeric repairing patch (CRP) featuring a double-disc structure, designed to seal TF defects and promote organized tissue regeneration. The CRP incorporates a double–cross-linking silk fibroin network and hierarchical micropores, resulting in a flexible, hydrophilic, and biocompatible patch with tissue-matching mechanical properties. The CRP could effectively seal defects and encourage tissue ingrowth, successfully repairing TF. A tissue-engineered epithelialized CRP (E-CRP) was further developed to enhance in situ reepithelialization. The CRP demonstrated reliable structural stability and facilitated effective tissue regeneration and functional reconstruction of TF defects in a large animal model. Furthermore, the customized CRPs might be preloaded into a bronchoscope and precisely delivered to TF defects via noninvasive implantation. Consequently, the proposed CRP/E-CRP represents a promising scaffold for TF treatment, with substantial transformative potential in clinical practice.",

Aptamers have emerged as promising alternatives over traditional biorecognition elements. However, the underlying aptamer-target binding interactions are often poorly understood. Here, we present a technique that can decode aptamer-protein binding interactions at the single-molecule level. We demonstrate that our single-molecule assay is able to decode the underlying binding kinetics of aptamers despite their similar binding affinity. Guided by computational simulations and validated with quartz crystal microbalance experiments, we show that the quantitative insights generated by this single-molecule technique enabled the rational understanding of biosensor performance (i.e., the sensitivity and limit of detection). This capability was demonstrated with thrombin as the analyte and the structurally similar aptamers HD1, RE31, and NU172 as the biorecognition elements.

The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing. Moreover, apoptotic vesicles, which are generated during the process, are partly phagocytosed by macrophages, mimicking physiological metabolic processes. This study opens new avenues for addressing bone health issues through the designed bioclearance of senescent cells, aligning with the body’s natural pathways for maintaining homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "In the process of DNA replication, the first steps in restoring the chromatin landscape involve parental histone recycling and new histone deposition. Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efficient transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication for maintaining chromatin landscapes, differentiation potential, and cellular viability.",

This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is “exceedingly rare” in the Universe. Here, we critically reevaluate core assumptions of the hard-steps model through the lens of historical geobiology. Specifically, we propose an alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary singularities required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth’s surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps required for human existence, then the timing of human origins was controlled by the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history.",

Here, a biomimetic nanovesicle (ADU-S@M1) is constructed to target tumors and then to produce abundant activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in situ by polarizing the tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype and promoting dendritic cell maturation. These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy.",

A promising mechanism for large-scale natural H 2 generation is serpentinization of exhumed mantle material. We study this serpentinization-related H 2 generation during rifting and subsequent rift-inversion orogen development using numerical geodynamic models. Serpentinization-related H 2 generation is best known from rifted margins and spreading ridges. However, because orogens are colder than rift environments, conditions for serpentinization and natural H 2 generation are considerably better in orogenic settings: We find that yearly H 2 generation capacity from serpentinization in the overriding mantle wedge during rift inversion may be up to 20 times larger than during rifting. Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H 2 accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings. Together with indications of ongoing natural H 2 generation in the Balkans and Pyrenees, our model results provide a first-order motivation for natural H 2 exploration in rift-inversion orogens.",

One well-explored example is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, where experimental development is grounded in decades-old theory, but structural dynamics are not easily integrated into this picture. Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.",

Our case study is Mono Lake in California, which has close to 1 millimolar dissolved P at steady state despite extremely high rates of biological productivity, in contrast to smaller closed basins where life is scarce. Hence, large closed-basin lakes offer an environment where high rates of prebiotic P productivity can plausibly coexist with high steady-state P concentrations.

In-depth functional studies in vitro and in vivo further reveal that specific ncUCEs can be enhancers of tumor suppressors (such as ARID1B) and silencers of oncogenic proteins (such as RPS13). Moreover, several miRNAs located in ncUCEs are recurrently mutated.

The EB disruption is accompanied by the alternations in permeability and even the breakdown of tight junctions (TJs), leading to the leakage of albumin; thus, albumin can serve as a biomarker for EB disruption. Herein, we develop an albumin-specific, covalently tagged near-infrared II (NIR-II) dye, with its high selectivity for endogenous albumin, for targeted imaging EB disruption. Our albumin-tagging dye serves as a chromophore to construct NIR-II fluorescent proteins in situ, with substantially improved brightness. Thus, through in situ dye tagging of endogenous albumin as the efficient “targeting agent,” we can precisely image disruptions in various endothelial barriers. Unlike the traditional exogenous targeting agents (e.g., dye-labeled antibodies) with enzymatic degradation or immune system capture issues, in situ albumin tagging demonstrates superhigh performance for targeted imaging.",

However, current nanosystems inducing cuproptosis rely on exogenous toxic copper ions, limiting the scope of biomaterials. Developing nanoplatforms that induce cuproptosis without exogenous copper holds substantial promise. Here, we engineered a two-dimensional iron (Fe) single-atom–doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) piezocatalyst (Fe-MoS 2 ) for tumor therapy. Incorporating single Fe atoms enhances MoS 2 piezoelectric polarization via charge redistribution and modulates Fe and Mo oxidation states, enabling multifaceted enzymatic activities, including peroxidase-, glutathione oxidase–, oxidase-, and catalase-like activities. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the Fe-MoS 2 nanocatalyst generates reactive oxygen species and depletes glutathione via synergistic piezocatalytic and enzyocatalytic effects, disrupting copper ion homeostasis and inducing cuproptosis, concurrently triggering ferroptosis and ferritinophagy, which collectively enhances tumor suppression. This study represents the first paradigm to introduce a copper-free piezocatalyst for initiating cuproptosis, substantially advancing the applications of cuproptosis in tumor therapy.",

Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast. We propose that ion-sensitive conformational changes in a PLD directly regulate transcription to maintain ionic strength homeostasis in animal cells.",

However, the mechanisms enabling heterotrophic diazotrophs to thrive in cold high-latitude waters and their contribution to the global nitrogen budget are unknown. Using a data-driven cell-based metabolic model, we show that heterotrophic bacteria inside sinking particles can fix N 2 over a wide range of temperatures, explaining their ubiquitous presence in the oceans. We estimate that heterotrophic diazotrophs account for about 10% of global marine N 2 fixation, with the highest contribution in oxygen minimum zones.

Recent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are protective in animal models and humans against several infections, including sepsis and COVID-19; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. Here, we mechanistically link two previously described effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in mediating protection against sepsis. We show that fluoxetine-mediated protection is independent of peripheral serotonin and instead increases levels of circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is necessary for protection from sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia, preventing cardiac effects including impairment of glucose oxidation, ectopic lipid accumulation, ventricular stretch and possibly cardiac failure.

The model can reproduce the broad geologic record of ice cap expansion, allowing us to infer the primary drivers of long-term climate change.

The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",

          "abstract": "The E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin (cadherin-catenin) complex couples the cytoskeletons of neighboring cells at adherens junctions (AJs) to mediate force transmission across epithelia. Mechanical force and auxiliary binding partners converge to stabilize the cadherin-catenin complex’s inherently weak binding to actin filaments (F-actin) through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that afadin’s coiled-coil (CC) domain and vinculin synergistically enhance the cadherin-catenin complex’s F-actin engagement. The cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an E-cadherin–β-catenin–αE-catenin–vinculin–afadin-CC supra-complex bound to F-actin reveals that afadin-CC bridges adjacent αE-catenin actin-binding domains along the filament, stabilizing flexible αE-catenin segments implicated in mechanical regulation. These cooperative binding contacts promote the formation of supra-complex clusters along F-actin. Additionally, cryo-EM variability analysis links supra-complex binding along individual F-actin strands to nanoscale filament curvature, a deformation mode associated with cytoskeletal forces. Collectively, this work elucidates a mechanistic framework by which vinculin and afadin tune cadherin-catenin complex–cytoskeleton coupling to support AJ function across varying mechanical regimes.",

Photoferroelectric semiconductors exhibit immense potential in capturing multimodal nonvolatile states, attributed to their spontaneous and reversible in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations. Herein, we uncover an unprecedented nonvolatile, zero-bias, ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis response with an innovative all-optical approach, discerned by analyzing in-plane and out-of-plane terahertz (THz) waves emitted from photoferroelectric α-In 2 Se 3 . The mechanism underlying such ultrafast photocurrent hysteresis arises from anomalous linear and circular photovoltaic effects synchronously fueled by a localized rearrangement of polarization. By harnessing the anisotropic photoferroelectric kinetics–induced relative phase between the in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations, we further demonstrate the flexible selection of chirality, tunable rotational angle, and optimizable ellipticity of THz waves. Our findings present a unique ultrafast and nondestructive strategy for investigating photoferroelectric hysteresis, empowering dynamic polarization manipulation of THz waves for a wide range of THz applications.",

Improving catalytic reactivity and reducing energy consumption are urgently needed but remain challenging. Here, we report an unexplored associative strategy to realize DME formation at room temperature and the generation of olefins even at 413 kelvin, which is achieved by coinjecting basic acetone to manipulate the local chemical microenvironment of the methanol reactant inside the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation. These findings offer more insights into the rational design of reaction systems by manipulating the local surroundings to regulate catalytic performances and should represent a large step forward in methanol conversion technology.",

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire. Our results highlight the role of convection and fuel in wildfire forecast, prompting a revisit of wildfire prediction under intertwined atmospheric and terrestrial changes.",

Only in situ imaging unveils the inaccessibility when compared to the industry-accepted ex situ characterization methods. Selectively removing some of the functionalization with solvent restores pore access without substantially altering the single-molecule kinetics that underlie the separation and agree with bulk chromatography measurements.

Specifically, we examined how reinstatement and transformation of item-specific representations across occipital, ventral visual, and lateral parietal cortices contribute to successful memory formation and recognition. Our findings suggest that reinstatement in temporal cortex and transformation in parietal cortex coexist and provide complementary strategies for recognition.

However, the mechanisms regulating this conversion remain unclear. In this study, we showed that removal of toxic and bitter SGAs is under the control of DNA demethylation, ethylene, and key transcription factors by forming a feedback loop that governs the expression of key GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM ( GAME ) genes during ripening. Moreover, the ethylene-inducible transcription factors NON-RIPENING, RIPENING INHIBITOR, and FRUITFULL1 coordinately regulate the expression of GAME31 , GAME40 , GAME5 , and the glycoalkaloid transporter gene GORKY , whereas jasmonic acid–induced MYC2 modulates the transcription of GAME36 .

Alteration in microglial numbers has been associated with abnormal behaviors akin to those observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function. Our findings reveal that microglia adapt their numbers to changes in pyramidal cell activity during a critical time window in development, consequently adjusting their numbers and function to the demands of the developing local circuits.",

In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O 2 evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups.

Consequently, the device works under an electric field of 6 × 10 3 volts per meter (three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional LCs), operates in a transmissive mode with ~85% transparency, and displays pure and tunable interference colors. The electro-interference-color device serves as a good example to fabricate diverse see-through chromatic applications as conceptually demonstrated smart windows with functions of privacy protection, energy saving, and artistic presentation as well as transparent display.",

          "abstract": "Implantable medical devices (IMDs) provide effective medical solutions for diverse health care applications. Electrical circuits are crucial for implantable devices due to the requirement of intended functions, such as communication with external devices. Circuits have several risks, such as biocompatibility issues, power limitations, or size constraints. In this work, we propose a passive modulated ultrasound (PMU) principle for IMDs and develop a circuit-free ultrasonic system (CUS) for thoracic pressure monitoring. The PMU principle can passively modulate monitored physiological signals into ultrasound pulses without using electrical circuits or power supply. The size of the developed CUS is only 2.5 millimeters in radius and 850 micrometers in height. Animal experiments demonstrated that the CUS, with a high sensitivity (−22.96 millivolts per kilopascal), can monitor thoracic pressure to assist in diagnosing different heart diseases, including cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction. The PMU provides a human-friendly wireless sensing and communication strategy for IMDs, which promotes advancements in health care applications within the human body.",

          "abstract": "Electroadhesive (EA) clutches are promising for advanced motion and force control in robotics, haptics, and rehabilitation, owing to their compactness and light weight. However, their practical use is limited by the inability to deliver high forces at low voltages, primarily due to a lack of understanding of their mechanics. We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches. This was achieved by incorporating a soft interlayer and peeling stopper for uniform stress distribution and mitigating the failure modes. These EA clutches were integrated into a lightweight ring-based wearable system for finger rehabilitation and haptics. Our findings lay the groundwork for designing low-voltage, high-performance EA clutches for next-generation motion and force control applications.",

          "abstract": "Synapses are endowed with the flexibility to change through experience, but must be sufficiently stable to last a lifetime. This tension is illustrated at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where two motor inputs that differ in structural and functional properties coinnervate most muscles to coordinate locomotion. To stabilize NMJ activity, motor neurons augment neurotransmitter release following diminished postsynaptic glutamate receptor functionality, termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How these distinct inputs contribute to PHP plasticity remains enigmatic. We have used a botulinum neurotoxin to selectively silence each input and resolve their roles in PHP, demonstrating that PHP is input specific: Chronic (genetic) PHP selectively targets the tonic MN-Ib, where active zone remodeling enhances Ca 2+ influx to promote increased glutamate release. In contrast, acute (pharmacological) PHP selectively increases vesicle pools to potentiate phasic MN-Is. Thus, distinct homeostatic modulations in active zone nanoarchitecture, vesicle pools, and Ca 2+ influx collaborate to enable input-specific PHP expression.",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of marine algae in the Neoproterozoic Era is thought to have stimulated the ecology of predatory microbial eukaryotes. To test this proposal, we introduced algal particulate matter (APM) to marine sediments underlying a modern marine oxygen minimum zone with bottom-water oxygen concentrations approximating those of the late Neoproterozoic water column. We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18 S rRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans.",

Most α-helical membrane proteins require protein-conducting insertases known as translocons to assist in their membrane insertion and folding. While the sequence-dependent propensities for a helix to either translocate through the translocon or insert into the membrane have been codified into numerical hydrophobicity scales, the corresponding propensity to partition into the membrane interface remains unrevealed. By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern. Using this system, we determined the sequence-dependent propensities for transfer from the translocon to a TM, interfacial, or extramembrane space and compared these propensities with the corresponding probability distributions determined from the sequences and structures of experimentally determined proteins.",

Here, we designed a combinatorial CAR signaling domain library and performed repeated antigen stimulation assays, pooled screens, and single-cell sequencing to systematically investigate the impact of modifying CAR signaling domains on T cell activation and persistence. Our data reveal the predominant influence of membrane-proximal domains in driving T cell phenotype. Notably, CD40 costimulation was crucial for fostering robust and lasting T cell responses. Furthermore, we correlated in vitro generated CAR T cell phenotypes with clinical outcomes in patients treated with CAR T therapy, establishing the foundation for a clinically informed screening approach. This work deepens our understanding of CAR T cell biology and may guide future CAR engineering efforts.",

          "abstract": "Oocytes naturally present mechanical defects that hinder their development after fertilization. Thus, in the context of assisted reproduction, oocyte selection based on their mechanical properties has great potential to improve the quality of the resulting embryos and the success rate of these procedures. However, using mechanical properties as a quantifiable selective criterion requires robust and nondestructive measurement tools. This study developed a constriction-based microfluidic device that monitors the deformation of mouse oocytes under controlled pressure. The device can distinguish mechanically aberrant oocyte groups from healthy control ones. On the basis of a mathematical model, we propose that deformability measurements infer both oocyte tension and elasticity, elasticity being the most discriminating factor in our geometry. Despite force transmission during oocyte deformation, no long-term damage was observed. This noninvasive characterization of mouse oocyte deformability in microconstrictions allows for a substantial advance in assessing the mechanical properties of mammalian oocytes and has potential application as a quantifiable selective criterion in medically assisted reproduction.",

However, its clinical translation is impeded by poor performance of lysosomal escape and tumor targeting. This challenge is especially prominent in glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, necessitating the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leveraging the intrinsic tumor-targeting and BBB traversing capability of human H-ferritin, we designed a series of ferritin variants with positively charged cavity and truncated carboxyl terminus, termed tHFn(+). These nanocarriers respond to weak acid and disassemble in endosomal compartments, exposing the internal positive charges to facilitate the lysosomal escape of loaded small interfering RNA (siRNA). Functioning as universal siRNA nanocarriers, tHFn(+) significantly enhanced the uptake of different siRNAs and suppressed gene expressions associated with GBM progression. Furthermore, tHFn(+) traversed the BBB and targeted glioma in vivo by binding to its receptors (e.g., transferrin receptor 1). tHFn(+)-delivered siRNAs exhibited exceptional therapeutic effects against glioma in vivo, advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond GBM for the treatment of various diseases.",

          "abstract": "Many countries are concerned about the migration of top taxpayers. Yet we know little about how economic elites weigh the taxes they pay when deciding where to live. Existing evidence on tax flight is either quantitative or comes from wealthy individuals issuing warnings in the media. Drawing on in-depth interviews with thirty-five individuals in the top 1 per cent of the wealth distribution in the UK, we find a striking stigma attached to tax migration. Participants disparaged those who move for tax purposes and several characterized low-tax destinations as boring and culturally barren. Yet the most important factor restraining tax migration was the attachment to London as a place to work and live, particularly its unparalleled highbrow cultural infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that wealthy individuals often choose to prioritize investments in place-specific cultural capital above the relatively small gains in economic capital associated with tax migration.",

          "abstract": "CEO compensation has expanded dramatically over the past half-century, with network processes playing a pivotal role. We advance research on these processes by focusing on which CEOs are more likely to get pay premiums and how this shapes income going to other actors within the firm. Using Danish registry data and a weighted k-core measure of elite connections, our analyses highlight that CEOs embedded in the corporate elite can extract a substantial wage premium. These premiums are then followed by reductions in wages going back to workers over the next three years. However, the more of a firm’s board of directors who are similarly connected to the corporate elite, the less effective are those connections in generating a premium. These findings extend the role of social networks beyond just the diffusion of increasing compensation for CEOs to the creation of inequalities among CEOs and between CEOs and workers.",

We estimate firm-level regression models contrasting hypotheses traditionally found in the literature on financialization (that firms turn to financial incomes in response to weakened profitability or shareholder-value orientation) with more recent alternative explanations (that point toward other independent processes such as monetary policy rates or corporate internationalization). Our results show that changes in monetary policy and stock-market capitalization are more relevant drivers of financial income accumulation overall, whereas the traditional explanations appear to be significant only for firms in the USA, particularly for highly financialized firms. Additionally, corporate internationalization also appears to be strongly related to financial incomes in NFCs. These results, thus, support recent calls for a revision of the traditional narrative regarding financial accumulation in advanced economies and its relation to other general economic processes.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, I examine the challenges in the legal processes of securing child support in India. Drawing from a qualitative study of family disputes—including ethnographic observations in courts, mediation centers, and legal offices, as well as in-depth interviews and archival research, I reveal how gendered institutional practices shape child support negotiations, often to the detriment of women. I make three significant contributions. First, while much research has focused on judicial decision making in family law disputes, I turn my attention to mediation, a growing method of dispute resolution, to show how this private ordering of family law often places women in financially precarious positions. Second, building on the concept of relational work, I show how mediators perform institutional gendered relational work and persuasive relational work in their roles as facilitators and reinforce inequality by reproducing gendered expectations and constructing notions of parenthood. Third, I demonstrate how women’s privileged class status does not necessarily guarantee favorable outcomes. Instead, gendered institutional dynamics intersect with systemic failure to perpetuate the gendered wealth gap, pushing women into debt, economic dependence, and financial insecurity. By analyzing these processes, this paper underscores how legal processes create persistent barriers to economic equality contributing to the gendered wealth gap and provides critical insights into the economic conditions of separated and divorced women.",
