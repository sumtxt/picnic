          "authors": "Francine D. Blau, Lisa M. Lynch",
          "abstract": "We provide an overview of what has happened for women over the past 50 years as they worked to break through professional barriers in economics, policy, and institutional leadership. We chart the progress of women in higher education at the college level and beyond and then examine women’s representation at the upper levels of academia, government, law, medicine, and management. We begin our description of trends in 1972, when Title IX was enacted to prohibit sex-based discrimination in federally funded educational programs. The data paint a picture of considerable progress but also persistent inequities. We then go on to consider possible explanations for the continuing gender differences and some of the empirical evidence on the factors identified.",

          "abstract": "We extend the work of Haveman et al., a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. social welfare system’s evolution from the start of the War on Poverty through 2012. Their work chronicled changes in the welfare system and in poverty measurement and analyzed poverty levels and trends. We extend the analysis through 2022, finding that the poverty rate declined from 2012 to 2019 mostly because of improvements in the economy and not from changes in the transfer system; in the 2019 to 2022 pandemic period, though, the opposite occurred, as changes in poverty rates were mostly driven by changes in government relief programs. The decline in poverty from 2012 to 2022 followed a run-up in poverty from 2000 to 2012, leaving the nation with no improvement in poverty rates from the economy since 2000. We conclude that significant future reductions in poverty will likely require further improvements in the safety net.",

          "authors": "Alan S. Blinder",
          "abstract": "There is a huge and harmful gap between two civilizations: economists and politicos. This article explores some of the reasons behind that gap and offers suggestions for how we might shrink it. Doing so will necessarily require more change from economists than from politicos, because politicians are normally the decision-makers while economists are just advisers. Hence, I suggest more places where economists should change their ways. The ideas set forth here are an expansion of those I set out in the 2023 Daniel Patrick Moynihan Lecture on Social Science and Public Policy.",

          "abstract": "Bucky’s Tuition Promise (BTP) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison offers generous financial aid to low-income, in-state students. Unlike many similar programs at other public universities, financial eligibility for BTP depends solely on a family’s adjusted gross income (AGI), rather than on the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or some function of the poverty line. This program design aims to make eligibility simpler and more transparent for students and their families and thereby to encourage application and matriculation. We investigate the implications of the program design for who does and does not receive additional institutional aid, with a particular focus on the marginal group of BTP-eligible students who lack federal Pell Grant eligibility. With this analysis, we aim to motivate a broader discussion of different notions of equity in financial aid administration and the tough trade-offs implicit in simplifying eligibility criteria.",

          "abstract": "We introduce this volume, which investigates a range of topics about poverty, including its measurement, policies intended to alleviate it, and the role of the economy in the likelihood of being in poverty. The volume was conceived as a tribute to Rebecca Blank, who was a leader in scholarship and policy translation and served at the highest levels in government and academia. The final section of the volume explores topics of special interest to Blank, including financial aid policy, the evolving roles of women in leadership, the ways in which academics can be more effective in policymaking, and motivations for her work.",

          "abstract": "Welfare reforms in the 1990s, particularly the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, were motivated by concerns over the long-term poor. We compare the experiences of newly poor women in 1990–1992, 2001–2003, and 2008–2010 and find that the size and sources of the income shocks generating new spells of poverty remained relatively stable. In dual-head families, the newly poor were most often pushed into poverty by a drop in spousal earnings; in single-mother families, the main cause was a drop in personal earnings. For single mothers in the latter two periods, we find that income from cash transfers after becoming poor was less than in the 1990–1992 benchmark. As these transfers include welfare payments, the timing points to the impacts of the 1996 welfare reforms.",

          "abstract": "We revisit a key question about poverty that was a repeated subject of investigation for Rebecca Blank, estimating the effects of the business cycle on pre–tax-and-transfer and post–tax-and-transfer poverty. Using an anchored household-level version of the Supplemental Poverty Measure’s thresholds and resources, we show that poverty is countercyclical, rising in recessions and falling in expansions. We also find that the social safety net provides protection against cyclicality: Post–tax-and-transfer poverty is less cyclical than is pre–tax-and-transfer poverty. The largest cyclicality occurs among children and Black and Hispanic persons, and lower cyclicality is evident among white and elderly persons. The safety net leads to the largest reductions in cyclicality for the elderly and the smallest effects for nonelderly households without children. Finally, we find an inverted U shape with cyclicality low and rising below 75 percent of poverty and declining above.",

          "abstract": "Use of public assistance by noncitizens is controversial. Before 2018, institutionalization and receipt of cash benefits were considered as evidence of whether immigrants were likely to become a “public charge” and, therefore, ineligible for citizenship. But a new rule—proposed in 2018 and finalized in 2020—also made participation in SNAP/Food Stamps and Medicaid relevant as evidence. We examine whether participation in SNAP/Food Stamps and Medicaid among U.S.-born children—whose own eligibility for program participation should be unaffected by the new rule—has changed, based on the citizenship status of their parents. We find evidence that, after the 2018 proposal, U.S.-born children with noncitizen parents are less likely than the children of U.S.-born parents to participate in these programs. We discuss the literature on “chilling effects” and on the impact of safety net programs on children’s long-term outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Policymaking that aims to protect families and foster economic growth ought to be informed by a clear understanding of how employment, benefits, and family well-being interact. Here, we conduct a broad assessment of employment trends among low-income Americans, showing that, in recent decades, people with low income have become more highly educated and less likely to be married, and the share that is Hispanic has increased. We also find that these shifting characteristics do little to explain change in employment over time. Our findings also contribute to a growing literature that documents how social benefits for nonelderly adults increasingly reward and encourage work: benefits have become more generous to low-income adults with children who have substantial earnings, while they have remained relatively stable for childless adults. Low-income families with children and substantial earnings received more income from social benefits in the past decade than they did 30 years ago.",

          "abstract": "Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), part-time workers were much less likely than full-time workers to have health insurance. The ACA included multiple provisions intended to raise health insurance coverage rates, including a mandate that employers provide affordable coverage to full-time workers, a requirement that dependents be allowed to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26, extensions of Medicaid coverage, and the establishment of health insurance exchanges on which lower-income households could purchase subsidized coverage. Implementation of these provisions was associated with a decline in the full-time/part-time coverage gap from 6.5 percentage points in 2013 to 3.1 percentage points in 2021. Increases in Medicaid coverage and insurance purchased on the exchanges were the largest contributors to the reduction in the full-time/part-time coverage gap.",

It requires extensive research, expert judgment of how to define resources and needs, and a data infrastructure that enables accurate measurement. In this article, we briefly summarize the evolution of poverty measurement in the U.S. and discuss the recommended changes to the Supplemental Poverty Measure that were recently proposed by an expert panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). We emphasize how the costs of medical care, child care, and housing can be better accounted for in the measurement of poverty, and the need to incorporate administrative data records with survey data.",

          "abstract": "Over many years, the research and writing of Rebecca Blank provided insightful analysis of poverty and the social safety net in the U.S. A number of lessons can be drawn from her work—about the social safety net and about policy-relevant scholarship—that remain crucial. Blank’s work shows us the importance of considering heterogeneity among those who live in poverty. It highlights the patchwork nature of the social safety net as well as the role played by both geographic variation and race in determining antipoverty policy in the U.S. Her lessons on scholarship include the value of measurement and of high-quality research that considers both benefits and costs of policies. Finally, Blank’s work shows us that the perception that “nothing works” to reduce poverty misinterprets history and ignores a growing body of evidence.",

This genome-wide association study (GWAS) of sociologically informed occupational status measures (ISEI, SIOPS, CAMSIS) using the UK Biobank ( N = 273,157) identified 106 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms of which 8 are novel to the study of SES. Genetic correlations with educational attainment ( r g = 0.96–0.97) and income ( r g = 0.81–0.91) point to a common genetic factor for SES. We observed a 54–57% reduction in within-family predictions compared with population-based predictions, attributed to indirect parental effects (22–27% attenuation) and assortative mating (21–27%) following our calculations. Using polygenic scores from population predictions of 5–10% (incremental R 2 = 0.023–0.097 across different approaches and occupational status measures), we showed that (1) cognitive and non-cognitive traits, including scholastic and occupational motivation and aspiration, link polygenic scores to occupational status and (2) 62% of the intergenerational transmission of occupational status cannot be ascribed to genetic inheritance of common variants but other factors such as family environments. Finally, links between genetics, occupation, career trajectory and health are interrelated with parental occupational status.",

However, it is unclear how much businesses depend on each other during disruptions. Leveraging human mobility data and same-day visits in five US cities, we quantify dependencies between points of interest encompassing businesses, stores and amenities. We find that dependency networks computed from human mobility exhibit significantly higher rates of long-distance connections and biases towards specific pairs of point-of-interest categories. We show that using behaviour-based dependency relationships improves the predictability of business resilience during shocks by around 40% compared with distance-based models, and that neglecting behaviour-based dependencies can lead to underestimation of the spatial cascades of disruptions. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring complex relationships in patterns of human mobility to foster urban economic resilience to shocks.",

Accurate, fast, lower-cost alternatives such as eliciting predictions could accelerate assessment for rapid policy implementation in a crisis and help guide a more efficient allocation of scarce replication resources. We elicited judgements from participants on 100 claims from preprints about an emerging area of research (COVID-19 pandemic) using an interactive structured elicitation protocol, and we conducted 29 new high-powered replications. After interacting with their peers, participant groups with lower task expertise (‘beginners’) updated their estimates and confidence in their judgements significantly more than groups with greater task expertise (‘experienced’). For experienced individuals, the average accuracy was 0.57 (95% CI: [0.53, 0.61]) after interaction, and they correctly classified 61% of claims; beginners’ average accuracy was 0.58 (95% CI: [0.54, 0.62]), correctly classifying 69% of claims. The difference in accuracy between groups was not statistically significant and their judgements on the full set of claims were correlated ( r (98) = 0.48, P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that both beginners and more-experienced participants using a structured process have some ability to make better-than-chance predictions about the reliability of ‘fast science’ under conditions of high uncertainty. However, given the importance of such assessments for making evidence-based critical decisions in a crisis, more research is required to understand who the right experts in forecasting replicability are and how their judgements ought to be elicited.",

Assessing variation in efficiency is key to understanding the evolution of complex behavioural traits in primates. Here we examine evidence for individual-level differences beyond age- and sex-class in non-human primate extractive foraging efficiency. We used 25 years (1992–2017) of video of 21 chimpanzees aged ≥6 years in Bossou, Guinea, to longitudinally investigate individual-level differences in stone tool use efficiency. Data from 3,882 oil-palm nut-cracking bouts from &gt;800 h of observation were collected. We found reliability in relative efficiency across four measures of nut-cracking efficiency, as well as a significant effect of age.

Nevertheless, direct insights into human interactions with particular crops and especially animals remain scarce across this vast area. Here we present new stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 86 human and 68 animal remains dating between ce ~700 and 1400 from the Llanos de Mojos, Bolivia. We show evidence of human reliance on maize agriculture in the earliest phases before a reduction in the dietary importance of this crop between ce 1100 and 1400. We also provide evidence that muscovy ducks ( Cairina moschata ), the only known domesticated vertebrate in the South American lowlands, had substantial maize intake suggesting intentional feeding, or even their domestication, from as early as ce 800. Our data provide insights into human interactions with Amazonian ecosystems, including direct evidence for human management of animals in pre-colonial contexts, further enriching our understanding of human history in what was once considered a ‘counterfeit paradise’.",

The same result was replicated in a similar but smaller second sample ( N &gt; 70,000) in which sibship size was also assessed, thereby allowing birth order differences to be separated from sibship size differences. In that sample, Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness showed higher means with larger sibship sizes, with differences between sibship sizes of 1 and 6+ of d = 0.30 and d = 0.36, respectively. Controls for upbringing religiousness and current religiousness reduced these differences by about 25%. Within sibship sizes, birth order differences in these dimensions were considerably smaller but oldests remained up to d = 0.10 lower than middles and youngests. Openness was d ≈ 0.10 higher for onlys than for non-onlys collectively, and within sibship sizes, Openness was d ≈ 0.10 higher for oldests than for middles and youngests.",

          "authors": "Riana Minocher, Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, Cody T. Ross",
          "abstract": "Nuclear family structures are often thought to be essential for the well-being of children. Divorce, the loss of either biological parent, the presence of step-parents, and the practice of polygynous marriage have all been claimed to negatively impact child well-being. However, empirical research on these topics has been limited by the routine use of cross-regional and cross-sectional databases. Cross-regional data render research vulnerable to the ecological inference fallacy, and cross-sectional data prevent assessment of age-specific impacts of time-varying family-structure variables. When longitudinal data are available, they tend to be drawn from Western/urban contexts. Detailed data on family structure and children’s well-being are rarely collected in more marginalized communities. In many rural and traditional communities, nonnuclear family structures are indeed prevalent and viewed as socially permissible—and, as such, may have different impacts on children’s well-being than in Western contexts. Here, we draw on a detailed, longitudinal dataset from a 20-y prospective study in rural Tanzania, where polygyny and serial monogamy are common. We analyze survival outcomes for 3,693 children born between 1931 and 2014, growth outcomes for 881 children born between 1976 and 2014, and educational outcomes for 1,370 children born between 1976 and 2014. Our analyses indicate that monogamous marriage is not consistently associated with better outcomes for children—contrary to some popular and public health perspectives on human family structure.",

While the negative effects of becoming unemployed on health and well-being are well understood, the influence of job loss on financial decisions has received little attention. Across a large-scale survey ( N = 37 , 854 ), spending data from a bank ( N = 404 , 470 ), and two online experiments (total N = 1 , 403 ), we find that job loss increases financial risk-taking. First, in survey data, job loss is associated with elevated levels of self-reported financial risk-taking and lottery ticket purchases. Next, using administrative data from a large bank, we find consistent causal evidence of the influence of job loss on gambling spending. Although total spending decreases after job loss, gambling spending is less affected than our control categories. Finally, we turn to two incentive-compatible manipulations of job loss operationalized in a lab setting. We find that this experimental manipulation increases the take-up of financial risks. The current finding that job loss increases financial risk-taking could accentuate long-term negative financial effects of job loss.",

Elevated chromatin accessibility is critical for the 2C-like state to occur, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Zscan4 exhibits burst expression in 2C embryos and 2C-like cells. Here, we show that Zscan4 mediates chromatin remodeling to promote the chromatin accessibility for achieving the 2C-like state. Through coimmunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry, we identified that Zscan4 interacts with the corepressors Kap1/Trim28, Lsd1, and Hdac1, also with H3K9me3 modifiers Suv39h1/2, to transiently form a repressive chromatin complex. Then, Zscan4 mediates the degradation of these chromatin repressors by recruiting Trim25 as an E3 ligase, enabling the ubiquitination of Lsd1, Hdac1, and Suv39h1/2. Degradation of the chromatin repressors promotes the chromatin accessibility for activation of the 2C-like state. These findings reveal the molecular insights into the roles of Zscan4 in promoting full activation of the 2C-like state.",

We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of nonequilibrium rectification processes in living systems.",

          "abstract": "Independent evolution of similar traits in lineages inhabiting similar environments (convergent or repeated evolution) is often taken as evidence for adaptation by natural selection, and used to illustrate the predictability of evolution. Yet convergence is rarely perfect for two reasons. First, environments may not be as similar as they appear. Second, responses to selection are contingent upon available genetic variation and independent lineages may differ in the alleles, genetic backgrounds, and even the developmental mechanisms responsible for the phenotypes in question. Both impediments to convergence are predicted to increase as the length of time separating two lineages increases, making it difficult to discern their relative importance. We quantified environmental similarity and the extent of convergence to show how habitat and divergence time each contribute to observed patterns of morphological evolution in 212 species of stick and leaf insects (order Phasmatodea). Dozens of phasmid lineages independently colonized similar habitats, repeatedly evolving in parallel directions on a 23-trait morphospace, though the magnitude and direction of these shifts varied. Lineages converging toward more similar environments ended up closer on the morphospace, as did closely related lineages, and closely related lineages followed more parallel evolutionary trajectories to arrive there than more distantly related ones. Remarkably, after accounting for habitat similarity, we show that divergence time reduced the extent of convergence at a constant rate across more than 100 My of separation, suggesting even the magnitude of contingency can be predictable, given sufficient spans of time.",

          "abstract": "Optical imaging access to nanometer-level protein distributions in intact tissue is a highly sought-after goal, as it would provide visualization in physiologically relevant contexts. Under the unfavorable signal-to-background conditions of increased absorption and scattering of the excitation and fluorescence light in the complex tissue sample, superresolution fluorescence microscopy methods are severely challenged in attaining precise localization of molecules. We reasoned that the typical use of a confocal detection pinhole in MINFLUX nanoscopy, suppressing background and providing optical sectioning, should facilitate the detection and resolution of single fluorophores even amid scattering and optically challenging tissue environments. Here, we investigated the performance of MINFLUX imaging for different synaptic targets and fluorescent labels in tissue sections of the mouse brain. Single fluorophores were localized with a precision of &lt;5 nm at up to 80 µm sample depth. MINFLUX imaging in two color channels allowed to probe PSD95 localization relative to the spine head morphology, while also visualizing presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) 1 clustering and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) clustering at the postsynapse. Our two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) two-color MINFLUX results in tissue, with &lt;10 nm 3D fluorophore localization, open up broad avenues to investigate protein distributions on the single-synapse level in fixed and living brain slices.",

          "abstract": "Artificially functional RNAs, such as fluorogenic RNA aptamer (FRApt)-based biosensing tag, represent significant advancements in various biological applications but are limited by the lack of insight into dynamic structure ensembles and universal design concepts. Through the development of an artificial RNA structure ensemble, we rationally established an RNA reconstitution model, “SSPepper-Apt,” to generate a universal fluorogenic RNA biosensing tag. By utilizing various target-recognizing RNA motifs, SSPepper-Apt enables the modular generation of sensing tags for low-background, highly selective imaging of metabolites, peptides, and proteins in living cells. Additionally, by employing single guide RNA (sgRNA) as the recognition RNA motif, SSPepper-Apt generates fluorescence in both CRISPR-mediated imaging and gene editing only when the Cas9–sgRNA complex is successfully assembled; therefore, it can be an effective sgRNA screening tool for gene editing. Our fluorogenic RNA-sensing tag provides a universal approach for constructing functional RNA systems, avoiding the laborious and time-consuming process of sequence combination, and expanding the application of synthetic biological tools.",

The protein product of the cell cycle gene, SKA2, is a GR interaction partner in peripheral cells. However, the precise roles of SKA2 in stress and GR signaling in the brain, specifically in nonreplicating postmitotic neurons, and its involvement in HPA axis regulation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate, using diverse in vitro cell assays, a mechanism by which SKA2 promotes GR signaling through enhancing GR–FKBP4 interaction leading to dissociation of FK506-bindingprotein 51 (FKBP5) from the complex. FKBP4 and FKBP5 are cochaperones known to regulate GR function in opposite directions. Notably in mice, SKA2 in Crh + neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is crucial for HPA axis responsiveness and for maintaining the negative feedback loop underlying allostasis. Moreover, we show that SKA2 expression is increased in postmortem human hippocampus and amygdala from individuals with BD. Our study highlights a critical role of SKA2 in HPA axis function, adds to the understanding of the molecular basis of stress-related psychiatric disorders, and points to potential targets for intervention.",

Here, multiparameter analysis of annually resolved tree-ring records and process-based physiological modeling provide evidence of stable and consistently humid climatic conditions during 270 to 77 BCE in northern China. Precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon region during the Qin–Western Han Dynasties was ~18 to 34% higher compared to present-day conditions. In shifting agricultural and pastoral boundaries ~60 to 100 km northwestward, possibility up to 200 km at times, persistently wetter conditions arguably increased food production, contributing to the socioeconomic prosperity around 2,200 y ago. A gradual wetting trend in the western part of arid northwestern China since the 1980s resembles the historical climate analogue, suggesting that similar benefits for regional environmental and agricultural systems may reoccur under current climate change, at least in the near term.",

          "authors": "Stephen M. Rogers, Darron A. Cullen, David Labonte, Gregory P. Sutton, Jozef J. M. Vanden Broeck, Malcolm Burrows",
          "abstract": "Resilin, an elastomeric protein with remarkable physical properties that outperforms synthetic rubbers, is a near-ubiquitous feature of the power amplification mechanisms used by jumping insects. Catapult-like mechanisms, which incorporate elastic energy stores formed from a composite of stiff cuticle and resilin, are frequently used by insects to translate slow muscle contractions into rapid-release recoil movements. The precise role of resilin in these jumping mechanisms remains unclear, however. We used RNAi to reduce resilin deposition in the principal energy-storing springs of the desert locust ( Schistocerca gregaria ) before measuring jumping performance. Knockdown reduced the amount of resilin-associated fluorescence in the semilunar processes (SLPs) by 44% and reduced the cross-sectional area of the tendons of the hind leg extensor-tibiae muscle by 31%. This affected jumping in three ways: First, take-off velocity was reduced by 15% in knockdown animals, which could be explained by a change in the extrinsic stiffness of the extensor-tibiae tendon caused by the decrease in its cross-sectional area. Second, knockdown resulted in permanent breakages in the hind legs of 29% of knockdown locusts as tested by electrical stimulation of the extensor muscle, but none in controls. Third, knockdown locusts exhibited a greater decline in distance jumped when made to jump in rapid succession than did controls. We conclude that stiff cuticle acts as the principal elastic energy store for insect jumping, while resilin protects these more brittle structures against breakage from repeated use.",

          "abstract": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the global climate that is projected to weaken under future anthropogenic climate change. While many studies have investigated the AMOC’s response to different levels and types of forcing in climate models, relatively little attention has been paid to the AMOC’s sensitivity to the rate of forcing change, despite it also being highly uncertain in future emissions scenarios. In this study, I isolate the AMOC’s response to different rates of CO 2 increase in a state-of-the-art global climate model and find that the AMOC undergoes more severe weakening under faster rates of CO 2 change, even when the magnitude of CO 2 change is the same. I then propose an AMOC-ocean heat transport-sea ice feedback that enhances the decline of the circulation and explains the dependence on the rate of forcing change. The AMOC’s rate-sensitive behavior leads to qualitatively different climates (including differing Arctic sea ice evolution) at the same CO 2 concentration, highlighting how the rate of forcing change is itself a key driver of global climatic change.",

          "abstract": "The Moche archaeological culture flourished along Peru’s North Coast between the 4th and 10th centuries CE and was characterized by a complex social hierarchy dominated by political and religious elites. Previous archaeological evidence suggests kinship was a key factor in maintaining political authority within Moche society. To test this hypothesis, we applied archaeological, genetic, and isotopic methods to examine familial relationships between six individuals, including the prominent Señora de Cao ( ~500 CE ), buried together in a pyramid-like, painted temple, Huaca Cao Viejo, in the Chicama Valley, Peru. Our findings reveal that all six individuals were biologically related, with varying degrees of kinship. The Señora de Cao was interred with a sacrificed juvenile, identified as a possible niece, and at least one, and potentially two siblings and a grandparent in separate tombs nearby. One of the male siblings was accompanied in death by his sacrificed son. Isotopic analysis indicates that while most individuals had diets rich in maize and animal protein and spent their childhoods in or near the Chicama Valley, the sacrificed juvenile accompanying the Señora had a distinct diet and geographic origin. These results demonstrate that Moche elites were interred with family members, including some raised far from their parental homes. This supports the hypothesis that kinship was central to transmitting status and authority. Moreover, sacrificing family members to accompany deceased elites underscores the significance of ritual sacrifice in reinforcing familial ties and linking the deceased to both ancestors and the divine.",

          "abstract": "Biological ensembles use collective intelligence to tackle challenges together, but suboptimal coordination can undermine the effectiveness of group cognition. Testing whether collective cognition exceeds that of the individual is often impractical since different organizational scales tend to face disjoint problems. One exception is the problem of navigating large loads through complex environments and toward a given target. People and ants stand out in their ability to efficiently perform this task not just individually but also as a group. This provides a rare opportunity to empirically compare problem-solving skills and cognitive traits across species and group sizes. Here, we challenge people and ants with the same “piano-movers” load maneuvering puzzle and show that while ants perform more efficiently in larger groups, the opposite is true for humans. We find that although individual ants cannot grasp the global nature of the puzzle, their collective motion translates into emergent cognitive skills. They encode short-term memory in their internally ordered state and this allows for enhanced group performance. People comprehend the puzzle in a way that allows them to explore a reduced search space and, on average, outperform ants. However, when communication is restricted, groups of people resort to the most obvious maneuvers to facilitate consensus. This is reminiscent of ant behavior, and negatively impacts their performance. Our results exemplify how simple minds can easily enjoy scalability while complex brains require extensive communication to cooperate efficiently.",

          "abstract": "The early populations that inhabited the Antilles were traditionally understood as highly mobile groups of hunters/fishers and gatherers. Although more recent data have demonstrated that some populations engaged in the production of domestic plants and cultivars, questions remain about other aspects of their lifeways, including whether the adoption of domesticates was accompanied by a decrease in residential mobility. The level of sedentism in a population is an instrumental variable to understand community social relations and complexity, adaptations, and lifeways. Here, we combined enamel strontium ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr), oxygen (δ 18 O en ), and carbon (δ 13 C en ) isotopes of 44 human teeth from the site of Canímar Abajo—where the oldest human remains from the insular Caribbean have been reported—to examine the mobility patterns of early Antillean groups. In contrast with traditional narratives, the homogeneous strontium isotope values observed in most individuals from the older funerary area of the site (cal. BC 2237–790) were consistent with the pattern expected for a sedentary population subsisting primarily on local resources obtained close to the coast. The isotopic evidence reveals that between cal. AD 403–1282, the mound was reused for funerary practices by both local communities and nonlocal individuals. The evidence suggests that this period saw higher population mobility, with influxes of individuals from more distant locations and diverse dietary and burial traditions. The isotope results from Canímar Abajo provide the earliest isotopic evidence of populations with low-level residential mobility in the Antilles.",

          "abstract": "Aerosol light absorption has been widely considered as a contributing factor to the worsening of particulate pollution in large urban areas, primarily through its role in stabilizing the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Here, we report that absorption-dominated aerosol–radiation interaction can decrease near-surface fine particulate matter concentrations ([PM 2.5 ]) at a large-scale during wintertime haze events. A “warm bubble” effect by the significant heating rate of absorbing aerosols above the PBL top generates a secondary circulation, enhancing the upward motion (downward motion) and the convergence (divergence) in polluted (relatively clean) areas, with a net effect of lowering near-surface [PM 2.5 ]. Furthermore, aerosol absorption of ultraviolet-wave light effectively reduces the photolysis of chemical species, i.e., aerosol–photolysis interaction, hindering ozone formation, reducing atmospheric oxidizing capability, and suppressing secondary aerosol concentrations. Our model assessment reveals that the synergetic two effects decrease near-surface [PM 2.5 ] by around 7.4%, so the presence of light-absorbing aerosols can considerably alleviate particulate pollution during wintertime haze events. Such negative feedbacks to the aerosol loading should be considered in weather/climate prediction and health assessment models.",

          "abstract": "Taxanes are frequently used anticancer drugs known to kill tumor cells by inducing mitotic aberrations and segregation defects. A defining feature of specific cancers, notably triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and particularly those deficient in BRCA1, is chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we focused on understanding the mechanisms of docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity, especially in the context of BRCA1-deficient TNBC. Using functional genetic screens in CIN+ cells, we identified genes that mediate docetaxel response and found an interaction between Huntingtin (HTT) and BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1). We employed Brca1 −/− ; p53 − /− mammary tumor cells, derived from genetically engineered mouse tumors that closely mimic the human disease, to investigate the role of these genes in CIN+ BRCA1-deficient cells. Specifically, we observed that loss of HTT sensitizes CIN+ BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells to docetaxel by shortening mitotic spindle poles and increasing spindle multipolarity. In contrast, BAP1 depletion protected cells against these spindle aberrations by restoring spindle length and enhancing mitotic clustering of the extra centrosomes. In conclusion, our findings shed light on the roles of HTT and BAP1 in controlling mitotic spindle multipolarity and centrosome clustering, specifically in the absence of BRCA1. This affects the response to microtubule-targeting agents and suggests that further studies of the interaction of these genes with the mitotic spindle may provide useful insights into how to target CIN+ cells, particularly in the challenging therapeutic landscape of BRCA1-deficient TNBC.",

          "abstract": "Global adaptation occurs when all populations of a species undergo selection toward a common optimum. This can occur by a hard selective sweep with the emergence of a new globally advantageous allele that spreads throughout a species’ natural range until reaching fixation. This evolutionary process leaves a temporary trace in the region affected, which is detectable using population genomic methods. While selective sweeps have been identified in many species, there have been few comparative and systematic studies of the genes involved in global adaptation. Building upon recent findings showing repeated genetic basis of local adaptation across independent populations and species, we asked whether certain genes play a more significant role in driving global adaptation across plant species. To address this question, we scanned the genomes of 17 plant species to identify signals of repeated global selective sweeps. Despite the substantial evolutionary distance between the species analyzed, we identified several gene families with strong evidence of repeated positive selection. These gene families tend to be enriched for reduced pleiotropy, consistent with predictions from Fisher’s evolutionary model and the cost of complexity hypothesis. We also found that genes with repeated sweeps exhibit elevated levels of gene duplication. Our findings contrast with recent observations of increased pleiotropy in genes driving local adaptation, consistent with predictions based on the theory of migration-selection balance.",

Here, we report an anode-tailored full-cell design (ATFD), which incorporates micrometer-sized silicon (μ-Si) alone, for operation over a limited, prespecified SOC range identified as 30−70%. This range allows homogeneous (de)lithiation throughout the electrode, accompanied by an acceptable level of volume change. The ATFD-based cell exhibits 21.3% higher gravimetric energy density than that of its graphite-based counterpart in a commercial 18650 cylindrical cell and 84.6% capacity retention after 500 cycles even at a fast-charging rate of 3 C.

However, cilia in cerebellar granule cell (GC) neurons disassemble during differentiation through ultrastructurally unique intermediates, a process we refer to as cilia deconstruction. In addition, mature neurons do not reciliate despite having docked centrioles. Here, we identify molecular changes that accompany cilia deconstruction and centriole docking in GC neurons. We used single cell transcriptomic and immunocytological analyses to compare the transcript levels and subcellular localization of proteins between progenitor, differentiating, and mature GCs. Differentiating GCs lacked transcripts for key activators of premitotic cilia resorption, indicating that cilia disassembly in differentiating cells is distinct from premitotic cilia resorption. Instead, during differentiation, transcripts of many genes required for cilia maintenance—specifically those encoding components of intraflagellar transport, pericentrosomal material, and centriolar satellites—decreased. The abundance of several corresponding proteins in and around cilia and centrosomes also decreased. These changes coincided with downregulation of SHH signaling prior to differentiation, even in a mutant with excessive SHH activation. Finally, mother centrioles in maturing granule neurons recruited the cap complex protein, CEP97. These data suggest that a global, developmentally programmed decrease in cilium maintenance in differentiating GCs mediates cilia deconstruction, while capping of docked mother centrioles prevents cilia regrowth and dysregulated SHH signaling. Our study provides mechanistic insights expanding our understanding of permanent cilia loss in multiple tissue-specific contexts.",

          "abstract": "The adsorption of ellipsoidal colloidal particles on liquid interfaces induces interfacial deformation, resulting in anisotropic interface-mediated interactions and the formation of superstructures. Soft prolate-shaped microgels at the air-water interface offer an ideal model for studying spontaneous capillary-driven self-assembly due to their tunable aspect ratio, controlled functionality, and softness. These microgels consist of a polystyrene core surrounded by a cross-linked, fluorescently labeled poly( N -isopropylmethylacrylamide) shell. By uniaxially stretching the particles embedded in polyvinyl alcohol films, the aspect ratio ρ can be finely adjusted. ρ was found to vary from 1 to 8.8 as estimated in their swollen conformation at 20 ° C from confocal laser scanning microscopy. The spontaneous interfacial self-assembly at the air–water interface is investigated through fluorescence microscopy, theoretical calculations, and computer simulations. A structural transition occurs from a seemingly random assembly for small aspect ratios to compact clusters, which transform into a side-to-side assembly forming long chains for high aspect ratios. The influence of the poly( N -isopropylmethacrylamide) shell on the assembly indicates a significant ρ -dependent microgel deformation. This deformation, in turn, determines the average distance between the particles. Consequently, capillary-driven self-assembly of soft anisotropic colloids becomes a powerful mechanism for structuring interfaces and designing microstructured materials.",

          "abstract": "The formation of functional epithelial tubules is critical for the development and maintenance of many organ systems. While the mechanisms of tubule formation by epithelial cells are well studied, the process of tubule anastomosis—where tubules connect to form a continuous network—remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze embryonic mouse kidney tubules undergoing anastomosis. Our analysis identified hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a key potential mediator of this process. To investigate this further, we developed an assay using epithelial spheroids with fluorescently tagged apical surfaces, allowing us to visualize and quantify tubule–tubule connections. Our results demonstrate that HGF promotes tubule anastomosis, and it does so through the MAPK signaling pathway and MMPs, independently of cell proliferation. Remarkably, treatment with HGF and collagenase was sufficient to induce tubule anastomosis in embryonic mouse kidneys. These findings provide a foundational understanding of how to enhance the formation of functional tubular networks. This has significant clinical implications for the use of in vitro–grown kidney tissues in transplant medicine, potentially improving the success and integration of transplanted tissues.",

          "abstract": "Adaptor protein complex-3 (AP-3) mediates cargo sorting from endosomes to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. Recently, it was shown that AP-3 adopts a constitutively open conformation compared to the related AP-1 and AP-2 coat complexes, which are inactive until undergoing large conformational changes upon membrane recruitment. How AP-3 is regulated is therefore an open question. To understand the mechanism of AP-3 membrane recruitment and activation, we reconstituted human AP-3 and determined multiple structures in the soluble and membrane-bound states using electron cryo-microscopy. Similar to yeast AP-3, human AP-3 is in a constitutively open conformation. To reconstitute AP-3 activation by adenosine di-phosphate (ADP)-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a small guanosine tri-phosphate (GTP)ase, we used lipid nanodiscs to build Arf1-AP-3 complexes on membranes and determined three structures showing the stepwise conformational changes required for formation of AP-3 coated vesicles. First, membrane recruitment is driven by one of two predicted Arf1 binding sites, which flexibly tethers AP-3 to the membrane. Second, cargo binding causes AP-3 to adopt a fixed position and rigidifies the complex, which stabilizes binding for a second Arf1 molecule. Finally, binding of the second Arf1 molecule provides the template for AP-3 dimerization, providing a glimpse into the first step of coat polymerization. We propose coat polymerization only occurs after cargo engagement, thereby linking cargo sorting with assembly of higher-order coat structures. Additionally, we provide evidence for two amphipathic helices in AP-3, suggesting that AP-3 contributes to membrane deformation during coat assembly. In total, these data provide evidence for the first stages of AP-3-mediated vesicle coat assembly.",

Here we identify a cellulose synthase–like protein, an unexpected biosynthetic component that interacts with the early pathway enzymes, enabling steroidal scaffolds production in plants. Moreover, knockout of this gene in black nightshade, Solanum nigrum , resulted in plants lacking both steroidal alkaloids and saponins. Unexpectedly, these knockout plants also revealed that steroidal saponins deter serious agricultural insect pests. This discovery provides the missing link to engineer these high-value steroidal molecules and also pinpoints the ecological role for steroidal saponins.",

In this work, we present an approach for the rapid, modular, enantiospecific, and diastereoselective functionalization of piperidine (saturated analog of pyridine), combining robust biocatalytic carbon-hydrogen oxidation with radical cross-coupling. This combination is directly analogous to electrophilic aromatic substitution followed by Pd-couplings for flat molecules, streamlining synthesis of 3D molecules.

          "abstract": "Decades of research on the infamous antinutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in Solanaceae plants have provided deep insights into their metabolism and roles. However, engineering SGAs in heterologous hosts has remained a challenge. We discovered that a protein evolved from the machinery involved in building plant cell walls is the crucial link in the biosynthesis of SGAs. We show that cellulose synthase–like M [GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM15 (GAME15)] functions both as a cholesterol glucuronosyltransferase and a scaffold protein. Silencing GAME15 depletes SGAs, which makes plants more vulnerable to pests. Our findings illuminate plant evolutionary adaptations that balance chemical defense and self-toxicity and open possibilities for producing steroidal compounds in heterologous systems for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.",

          "abstract": "The calcium (Ca 2+ ) sensor ROD1 (RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1) is a master regulator of immunity in rice. By screening suppressors of rod1 mutants, we show that ROD1 governs immune homeostasis by surveilling the activation of a canonical immune pathway. Mutations in OsTIR ( TIR-only protein ), OsEDS1 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 1 ), OsPAD4 ( phytoalexin deficient 4 ), and OsADR1 ( activated disease resistance 1 ) all abolish enhanced disease resistance of rod1 plants. OsTIR catalyzes the production of second messengers 2′-(5″-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP), which trigger formation of an OsEDS1-OsPAD4-OsADR1 (EPA) immune complex. ROD1 interacts with OsTIR and inhibits its enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of ROD1 leads to constitutive activation of the EPA complex. Thus, we unveil an immune network that fine-tunes immune homeostasis and multipathogen resistance in rice.",

BBR from nanostructured filaments with twisted geometry from nanocarbon or metal has strong ellipticity from 500 to 3000 nanometers. The submicrometer-scale chirality of these filaments satisfies the dimensionality requirements imposed by fluctuation-dissipation theorem and requires symmetry breaking in absorptivity and emissivity according to Kirchhoff’s law. The resulting BBR shows emission anisotropy and brightness exceeding those of conventional chiral photon emitters by factors of 10 to 100. The helical structure of these filaments enables precise spectral tuning of the chiral emission, which can be modeled using electromagnetic principles and chirality metrics. Encapsulating nanocarbon filaments in refractive ceramics produces highly efficient, adjustable, and durable chiral emitters capable of functioning at extreme temperatures previously considered unattainable.",

However, most individuals exhibit a more robust response to one of these strains and thus are vulnerable to infection by others. By studying a monozygotic twin cohort, we found that although prior exposure is a factor, host genetics are a stronger driver of subtype bias to influenza viral strains. We found that covalent coupling of heterologous hemagglutinin (HA) from different viral strains could largely eliminate subtype bias in an animal model and in a human tonsil organoid system. We proposed that coupling of heterologous antigens improves antibody responses across influenza strains by broadening T cell help, and we found that using this approach substantially improved the antibody response to avian influenza HA.",

First, coverage: Not all rejected mail ballots are documented. Second, substitution: Some people whose mail ballot is rejected may subsequently successfully vote, in particular if they were notified in time to take action. Third, deterrence: Others may not return their mail ballots if they expect them to be rejected. While rejected mail ballots could over- or underestimate lost votes, a case study of Pennsylvania’s 2022 general election reveals at least 47% more lost votes than rejected mail ballots. These lost votes could prove electorally consequential in Pennsylvania given the number of mail ballots cast and the substantial partisan splits on mail versus in-person ballots.",

          "abstract": "Machine-learning models are key to modern biology, yet models trained on one dataset are often not generalizable to other datasets from different cohorts or laboratories due to both technical and biological differences. Domain adaptation, a type of transfer learning, alleviates this problem by aligning different datasets so that models can be applied across them. However, most state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods were designed for large-scale data such as images, whereas biological datasets are smaller and have more features, and these are also complex and heterogeneous. This Review discusses domain adaptation methods in the context of such biological data to inform biologists and guide future domain adaptation research. We describe the benefits and challenges of domain adaptation in biological research and critically explore some of its objectives, strengths, and weaknesses. We argue for the incorporation of domain adaptation techniques to the computational biologist’s toolkit, with further development of customized approaches.",

          "abstract": "Real-time monitoring of infinitesimal deformations on complex morphologies is essential for precision biomechanical engineering. While flexible strain sensors facilitate real-time monitoring with shape-adaptive properties, their sensitivity is generally lower than spectroscopic imaging methods. Crack-based strain sensors achieve enhanced sensitivity with gauge factors (GFs) exceeding 30,000; however, such GFs are only attainable at large strains exceeding several percent and decline below 10 for strains under 10 −3 , rendering them inadequate for minute deformations. Here, we introduce hypersensitive and flexible “meta-crack” sensors detecting infinitesimal strains through previously undiscovered crack-opening mechanisms. These sensors achieve remarkable GFs surpassing 1000 at strains of 10 −4 on substrates with a Poisson’s ratio of −0.9. The crack orientation–independent gap-widening behavior elucidates the origin of hypersensitivity, corroborated by simplified models and finite element analysis. Additionally, parallel mechanical circuits of meta-cracks effectively address the trade-off between resolution and maximum sensing threshold. In vivo real-time monitoring of cerebrovascular dynamics with a strain resolution of 10 −5 underscores the hypersensitivity and conformal adaptability of sensors.",

Despite the fact that the late step of biotin synthesis is a validated anti-ESKAPE drug target, the primary stage remains fragmentarily understood. We report the functional definition of two BioC isoenzymes (AbBioC for A. baumannii and KpBioC for K. pneumoniae ) that act as malonyl-ACP methyltransferase and initiate biotin synthesis. The physiological requirement of biotin is diverse within ESKAPE pathogens. CRISPR-Cas9–based inactivation of bioC rendered A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae biotin auxotrophic. The availability of soluble AbBioC enabled the in vitro reconstitution of DTB/biotin synthesis. We solved two crystal structures of AbBioC bound to SAM cofactor (2.54 angstroms) and sinefungin (SIN) inhibitor (1.72 angstroms). Structural and functional study provided molecular basis for SIN inhibition of BioC. We demonstrated that BioC methyltransferase plays dual roles in K. pneumoniae infection and A. baumannii colistin resistance.",

          "abstract": "The landmark discovery of gold catalysts has aroused substantial interest in heterogeneous catalysis, yet the catalytic mechanism remains elusive. For carbon monoxide oxidation on gold nanoparticles (NPs) supported on ceria surfaces, it is widely believed that carbon monoxide adsorbs on the gold particles, while the reaction occurs at the gold/ceria interface. Here, we have investigated the dynamic changes of supported gold NPs with various sizes in a carbon monoxide oxidation atmosphere using deep potential molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the structure of tiny gold particles in carbon monoxide atmospheres becomes highly disordered and undergoes phase transition. Such a liquid-like structure provides massive reactive sites, enabling facile carbon monoxide oxidation on the solid-state gold NP rather than just at the gold/ceria interface. This result is further corroborated by catalytic experiments. This work sheds light on both the size effects and activity in noble metal catalysis and provides insights for the design of more effective nanocatalysts.",

PI4KA exists primarily in a heterotrimeric complex with its regulatory proteins TTC7 and FAM126. Fundamental to PI4KA activity is its targeted recruitment to the plasma membrane by the lipidated proteins EFR3A and EFR3B. Here, we report a cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the C terminus of EFR3A bound to the PI4KA-TTC7B-FAM126A complex, with extensive validation using both hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and mutational analysis. The EFR3A C terminus undergoes a disorder-order transition upon binding to the PI4KA complex, with an unexpected direct interaction with both TTC7B and FAM126A. Complex disrupting mutations in TTC7B, FAM126A, and EFR3 decrease PI4KA recruitment to the plasma membrane. Multiple posttranslational modifications and disease linked mutations map to this site, providing insight into how PI4KA membrane recruitment can be regulated and disrupted in human disease.",

Embodying this feature in soft robots poses nontrivial challenges on both hardware and software that can undermine the simplicity and autonomy of such devices. Existing pneumatic electronics-free soft robots have so far mostly been approached by using system fluidic circuit architectures analogous to digital electronics. Instead, here we design dedicated pneumatic coding blocks equivalent to If , If...break , and For software control statements, which are based on the analog nature of nonlinear mechanical components. We demonstrate that we can combine these coding blocks into programs to implement sequences and to control an electronics-free autonomous soft gripper that switches between behaviors based on interactions with the environment. As such, our strategy provides an alternative approach to designing complex behavior in soft robotics that is more reminiscent of how functionalities are also encoded in the body of living systems.",

Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that cause epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis worldwide. Here, we show that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of pandemic GII.4 HuNoV forms distinct condensates that exhibit all the signature properties of LLPS with sustained polymerase activity and the capability of recruiting components essential for viral replication. We show that such condensates are formed in HuNoV-infected human intestinal enteroid cultures and are the sites for genome replication. Our studies demonstrate the formation of phase-separated condensates as replication factories in a positive-sense RNA virus, which plausibly is an effective mechanism to dynamically isolate RdRp replicating the genomic RNA from interfering with the ribosomal translation of the same RNA.",

The plasmon scattering from a nanoparticle-on-film cavity has extremely high sensitivity to the spacing defined by the analyte molecules inside the nanogap. Meanwhile, a 1000-fold infrared light intensity enhancement at the bond vibration frequency further boosts the interaction between mid-IR photons and analyte molecules.

Furthermore, we find that, globally, average glacial erosion rates exceed fluvial erosion rates through time by an order of magnitude, and that this difference cannot be explained by Sadlerian biases or by variations in hillslope, precipitation, or latitude. These findings support observations of increased erosion rates following Cenozoic cooling and glaciation, and reveal the importance of glacial erosion over millennial to orogenic timescales.",

These pHANCs demonstrate exceptional ion selectivity and permeability due to the high surface charges and well-ordered conduits, resulting in outstanding energy harvesting from concentration gradients. Large-scale fabrication of pHANCs has been successfully realized, wherein hundreds of biomimetic photoreceptors produce an ultrahigh voltage over 76 volts, which has not been achieved previously.

At the nanoscale, sharply focused structured light carries coupled spin-orbital angular momenta with complex 3D nearfield structures, crucial for manipulating multidimensional information of light in nanophotonics. However, characterizing these interactions faces challenges with conventional farfield–based methods, which typically lack the essential accuracy and resolution to interrogate the structured nearfield with high fidelity. To address this challenge, we experimentally observe spin-orbit interactions at the nanoscale using photoinduced force microscopy. Such interactions are enabled through sharply focused circularly polarized optical vortices, which are then mapped by nearfield optical forces in high resolution. Because the optical forces can reveal both longitudinal and transverse nearfield structures with high fidelity, the spin-orbit interactions are eventually evaluated quantitatively at the nearfield, as an important inspiration to use the coupled momenta in dense optical nano-device systems.",

By combining HP dehydroascorbate and pyruvate, we are able to visualize increased lactate production in the white matter and increased redox capacity in the deep gray matter.

However, the response of N 2 O production to these changes is poorly constrained. Here we applied nitrogen isotope tracer incubations to measure N 2 O production under experimentally manipulated changes in oxygen and temperature in the Chesapeake Bay—the largest estuary in the United States. N 2 O production more than doubled from nitrification and increased exponentially from denitrification when O 2 was decreased from &gt;20 to &lt;5 micromolar. Raising temperature from 15° to 35°C increased N 2 O production 2- to 10-fold. Developing a biogeochemical model by incorporating these responses, N 2 O emissions from the Chesapeake Bay were estimated to decrease from 157 to 140 Mg N year −1 from 1986 to 2016 and further to 124 Mg N year −1 in 2050. Although deoxygenation and warming stimulate N 2 O production, the modeled decrease in N 2 O emissions, attributed to decreased nutrient inputs, indicates the importance of nutrient management in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, potentially mitigating climate change.",

A gain-of-function missense mutation from patients with cancer, METTL14 R298P , increases malignant cell growth in culture and transgenic mice without increasing global m 6 A levels in mRNAs. The mutant methyltransferase preferentially modifies noncanonical sites containing a GGAU motif, in vitro and in vivo. The m 6 A in GGAU context is detected by the YTH family of readers similarly to the canonical sites but is demethylated less efficiently by an eraser, ALKBH5.

Here, we elucidate that human eyelashes featuring a hydrophobic curved flexible fiber array with surface micro-ratchet and macro-curvature approximating the Brachistochrone is adept at directionally and rapidly expelling incoming liquid to maintain clear vision. These structural attributes are sequentially used for liquid drainage, starting from anisotropic retention via micro-ratchet, followed by the elastic expulsion among deflected hydrophobic flexible fiber arrays and culminating in the fastest sliding off along a Brachistochrone path, which together reduce the contact time by about 20% of that on rigid linear slopes.

However, limited annotated biomedical imaging datasets can cause ViT models to overfit, leading to false predictions due to random noise. To address this, we introduce Training Attention and Validation Attention Consistency (TAVAC), a metric for evaluating ViT model overfitting and quantifying interpretation reproducibility. By comparing high-attention regions between training and testing, we tested TAVAC on four public image classification datasets and two independent breast cancer histological image datasets. Overfitted models showed significantly lower TAVAC scores. TAVAC also distinguishes off-target from on-target attentions and measures interpretation generalization at a fine-grained cellular level. Beyond diagnostics, TAVAC enhances interpretative reproducibility in basic research, revealing critical spatial patterns and cellular structures of biomedical and other general nonbiomedical images.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical unloading causes bone loss, but it remains unclear whether disuse-induced changes to bone microstructure are permanent or can be recovered upon reloading. We examined bone loss and recovery in 17 astronauts using time-lapsed high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and biochemical markers to determine whether disuse-induced changes are permanent. During 6 months in microgravity, resorption was threefold higher than formation. Upon return to Earth, targeted bone formation occurred in high mechanical strain areas, with 31.8% of bone formed in the first 6 months after flight at sites resorbed during spaceflight, significantly higher than the 2.7% observed 6 to 12 months after return. Limited bone recovery at resorption sites after 6 months on Earth indicates a restricted window for reactivating bone remodeling factors in humans. Incomplete skeletal recovery may arise from these arrested remodeling sites, representing potential targets for new interventions, thus providing means to counteract this long-term health risk for astronauts.",

          "abstract": "The development of a microwave electrometer with inherent uncertainty approaching its ultimate limit carries both fundamental and technological significance. However, because of the thermal motion of atoms, the state-of-art Rydberg electrometer falls considerably short of the standard quantum limit by about three orders of magnitude. Here, we use an optically thin medium with approximately 5.2 × 10 5 laser-cooled atoms to implement the microwave heterodyne detection. By mitigating various noises and strategically optimizing the electrometer parameters, our study reduces the equivalent noise temperature by a factor of 20 and achieves an electric field sensitivity of 10.0 nV cm −1 Hz −1/2 , lastly reaching a factor of 2.6 above the standard quantum limit. Our work also provides valuable insights into the inherent capabilities and limitations of Rydberg electrometers, offering superior sensitivity in detecting weak microwave signals for numerous applications.",

          "abstract": "Methanol, as a non-edible feedstock, offers a promising sustainable alternative to sugar-based substrates in biochemical production. Despite progress in engineering methanol assimilation in nonmethylotrophs, the full transformation into methanol-dependent synthetic methylotrophs remains a formidable challenge. Here, moving beyond the conventional rational design principle, we engineered a synthetic methylotrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae through genome rearrangement and adaptive laboratory evolution. This evolutionarily advanced strain unexpectedly shed the heterologous methanol assimilation pathway and demonstrated the robust growth on sole methanol. We discovered that the evolved strain likely realized methanol assimilation through a previously unidentified Adh2-Sfa1-rGly (ASrG) pathway, facilitating the concurrent assimilation of formate and CO 2 . Furthermore, the incorporation of electron transfer material C 3 N 4 quantum dots obviously enhanced methanol-dependent growth, emphasizing the role of energy availability in the ASrG pathway. This breakthrough introduces a previously unidentified C1 utilization pathway and highlights the exceptional adaptability and self-evolving capacity of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network.",

          "abstract": "Monitoring electrical potentials with high recording site density and micrometer spatial resolution in liquid is critical in biosensing. Organic electronic materials have driven remarkable advances in the field because of their unique material properties, yet limitations in spatial resolution and recording density remain. Here, we introduce organic electro-scattering antennas (OCEANs) for wireless, light-based probing of electrical signals with micrometer spatial resolution, potentially from thousands of sites. The technology relies on the unique dependence of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate light scattering properties to its doping level. Electro-optic characteristics of individual antennas varying in diameters and operating voltages were systematically characterized in saline solution. Signal-to-noise ratios up to 48 were achieved in response to 100-mV stimuli, with 2.5-mV detection limits. OCEANs demonstrated millisecond time constants and exceptional long-term stability, enabling continuous recordings over 10 hours. By offering spatial resolution of 5 μm and a recording density of 4 × 10 6 cm −2 , OCEANs unlock new readout capabilities, potentially accelerating fundamental and clinical research.",

          "abstract": "Dysregulation of endothelial barrier integrity can lead to vascular leak and potentially fatal oedema. TNF-α controls endothelial permeability during inflammation and requires the actin organizing Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins. We identified TRAF2 and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) as a kinase directly phosphorylating and activating ERM, specifically at the plasma membrane of primary human endothelial cells. TNIK mediates TNF-α–dependent cellular stiffness and paracellular gap formation in vitro and is essential in driving inflammatory oedema formation in vivo. Unlike its homologs, TNIK activity is negatively and reversibly regulated by H 2 O 2 -mediated oxidation of C202 within the kinase domain. TNIK oxidation results in intermolecular disulfide bond formation and loss of kinase activity. Pharmacologic inhibition of endogenous reactive oxygen species production in endothelial cells elevated TNIK-dependent ERM phosphorylation, endothelial cell contraction, and cell rounding. Together, we highlight an interplay between TNIK, ERM phosphorylation, and redox signalling in regulating TNF-induced endothelial cell permeability.",

          "authors": "Ying Zhou, Min Zou, Mark Williams",
          "abstract": "Previous research has yielded mixed evidence on the relationship between age and job satisfaction. While there is broad consensus that job satisfaction tends to increase from midlife into older age, considerable debate persists regarding whether it rises or falls during the early stages of a career. This study examines this relationship in depth by analysing four nationally representative datasets, which include both cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 108 401 workers in the UK covering all industries, occupations and geographical areas. Our findings reveal a distinct U-shaped trajectory of job satisfaction among workers in managerial, professional and associate professional occupations. However, this pattern is not evident among workers in intermediate or lower occupational classes. These results remain consistent even after adjusting for period effects, cohort effects and fixed individual characteristics. The results of this study suggest that commonly cited reasons for the mid-career crisis, such as increased work–family conflicts, are unlikely to fully explain the pattern. Instead, the answer is likely to lie in work-related factors that disproportionately affect highly skilled workers. By highlighting the role of occupational context in shaping how individuals experience their work as they age, this study contributes to resolving a long-standing debate in the job satisfaction literature and lays the groundwork for theoretical advancements in this field.",
