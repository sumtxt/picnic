          "abstract": "Eukaryotic DNA replication begins with the loading of the MCM replicative DNA helicase as a head-to-head double hexamer at origins of DNA replication 1–3 . Our current understanding of how the double hexamer is assembled by the origin recognition complex (ORC), CDC6 and CDT1 comes mostly from budding yeast. Here we characterize human double hexamer (hDH) loading using biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy with purified proteins. We show that the human double hexamer engages DNA differently from the yeast double hexamer (yDH), and generates approximately five base pairs of underwound DNA at the interface between hexamers, as seen in hDH isolated from cells 4 . We identify several differences from the yeast double hexamer in the order of factor recruitment and dependencies during hDH assembly. Unlike in yeast 5–8 , the ORC6 subunit of the ORC is not essential for initial MCM recruitment or hDH loading, but contributes to an alternative hDH assembly pathway that requires an intrinsically disordered region in ORC1, which may work through a MCM–ORC intermediate. Our work presents a detailed view of how double hexamers are assembled in an organism that uses sequence-independent replication origins, provides further evidence for diversity in eukaryotic double hexamer assembly mechanisms 9 , and represents a first step towards reconstitution of DNA replication initiation with purified human proteins.",

          "abstract": "The tumour microenvironment is programmed by cancer cells and substantially influences anti-tumour immune responses 1,2 . Within the tumour microenvironment, CD8 + T cells undergo full effector differentiation and acquire cytotoxic anti-tumour functions in specialized niches 3–7 . Although interactions with type 1 conventional dendritic cells have been implicated in this process 3–5,8–10 , the underlying cellular players and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that inflammatory monocytes can adopt a pivotal role in intratumoral T cell stimulation. These cells express Cxcl9 , Cxcl10 and Il15 , but in contrast to type 1 conventional dendritic cells, which cross-present antigens, inflammatory monocytes obtain and present peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I complexes from tumour cells through ‘cross-dressing’. Hyperactivation of MAPK signalling in cancer cells hampers this process by coordinately blunting the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) cytokines and inducing the secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), which impairs the inflammatory monocyte state and intratumoral T cell stimulation. Enhancing IFN-I cytokine production and blocking PGE 2 secretion restores this process and re-sensitizes tumours to T cell-mediated immunity. Together, our work uncovers a central role of inflammatory monocytes in intratumoral T cell stimulation, elucidates how oncogenic signalling disrupts T cell responses through counter-regulation of PGE 2 and IFN-I, and proposes rational combination therapies to enhance immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Increasing extreme climatic events threaten the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems 1,2 . Because soil microbes govern key biogeochemical processes, understanding their response to climate extremes is crucial in predicting the consequences for ecosystem functioning 3,4 . Here we subjected soils from 30 grasslands across Europe to four contrasting extreme climatic events under common controlled conditions (drought, flood, freezing and heat), and compared the response of soil microbial communities and their functioning with those of undisturbed soils. Soil microbiomes exhibited a small, but highly consistent and phylogenetically conserved, response under the imposed extreme events. Heat treatment most strongly impacted soil microbiomes, enhancing dormancy and sporulation genes and decreasing metabolic versatility. Microbiome response to heat in particular could be predicted by local climatic conditions and soil properties, with soils that do not normally experience the extreme conditions being imposed being most vulnerable. Our results suggest that soil microbiomes from different climates share unified responses to extreme climatic events, but that predicting the extent of community change may require knowledge of the local microbiome. These findings advance our understanding of soil microbial responses to extreme events, and provide a first step for making general predictions about the impact of extreme climatic events on soil functioning.",

          "abstract": "The early radiation of dinosaurs remains a complex and poorly understood evolutionary event 1–4 . Here we use hundreds of fossils with direct evidence of feeding to compare trophic dynamics across five vertebrate assemblages that record this event in the Triassic–Jurassic succession of the Polish Basin (central Europe). Bromalites, fossil digestive products, increase in size and diversity across the interval, indicating the emergence of larger dinosaur faunas with new feeding patterns. Well-preserved food residues and bromalite-taxon associations enable broad inferences of trophic interactions. Our results, integrated with climate and plant data, indicate a stepwise increase of dinosaur diversity and ecospace occupancy in the area. This involved (1) a replacement of non-dinosaur guild members by opportunistic and omnivorous dinosaur precursors, followed by (2) the emergence of insect and fish-eating theropods and small omnivorous dinosaurs. Climate change in the latest Triassic 5–7 resulted in substantial vegetation changes that paved the way for ((3) and (4)) an expansion of herbivore ecospace and the replacement of pseudosuchian and therapsid herbivores by large sauropodomorphs and early ornithischians that ingested food of a broader range, even including burnt plants. Finally, (5) theropods rapidly evolved and developed enormous sizes in response to the appearance of the new herbivore guild. We suggest that the processes shown by the Polish data may explain global patterns, shedding new light on the environmentally governed emergence of dinosaur dominance and gigantism that endured until the end-Cretaceous mass extinction.",

          "abstract": "Brain-wide association studies (BWAS) are a fundamental tool in discovering brain–behaviour associations 1,2 . Several recent studies have shown that thousands of study participants are required for good replicability of BWAS 1–3 . Here we performed analyses and meta-analyses of a robust effect size index using 63 longitudinal and cross-sectional MRI studies from the Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium 4 (77,695 total scans) to demonstrate that optimizing study design is critical for increasing standardized effect sizes and replicability in BWAS. A meta-analysis of brain volume associations with age indicates that BWAS with larger variability of the covariate and longitudinal studies have larger reported standardized effect size. Analysing age effects on global and regional brain measures from the UK Biobank and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we showed that modifying study design through sampling schemes improves standardized effect sizes and replicability. To ensure that our results are generalizable, we further evaluated the longitudinal sampling schemes on cognitive, psychopathology and demographic associations with structural and functional brain outcome measures in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development dataset. We demonstrated that commonly used longitudinal models, which assume equal between-subject and within-subject changes can, counterintuitively, reduce standardized effect sizes and replicability. Explicitly modelling the between-subject and within-subject effects avoids conflating them and enables optimizing the standardized effect sizes for each separately. Together, these results provide guidance for study designs that improve the replicability of BWAS.",

          "abstract": "In April 2022, mandatory kilocalorie (kcal) labelling in the out-of-home food sector was introduced as a policy to reduce obesity in England. Here we examined whether the implementation of this policy was associated with a consumer behaviour change. Large out-of-home food sector outlets subject to kcal labelling legislation were visited pre- and post-implementation, and customer exit surveys were conducted with 6,578 customers from 330 outlets. Kcals purchased and consumed, knowledge of purchased kcals and reported noticing and use of kcal labelling were examined. The results suggested that the introduction of the mandatory kcal labelling policy in England was not associated with a significant decrease in self-reported kcals purchased ( B = 11.31, P = 0.564, 95% confidence interval (CI) −27.15 to 49.77) or consumed ( B = 18.51, P = 0.279, 95% CI −15.01 to 38 52.03). Post-implementation, participants underestimated the energy content of their purchased meal less ( B = 61.21, P = 0.002, 95% CI 21.57 to 100.86) and were more likely to report noticing (odds ratio 2.25, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 1.84 to 2.73) and using (odds ratio 2.15, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.85) kcal labelling, which may have wider public health implications.",

Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. Here, to evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs indicated high confidence in their predictions, their responses were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where LLMs assist humans in making discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavours.",

          "authors": "Mathias Kruse",
          "abstract": "In Europe, the tendency among immigrants and descendants to seek out and interact with other coethnics has raised concern for their integration as it can reduce contact with the ethnic majority. Though policymakers implement large-scale integration programs to counteract these trends, it remains empirically and theoretically ambiguous whether exposure to coethnic peers impedes integration, and causal evidence is more limited for the growing population of migrant children. In this article, I use high-quality Danish administrative panel data over 28 y to investigate whether the ethnic composition experienced in childhood among immigrants and descendants with a non-EU background affects a core behavioral indicator of integration: naturalization. To isolate the causal effect of the childhood ethnic composition, I use the quasi-experimental assignment of siblings into different school grades in the same school. I find that being exposed to coethnic peers in the school grade increases the probability of naturalizing later in life. The main explanation is that exposure to some coethnic peers improves academic skills which are positively correlated with citizenship acquisition. These findings demonstrate the causal importance of non-EU migrant children’s social environment for their later integration into the national community showing that the modest presence of coethnic peers can be a precondition for, not a barrier to, integration.",

          "authors": "Derek E. Holliday, Yphtach Lelkes, Sean J. Westwood",
          "abstract": "The attempted assassination of Donald Trump led to widespread concern that the event would escalate political violence between U.S. partisans. While some politicians pleaded for Americans to unite against political violence and “turn down the temperature” on partisan hostility, others continued to engage in inflammatory rhetoric and blame. Using a national survey in the field at the time of the assassination attempt, we take the temperature of America’s partisans before and after the event. We exploit the natural variation induced by the assassination attempt and large daily survey coverage (preattempt: 3,572; postattempt: 703; and 690 in a panel) in the days before and after the attempt to estimate the causal effects of extreme partisan violence on measures of partisan animosity and identity. Using panel and cross-sectional interrupted time series analysis, we find no evidence that the event increased tensions or support for retaliatory violence in the immediate aftermath. On the contrary, Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, became significantly less supportive of partisan violence against Democrats. Republicans also did not become more hostile toward Democrats; instead, their attachment to their own party significantly increased. Democrats experienced no change in attitudes. While nearly a third of Americans have no positive feelings toward the other party, and a supermajority have negative feelings, this animosity was not exacerbated by an extreme but salient instance of partisan violence. Despite the ills of modern political conflict, extreme partisan violence did not cause an immediate upsurge in support for violence.",

          "abstract": "Social rejection hurts, but it can also be informative: Through experiences of acceptance and rejection, people identify partners interested in connecting with them and choose which ties to cement or to sever. What is it that people actually learn from rejection? In social interactions, people can learn from two kinds of information. First, people generally learn from rewarding outcomes, which may include concrete opportunities for interaction. Second, people track the “relational value” others ascribe to them—an internal model of how much others value them. Here, we used computational neuroimaging to dissociate these forms of learning. Participants repeatedly tried to match with others in a social game. Feedback revealed whether they successfully matched (a rewarding outcome) and how much the other person wanted to play with them (relational value). A Bayesian cognitive model revealed that participants chose partners who provided rewarding outcomes and partners who valued them. Whereas learning from outcomes was linked to brain regions involved in reward-based reinforcement, learning about relational value was linked to brain regions previously associated with social rejection. These findings identify precise computations underlying brain responses to rejection and support a neurocomputational model of social affiliation in which people build an internal model of relational value and learn from rewarding outcomes.",

We found that an 8-item CRT has greater predictive validity than an 8-item Mathematical Aptitude Test (MAT) consisting of comparably difficult items which lack dominant intuitive lures. Further, the incremental predictive validity stems from the CRT’s measurement of reflection, which we show using both structural equation models and a dual-response paradigm that helps distinguish susceptibility to intuitions from inadequate mathematical aptitude.",

          "abstract": "Stylized experiments, the public goods game and its variants thereof, have taught us the peculiar reproducible fact that humans tend to cooperate (or contribute to shared resources) more than expected from economically rational assumptions. There have been two competing explanations for this phenomenon: Either cooperating is an innate human trait (the prosocial preference hypothesis) or a transitory effect while learning the game (the confused learner hypothesis). We use large-scale experimental data in the two-player version of the public goods game—the prisoner’s dilemma—from an experimental design to distinguish between these two hypotheses. By monitoring the effects of zealots (persistently cooperating bots) and varying the participants’ awareness of them, we find a considerably more complex scenario than previously reported. People indeed have a prosocial bias, but not to the degree that they always forego taking action to increase their profit. While our findings end the simplistic theorizing of prosociality, an observed positive, cooperative response to zealots has actionable policy implications.",

          "abstract": "With climate change intensifying, building resilience against climate-related shocks is now a global imperative. Historically, many societies have faced natural hazards, with some adapting through specific social and cultural practices. Understanding these responses is key to developing modern sustainability strategies. Here, we address this issue by developing a mathematical model explicitly accounting for various environmental shock dimensions, cooperative activities common in nonindustrial societies, and decision-making based on material factors as well as personal values and social norms. Our results suggest that cultural looseness can be vital for effectively responding to mild, slow-onset shocks, leading to moderate cooperation and minimal cultural change. Conversely, coping with severe shocks requires an intermediate level of cultural tightness, fostering significant cultural transformation and high cooperation. While tight societies struggle with new shocks, they may handle regular, severe, fast-onset shocks better than do loose societies. Our research enhances understanding of environmental impacts on cooperation, cultural tightness, and social resilience, and highlights cultural adaptations useful in addressing current environmental challenges like global warming, floods, tornadoes, and soil degradation.",

          "abstract": "Low cerebrospinal (CSF) arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration is a biomarker of social impairment in low-social monkeys and children with autism, suggesting that AVP administration may improve primate social functioning. However, AVP administration also increases aggression, at least in “neurotypical” animals with intact AVP signaling. Here, we tested the effects of a voluntary drug administration method in low-social male rhesus monkeys with high autistic-like trait burden. Monkeys received nebulized AVP or placebo, using a within-subjects design. Study 1 (N = 8) investigated the effects of AVP administration on social cognition in two tests comparing responses to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Test 1: Placebo-administered monkeys lacked face recognition memory, whereas face recognition memory was “rescued” following AVP administration. In contrast, object recognition memory was intact and did not differ between administration conditions. Test 2: Placebo-administered monkeys did not respond to conspecific social communication cues, whereas following AVP administration, they reciprocated affiliative communication cues with species-typical affiliative responses. Importantly, AVP administration did not increase aggressive responses to conspecific aggressive or affiliative overtures. Study 2 (N = 4) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of this administration method. Following AVP nebulization, we observed a linear increase in cisternal CSF AVP levels, and a quadratic rise and fall in blood AVP levels. These findings indicate that nebulized AVP likely penetrates the central nervous system, selectively promotes species-typical responses to social information, and does not induce aggression in low-social individuals. Nebulized AVP therefore may hold promise for managing similar social symptoms in people with autism, particularly in very young or lower functioning individuals.",

          "abstract": "Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion—where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. But real-world contagion processes are often complex, meaning that multiple exposures may be required before an individual considers changing their type. We introduce a framework that combines the concepts of simple payoff-biased imitation with complex contagion, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. We formulate this model as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, a widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner’s Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation toward more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework to describe more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.",

While these tools provide opportunities for improved teaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment and learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of vulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes to be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential scale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can complete assessment questions in standard university-level Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. Specifically, we compile a dataset of textual assessment questions from 50 courses at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to produce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions correctly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one prompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset by degree program, these systems already pass the nonproject assessments of large numbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher education accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve.

          "abstract": "The proportionality of oxygen-to-nitrogen isotope effects ( 18 ε/ 15 ε) is used as a key isotopic signature of nitrogen cycling processes in the environment. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction is observed to have an 18 ε/ 15 ε proportionality of ~0.9 in marine and ~0.6 in freshwater/terrestrial ecosystems. The origins of this difference are uncertain, with both geochemical and biological factors conceivably at play. One potential factor is variation in the isotope effect of nitrate reduction among different forms of the nitrate reductase enzyme. NarG nitrate reductases are observed to typically have an 18 ε/ 15 ε of ~0.9. However, a recent study uncovered an exception, with Bacillus NarG enzymes having an 18 ε/ 15 ε proportionality of ~0.6. This provides an opportunity to investigate genetic controls on 18 ε/ 15 ε. Furthermore, this atypical NarG signature also raises the question of whether intrinsic isotope signatures can evolve as the enzymes that produce them accumulate mutations through time. Here, we present data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments of key NarG residues, which suggest that the distinct Bacillus 18 ε/ 15 ε cannot be caused by single mutations alone and is potentially uncommon in nature. Variation in the intrinsic isotope effects of an enzyme through time may thus require more extensive evolutionary changes.",

          "abstract": "The Bayesian confidence hypothesis (BCH), which postulates that confidence reflects the posterior probability that a decision is correct, is currently the most prominent theory of confidence. Although several recent studies have found evidence against it in the context of relatively complex tasks, BCH remains dominant for simpler tasks. The major alternative to BCH is the confidence in raw evidence space (CRES) hypothesis, according to which confidence is based directly on the raw sensory evidence without explicit probability computations. Here, we tested these competing hypotheses in the context of perceptual tasks that are assumed to induce Gaussian evidence distributions. We show that providing information about task difficulty gives rise to a basic behavioral signature that distinguishes BCH from CRES models even for simple 2-choice tasks. We examined this signature in three experiments and found that all experiments exhibited behavioral signatures in line with CRES computations but contrary to BCH ones. We further performed an extensive comparison of 16 models that implemented either BCH or CRES confidence computations and systematically differed in their auxiliary assumptions. These model comparisons provided overwhelming support for the CRES models over their BCH counterparts across all model variants and across all three experiments. These observations challenge BCH and instead suggest that humans may make confidence judgments by placing criteria directly in the space of the sensory evidence.",

          "abstract": "Variants in the gene NDP cause Norrie disease, a severe dual-sensory disorder characterized by congenital blindness due to disrupted retinal vascular development and progressive hearing loss accompanied by sensory hair cell death. NDP encodes the secreted signaling molecule norrin. The role of norrin in the cochlea is incompletely understood. We investigated whether the Norrie disease cochlear pathology can be ameliorated in an Ndp -knockout ( Ndp -KO) mouse model by conditional activation of stabilized β-catenin in vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that in the cochlea microvasculature, β-catenin is the primary downstream intracellular effector of norrin binding to endothelial cell surface receptors and that restoration of this signaling pathway is sufficient to prevent sensory hair cell death and hearing loss. We show that tamoxifen induction of Cdh5CreERT2;Ctnnb1 flex3/+ ;Ndp- KO mice stabilizing β-catenin in vascular endothelial cells alone rescued defects in cochlear vascular barrier function, restored dysregulated expression of endothelial cell disease biomarkers ( Cldn5, Abcb1a, Slc7a1, and Slc7a5 ), and prevented progressive outer hair cell death and hearing loss. Single-cell transcriptome profiling of human cochleas showed NDP expression by fibrocytes and glial cells while receptor gene expression ( FZD4, TSPAN12, LRP5, and LRP6 ) coincided in vascular endothelial cells. Our findings support the conclusion that vascular endothelial cells are a primary target of norrin signaling in the cochlea of mice and humans and restoration of β-catenin regulation of target gene expression within cochlear endothelial cells is sufficient to maintain a cochlear microenvironment critical for hair cell survival.",

The screening of approved and investigational drugs in cell-based phenotypic assays can provide evidence of drug activity, but alternative screening paradigms are needed to develop and optimize multidrug combination regimens. Here, we utilize in vitro screening outcomes across a panel of lymphoma cell lines to dissect the activity of four small-molecule drugs (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisolone, and Lenalidomide) currently under investigation within ongoing clinical trials in lymphoma. Data from multiple concentration ranges and time points show that synergistic drug combinations promote apoptosis and cytotoxicity responses at concentrations and time points that are consistent with in vivo drug exposures. To fully map the interaction landscape of these agents in relevant cell models, we developed an in vitro assay format that facilitated time-course evaluations involving concurrent multidrug exposure which further highlighted rapid, synergistic apoptosis induction as a central engine for the activity of this multicomponent targeted therapy. In addition to several instances of exceptional drug+drug synergy, the genetically similar diffuse large B cell lymphoma models also displayed substantial heterogeneity in the degree of synergism between drug pairs. A parallel survey of chemotherapies exhibited limited combination benefit, supporting recent findings that multicomponent chemotherapy outcomes are driven by individual drug activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate how in vitro drug screening data can identify multidrug combinations that exploit drug synergy to overcome the functional diversity of human malignancies.",

          "abstract": "Plants have evolved photoreceptors to optimize their development during primary growth, including germination, hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon opening, and root growth, allowing them to adapt to challenging light conditions. The light signaling transduction pathway during seedling establishment has been extensively studied, but little molecular evidence is available for light-regulated secondary growth, and how light regulates cambium-derived tissue production remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that CRYPTOCHROME (CRY)-dependent blue light signaling and the subsequent attenuation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) movement to hypocotyls are key inducers of xylem fiber differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using grafted chimeric plants and hypocotyl-specific transcriptome sequencing of light signaling mutants under controlled light conditions, we demonstrate that the perception of blue light by CRYs in shoots drives secondary cell wall (SCW) deposition at xylem fiber cells during the secondary growth of hypocotyls. We propose that HY5 is a blue light–responsive mobile protein that inhibits xylem fiber formation via direct transcriptional repression of NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING 3 ( NST3 ). CRYs retain HY5 in the nucleus, impede its long-distance transport from leaf to hypocotyl, and they initiate NST3- driven SCW gene expression, thereby triggering xylem fiber production. Our findings shed light on the long-range CRYs-HY5-NST3 signaling cascade that shapes xylem fiber development, highlighting the activity of HY5 as a transcriptional repressor during secondary growth.",

To address these issues, here, we report a set of intelligent and portable lollipop-shaped taste interfacing systems covering from 2 to 9 different taste options for establishing an adjustable taste platform in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) environments. Tasteful and food-grade chemicals embedded agarose hydrogels serve as taste sources based on iontophoresis operation principle, with an adjustable feedback intensity and independent operation time by tuning the voltage input. To achieve portability and user-friendly operation, the devices are miniaturized into a gustation interface with 9-channel taste generators in the dimension of 8 cm × 3 cm × 1 cm. To realize both gustation and olfaction feedbacks in Metaverse, an olfaction interface based on 7-channel odor generators is also introduced into the gustation interface system.

However, whether Chinmo is required for larval maintenance in lepidopteran insects, the underlying mechanisms involved in maintaining the larval stage, and its interactions with the JH signaling pathway are not well understood. Here, we used a binary transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout Chinmo and Kr-h1 (primary response gene in the JH signaling pathway) in the fall armyworm (FAW). Kr-h1 knockout induced premature metamorphosis only after L5 (penultimate), whereas Chinmo and Kr-h1 double knockout induced premature metamorphosis in L3. Sequencing and differential gene expression (DEG) analysis of RNA isolated from mutants and single-cell multiome ATAC analysis of Chinmo , Kr-h1 , and Chinmo and Kr-h1 double knockout Sf9 cells revealed that Chinmo participates in chromatin modifications that prevent the promoter accessibility and expression of metamorphosis promoting genes. These results suggest that Chinmo is a larval specifier that plays a major role in preventing metamorphosis in early larval stages by controlling chromatin accessibility near the promoters of genes such as Br-C and E93 required for pupal and adult development.",

Here, we applied ML techniques to address this challenge, focusing on human pancreatic α-amylase, a crucial enzyme in type-II diabetes treatment. Using ML-based collective variables (CVs), we correlated the probability of being in a RC with the experimental catalytic activity of several malto-oligosaccharide substrates. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable transferability of these CVs across various compounds, significantly streamlining the modeling process and reducing both computational demand and manual intervention in setting up simulations for new substrates.

          "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) latently infected neurons display diverse patterns in the distribution of the viral genomes within the nucleus. A key pattern involves quiescent HSV-1 genomes sequestered in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) forming viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (vDCP NBs). Using a cellular model that replicates vDCP NB formation, we previously demonstrated that these viral genomes are chromatinized with the H3.3 histone variant modified on its lysine 9 by trimethylation (H3.3K9me3), a mark associated with transcriptional repression. Here, we identify the HUSH complex and its effectors, SETDB1 and MORC2, as crucial for the acquisition of H3K9me3 on PML NB-associated HSV-1 and the maintenance of HSV-1 transcriptional repression. ChIP-seq analyses show H3K9me3 association with the entire viral genome. Inactivating the HUSH–SETDB1–MORC2 complex before infection significantly reduces H3K9me3 on the viral genome, with minimal impact on the cellular genome, aside from expected changes in LINE-1 retroelements. Depletion of HUSH, SETDB1, or MORC2 alleviates HSV-1 repression in infected primary human fibroblasts and human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived sensory neurons (hiPSDN). We found that the viral protein ICP0 induces MORC2 degradation via the proteasome machinery. This process is concurrent with ICP0 and MORC2 depletion capability to reactivate silenced HSV-1 in hiPSDN. Overall, our findings underscore the robust antiviral function of the HUSH–SETDB1–MORC2 repressor complex against a herpesvirus by modulating chromatin marks linked to repression, thus presenting promising avenues for anti-herpesvirus therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "Orientation is one of the most salient features in visual scenes. Neurons at multiple levels of the visual system detect orientation, but in many cases, the underlying biophysical mechanisms remain unresolved. Here, we studied mechanisms for orientation detection at the earliest stage in the visual system, in B/K wide-field amacrine cells (B/K WACs), a group of giant, nonspiking interneurons in the mouse retina that coexpress Bhlhe22 (B) and Kappa Opioid Receptor (K). B/K WACs exhibit orientation-tuned calcium signals along their long, straight, unbranching dendrites, which contain both synaptic inputs and outputs. Simultaneous dendritic calcium imaging and somatic voltage recordings reveal that individual B/K dendrites are electrotonically isolated, exhibiting a spatially confined yet extended receptive field along the dendrite, which we term “compartmentalized pooling.” Further, the receptive field of a B/K WAC dendrite exhibits center-surround antagonism. Phenomenological receptive field models demonstrate that compartmentalized pooling generates orientation selectivity, and center-surround antagonism shapes band-pass spatial frequency tuning. At the microcircuit level, B/K WACs receive excitation driven by one contrast polarity (e.g., “ON”) and glycinergic inhibition driven by the opposite polarity (e.g., “OFF”). However, this “crossover” inhibition is not essential for generating orientation selectivity. A minimal biophysical model reproduced compartmentalized pooling from feedforward excitatory inputs combined with a substantial increase in the specific membrane resistance between somatic and dendritic compartments. Collectively, our results reveal the biophysical mechanism for generating orientation selectivity in dendrites of B/K WACs, enriching our understanding of the diverse strategies employed throughout the visual system to detect orientation.",

          "abstract": "Estrogen deficiency, which is linked to various pathological conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency and postmenopausal osteoporosis, disrupts the delicate balance between bone formation and resorption. This imbalance leads to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures, primarily due to a significant reduction in trabecular bone mass. Trabecular osteoblasts, the cells responsible for bone formation within the trabecular compartment, originate from skeletal progenitors located in the bone marrow. The microenvironment of the bone marrow contains hypoxic (low oxygen) regions, and the hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF2) plays a crucial role in cellular responses to these low-oxygen conditions. This study demonstrates that the loss of HIF2 in skeletal progenitors and their derivatives during development enhances trabecular bone mass by promoting bone formation. More importantly, PT2399, a small molecule that specifically inhibits HIF2, effectively prevents trabecular bone loss in ovariectomized adult mice, a model for estrogen-deficient bone loss. Both the genetic and pharmacological approaches result in an increase in osteoblast number, which is linked to the expansion of the pool of skeletal progenitor cells. This expansion either by loss or inhibition of HIF2 uncovers a pivotal mechanism for increasing osteoblast numbers and bone formation, resulting in greater trabecular bone mass.",

Existing methods to eliminate environmental confounding leverage random genetic variation resulting from recombination and require within-family dyadic genetic data (i.e., parent–child and/or sibling pairs), meaning they can only be applied in relatively small and selected samples. We introduce the phenotype differences model and provide derivations showing that it—under plausible assumptions—provides consistent (and, in certain cases, unbiased) estimates of genetic effects using just a single individual’s genotype. Then, leveraging distinct samples of fully and partially genotyped sibling pairs in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we use polygenic indices and phenotypic data for 24 different traits to empirically validate the phenotype differences model. Finally, we utilize the model to test the effects of 40 polygenic indices on lifespan. After a 10% false discovery rate correction, we find that polygenic indices for three traits—body mass index, self-rated health, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—have a statistically significant effect on an individual’s lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are well established as contributors to intermolecular interactions and the formation of biomolecular condensates. In particular, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) often harbor IDRs in addition to folded RNA-binding domains that contribute to RBP function. To understand the dynamic interactions of an IDR–RNA complex, we characterized the RNA-binding features of a small (68 residues), positively charged IDR-containing protein, Small ERDK-Rich Factor (SERF). At high concentrations, SERF and RNA undergo charge-driven associative phase separation to form a protein- and RNA-rich dense phase. A key advantage of this model system is that this threshold for demixing is sufficiently high that we could use solution-state biophysical methods to interrogate the stoichiometric complexes of SERF with RNA in the one-phase regime. Herein, we describe our comprehensive characterization of SERF alone and in complex with a small fragment of the HIV-1 Trans-Activation Response (TAR) RNA with complementary biophysical methods and molecular simulations. We find that this binding event is not accompanied by the acquisition of structure by either molecule; however, we see evidence for a modest global compaction of the SERF ensemble when bound to RNA. This behavior likely reflects attenuated charge repulsion within SERF via binding to the polyanionic RNA and provides a rationale for the higher-order assembly of SERF in the context of RNA. We envision that the SERF–RNA system will lower the barrier to accessing the details that support IDR–RNA interactions and likewise deepen our understanding of the role of IDR–RNA contacts in complex formation and liquid–liquid phase separation.",

S-palmitoylation is a PTM catalyzed by zinc finger DHHC domain containing (zDHHC) S-acyltransferases that affects both localization and activity of proteins regulating synaptic plasticity and amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism. Here, we found significant increases of both zDHHC7 expression and protein S-palmitoylation in hippocampi of both 3×Tg-AD mice and post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Chronic intranasal administration of the S-palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate counteracted synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits, reduced the Aβ deposition in the hippocampus and extended the lifespan of both male and female 3×Tg-AD mice. Moreover, hippocampal silencing of zDHHC7 prevented the onset of cognitive deficits in the same experimental model. We also identified a FoxO1-mediated epigenetic mechanism inducing zDHHC7 expression, which was triggered by brain insulin resistance in 3×Tg-AD mice. Finally, in hippocampi of AD patients S-palmitoylation levels of Beta-Secretase 1 were associated with Aβ 1 to 42 load and they inversely correlated with Mini Mental State Examination scores. Our data reveal a key role of both zDHHC7 overexpression and protein hyperpalmitoylation in the onset and progression of AD-related alterations of synaptic plasticity and memory.",

Microtubules serve as polar tracks for the selective transport of specific molecular motors toward either their plus or minus ends. How both motors reciprocally move microtubules and organize the network’s arrangement and polarity is unknown. Here, we combined experiments on reconstituted systems and theory to study the interaction of microtubules with both plus- and minus-end directed motors bound to a fluid membrane. Depending on motor concentrations, the system could lead either to the constant transport of microtubules or to their alignment, stacking, and immobilization in regular bands that separate motors into domains of opposite polarities. In bands, microtubules shared the same polarity and segregated the two opposing motors accordingly. These regular patterns resulted from the balance of forces produced by the two motors as they walked in opposite directions along microtubules. The system was maintained in a dynamic steady state in which the directional transport of microtubule-bound motors compensates for the random diffusion of lipid-bound motors. The size of motor domains depended on their respective concentrations. The constant flow of motors allowed the system to respond to variations in motor concentrations by moving microtubules to adapt to the new force balance. The polar sorting and linear arrangement of microtubules associated with the segregation of motors of opposite polarity are typical of cellular architectures, which these data may help to better understand.",

However, knowledge of the range of the antigen(s) that can activate diverse MR1-reactive T cells remains incomplete. Here, we identify pyridoxal (vitamin B6) as a naturally presented MR1 ligand using unbiased mass spectrometry analyses of MR1-bound metabolites. Pyridoxal, and the related compound, pyridoxal 5-phosphate bound to MR1 and enabled cell surface upregulation of wild type MR1*01 and MR1 expressing the Arg9His polymorphism associated with the MR1*04 allotype in a manner dependent on Lys43-mediated Schiff-base formation. Crystal structures of MR1*01 in complex with pyridoxal and pyridoxal 5-phosphate showed how these ligands were accommodated within the A-pocket of MR1. T cell lines transduced with the 7.G5 TCR, which has reported “pan-cancer” specificity, were specifically activated by pyridoxal presented by antigen-presenting cells expressing MR1*01 and MR1 allotypes bearing the less common Arg9His polymorphism. 7.G5 T cells also recognized, to a lesser extent, pyridoxal 5-phosphate and, importantly, recognition of both vitamers was blocked by an anti-MR1 antibody. 7.G5 TCR reactivity toward pyridoxal was enhanced when presented by the Arg9His polymorphism-bearing MR1 allotypes. Vitamin B6, and vitamers thereof, have been associated with various cancers, and here we describe a link between this ligand, MR1, and its allomorphs, and the pan-cancer 7.G5 TCR.

In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of two hepatitis E virus (HEV) nAbs, 8H3, and 8C11, which have exhibited enhanced neutralizing activity in a rhesus monkey model. We presented crystal structures of 8H3 Fab alone and a triple complex of 8C11 Fab and 8H3 Fab simultaneously binding to the HEV E2s protein (8C11:E2s:8H3). Through structural analysis, we identified critical binding sites and fully elucidated the binding footprints of nAb 8H3 in the 8C11:E2s:8H3 complex using site-directed mutagenesis, pinpointing Ile 529, Glu 549, Lys 554, and Ser 566 in the E2s domain, and K66H, S67H, D88H in the 8C11 heavy chain. Interestingly, the synergetic enhancement of 8C11 to 8H3 converted to an antagonistic effect when 8C11 bound to E2s with pretreatment of 8H3, indicating a unidirectional synergistic effect associated with the sequence of antibody involvement. We demonstrated this phenomenon through structural comparisons of E2s:8C11 vs. 8C11:E2s:8H3 crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations, found that Ile 529 played a key role in the synergistic interplay between these two nAbs. The two-antibody combination showed a more potent antibody-imposed physical disruption mechanism and enhanced coneutralization in an authentic HEV-based cell model.

Here, we utilized remote sensing and observation-driven datasets to quantify the statistical associations between SSS and streamflow ( Q basin ) at 48 megadeltas worldwide. This study uncovers a robust negative association between Q basin and SSS , with correlation coefficients R less than - 0.6 for seasonal data found in 26 of the 48 megadeltas, and less than - 0.4 for deseasoned data in 21 megadeltas. The anticorrelation relationship is more pronounced in large deltas, particularly near tropical climates and in river-influenced deltas. The study also underscores the significant roles of climate, morphological, and anthropogenic stratification in impacting the natural influence of freshwater discharge on SSS .

A particularly dramatic example of rapid motion in plants is the squirting cucumber ( Ecballium elaterium ) which launches its seeds explosively via a high-pressure jet. Despite intriguing scientists for centuries, the exact mechanism of seed dispersal and its effect on subsequent generations remain poorly understood. Here, through a combination of experimentation, high-speed videography, quantitative image analysis, and mathematical modeling, we develop a full mechanical description of the process. We quantify the turgor pressure driving ballistic ejection, and uncover key mechanical interactions between the fruit and stem both prior to and during seed ejection, including the unique feature that fluid is redistributed from fruit to stem prior to ejection, a developmental event that goes against the paradigm of rapid seed ejection but which is of key importance in successful dispersal for Ecballium . Combining modeling elements, we quantify and simulate the ballistic trajectories of seeds, which are dispersed over distances greater than 2,000 times their length. We demonstrate how together these mechanical features contribute to a nearly uniform distribution of seeds away from the parent plant. Parametric variation of key developmental events in the modeling framework indicates how a suite of adaptive features in combination drives the spatial distribution of offspring over consecutive generations, and suggests that ballistic seed dispersal has a stabilizing effect on population dynamics by reducing intraspecific competition.",

Despite being the most abundant G protein at synapses, the role of Go in the brain remains unclear, primarily because of the high mortality associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) 17 in Gnao1 mutated animals. Here, we conducted proteomic analyses with a brain synaptosomal fraction to investigate the Go-interactome and then generated a non-DEE model using Gli1 CreERT2 mice to selectively knockout (KO) the presynaptic Gαo within cerebellum. Our findings revealed that Gαo interacts with multiple proteins involved in neurotransmitter release, as well as cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R), a key Gi/o-coupled receptor in presynaptic terminals. In Gnao1 KO mice, synapse formation was reduced in the cerebellum with a concomitant reduction in depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, a manifestation of CB1R-mediated synaptic plasticity found in the cerebellum. These mice displayed motor deficits in rotarod, grip strength, gait, and beam balance tests. Our results suggest that Go plays a critical role in regulating neurotransmitter releases at the presynaptic terminals and its absence in the entire brain may contribute to DEE pathogenesis.

          "abstract": "The physics of membranes, a classic subject, acquires new momentum from two-dimensional (2D) materials multilayers. This work reports the surprising results emerged during a theoretical study of equilibrium geometry of bilayers as freestanding membranes. While ordinary membranes are prone to buckle around compressive impurities, we predict that all 2D material freestanding bilayers universally undergo, even if impurity-free, a spontaneous out-of-plane buckling. The moiré network nodes here play the role of internal impurities, the dislocations that join them giving rise to a stress pattern, purely shear in homobilayers and mixed compressive/shear in heterobilayers. That intrinsic stress is, theory and simulations show, generally capable to cause all freestanding 2D bilayers to undergo distortive bucklings with large amplitudes and a rich predicted phase transition scenario. Realistic simulations predict quantitative parameters expected for these phenomena as expected in heterobilayers such as graphene/hBN, WS 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayers, and for twisted homobilayers such as graphene, hBN, MoS 2 . Buckling then entails a variety of predicted consequences. Mechanically, a critical drop of bending stiffness is expected at all buckling transitions. Thermally, the average buckling corrugation decreases with temperature, with buckling-unbuckling phase transitions expected in some cases, and the buckled state often persisting even above room temperature. Buckling will be suppressed by deposition on hard attractive substrates, and survives in reduced form on soft ones. Frictional, electronic, and other associated phenomena are also highlighted. The universality and richness of these predicted phenomena strongly encourages an experimental search, which is possible but still missing.",

However, while actively maintaining patterns of activity requires robustness against noise and distractors, updating the activity requires sensitivity to task-relevant inputs. How these conflicting demands can be reconciled in a single neural system remains unclear. Here, we study the prefrontal cortex of monkeys maintaining a covert rule and integrating sensory inputs toward a choice. Following the onset of neural responses, sensory integration evolves with a 70 ms delay. Using a stability analysis and a recurrent neural network model trained to perform the task, we show that this delay enables a transient, system-level destabilization, opening a temporal window to selectively incorporate new information. This mechanism allows robustness and sensitivity to coexist in a neural system and hierarchically updates patterns of neural activity, providing a general framework for cognitive control.

          "authors": "Haotian Zhang, Mert Gur, Ivet Bahar",
          "abstract": "Hinge sites of proteins play a key role in mediating conformational mechanics. Among them, those involved in the most collective modes of motion, also called global hinges, are of particular interest, as they support cooperative rearrangements that are often functional. Yet, the utility of targeting global hinges for modulating function remains to be established. We present here a systematic study of a series of proteins resolved in drug-bound forms to examine the probabilistic occurrence of spatial overlaps between hinge sites and drug-binding pockets. Our analysis reveals a high propensity of drug binding to hinge sites compared to random. Notably, one-third of currently approved drugs are colocalized with hinge sites. These mechanosensitive sites are predictable by simple models such as the Gaussian Network Model. Their targeting thus emerges as a viable strategy for developing a new class of drugs that would exploit and modulate the target proteins’ intrinsic dynamics, and potentially alleviate drug-resistance when used in combination with orthosteric or allosteric drugs.",

          "abstract": "Multiple recent record-shattering weather events raise questions about the adequacy of climate models to effectively predict and prepare for unprecedented climate impacts on human life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Here, we show that extreme heat in several regions globally is increasing significantly and faster in magnitude than what state-of-the-art climate models have predicted under present warming even after accounting for their regional summer background warming. Across all global land area, models underestimate positive trends exceeding 0.5 °C per decade in widening of the upper tail of extreme surface temperature distributions by a factor of four compared to reanalysis data and exhibit a lower fraction of significantly increasing trends overall. To a lesser degree, models also underestimate observed strong trends of contraction of the upper tails in some areas, while moderate trends are well reproduced in a global perspective. Our results highlight the need to better understand and model the drivers of extreme heat and to rapidly mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to avoid further harm from unexpected weather events.",

The postulated catalytic mechanism involves stabilization of a chiral DNA loop followed by the passage of the T-segment through the temporarily cleaved G-segment resulting in sign inversion. The molecular basis for this is poorly understood as the chiral loop has never been directly observed. We have obtained high-resolution cryoEM structures of Escherichia coli gyrase with chirally wrapped 217 bp DNA with and without the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin (MFX). Each structure constrains a positively supercoiled figure-of-eight DNA loop stabilized by a GyrA β-pinwheel domain which has the structure of a flat disc. By comparing the catalytic site of the native drug-free and MFX-bound gyrase structures both of which contain a single metal ion, we demonstrate that the enzyme is observed in a native precatalytic state. Our data imply that T-segment trapping is not dependent on the dimerization of the ATPase domains which appears to only be possible after strand passage has taken place.",

Extensive bioinformatics analyses encompassing thousands of patient tumors and human cancer cell lines uncovered enhanced expression of proliferator-activatedreceptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a potent regulator of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), across several SCNCs. PGC-1α correlated tightly with increased expression of the lineage marker Achaete-scute homolog 1, (ASCL1) through a positive feedback mechanism. Analyses using a human prostate tissue-based SCN transformation system showed that the ASCL1 subtype has heightened PGC-1α expression and OXPHOS activity. PGC-1α inhibition diminished OXPHOS, reduced SCNC cell proliferation, and blocked SCN prostate tumor formation. Conversely, PGC-1α overexpression enhanced OXPHOS, validated by small-animal Positron Emission Tomography mitochondrial imaging, tripled the SCN prostate tumor formation rate, and promoted commitment to the ASCL1 lineage. These results establish PGC-1α as a driver of SCNC progression and subtype determination, highlighting metabolic vulnerabilities in SCNCs across different tissues.",

          "abstract": "The Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (UPR mt ), a mitochondria-originated stress response to altered mitochondrial proteostasis, plays important roles in various pathophysiological processes. In this study, we revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-tethered stress sensor CREBH regulates UPR mt to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and function in the liver. CREBH is enriched in and required for hepatic Mitochondria-Associated Membrane (MAM) expansion induced by energy demands. Under a fasting challenge or during the circadian cycle, CREBH is activated to promote expression of the genes encoding the key enzymes, chaperones, and regulators of UPR mt in the liver. Activated CREBH, cooperating with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), activates expression of Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) 5 and ATF4, two major UPR mt transcriptional regulators, independent of the ER-originated UPR (UPR ER ) pathways. Hepatic CREBH deficiency leads to accumulation of mitochondrial unfolded proteins, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and elevated cellular redox state. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function caused by CREBH deficiency coincides with increased hepatic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but decreased glycolysis. CREBH knockout mice display defects in fatty acid oxidation and increased reliance on carbohydrate oxidation for energy production. In summary, our studies uncover that hepatic UPR mt is activated through CREBH under physiological challenges, highlighting a molecular link between ER and mitochondria in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis and energy homeostasis under stress conditions.",

          "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that defends against viral infections in diverse organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans mutations that enhance RNAi have revealed pathways that may regulate antiviral defense. A genetic screen for C. elegans mutations that fail to up-regulate a defense response reporter transgene detected mutations that enhance RNAi to silence this reporter gene in the inositol polyphosphate multikinase impk-1 , the synMuv B gene lin-15B, and the pathogen defense response gene pals-22 . Using other assays for enhanced RNAi, we found that the impk-1 alleles and an ippk-1 gene inactivation of a later step in inositol hexaphosphate (IP 6 ) synthesis, and the lin-15B and pals-22 alleles enhance RNAi. IP 6 has been known for decades to bind and stabilize human adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA (ADAR) as well as the paralog tRNA editing ADAT. We show that the C. elegans IP 6 pathway is also required for mRNA and tRNA editing. Thus, a deficiency in two axes of RNA editing enhances the already potent C. elegans RNAi antiviral defense, suggesting adenosine to inosine RNA editing may normally moderate this siRNA antiviral defense pathway. The C. elegans IP 6 -deficient mutants are synthetic lethal with a set of enhanced RNAi mutants that act in the polyploid hypodermis to regulate collagen secretion and signaling from that tissue, implicating IP 6 signaling especially in this tissue. This enhanced antiviral RNAi response uses the C. elegans RIG-I-like receptor DRH-1 to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The production of primary siRNAs, rather than secondary siRNAs, contributes to this activation of the UPR through XBP-1 signaling. The gon-14 and pal-17 mutants that also emerged from this screen act in the mitochondrial defense pathway rather than by enhancing RNAi.",

In this study, chromatin accessibility profiling of genetically defined mouse MNs was used to identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) capable of driving MN-selective gene expression. Subsequent testing of these candidates identified two CREs that confer MN-selective gene expression in the spinal cord as well as reduced off-target expression in dorsal root ganglia. Within one of these candidate elements, we identified a compact core transcription factor (TF)-binding region that drives MN-selective gene expression. Finally, we demonstrated that selective spinal cord expression driven by this mouse CRE is preserved in non-human primates. These findings suggest that cell-type-selective viral reagents in which cell-type-selective CREs drive restricted gene expression will be valuable research tools in mice and other mammalian species, with potentially significant therapeutic value in humans.",

However, genetic variation in the organellar genomes (plasmotypes) is often disregarded due to the difficulty of studying the plasmotypes and the lack of evidence that this is a worthwhile investment. Here, we systematically phenotyped plasmotype diversity using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model species. A reanalysis of whole-genome resequencing data of 1,541 representative accessions shows that the genetic diversity among the mitochondrial genomes is eight times lower than among the chloroplast genomes. Plasmotype diversity of the accessions divides the species into two major phylogenetic clusters, within which highly divergent subclusters are distinguished. We combined plasmotypes from 60 A. thaliana accessions with the nuclear genomes (nucleotypes) of four A. thaliana accessions to create a panel of 232 cytonuclear genotypes (cybrids). The cybrid plants were grown in a range of different light and temperature conditions and phenotyped using high-throughput phenotyping platforms. Analysis of the phenotypes showed that several plasmotypes alone or in interaction with the nucleotypes have significant effects on photosynthesis and that the effects are highly dependent on the environment. Moreover, we introduce Plasmotype Association Studies (PAS) as a method to reveal plasmotypic effects. Within A. thaliana, several organellar variants can influence photosynthetic phenotypes, which emphasizes the valuable role this variation has on improving photosynthetic performance. The increasing feasibility of producing cybrids in various species calls for further research into how these phenotypes may support breeding goals in crop species.",

          "abstract": "Flexible control of pectoral appendages enables motor behaviors of vastly different strength, speed, and amplitude, as in a human playing the piano or throwing a ball. Such control necessitates a fine-tuned, coordinated activation of motoneurons, which is facilitated by spatially ordered motoneuron pools in mammals. While differently sized neurons are known to contribute to different strengths of pectoral movements, it remains unclear how these pectoral motor pools are organized in less complex pectoral systems as those of teleost fish. We show how pectoral motor control can be extended to increase the speed- and amplitude-range of motor behaviors by investigating anatomical and physiological features of pectoral motoneurons and the motor pools they form in freshwater hatchet fish, well-known for their pectoral aerial escape response. Through the differentiation of one motor pool, the pectoral motor network of hatchet fish acquired additional flexibility to enable specific control of vastly different amplitudes, velocities, and strengths. Similar neuronal organization patterns have been described for controlling fast, intermediate, and slow axial muscles in zebrafish and in tetrapod motor systems controlling pectoral limbs. We show that hatchet fish share organizational principles of their pectoral motor pools with those found in other motor networks in both teleosts and tetrapods. Our data thus suggest that principles of spatial and physiological differentiation of motor pools associated with different pectoral muscles and behaviors might be deeply homologous between actinopterygian and sarcopterygian vertebrates.",

To investigate this in more detail, we performed infection assays in engineered cells promoting ACE2-mediated entry with and without TMPRSS2 coexpression. Electron microscopy and inhibitor experiments indicated TMPRSS2-mediated cell entry was associated with increased virion internalization into endosomes, and partially dependent upon clathrin-mediated endocytosis. TMPRSS2 increased panvariant uptake efficiency and enhanced early rates of virus replication, transcription, and secretion, with variant-specific profiles observed. On the host side, transcriptional profiling confirmed the magnitude of infection-induced antiviral and proinflammatory responses were linked to uptake efficiency, with TMPRSS2-assisted entry boosting early antiviral responses. In addition, TMPRSS2-enhanced infections increased rates of cytopathology, apoptosis, and necrosis and modulated virus secretion kinetics in a variant-specific manner. On the virus side, convergent signatures of cell-uptake-dependent innate immune induction were recorded in viral genomes, manifesting as switches in dominant coupled Nsp3 residues whose frequencies were correlated to the magnitude of the cellular response to infection. Experimentally, we demonstrated that selected Nsp3 mutations conferred enhanced interferon antagonism. More broadly, we show that TMPRSS2 orthologues from evolutionarily diverse mammals facilitate panvariant enhancement of cell uptake. In summary, our study uncovers previously unreported associations, linking cell entry efficiency to innate immune activation kinetics, cell death rates, virus secretion dynamics, and convergent selection of viral mutations. These data expand our understanding of TMPRSS2’s role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and confirm its broader significance in zoonotic reservoirs and animal models.",

Here, we identified a depupylation regulator, a protein called CoaX, through its copurification with the depupylase Dop. CoaX is a pseudopantothenate kinase that showed evidence of binding to pantothenate, an essential nutrient Mtb synthesizes, but not its phosphorylation. In a ∆ coaX mutant, pantothenate synthesis enzymes including PanB, a substrate of the Pup-proteasome system (PPS), were more abundant than in the parental strain. In vitro, CoaX specifically accelerated depupylation of Pup~PanB, while addition of pantothenate inhibited this reaction. In culture, media supplementation with pantothenate decreased PanB levels, which required CoaX. Collectively, we propose CoaX regulates PanB abundance in response to pantothenate levels by modulating its vulnerability to proteolysis by Mtb proteasomes.",

We present a markedly different approach that initiates acid-catalyzed polymerization at the surface of water films or water droplets, which is the reactive phase during a wet–dry cycle in freshwater hot springs associated with subaerial volcanic landmasses. We apply this method to the oligomerization of different nucleic acids, a topic relevant to how it might be possible to go from simple nucleic acid monomers to long-chain polymers, a key step in forming the building blocks of life. It has long been known that dehydration at elevated temperatures can drive the synthesis of ester and peptide bonds, but this reaction has typically been carried out by incubating dry monomers at elevated temperatures. We report that single or multiple cycles of wetting and drying link mononucleotides by forming phosphodiester bonds. Mass spectrometric analysis reveals uridine monophosphate oligomers up to 53 nucleotides, with an abundance of 35 and 43 nt in length. Long-chain oligomers are also observed for thymidine monophosphate, adenosine monophosphate, and deoxyadenosine monophosphate after exposure to a few wet–dry cycles. Nanopore sequencing confirms that long linear chains are formed. Enzyme digestion shows that the linkage is the phosphodiester bond, which is further confirmed by 31 P NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This suggests that nucleic acid oligomers were likely to be present on early Earth in a steady state of synthesis and hydrolysis.",

Unlike cross-flow filtration, where permeability and selectivity are rationally designed following trade-off analyses, the driving forces underlying the evolution of mobula filter geometry have remained elusive. To bridge the principles of cross-flow and mobula filtration, we establish a universal framework for the permeability–selectivity trade-off in a leaky channel inspired by mobula filters, where permeability and selectivity are characterized by the pore-scale leaking rate and the cut-off particle size, respectively. Beyond the classic pore-flow regime in cross-flow filtration, we reveal transition and vortex regimes pertinent to mobula filtration. Combining theory, physical experiments, and simulations, we present distinct features of water permeability and particle selectivity across the three regimes. In particular, we identify an unreported 1/2-scaling law for the leaking rate in the vortex regime. We conclude by demonstrating that mobula filters strike an elegant balance between permeability and selectivity, which enables mobula rays to simultaneously satisfy biological requirements for breathing and filter feeding. By integrating cross-flow and mobula filtration into a universal framework, our findings provide fundamental insights into the physical constraints and evolutionary pressures associated with biological filtration geometries and lay the foundation for developing mobula-inspired filtration in industry.",

Plot-scale tree diversity experiments with observations over 10 to 11 y indicate that tree diversity increases stability under various environmental changes. However, it remains unknown whether these small-scale experimental findings are relevant to the longer-term stability of natural forests. Using 7,500 natural forest plots across much of Canada, monitored over three to four decades on average, we provide strong evidence that higher temporal stability (defined as the mean productivity divided by its SD over time) is consistently associated with greater tree functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic diversity across all lengths of observations. Specifically, increasing functional diversity from its minimum to maximum values increases stability, mean productivity, and the temporal SD of productivity by 14%, 36%, and 28%, respectively. Our results highlight that the promotion of functionally, phylogenetically, and/or taxonomically diverse forests could enhance the long-term productivity and stability of natural forests.",

          "abstract": "The Voyager spacecraft discovered that the ice giants Uranus and Neptune have nondipolar magnetic fields, defying expectations that a thick interior layer of planetary ices would generate strong dipolar fields. Stanley and Bloxham showed that nondipolar fields emerge if the magnetic field is only generated in a thin outer layer. However, the origin and composition of this dynamo active layer has so far remained elusive. Here, we show with ab initio computer simulations that a mixture of H 2 O, CH 4 , and NH 3 will phase separate under the pressure–temperature condition in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune, forming a H 2 O-dominated fluid in the upper mantle and a CH 4 -NH 3 mixture below. We further demonstrate that with increasing pressure, the CH 4 -NH 3 mixture becomes increasingly hydrogen depleted as it assumes the state of a polymeric C-N-H fluid. Since the amount of hydrogen loss increases with pressure, we propose that the C-N-H fluid forms a stably stratified layer. The magnetic fields are primarily generated in an upper layer that is H 2 O-rich, homogeneous, convective, and electrically conducting. Under these assumptions, we construct ensembles of models for the interiors of Uranus and Neptune with the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid method. We demonstrate that the phase separation of the solar-type H 2 O-CH 4 -NH 3 mixture leads to models that match the observed gravity field and to layer thicknesses that are compatible with magnetic field measurements.",

          "abstract": "Habitats with intermittent flooding, such as paddy soils, are crucial reservoirs in the global carbon pool; however, the effect of phage–host interactions on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in paddy soils remains unclear. Hence, this study applied multiomics and global datasets integrated with validation experiments to investigate phage–host community interactions and the potential of phages to impact carbon sequestration in paddy soils. The results demonstrated that paddy soil phages harbor a diverse and abundant repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) associated with carbon fixation, comprising 23.7% of the identified AMGs. The successful annotation of protein structures and promoters further suggested an elevated expression potential of these genes within their bacterial hosts. Moreover, environmental stressors, such as heavy metal contamination, cause genetic variation in paddy phages and up-regulate the expression of carbon fixation AMGs, as demonstrated by the significant enrichment of related metabolites ( P &lt; 0.05). Notably, the findings indicate that lysogenic phages infecting carbon-fixing hosts increased by 10.7% under heavy metal stress. In addition, in situ isotopic labeling experiments induced by mitomycin-C revealed that by increasing heavy metal concentrations, 13 CO 2 emissions from the treatment with added lysogenic phage decreased by approximately 17.9%. In contrast, 13 C-labeled microbial biomass carbon content increased by an average of 35.4% compared to the control. These results suggest that paddy soil phages prominently influence the global carbon cycle, particularly under global change conditions. This research enhances our understanding of phage–host cooperation in driving carbon sequestration in paddy soils amid evolving environmental conditions.",

          "abstract": "The resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily of multidrug efflux systems are important players in mediating antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni , a major enteric pathogen, utilizes an RND-type transporter system, CmeABC, as the primary mechanism for extrusion of various antibiotics. Recently, a functionally potent variant of CmeABC (named RE-CmeABC) emerged in clinical Campylobacter isolates, conferring enhanced resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Despite the clinical importance of RE-CmeABC, the molecular mechanisms for its functional gain and its evolutionary trajectory remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that amino acid substitutions in RE-CmeB (inner membrane transporter), but not in RE-CmeA (periplasmic protein) and RE-CmeC (outer membrane protein), in conjunction with a nucleotide mutation in the promoter region of the efflux operon, are responsible for the functional gain of the multidrug efflux system. We also showed that RE- cmeABC is emerging globally and distributed in genetically diverse C. jejuni strains, suggesting its possible spread by horizontal gene transfer. Notably, many of RE- cmeABC harboring isolates were associated with the human host including strains from large disease outbreaks, indicating the clinical relevance and significance of RE-CmeABC. Evolutionary analysis indicated that RE- cmeB likely originated from Campylobacter coli , but its expansion mainly occurred in C. jejuni, possibly driven by antibiotic selection pressure. Additionally, RE- cmeB , but not RE- cmeA and RE- cmeC , experienced a selective sweep and was progressing to be fixed during evolution. Together, these results identify a mutation-based mechanism for functional gain in RE-CmeABC and reveal the key role of RE-CmeB in facilitating Campylobacter adaptation to antibiotic selection.",

          "abstract": "Emergence is a fundamental concept in biology and other disciplines, but whether emergent phenotypes evolve similarly to nonemergent phenotypes is unclear. The hypothesized process of emergent evolution posits that evolutionary change in at least some collective behaviors will differ from evolutionary change in the corresponding intrinsic behaviors of isolated individuals. As a result, collective behavior might evolve more rapidly and diversify more between populations compared to individual behavior. To test whether collective behavior evolves emergently, we conducted a large comparative study using 22 ant species and gathered over 1,500 behavioral rhythm time series from hundreds of colonies and isolated individuals, totaling over 1.5 y of behavioral data. We show that analogous traits measured at individual and collective levels exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns. The estimated rates of phenotypic evolution for the rhythmicity of activity in ant colonies were faster than the evolutionary rates of the same behavior measured in isolated individual ants, and total variation across species in collective behavior was higher than variation in individual behavior. We hypothesize that more rapid evolution and higher variation is a widespread feature of emergent phenotypes relative to lower-level phenotypes across complex biological systems.",

To date, all studied cyanobacterial lineages encode carbon fixation machinery relying upon form I Rubiscos within a CO 2 -concentrating carboxysome. Here, we report that the uncultivated anoxic marine zone (AMZ) IB lineage of Prochlorococcus from pelagic oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) harbors both form I and form II Rubiscos, the latter of which are typically noncarboxysomal and possess biochemical properties tuned toward low-oxygen environments. We demonstrate that these cyanobacterial form II enzymes are functional in vitro and were likely acquired from proteobacteria. Metagenomic analysis reveals that AMZ IB are essentially restricted to ODZs in the Eastern Pacific, suggesting that form II acquisition may confer an advantage under low-O 2 conditions. AMZ IB populations express both forms of Rubisco in situ, with the highest form II expression at depths where oxygen and light are low, possibly as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of photoautotrophy under energy limitation. Our findings expand the diversity of carbon fixation configurations in the microbial world and may have implications for carbon sequestration in natural and engineered systems.",

Yet to date, most studies have approached VWM as just serving perception beyond the immediate. Whether and how prospective actions shape information in VWM remains largely unknown, in part because typical experimental setups limit behavior to simple button presses. In two experiments (one preregistered), using a novel interactive VWM task, we show that the similarity of the actions that we intend to perform on memory items adaptively distorts their representation. Participants memorized the orientation of two bars, after which they were informed as to which manual actions they should reproduce these orientations with in a memory recall test. We observed that perceptually similar items were remembered as more distinct when paired with different action plans versus the same action plan. A control experiment showed that this action-induced effect reflects a true change in the visual representation rather than a motor bias. These findings demonstrate that VWM representations are flexibly adapted to guide specific overt actions and provide evidence that action plans can retrospectively warp sensory feature space in VWM.",

Activity-dependent developmental mechanisms impact refinement of sensory circuits, but whether leptin-mediated postnatal neuronal activity specifies hypothalamic neural projections is largely unexplored. Here, we used chemogenetics to manipulate the activity of AgRP neurons during a discrete postnatal critical period and evaluated the development of AgRP inputs to the PVH and descending efferent outflow to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC). In leptin-deficient mice, targeting of AgRP neuronal outgrowth to PVH oxytocin neurons was reduced, and despite the lack of leptin receptors found on oxytocin neurons in the PVH, oxytocin-containing connections to the DVC were also impaired. Activation of AgRP neurons during early postnatal life not only normalized AgRP inputs to the PVH but also oxytocin outputs to the DVC in leptin-deficient mice. Blocking AgRP neuron activity during the same postnatal period reduced the density of AgRP inputs to the PVH of wild type mice, as well as the density of oxytocin-containing DVC fibers, and these innervation deficits were associated with dysregulated autonomic function. These findings suggest that leptin-mediated AgRP neuronal activity is required for the development of PVH connectivity and represents a unique activity-dependent mechanism for specification of neural pathways involved in the hypothalamic integration of autonomic responses.",

          "abstract": "Dynamin 1 (Dyn1) GTPase, a principal driver of membrane fission during synaptic endocytosis, self-assembles into short mechanoactive helices cleaving the necks of endocytic vesicles. While structural information about Dyn1 helix is abundant, little is known about the nanoscale dynamics of the helical scaffolding at the moment of fission, complicating mechanistic understanding of Dyn1 action. To address the role of the helix dynamics in fission, we used High-Speed Atomic Force Microscopy (HS-AFM) and fluorescence microscopy to track and compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of the helices formed by wild-type Dyn1 and its K44A mutant impaired in GTP hydrolysis on minimal lipid membrane templates. In the absence of nucleotide, membrane-bound WT Dyn1 and K44A Dyn1 self-assembled into tubular protein scaffolding of similar diameter encaging the lipid bilayer. In both cases, the GTP addition caused scaffold constriction coupled with formation of 20 to 30 nm nanogaps in the protein coverage. While both proteins reached scaffold diameters characteristic for membrane superconstriction causing fission, the fission was detected only with WT Dyn1. We associated the fission activity with the dynamic evolution of the nanogaps: K44A Dyn1 gaps were static, while WT Dyn1 gaps actively evolved via repetitive nonaxisymmetric constriction-bending deformations caused by localized GTP hydrolysis. Modeling of the deformations implicated filament twist as an additional deformation mode which combines with superconstriction to facilitate membrane fission. Our results thus show that the dynamics of the Dyn1 helical scaffold goes beyond radial constriction and involves nonaxisymmetric deformations, where filament twist emerges as a critical driver of membrane fission.",

After release, SV proteins and excess membrane are recycled via endocytosis, and new SVs can be formed in a clathrin-dependent manner. This process maintains complex molecular composition of SVs through multiple recycling rounds. Previous studies explored the molecular composition of SVs through proteomic analysis and fluorescent microscopy, proposing a model for an average SV ( 1 ). However, the structural heterogeneity and molecular architecture of individual SVs are not well described. Here, we used cryoelectron tomography to visualize molecular details of SVs isolated from mouse brains and inside cultured neurons. We describe several classes of small proteins on the SV surface and long proteinaceous densities inside SVs. We identified V-ATPases, determined a structure using subtomogram averaging, and showed them forming a complex with the membrane-embedded protein synaptophysin (Syp). Our bioluminescence assay revealed pairwise interactions between vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 and Syp and V-ATPase Voe1 domains. Interestingly, V-ATPases were randomly distributed on the surface of SVs irrespective of vesicle size. A subpopulation of isolated vesicles and vesicles inside neurons contained a partially assembled clathrin coat with an icosahedral symmetry. We observed V-ATPases under clathrin cages in several isolated clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Additionally, from isolated SV preparations and within hippocampal neurons we identified clathrin baskets without vesicles. We determined their and CCVs preferential location in proximity to the cell membrane. Our analysis advances the understanding of individual SVs' diversity and their molecular architecture.",

          "abstract": "Neurofilaments (NFs) are multisubunit, bottlebrush-shaped intermediate filaments abundant in the axonal cytoskeleton. Each NF subunit contains a long intrinsically disordered tail domain, which protrudes from the NF core to form a “brush” surrounding each NF. Precisely how the tails’ variable charge patterns and repetitive phosphorylation sites mediate their conformation within the brush remains an open question in axonal biology. We address this problem by grafting recombinant NF tail protein constructs NF-Light, -Medium, and -Heavy (NFL, NFM, and NFH) to surfaces, yielding protein brushes of defined stoichiometry that can be phosphorylated in vitro. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that brush height depends on composition monotonically but not always linearly for binary NFL:NFM or NFL:NFH systems, and that NFM-based brushes are highly extended, while brushes incorporating the much larger NFH are surprisingly compact even after multisite phosphorylation. Complementary self-consistent field theory (SCFT) predicts multilayer brush morphologies for NFM and phosphorylated NFH brushes. Further experiments and SCFT analysis with designed mutants reveal that N-terminal negative charges in the NFH tail repel phosphorylated residues to generate the multilayer morphology, while the C-terminal charge-neutral region contributes to multilayer brush morphology but not total brush height. Charge-shuffled NFM variants show that charge segregation promotes brush collapse near physiological ionic strengths. Collectively, this study supports a role for NFM in establishing a dynamic range for NF brush conformation, lending insight into previous in vitro and in vivo findings. More broadly, this work establishes a platform for dissecting contributions of disordered protein sequence to conformation at interfaces.",

Unexpectedly, coadministration of mRNA vaccines encoding RdRp or the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) dampens RBD-specific immune responses. Contralateral administration reduces the suppression of RBD-specific T cell responses while type I interferon signaling blockade restores RBD-specific antibodies. A staggered immunization strategy maintains both RBD vaccine-mediated antibody and T cell responses as well as protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in human ACE2 transgenic mice. In HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice, the RdRp vaccine elicits CD8+ T cell responses against HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes recognized by human donor T cells.

          "abstract": "Phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein (PBLD) has been reported to be involved in the development of many cancers. However, whether PBLD regulates innate immune responses and viral replication is unclear. In this study, although it was found that the activity of PBLD extends to other PRRs, we focused on the RLR pathway activated via the p53–USP4–MAVS axis in response to virus infections. We found that PBLD deubiquitinates and stabilizes MAVS through ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) to promote antiviral innate immunity. Mechanistically, PBLD activates the transcription of USP4 via the upregulation of p53. USP4, which is a MAVS-interacting protein, substantially stabilizes the MAVS protein by deconjugating K48-linked ubiquitination chains from the MAVS protein at Lys461 during RNA virus infection. Most intriguingly, RNA virus-infected primary macrophages (peritoneal macrophages, PMs, and bone marrow–derived macrophages, BMDMs) and internal organ cells (lung and liver) from PBLD-deficient mice suppress the IFN-I response and promote viral replication. Notably, PBLD-deficient mice are more susceptible to RNA virus infection than their wild-type littermates. Our findings highlight a unique function of PBLD in antiviral innate immunity through the p53–USP4–MAVS signaling, providing a preliminary basis for research on PBLD as a target molecule for treating RNA virus infection.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic loss and dendritic degeneration are common pathologies in several neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive cognitive and/or motor decline, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS). An essential regulator of neuronal health, the cAMP-dependent transcription factor CREB positively regulates synaptic growth, learning, and memory. Phosphorylation of CREB by protein kinase A (PKA) and other cellular kinases promotes neuronal survival and maturation via transcriptional activation of a wide range of downstream target genes. CREB pathway dysfunction has been strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis, and recent data suggest that impaired CREB activation may contribute to disease phenotypes in FTD/ALS as well. However, the mechanisms behind reduced CREB activity in FTD/ALS pathology are not clear. In this study, we found that cortical-like neurons derived from iPSC lines carrying the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, a common genetic cause of FTD/ALS, displayed a diminished activation of CREB, resulting in decreased dendritic and synaptic health. Importantly, we determined such impairments to be mechanistically linked to an imbalance in the ratio of regulatory and catalytic subunits of the CREB activator PKA and to be conserved in C9-ALS patient’s postmortem tissue. Modulation of cAMP upstream of this impairment allowed for a rescue of CREB activity and an amelioration of dendritic morphology and synaptic protein levels. Our data elucidate the mechanism behind early CREB pathway dysfunction and discern a feasible therapeutic target for the treatment of FTD/ALS and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Ordered polar structures in oxide nanofilms play a pivotal role in the development of nanoelectronic applications. Hitherto, ordered polar structures have been restricted to a limited number of ferroelectric materials, and there is no effective scheme to induce and manipulate ordered polar patterns in centrosymmetric nonpolar nanofilms due to the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we circumvent these limitations by utilizing the wrinkle-induced strain gradient modulation associated with flexoelectricity as a general means of inducing and manipulating ordered polar patterns in nonpolar nanofilms. Leveraging the surface instability caused by strain mismatch between oxide nanofilms and pre-strained compliant substrate, we successfully fabricate striped SrTiO 3 wrinkles, where well-ordered strain gradients and corresponding periodic polar patterns are readily achieved. Through in-situ piezoresponse force microscopy experiments, we show that the generated polar patterns can be manipulated by varying strain boundaries. Furthermore, the atomistic resolution images and first-principles calculations reveal that such wrinkle-induced ordered polar patterns primarily emerge from the flexoelectric coupling between the local polarization and strain gradients. These findings provide implications for manipulating polar structures by strain gradient and flexoelectric engineering, which in turn enable the realization of nontrivial polar structures in a broader range of materials.",

Here, we report a conformal, scalable device package that integrates a flexible amorphous silicon–based temperature sensor array and drug-loaded hydrogel for the healing process. This system can enable the spatial temperature mapping at submillimeter resolution and high sensitivity of 0.1 °C, for dynamically localizing the inflammation regions associated with temperature change, automatically followed with heat-triggered drug delivery from hydrogel triggered by wearable infrared light-emitting-diodes. We establish the operational principles experimentally and computationally and evaluate system functionalities with a wide range of targets including live animal models and human subjects. As an example of medical utility, this system can yield closed-loop monitoring/treatments by tracking of temperature distribution over wound areas of live rats, in designs that can be integrated with automated wireless control.

Here, we show that FPC activity also introduces DNA damage by increasing DNA topological stress during replication. Mrc1 action increases DNA topological stress during plasmid replication, while Mrc1 or Tof1 activity causes replication stress and DNA damage within topologically constrained regions. We show that the recruitment of Top1 to the fork by Tof1 suppresses the DNA damage generated in these loci. While FPC activity introduces some DNA damage due to increased topological stress, the FPC is also necessary to prevent DNA damage in long replicons across the genome, indicating that the FPC is required for complete and faithful genome duplication. We conclude that FPC regulation must balance ensuring full genome duplication through rapid replication with minimizing the consequential DNA topological stress–induced DNA damage caused by rapid replication through constrained regions.",

Currents through KCNQ2 mutant channels displayed increased density, hyperpolarizing shifts in activation gating, faster activation and slower deactivation kinetics, and resistance to changes in the cellular concentrations of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), a critical regulator of Kv7 channel function; all these features are consistent with a strong gain-of-function effect. An increase in the probability of single-channel opening, with no change in membrane abundance or single-channel conductance, was responsible for the observed gain-of-function effects. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the mutations widened the inner pore gate and stabilized a constitutively open channel configuration in the closed state, with minimal effects on the open conformation. Thus, mutation-induced stabilization of the inner pore gate open configuration is a molecular pathogenetic mechanism for KCNQ2 -related encephalopathies.",

Herein, we characterized the structure, the biosynthetic pathway, and the mode of action of a RiPP family called bufferins. With thousands of homologous biosynthetic gene clusters throughout the bacterial phylogenetic tree, bufferins form by far the largest family of RiPPs modified by multinuclear nonheme iron-dependent oxidases (MNIO, DUF692 family). Using Caulobacter vibrioides bufferins as a model, we showed that the conserved Cys residues of their precursors are transformed into 5-thiooxazoles, further expanding the reaction range of MNIO enzymes. This rare modification is installed in conjunction with a partner protein of the DUF2063 family. Bufferin precursors are rare examples of bacterial RiPPs found to feature an N-terminal Sec signal peptide allowing them to be exported by the ubiquitous Sec pathway. We reveal that bufferins are involved in copper homeostasis, and their metal-binding propensity requires the thiooxazole heterocycles. Bufferins enhance bacterial growth under copper stress by complexing excess metal ions. Our study thus describes a large family of RiPP metallophores and unveils a widespread but overlooked metal homeostasis mechanism in bacteria.",

          "abstract": "Telomeric DNA sequences are difficult to replicate. Replication forks frequently pause or stall at telomeres, which can lead to telomere truncation and dysfunction. In addition to being at chromosome ends, telomere repeats are also present at internal locations within chromosomes, known as interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs). These sequences are unstable and prone to triggering gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). In this study, we quantitatively examined the effect of ITSs on the GCR rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a genetic assay. We find that the GCR rate increases exponentially with ITS length. This increase can be attributed to the telomere repeat binding protein Rap1 impeding DNA replication and a bias of repairing DNA breaks at or distal to the ITS via de novo telomere addition. Additionally, we performed a genome-wide screen for genes that modulate the rate of ITS-induced GCRs. We find that mutation of core components of the DNA replication machinery leads to an increase in GCRs, but many mutants known to increase the GCR rate in the absence of an ITS do not significantly affect the GCR rate when an ITS is present. We also identified genes that promote the formation of ITS-induced GCRs, including genes with roles in telomere maintenance, nucleotide excision repair, and transcription. Our work thus uncovers multiple mechanisms by which an ITS promotes GCR.",

MDA has density between that of low-density amorphous (LDA) and high-density amorphous (HDA) ices, adding to the complexity of water’s phase diagram, known for its glass polyamorphism and two-state thermodynamics. The nature of MDA and its relation to other amorphous ices and liquid water remain unsolved. Here, we use molecular simulations under controlled pressure and shear rate at 77 K to produce and investigate MDA. We find that MDA formed at constant shear rate is a steady-state nonequilibrium shear-driven amorphous ice (SDA), that can be produced by shearing ice I h , LDA, or HDA. Our results suggest that MDA could be obtained by ball-milling water glasses without crystallization interference. Increasing the shear rate at ambient pressure produces SDAs with densities ranging from LDA to HDA, revealing shear rate as a new thermodynamic variable in the nonequilibrium phase diagram of water. Indeed, shearing provides access to amorphous states inaccessible by controlling pressure and temperature alone. SDAs produced with shearing rates as high as 10 6 s −1 sample the same region of the potential energy landscape than hyperquenched glasses with identical density, pressure, and temperature. Intriguingly, SDAs obtained by shearing at ~10 8 s −1 have density, enthalpy, and structure indistinguishable from those of water “instantaneously” quenched from room temperature to 77 K over 10 ps, making them good approximants for the “true glass” of ambient liquid water.",

          "abstract": "While hydroxyl radical is commonly named as the Fenton product responsible for DNA and RNA damage in cells, here we demonstrate that the cellular reaction generates carbonate radical anion due to physiological bicarbonate levels. In human and Escherichia coli models, their transcriptomes were analyzed by RNA direct nanopore sequencing of ribosomal RNA and chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection to quantify oxidation products in order to follow the bicarbonate dependency in H 2 O 2 -induced oxidation. These transcriptomic studies identified physiologically relevant levels of bicarbonate focused oxidation on the guanine base favorably yielding 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG). In human cells, the bicarbonate-dependent oxidation was further analyzed in the metabolome by mass spectrometry, and a glycosylase-dependent qPCR assay to quantify oxidation sites in telomeres. These analyses further identify guanine as the site of oxidation when bicarbonate is present upon H 2 O 2 exposure. Labile iron as the catalyst for forming carbonate radical anion was demonstrated by repeating the bicarbonate-dependent oxidations in cells experiencing ferroptosis, which had a &gt;fivefold increase in redox-active iron, to find enhanced overall guanine-specific oxidation when bicarbonate was present. The complete profiling of nucleic acid oxidation in the genome, transcriptome, and metabolome supports the conclusion that a cellular Fe(II)-carbonate complex redirects the Fenton reaction to yield carbonate radical anion. Focusing H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative modification on one pathway is consistent with the highly evolved base excision repair suite of enzymes to locate G-oxidation sites for repair and gene regulation in response to oxidative stress.",

Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells activates antibacterial autophagy through a process that requires the innate immune adaptor protein MYD88, yet how MYD88 signaling connects to the autophagy machinery is unknown.

Salmonella infection activated the kinase c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) downstream of MYD88. JNK1 induced enterocyte BCL2 phosphorylation, promoting dissociation of the inhibitory BCL2–BECN1 complex and releasing BECN1 to initiate autophagy. Mice with BCL2 phosphorylation site mutations that prevent BCL2–BECN1 dissociation showed increased Salmonella invasion of enterocytes and dissemination to extraintestinal sites. These findings reveal that BCL2 links MYD88 signaling to enterocyte autophagy initiation, providing mechanistic insight into how invading bacteria trigger autophagy in the intestinal epithelium.",

How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.",

Arabidopsis formin 5 (AtFH5), an actin-nucleating protein, localizes at secretory vesicles and mediates actin polymerization-based vesicle trafficking in pollen. Here, we demonstrate that AtFH5 determines the recruitment and transport of cell wall components in AtFH5-labeled vesicles during the tip growth of pollen tubes. Through a screen of interacting proteins of AtFH5, we identify many cell wall–related proteins, with arabinogalactan protein 23 (AGP23) occupying the highest frequency. AtFH5 interacts with AGP23 via its N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and jointly regulate the pollen germination and tube growth process. Further observations reveal that AGP23 co-localizes with AtFH5 at moving vesicles, germination sites, and pollen tube tips, suggesting that AGP23 is delivered by AtFH5-labeled vesicles. Deletion of the ECD of AtFH5 interrupts the dynamic localization and cell-wall connection of AGP23 in pollen grains and tubes. Cytological and genetic evidence shows that AGP23 and AtFH5 work in the same pathway to modulate cell wall composition. Together, our data uncover a role of formin in directing the sorting and deposition of cell wall components via secretory vesicle trafficking during pollen germination and tube growth.",

(GAA) n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA) n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA) n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5′ of the (GAA) 100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA) n repeats, recreating, in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3′ of the (GAA) 100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5′ GAA-strand nicks increase expansion frequency in nondividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent than in dividing cells.",

We propose Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regeneration as the function of this enzyme and name it Metabolosome Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Hydrogen (NADH) dehydrogenase (MNdh). Its partner shell protein BMC-T SE (tandem domain BMC shell protein of the single layer type for electron transfer) assists in passing the generated electrons to the outside. We support this hypothesis with bioinformatic analysis, functional assays, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, protein voltammetry, and structural modeling verified with X-ray footprinting.

Using a phylogenetic approach never applied before to paleoanthropological data, we show that relative brain size increase across ~7 My of hominin evolution arose from increases within individual species which account for an observed overall increase in relative brain size. Variation among species in brain size after accounting for this effect is associated with body mass differences but not time. In addition, our analysis also reveals that the within-species trend escalated in more recent lineages, implying an overall pattern of accelerating relative brain size increase through time.",

          "abstract": "Science, both teaching and doing, is under attack. The recent US presidential election of a person and platform with anti-science bias exemplifies this. The study of climate processes and patterns and the role of human activities in these phenomena are at the heart of multiple global crises, and yet the scientific results , and the scientists presenting them, are attacked constantly . The dissemination of knowledge on health involving reproduction and human sexuality is increasingly marked for attack (in Russia , Uganda , and the USA ), and researchers in these areas are often the target of extensive political pressure . The massive attack on the science and the scientists behind vaccines, pathogen transmission, and public health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond is well documented , as are attacks on basic science education and the practice of science (for example, in Hungary and the USA ). Even in the arena of biodiversity conservation, there is growing politicization of the data and political targeting of the scientists producing it. According to the US-based National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT), climate change, reproduction, vaccines, and other evidence-based scientific topics are being deemed “controversial” by school boards and state officials and are being removed from state-approved teaching resources across the country. Core research on health, climate, human biology, and biodiversity is being undermined by private foundations, governments, and anti-science ideologues.",

          "abstract": "The Pew Research Center survey on trust in science and researchers is eagerly awaited every year by science policy experts and communicators. This year’s results, released last week, give a small, but meaningful, reason to be optimistic: Trust in scientists, which took a substantial hit during the pandemic, is starting to recover. The survey, conducted in October 2024 with 9593 adults across the United States, estimates that 76% of Americans now have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in scientists to act in the public’s best interests. That’s a modest uptick from 73% last year and a hopeful sign that the page may be turning on some of the pandemic-era skepticism. Although the increase is barely outside the margin of error, it may mark the end of a troubling 3-year decline. However, the data reveal a persistent problem—a considerable portion of the public continues to harbor negative views of scientists’ personal qualities, particularly their communication skills. This reality should be worrisome to the scientific community and drive a collective conversation about rebuilding public confidence.",

We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ 15 N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations.",

In this work, we report the noncovalent synthesis of unprecedented plastics that are mechanically strong yet metabolizable under biologically relevant conditions owing to their dissociative nature with electrolytes. Salt-bridging sodium hexametaphosphate with di- or tritopic guanidinium sulfate in water forms a cross-linked supramolecular network, which is stable unless electrolytes are resupplied. This unusual stability is caused by a liquid-liquid phase separation that expels sodium sulfate, generated upon salt bridging, into a water-rich phase. Drying the remaining condensed liquid phase yields glassy plastics that are thermally reshapable, such as thermoplastics, and usable even in aqueous media with hydrophobic parylene C coating. This approach can be extended to polysaccharide-based supramolecular plastics that are applicable for three-dimensional printing.",

We demonstrate that selective depletion of arginase I (Arg1)–expressing tumor-associated macrophages (Arg1 + TAMs) inhibits tumor growth and concurrently reduces the ratio of T H 1-T reg cells in the TME. Arg1 + TAMs secrete the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which reinforces interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–induced T reg cell polarization into T H 1-T reg cells in a manner dependent on CXCR3 and the IFN-γ receptor. Both genetic PF4 inactivation and PF4 neutralization hinder T H 1-T reg cell accumulation in the TME and reduce tumor growth. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of Arg1 + TAM–produced PF4 for high T H 1-T reg cell levels in the TME to suppress antitumor immunity.",

Slow decoding during translation promotes association of CCR4-NOT with ribosomes, accelerating mRNA degradation. We applied selective ribosome profiling to further investigate the determinants of CCR4-NOT recruitment to ribosomes in mammalian cells. This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryo–electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3. These effects link codon content to mRNA stability. Thus, in addition to their canonical decoding function, tRNAs directly engage regulatory complexes during translation, a mechanism we term P-site tRNA-mediated mRNA decay.",

The changes after sleep were correlated with an increase in information encoded in population activity in each area and improved behavioral performance. Electrically stimulating visual cortex at 4 hertz emulated the beneficial effects of sleep on network and perceptual performance.

Metal nanoparticles may experience changes in shape, surface structure and composition, and atomic packing in response to the pressure of a reactant or product gas, temperature, and reaction between the catalyst surface and gas. Metal oxide supports can partially or fully encapsulate metal nanoparticles, altering their electronic structure and reactivity. Restructuring is a main approach to creating active catalytic sites. The rational design of catalysts must anticipate that such restructurings can occur under reaction or catalytic conditions and gain knowledge of how they occur.

          "abstract": "After the near-complete cessation of commercial whaling, ship collisions have emerged as a primary threat to large whales, but knowledge of collision risk is lacking across most of the world’s oceans. We compiled a dataset of 435,000 whale locations to generate global distribution models for four globally ranging species. We then combined &gt;35 billion positions from 176,000 ships to produce a global estimate of whale-ship collision risk. Shipping occurs across 92% of whale ranges, and &lt;7% of risk hotspots contain management strategies to reduce collisions. Full coverage of hotspots could be achieved by expanding management over only 2.6% of the ocean’s surface. These inferences support the continued recovery of large whales against the backdrop of a rapidly growing shipping industry.",

          "abstract": "The ability to use subjective, latent contextual representations to influence decision-making is crucial for everyday life. The hippocampus is hypothesized to bind together otherwise abstract combinations of stimuli to represent such latent contexts, to support the process of hidden state inference. Yet evidence for a role of the hippocampus in hidden state inference remains limited. We found that the ventral hippocampus is required for mice to perform hidden state inference during a two-armed bandit task. Hippocampal neurons differentiate the two abstract contexts required for this strategy in a manner similar to the differentiation of spatial locations, and their activity is essential for appropriate dopamine dynamics. These findings offer insight into how latent contextual information is used to optimize decisions, and they emphasize a key role for the hippocampus in hidden state inference.",

          "abstract": "Although cumulative culture is a hallmark of hominin evolution, its origins can be traced back to our common ancestor with chimpanzees. Here, we investigated the evolutionary origins of chimpanzee cumulative culture and why it remained incipient. To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo , resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification.",

          "abstract": "Reasoning about someone’s thoughts and intentions—i.e., forming a “theory of mind”—is a core aspect of social cognition and relies on association areas of the brain that have expanded disproportionately in the human lineage. We recently showed that these association zones comprise parallel distributed networks that, despite occupying adjacent and interdigitated regions, serve dissociable functions. One network is selectively recruited by social cognitive processes. What circuit properties differentiate these parallel networks? Here, we show that social cognitive association areas are intrinsically and selectively connected to anterior regions of the medial temporal lobe that are implicated in emotional learning and social behaviors, including the amygdala at or near the basolateral complex and medial nucleus. The results suggest that social cognitive functions emerge through coordinated activity between internal circuits of the amygdala and a broader distributed association network, and indicate the medial nucleus may play an important role in social cognition in humans.",

To identify sleep drive neurons, we imaged Drosophila brains with calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI). The results indicate that the activity of the protocerebral bridge (PB) correlates with sleep drive. We further identified a key three-layer PB circuit, EPG-SpsP-PEcG, in which the four SpsP neurons in the PB respond to ellipsoid body (EB) signals from EPG neurons and send signals back to the EB through PEcG neurons. This circuit is strengthened by sleep deprivation, indicating a plasticity response to sleep drive. SpsP neurons also receive inputs from the sensorimotor brain region, suggesting that they may encode sleep drive by integrating sensorimotor and navigation cues. Together, our experiments show that the four SpsP neurons and their sleep regulatory circuit play an important and dynamic role in sleep regulation.",

However, the ability to control QGP remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that QGP at the LaAlO 3 /KTaO 3 (110) interface can be efficiently modulated by the orientation of applied magnetic field: With a perpendicular field, an anomalous QGP emerges in the low-temperature regime, characterized by a decreasing critical field as temperature lowers; conversely, with a parallel field, a normal QGP arises, where the critical field increases with decreasing temperature. Such opposite characteristics stem from the controllable quantum fluctuations and conductivity corrections under distinct magnetic field orientations. Furthermore, we show the effective tuning of the phase boundary by electrostatic gating, attributed to the gate-controlled quantum fluctuations. These findings not only demonstrate how to experimentally manipulate QGP but also provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum fluctuations can effectively modulate QGP.",

          "abstract": "The transduction of extracellular chemical signals into intracellular events relies on the communication between neighboring domains of membrane receptors. In the particular case of Cys-loop receptor channels, five short stretches of amino acids, one per subunit, link the extracellular and transmembrane domains in such a way that the ion permeability of the latter and the affinity for neurotransmitters of the former become tied to each other. Here, using direct functional approaches, we set out to understand the molecular bases of this crucial interdependence through the characterization of total loss-of-current mutations at the interface between domains. Our results indicate that domain−domain proximity plays a previously unnoticed critical role inasmuch as inserting a single residue in each linker rendered the two domains independent of each other. In marked contrast, loss-of-current mutations that leave the linkers’ length unaltered did not compromise the interdomain coupling, but rather, seemed to cause agonist-bound closed receptors to desensitize without appreciably opening.",

Furthermore, we validated PRIME’s predictions on five proteins, examining the impact of the top 30 to 45 single-site mutations on various protein properties, including thermal stability, antigen-antibody binding affinity, and the ability to polymerize nonnatural nucleic acid or resilience to extreme alkaline conditions. More than 30% of PRIME-recommended mutants exhibited superior performance compared to their premutation counterparts across all proteins and desired properties. We developed an efficient and effective method based on PRIME to rapidly obtain multisite mutants with enhanced activity and stability. Hence, PRIME demonstrates broad applicability in protein engineering.",

This is the earliest large-scale Archaic fish-trapping facility recorded in ancient Mesoamerica. We suggest that such landscape-scale intensification may have been a response to long-term climate disturbance recorded between 2200 and 1900 BCE. Agricultural intensification after 2000 BCE has been credited for supporting the rise of pre-Columbian civilizations in Formative Mesoamerica, but we suggest that some groups relied more heavily on the mass harvesting of aquatic resources. We argue that such early intensification of aquatic food production offered a high value subsistence strategy that was instrumental in the emergence of Formative period sedentarism and the development of complexity among pre-Columbian civilizations like the Maya.",

Disease-causing mutations are found in both domains. Now, studies have focused largely on LRRK2 kinase activity, while attention to its GTPase function is limited. LRRK2 is a guanine nucleotide–binding protein, but the mechanism of direct regulation of its GTPase activity remains unclear and its physiological GEF is not known. Here, we identified CalDAG-GEFI (CDGI) as a physiological GEF for LRRK2. CDGI interacts with LRRK2 and increases its GDP to GTP exchange activity. CDGI modulates LRRK2 cellular functions and LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration in both LRRK2 Drosophila and mouse models. Together, this study identified the physiological GEF for LRRK2 and provides strong evidence that LRRK2 GTPase is regulated by GAPs and GEFs. The LRRK2 GTPase, GAP, or GEF activities have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets, which is distinct from the direct LRRK2 kinase inhibition.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the meniscus region formed between the electrode and the convex liquid level due to the electrowetting of the catalyst plays a vital role in the CO 2 RR in batch cells. CO 2 RR in the meniscus region in batch cells exhibits similar performance with that in flow cells, and the performance disparity between these two configurations largely disappears when conducting CO 2 RR primarily in the meniscus region. An assembled double-sided gas diffusion electrode with a gas channel is developed to maximize the meniscus-like region, achieving a CO 2 RR partial current density of 640 mA/cm 2 geo on commercial Cu in the KHCO 3 electrolyte. This performance represents the highest CO 2 RR activity in neutral buffered media.",

          "abstract": "Optimal gene transcription is achieved through precise interactions between transcription factors and their DNA binding sites. We provide evidence that conserved distally located 5′-flanking sequences interact directly with the intrinsically disordered amino-terminal region of the thyroid receptor-α (TRα) to control transcriptional activity. Simulated modeling and dynamics with multiple ChIP-seq–derived sequences consistently reveal specific lysine/arginine–DNA minor groove interactions. The impact of these interactions is to distort DNA structural conformations, and these are also revealed with atomic force microscopy. The importance of the 5′-flanking DNA is further emphasized with reporter gene assays and comparisons with canonical response elements. Overall, the study reveals the inadequacy of current definitions of the DNA hormone response element (HRE) and suggests that future descriptions of the HRE include the conserved distal DNA sequences. The broad impact of this study is further underscored by the common occurrence of Lys/Arg-rich motifs within the intrinsically disordered regions of nuclear receptors.",

          "abstract": "Numerous human cancers have exhibited the ability to elude immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This type of resistance can be mediated by immune-suppressive macrophages that limit antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we elucidate a strategy to shift macrophages into a proinflammatory state that down-regulates V domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) via inhibiting AhR and IRAK1. We used a high-throughput microfluidic platform combined with a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of VISTA levels. Functional characterization showed that the knockdown of these hits diminished VISTA surface levels on macrophages and sustained an antitumor phenotype. Furthermore, targeting of both AhR and IRAK1 in mouse models overcame resistance to ICB treatment. Tumor immunophenotyping indicated that infiltration of cytotoxic CD8 + cells, natural killer cells, and antitumor macrophages was substantially increased in treated mice. Collectively, AhR and IRAK1 are implicated as regulators of VISTA that coordinate a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.",

Micro- to nanoscale microscopy of a unique impact-shocked zircon from the regolith breccia meteorite NWA7034 reveals textural and chemical indicators of hydrothermal conditions on Mars during crystallization 4.45 billion years ago. Element distribution maps show sharp alternating zoning defined by marked enrichments of non-formula elements, such as Fe, Al, and Na, and ubiquitous nanoscale magnetite inclusions. The zoning and inclusions are similar to those reported in terrestrial zircon crystallizing in the presence of aqueous fluid and are here interpreted as primary features recording zircon growth from exsolved hydrous fluids at ~4.45 billion years. The unique record of crustal processes preserved in this grain survived early impact bombardment and provides previously unidentified petrological evidence for a wet pre-Noachian martian crust.",

Bradykinesia and rigidity amelioration were associated with ablation of the rostral motor STN subregion connected to the supplementary motor and premotor cortices, whereas antitremor effect was explained by lesioning the posterolateral STN projection to the primary motor cortex. These findings were corroborated prospectively in another PD cohort ( n = 12).

Genome-wide analysis revealed that this score is highly heritable, identifying loci associated with iron homeostasis, and driven by peripheral iron levels. Our score predicted gait abnormalities and showed a U-shaped relationship with PD risk, identifying individuals with threefold increased risk. These results establish a hormetic relationship between brain iron and PD risk, where central iron levels are strongly determined by genetics via peripheral iron.

Cell-surface expression of transporters is regulated by substrates and intracellular signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that substrates of the dopamine transporter (DAT), amphetamine and dopamine, synergize with protein kinase C (PKC)–dependent DAT ubiquitination to markedly elevate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of DAT, which is accompanied by DAT movement out of plasma membrane protrusions with a negative curvature. Disruption of the outward-open (OO) DAT conformation or its stabilization in the inward-open (IO) conformation recapitulates substrate effects on DAT endocytosis. Amphetamine strongly increases PKC-dependent endocytosis of norepinephrine transporter (NET) but not of serotonin transporter (SERT), correlating with a substantially weaker ubiquitination of SERT compared to NET. We propose a “shape-transition” model whereby shifting from convex-shaped OO conformers to IO conformers minimizes retention of transporters in negatively curved membranes, which facilitates their PKC-dependent ubiquitination and recruitment to positively invaginated clathrin-coated membranes, driving robust transporter endocytosis.",

With hundreds of well-recorded events, we verify that PmP is observable and develop a technique to identify and pick P-PmP differential times with high confidence.

The distinguished aspects of this method include the exceptional stability of the dearomatized products and impressive versatility of the recovered substrates in the construction of enantioenriched helical frameworks.

We report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young’s modulus (30 kilopascals) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20 to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies.

Systematic interrogation of the five E protein binding elements (EPE1–5) in the Tcf7 enhancer region showed lineage-specific utilization. Specifically, loss-of-function analysis revealed that only EPE3 plays a critical role in supporting αβ T cell development, while EPE1, 3, and 5 regulate the γδ T cell maturation and functional cell fate decision. The importance of EPE3 in supporting both lineages may stem from its unique capacity to interact with the Tcf7 transcriptional start site.

Here, we identify an essential regulator of Drosophila thoracic flight muscle development, the Hox TF Antennapedia (Antp). Correcting a long-standing belief that flight muscle development occurs without the input of Hox TFs, we show that Antp intervenes at several stages of flight muscle development, from the establishment of the progenitor pool in the embryo to myoblast differentiation in the early pupa. Furthermore, the precisely regulated clearance of Hox in the developing flight muscle fibers is required to allow for fibrillar muscle fate diversification, setting these muscles apart from all other adult tubular muscle types.",

Despite profound implications for the Arctic climate system and marine ecosystems, the primary drivers of this process remain debated. One hypothesis suggested that alternating phases of the atmospheric Arctic Dipole may have mitigated recent atlantification. Here, we use high-resolution model simulations to disentangle the main contributors to atlantification in the Arctic basin. We show that the decline in Arctic sea ice was the dominant driver, while wind variability associated with the Arctic Dipole played a minor role, contributing slightly rather than mitigating the process. The positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation also made a relatively small contribution. Although recent changes in atmospheric circulation over the Greenland Sea tended to reduce warm water inflow through the Fram Strait, this cooling effect on the Arctic Atlantic Water layer was outweighed by the warming induced by sea ice decline.",

          "abstract": "Molecular alterations in cancerous tissues exhibit intercellular genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, complicating the performance of diagnostic assays, particularly for early cancer detection. Conventional liquid biopsy methods have limited sensitivity and/or ability to assess epigenetic heterogeneity of rare epiallelic variants cost-effectively. We report an approach, named REM-DREAMing (Ratiometric-Encoded Multiplex Discrimination of Rare EpiAlleles by Melt), which leverages a digital microfluidic platform that incorporates a ratiometric fluorescence multiplex detection scheme and precise digital high-resolution melt analysis to enable low-cost, parallelized analysis of heterogeneous methylation patterns on a molecule-by-molecule basis for the detection of cancer in liquid biopsies. We applied the platform to simultaneously assess intermolecular epigenetic heterogeneity in five methylation biomarkers for improved, blood-based screening for early-stage non–small cell lung cancer. In a cohort of 48 low-volume liquid biopsy specimens from patients with indeterminant pulmonary nodules, we show that assessment of intermolecular methylation density distributions can notably improve the performance of multigene methylation biomarker panels for the early detection of cancer.",

However, low immunogenicity, caused by inefficient mRNA expression and weak immune stimulation, hampers the efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Here, we present an mRNA compartmentalization–based cancer vaccine, comprising a multimodule DNA nanostructure (MMDNS)–assembled compartment for efficient mRNA translation via in situ localizing mRNA concentration and relevant reaction molecules. The MMDNS is constructed via programmable DNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR)–based strategy, with integrating antigen-coded mRNA, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), acidic-responsive DNA sequence, and dendritic cells targeting aptamer. MMDNS undergoes in situ assembly in acidic lysosomes to form a micro-sized aggregate, inducing an enhanced CpG ODN adjuvant efficacy. Subsequently, the aggregates escape into cytoplasm, providing a moderate compartment which supports the efficient translation of spatially proximal mRNA transcripts via localizing relevant reaction molecules. The mRNA compartmentalization–based vaccine boosts a strong immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, offering a robust strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

In particular, the dynamical process by which quantum noise, varying in strength from 0 to critical levels, affects and destroys quantum advantage has not been well understood. Meanwhile, correlation generation serves as a precious theoretical model for information processing tasks, where quantum advantage can be precisely quantified. In this study, we show that this model provides valuable insights into the understanding of this dynamical process. We prove that, as the strength of quantum noise continuously increases from 0, the quantum advantage diminishes gradually and eventually vanishes. Unexpectedly, in some cases, we observe the phenomenon of a sudden death of quantum advantage: When the noise strength exceeds a certain threshold, the quantum advantage abruptly disappears from a substantial level. This phenomenon, once again, reveals the tremendous impact of noise on quantum information processing tasks.",

We compiled a database of seawater MeSH concentrations, identified their statistical predictors, and produced monthly fields of global marine MeSH emissions adding to DMS emissions. Implemented into a global chemistry-climate model, MeSH emissions increase the sulfate aerosol burden by 30 to 70% over the Southern Ocean and enhance the aerosol cooling effect while depleting atmospheric oxidants and increasing DMS lifetime and transport. Accounting for MeSH emissions reduces the radiative bias of current climate models in this climatically relevant region.",

It remains little understood about how proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1α/tumor necrosis factor–α/C1q (ITC), often elevated in neurodegenerative diseases, alter astrocyte-secreted signals and their effects in disease pathogenesis. By selectively isolating astrocyte exosomes (A-Exo.) and employing cell type–specific exosome reporter mice, our current study showed that ITC cytokines significantly reduced A-Exo. secretion and decreased spreading of focally labeled A-Exo. in diseased SOD1G93A mice. Our results also found that A-Exo. were minimally associated with misfolded SOD1 and elicited no toxicity to mouse spinal and human iPSC–derived motor neurons. In contrast, A-Exo. were neuroprotective against excitotoxicity, which was completely diminished by ITC cytokines and partially abolished by SOD1G93A expression. Subsequent proteomic characterization of A-Exo. and genetic analysis identified that surface expression of glial-specific HepaCAM preferentially mediates A-Exo’s axon protection effect. Together, our study defines a cytokine-induced loss-of-function mechanism of A-Exo. in protecting neurons from excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

By controlling the deprotonation rate of 2-Ph 2 PC 6 H 4 PH 2 and adjusting the templates, we successfully synthesized two near-infrared emissive nanoclusters, Ag30 and Ag32 , which have analogous icosidodecahedral Ag 30 shells with an I h symmetry. Deprotonated ligand (2-Ph 2 P α C 6 H 4 P β 2− ) exhibits a coordination mode of μ 5 -η 1 (P β ),η 2 (P α ,P β ), which endows a unique metallic aromaticity to Ag30 and Ag32 . The solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes based on Ag30 achieve an external quantum efficiency of 15.1%, representing the breakthrough in application of silver nanoclusters to near-infrared–emitting devices.

We find a bidirectional response to vegetation’s influence on SSY in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau and Tien Shan and identify that the two interacting factors of precipitation and vegetation cover explain 54% of the variability in SSY, reflecting the divergent roles of vegetation in promoting biogenic-weathering versus slope stabilization across bioclimatic zones.

The circumventricular organs (CVOs) are important brain sites to perceive peripheral inflammatory signals, but few studies have reported their role in inflammation-induced anxiety or depression. Using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced inflammation, we identified a previously unreported role of the subfornical organ (SFO), one of the CVOs, in combating inflammation-induced anxiety. LPS treatment induced anxiety-like and sickness behaviors in mice. Although both the SFO and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (a CVO) neurons were activated after LPS treatment, only manipulating SFO neurons modulated LPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Activating or inhibiting SFO neurons alleviated or aggravated LPS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, SFO exerted this effect through glutamatergic projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Manipulating SFO neurons did not affect LPS-induced sickness behaviors. Thus, we uncovered an active role of SFO neurons in counteracting peripheral inflammation-induced anxiety.",

JNJ-A07 blocked DENV-2 transmission by the mosquitoes in both pre-exposure and post-exposure settings. In addition, JNJ-A07 remained in the mosquito bodies for 7 days after blood meal.

The self-organization process of tumor cells is facilitated by a vortex acoustic field, which enables the cell bioassembly and ion channel activation. This approach can significantly enhance the influx of calcium ions, thereby accelerating intercellular interactions of cellular assemblies. We established scaffold-free melanoma and breast cancer organoids using AV-Scaf and cocultured melanoma organoids with T cells. We found that our coculture system resulted in a high activation state of T cells, characterized by notable up-regulation of granzyme B (2.82 to 17.5%) and interferon-γ (1.36 to 16%).

Tumor cells infiltrating PTB from TC behave more like oligodendrocyte progenitor cells than astrocytes at the transcriptome level. Dual-omics analyses further suggest that the distal regulatory regions in the tumor genome and specific transcription factors are potential determinants of regional heterogeneity. Notably, while activator protein 1 (AP-1) is active in all GBM states, its activity declines from TC to PTB, with another transcription factor, BACH1, showing the opposite trend.

Here, we propose a high-order direct modulation terahertz communication framework using a wideband time-coding metachip modulator. The modulator leverages the electromagnetic resonance properties within the metaunit structure, with control enabled by gallium arsenide Schottky diodes. By manipulating the timing of voltage pulses applied to these diodes, the equivalent electromagnetic resonance distributions can be precisely regulated in the time domain. This enables independent and accurate control over the amplitude and phase of terahertz harmonics. Leveraging this technique, three high-order modulation schemes—quadrature phase-shift keying, 16-phase-shift keying, and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation— are achieved in a direct modulation and direct detection system, demonstrating the real-time image transmission.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA repair dysregulation in cancer cells is crucial for cancer development and therapies. Here, we report that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) directly methylates poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an essential enzyme involved in DNA repair, and regulates its activity. Functionally, EZH2-catalyzed methylation represses PARP1 catalytic activity, down-regulates the recruitment of x-ray repair cross-complementing group-1 to DNA lesions and its associated DNA damage repair; on the other hand, it protects the cells from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide overconsumption upon DNA damage formation. Meanwhile, EZH2-mediated methylation regulates PARP1 transcriptional and oncogenic activity, at least in part, through impairing PARP1-E2F1 interaction and E2F1 transcription factor activity. EZH2 and PARP1 inhibitors synergistically suppress prostate cancer growth. Collectively, our findings uncover an insight of EZH2 functions in fine-tuning PARP1 activity during DNA damage repair and cancer progression, which provides a rationale for combinational targeting EZH2 and PARP1 in cancer.",

          "abstract": "Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) aerogel mats were irradiated with carbon ions to explore the effect of irradiation-induced sp 3 bonds and sp 2 bond defects on ultrahigh strain rate mechanical properties. Energy dissipation was measured using a microprojectile impact test. Specific penetration energy E p * increased strongly with irradiation with a maximum E p * of ~26 megajoules per kilogram, over 200% higher than the previous best energy-absorbing material of pristine MWNT mats and at least an order of magnitude higher than any other material tested at the microscale. Perforation morphologies observed by electron microscopy show that a much larger network region is deformed due to sp 3 bond enhanced load sharing within and between tubes, while defects introduced by the radiation induce more bond, shell, and tube damage leading to strongly enhanced energy dissipation.",

          "authors": "Axana Dalle, Louis Lippens, Stijn Baert",
          "abstract": "As age discrimination hampers the OECD’s ambition to extend the working population, an efficient anti-discrimination policy targeted at the right employers is critical. Therefore, the context in which age discrimination is most prevalent must be identified. In this study, we thoroughly review the current theoretical arguments and empirical findings regarding moderators of age discrimination in different demand-side domains (i.e. decision-maker, vacancy, occupation, organization and sector). Our review demonstrates that the current literature is highly fragmented and often lacks field-experimental evidence, raising concerns about its internal and external validity. To address this gap, we conducted a correspondence experiment and systematically linked the resulting data to external data sources. In so doing, we were able to study the priorly determined demand-side moderators within a single multi-level analysis and simultaneously control multiple correlations between potential moderators and discrimination estimates. Having done so, we found no empirical support for any of these moderators.",

          "authors": "Jordan Rosenblum, Lane Kenworthy, Mikael Nygård",
          "abstract": "We explore the link between the distribution of power and income inequality in rich capitalist democracies since 1960. We advance understanding of the impact of government ideology, a key indicator of the distribution of power, in two ways. First, previous research has tended to focus on government ideology at the country level. We make use of party manifesto data to introduce a novel global ideology measure that captures a global shift rightward since 1980, often referred to as the rise of neoliberalism. Second, for country-level party ideology, we use party manifesto data to capture changes over time. We find that this time-varying operationalization of party ideology is more strongly linked to income inequality than the standard expert-survey operationalization that assumes party ideology remains constant. In line with theoretical expectations derived from prior research, our findings show that a more rightward distribution of power at both the country and the global level is associated with increased income inequality within countries.",
