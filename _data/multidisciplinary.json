          "abstract": "Nonlinear optics 1 plays a central role in many photonic technologies, both classical 2–5 and quantum 6–8 . However, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is typically determined during design and fixed during fabrication 9 , restricting the use of nonlinear optics to scenarios in which this inflexibility is tolerable. Here we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of χ (2) nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced χ (2) (refs. 10–16 ), and the programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrate spectral, spatial and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching grating structures 1 in two dimensions. The programmability of the device makes it possible to perform inverse design of grating structures in situ, as well as real-time feedback to compensate for fluctuations in operating and environmental conditions. Our work shows that we can break from the conventional one-device–one-function paradigm, potentially expanding the applications of nonlinear optics to situations in which fast device reconfigurability is desirable—such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources 7,17–19 , all-optical signal processing 20 , optical computation 21 and adaptive structured light for sensing 22–24 .",

          "abstract": "As we age, many tissues become colonized by microscopic clones carrying somatic driver mutations 1–7 . Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited due to the challenge of detecting mutations in small clones. Here we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq) 8 , a duplex sequencing method with an error rate lower than five errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted capture. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity simultaneously profiles large numbers of clones, providing accurate mutation rates, signatures and driver frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 blood samples from a twin cohort, we report an extremely rich selection landscape, with 46 genes under positive selection in oral epithelium, more than 62,000 driver mutations and evidence of negative selection in essential genes. High-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites are obtained for many genes: a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition or selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing provides a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.",

          "abstract": "Mutations that occur in the cell lineages of sperm or eggs can be transmitted to offspring. In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders 1–3 . Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq 4 to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq 5 of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways. Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.",

          "abstract": "Men are at higher risk of several cancer types than women 1 . For bladder cancer the risk is four times higher for reasons that are not clear 2 . Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer 3 . As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10 , CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo—natural saturation mutagenesis—that can be extended to other human tissues.",

          "abstract": "Even with the rapid development of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy conversion from fossil or synthetic fuels remains a challenge because, for example, combustion engines in long-range aircraft will still be needed in the upcoming decades 1 . Increasing their operating temperatures (1,050–1,150 °C (refs. 2–4 )) is one option. This requires replacing single-crystalline Ni-based superalloys in the hottest sections of turbines by refractory-element-based materials, which exhibit much higher solidus temperatures beyond 2,000 °C (refs. 5–7 ). Here we introduce a single-phase Cr-36.1Mo-3Si (at.%) alloy that meets, for the first time, to our knowledge, the most important critical requirements for refractory-element-based materials: (1) relevant resistance against pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at elevated temperatures, minimum up to 1,100 °C, and (2) sufficient compression ductility at room temperature. Although strength and creep resistance in such alloys were already superior to Ni-based superalloys in several cases, oxidation/corrosion resistance, mandatory to withstand the combustion atmosphere, and ductility/toughness, needed for damage tolerance and device setting, still pose barriers for the development or application of refractory-element-based candidate materials. Any previous successful attempts to address the otherwise catastrophic oxidation of Mo and nitridation of Cr during oxidation suffered from a loss in ductility at ambient temperatures.",

          "authors": "Soumyadip Mondal, Huyen T. K. Nguyen, Robert Hauschild, Stefan A. Freunberger",
          "abstract": "Oxygen redox chemistry is central to life 1 and many human-made technologies, such as in energy storage 2–4 . The large energy gain from oxygen redox reactions is often connected with the occurrence of harmful reactive oxygen species 3,5,6 . Key species are superoxide and the highly reactive singlet oxygen 3–7 , which may evolve from superoxide. However, the factors determining the formation of singlet oxygen, rather than the relatively unreactive triplet oxygen, are unknown. Here we report that the release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. We found that as the driving force for the reaction increases, the initially dominant evolution of triplet oxygen slows down, and singlet oxygen evolution becomes predominant with higher maximum kinetics. This behaviour also applies to the widely observed superoxide disproportionation, in which one superoxide is oxidized by another, in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems, with Lewis and Brønsted acidity controlling the driving forces. Singlet oxygen yields governed by these conditions are relevant, for example, in batteries or cellular organelles in which superoxide forms. Our findings suggest ways to understand and control spin states and kinetics in oxygen redox chemistry, with implications for fields, including life sciences, pure chemistry and energy storage.",

          "abstract": "The ancient South Pole–Aitken impact basin provides a key data point for our understanding of the evolution of the Moon, as it formed during the earliest pre-Nectarian epoch of lunar history 1 , excavated more deeply than any other known impact basin 2,3 and is found on the lunar far side, about which less is known than the well-explored near side. Here we show that the tapering of the basin outline and the more gradual topographic and crustal thickness transition towards the south support a southward impact trajectory, opposite of that commonly assumed. A broad thorium-rich and iron-rich ejecta deposit southwest of the basin is consistent with partial excavation of late-stage magma ocean liquids. These observations indicate that thorium-rich magma ocean liquids persisted only beneath the southwestern half of the basin at the time of impact, matching predictions for the transition from a global magma ocean to a local enrichment of potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in the near-side Procellarum KREEP Terrane. These results have important implications for the upcoming human exploration of the lunar south pole by Artemis, as proposed landing sites are now recognized to sit on the downrange rim and thorium-rich impact ejecta of the basin.",

However, making these data efficiently and accurately full-text searchable remains challenging. Here we build on efficient data structures and algorithms for representing large sequence sets 1–6 . We present MetaGraph, a methodological framework that enables us to scalably index large sets of DNA, RNA or protein sequences using annotated de Bruijn graphs. Integrating data from seven public sources 7–13 , we make 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino acid residues across all clades of life—including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, animals and humans—full-text searchable. We demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective full-text search in large sequence repositories (67 petabase pairs (Pbp) of raw sequence) at an on-demand cost of around US$100 for small queries up to 1 megabase pairs (Mbp) and down to US$0.74 per queried Mbp for large queries. We show that the highly compressed representation of all public biological sequences could fit on a few consumer hard drives (total cost of around US$2,500), making it cost-effective to use and readily transportable for further analysis. We explore several practical use cases to mine existing archives for interesting associations, demonstrating the use of our indexes for integrative analyses, and illustrating that such capabilities are poised to catalyse advancements in biomedical research.",

          "authors": "Hampton Gaddy, Rebecca Sear, Laura Fortunato",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.",

          "abstract": "Air pollution is a major global health threat, with exposure exhibiting substantial heterogeneity across and within regions. While disparities in air pollution exposure by income groups are well documented, how these inequalities translate into differential burdens of pollution-attributable premature mortality remains understudied. We utilize high-resolution estimates of secondary air pollutants, combined with income data, to investigate the relationship between global air pollution–attributable mortality and poverty across urban–rural contexts and air pollutants. We show that high-income countries face higher air pollution–attributable mortality owing to population aging, in contrast to the established exposure inequality pattern. While affluent populations within most countries also face higher mortality burdens, in several low-income countries, this pattern is reversed due to elevated exposures among impoverished rural populations. South Asia and Africa exhibit the highest levels of vulnerability to coincident mortality and poverty, where populations living in periurban transition zones bear disproportionate dual burdens. In many low-income countries, those living near wealthier urban centers also face elevated health burdens from air pollution: a “cost of opportunity” when air pollutant regulations are weak. Our findings emphasize the imperative for tailored policy interventions to mitigate amplified health risks in vulnerable communities.",

          "abstract": "Public trust in democratic institutions has dropped to historic lows, prompting electorates in major democracies to turn to “amateur” politicians with the expectation that these political outsiders will cut through stalemates to deliver policy results. Amateurs are often seen as pragmatic “doers,” but also uncompromising, a combination at odds with governing systems where legislative progress depends on cross-party coalitions. Using the US Congress as a critical case, we evaluate these competing expectations by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million bill (co)sponsorship records. We find that electing amateurs intensifies partisan divisions: Districts that send amateurs to Congress yield representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their bills and less often support other-party legislation. Our results suggest that amateurs are unlikely to deliver on their promise for pragmatic governance, as they resist or undervalue the compromises essential to lawmaking.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, like in other countries, the agrifood supply chain faces challenges from a growing population and less predictable weather conditions. Extreme weather events such as droughts decrease agricultural yield and harvested areas, impact the domestic trade of agricultural products and, in turn, food manufacturing. We investigate this relationship at the state level by estimating the food manufacturing production function in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation process. We first assess how drought affects trade in animals and fish, cereal grains, and all other crop products. Next, we estimate a nested production function for processed food. Our findings indicate that the impact of a drought is far from being confined to the area where it happens. At the national level, we find that a 1% increase in drought in the states producing agricultural commodities reduces their exports to other states by 0.5% to 0.7% which, in turn, reduces food manufacturing production by an average of 0.04%. The capacity to shift the origin of import flows, adjust their volume, and substitute agricultural inputs supports the resilience of the food manufacturing sector. We further estimate the 48 × 48 pairwise dependence across states and by commodity group. While cereal grain production is more spatially concentrated than other crops, the agrifood supply chain can enhance its resilience by sourcing from geographically diverse counties within key supplier states and improving multistate coordination. These findings provide important insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders willing to reduce the food system vulnerability to extreme weather events.",

          "authors": "Pablo J. Ordóñez, Protensia Hadunka, Gemma Del Rossi, Kathy Baylis",
          "abstract": "As climate change makes agricultural production shocks more frequent and severe, it is vital to understand their effect on farmer welfare, land use, and deforestation. Theoretically, a change in agricultural productivity could increase or decrease deforestation by changing demand for agricultural land and/or through the consumption of forests as a coping strategy. This paper uses the introduction of a crop pest to sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the effect of a negative agricultural productivity shock on deforestation. Using primary household data, we first find that farmers who were exposed to higher levels of fall armyworm saw substantial decreases in yield and food security. Using estimates of fall armyworm suitability in conjunction with machine-learning models of maize yields and deforestation, we find that the introduction of the fall armyworm induced a doubling of the deforestation rate in Zambia in the 3 y following the outbreak. This increase was driven both by increased agricultural land expansion and increased charcoal production as a coping strategy. These responses vary substantially over space. More remote areas experienced 23% lower FAW-induced deforestation compared with the sample average, suggesting that farmers with access to maize and charcoal markets may have increased deforestation as a response. Wealthier areas were also less likely to deforest in response to FAW pressure. In sum, our results suggest that negative agricultural productivity shocks may lead to a negative climate feedback, with farmers engaging in emissions-increasing strategies in response.",

          "abstract": "Structural and social inequalities are determinants of poor human development outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. In a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design study, we examined associations of affirmative action in local governments for a historically marginalized group in India with health and education outcomes, using administrative health data, primary data in schools, and interviews. Exposure was 60 village clusters with, and nonexposure was 60 village clusters without, local leadership reserved for scheduled caste (SC) in 2021 local elections. Primary outcomes were infant mortality rate (IMR) and student test scores. Secondary outcomes were prenatal visits, mother tetanus vaccinations, prenatal supplement, infant vaccination, and teacher engagement in schools. Groups did not differ on socioeconomic, geographic, and service delivery indicators in 2020 (baseline). In 2023, 2.5 y after elections, exposure village clusters had lower IMR (0.46 IRR; [0.30 to 0.69]; P &lt; 0.001), and exposure village clusters had significantly higher odds of two prenatal visits, two tetanus vaccinations, and prenatal supplement received by the second trimester. Exposure was not associated with maternal care in the first trimester or infant vaccination. Exposure was not associated with test scores, but teacher engagement was lower in exposure village clusters. Exposure group leaders reported higher discrimination than nonexposure group, and in follow-up interviews, they described more difficulty in working with teachers. Affirmative action in local governments in India predicted greater infant survival and improved prenatal health services, indicating benefits of addressing structural inequities. Lack of benefits for education outcomes might reflect social inequity of discrimination experienced by SC leaders.",

          "abstract": "Multispecies sensory networks, where different species prioritize different sensory modalities and then use heterospecific information in a likely noncooperative fashion, may allow animals to improve foraging over large areas for cryptic prey. We test this hypothesis in procellariiform seabirds that forage in mixed flocks, where both prey odors and visual cues provided by other foraging hetero- and conspecifics might improve success rates. Using agent-based models, we explored the impact of social strategies on olfactory foraging for Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ). Our results suggest that social foraging enables species with different sensory adaptations to achieve similar success rates. Additionally, our results indicate that foraging is more successful in mixed-species rather than single-species flocks, where individuals can monitor the activity of other birds that are using different sensory foraging strategies than themselves to find prey. These results suggest that sensory-based foraging networks may be more critical to their survival than previously assumed. Finally, we show that success rates decrease at low population densities. As seabird populations continue to decline, understanding and preserving these social foraging networks may be essential for their conservation and ecological success. Overall, our study provides insights into the critical role of multispecies sensory networks to foraging success, wherein different species have different sensory adaptations for locating prey. While we used empirical anatomical and behavioral data specific to procellariiforms to inform our models, our approach and results may have broader implications for other species as well.",

          "abstract": "Europe is a heatwave hotspot: numerous temperature records have been broken in recent summers, and roughly 60,000 and 50,000 heat-related deaths occurred in the summers of 2022 and 2023, respectively. With recent summers, like that of 2022, projected to become the new norm, there is a pressing need to further develop heat-health warning systems to help society adapt to a warming climate. Here, we forecast heat-related mortality by applying a statistical epidemiological framework to temperature forecasts extending up to 2 wk in advance. Focusing on two recent and exceptional summers in Europe, namely 2022 and 2023, we evaluate the skill of the daily heat-related mortality forecasts, and assess its association with temperature. For most of Europe, milder temperatures, close to the minimum mortality temperature, are associated with more skillful heat-related mortality forecasts. However, some of the hottest regions in Europe instead showed enhanced forecast skill associated with higher temperatures. This suggests that heat-related mortality forecasts can provide valuable information in European regions associated with high levels of heat-related mortality. Consequently, we advocate for local health authorities to include information from forecasts of heat-related mortality in their heat warning systems.",

Noninvasive strategies for monitoring these enzymes could be important for studying basic biology of cholinergic systems and disorders that affect their function. To address this goal, we developed an imaging probe that allows activity of ChE to be detected using MRI. The probe, called ChERT, undergoes enzymatic processing that reduces its solubility, promoting accumulation near sites of cholinesterase activity. Following wide-field brain delivery, ChERT produces MRI contrast changes in brain regions known to be enriched in cholinesterases; these are suppressed in the presence of a selective enzymatic inhibitor, confirming their specificity. After abdominal delivery, ChERT labels regions of the gut where ChE expression is expected. In both the brain and periphery, colocalization of ChERT with ChE could be confirmed and visualized at higher resolution by fluorescence microscopy, owing to optical properties of the probe architecture. The ChERT agent thus provides a potentially versatile basis for assessment of cholinergic phenotypes throughout the body.",

The model, dubbed strongly constrained and appropriately normed-machine learning (SCAN-ML), reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semiempirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the ab initio study of reactive crystallization pathways in biominerals, which are currently poorly understood.",

We demonstrate through bio-chemo-mechanical modeling that this emergent behavior arises from a nonmonotonic dependence on nonlinear extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics: mechanical communication between cells is optimized at intermediate stiffness values where cells can both generate sufficient forces and create strain-stiffened tension bands in the ECM. This balance establishes a critical cell spacing threshold for cell–cell communication ( ∼ 100 to 200 μ m) that is conserved across experimental observations for a broad range of cell types and collagen densities. Our model reveals that the critical stretch ratio at which fibrous networks transition from compliant to strain-stiffening governs this threshold through the formation of tension bands between neighboring cells. These mechanical communication networks drive collective phase transition in tissue condensation when cell density exceeds an effective percolation threshold. Our model explains how microscale cell–ECM interactions control emergent mechanical properties in biological systems and offers insight both into the physics of inhomogeneous materials under active stress, and into potential mechanical interventions for wound healing and fibrotic disorders.",

          "abstract": "Neurons process information by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs along their dendrites. Understanding the computational principles underlying neuronal information processing requires a reliable measure of synaptic conductance dynamics that accurately represents the input sources before signal integration and processing. Prevailing approaches to measuring synaptic conductances typically employ a voltage clamp at the soma of a neuron and assume the neuron as an isopotential point when processing electrical signals. However, owing to the presence of the well-known space clamp effect, the measurement of synaptic conductances through these methods often leads to significant errors, impeding the elucidation of dendritic signal features and subsequent signal integration processes. To address this issue, here we first develop a two-step clamp method at the soma that separately recovers the mean and time constant information of local synaptic conductance on the dendrite with high accuracy when a neuron receives a single synaptic input. Furthermore, under in vivo conditions of multiple synaptic inputs, we propose an intercept method to extract effective net excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from measurements of synaptic currents at the soma. Both methods are grounded in mathematical perturbation analyses of a conductance-based passive cable model and are validated across multiple biologically detailed multicompartment neuron models with active channels, including Purkinje neuron, pyramidal neuron, and fast-spiking interneuron. Results demonstrate that our methods effectively circumvent the space clamp effect, offering reliable means to assess the role of measured conductances and synaptic activity in neuronal information processing.",

          "abstract": "Glycosylation is among the most common molecular modifications in living organisms, one that affects the function of myriad macromolecules: mostly proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides of various kinds but also a few specific noncoding RNAs that undergo glycosylation at an internal site. Here we expand the glycome by showing that protein-coding transcripts can also be glycosylated, but in the form of a 5′-terminal glucose cap. These caps are present on up to 30 to 40% of the 5′ ends of U-initiated mRNAs in Escherichia coli , a remarkably high level of noncanonical capping that requires no transcript or promoter characteristic other than a 5′-terminal U. By contrast, no N -acetylglucosamine caps are evident. Due to their resistance to enzymatic removal, glucose caps can greatly prolong the cellular lifetime of mRNA by impeding its degradation via a 5′-end-dependent mechanism. The prevalence and protective impact of glucose caps set them apart from other bacterial RNA caps. This epitranscriptomic modification has the potential to selectively increase the synthesis of bacterial proteins encoded by U-initiated transcripts, especially after transcription is downregulated.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen cycles in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have historically been studied in the context of exogenous ammonium/nitrate availability and uptake. Recently, crystalline guanine has been identified, using Raman microscopy, in the cytoplasm of numerous microalgae, including C. reinhardtii . The signal level is influenced by availability of exogenous nitrogen, suggesting that the deposits serve as a nitrogen store. We report the visualization of these guanine crystals in C. reinhardtii and other microalgae using quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy. They prove to reside within cytoplasmic vacuoles: A membrane with a high density of small intramembranous particles surrounds a uniform, coarsely granular interior matrix within which stacks of flat crystals assemble, often in stunning abundance. We designate these as guanine storage vacuoles (GSVs). In C. reinhardtii and other members of the Chlamydomonadales, a discrete disc-shaped granular domain occupies the center of each GSV, and the crystals arise within or at the edges of this domain, suggesting that it represents an amorphous form of guanine. In C. reinhardtii , GSVs are numerous in log-phase cells, are not found in cells maintained in nitrogen-free medium, and reappear within 8 h after the cells are provided with nitrogen, initially as small disc-containing vacuoles. We compare this cycle with that of the polyphosphate granules localized in acidocalcisomes. Nineteen enzyme families and 10 transporters are predicted to participate in guanine-related pathways in C. reinhardtii , many showing strong upregulation with nitrogen starvation. These understandings will inform future studies on the contributions made by GSVs to the metabolism and physiology of eukaryotic microalga.",

It enforces spatial distance constraints between atomic nuclei and auxiliary mesh points placed on a spherical surface around each atom, approximating van der Waals boundaries to reduce atomic collisions. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces collision rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design.

Their numbers are believed to be in decline due to numerous anthropogenic threats; however, their conservation is hindered by numerous knowledge gaps. In particular, the dearth of genetic data, unique among all big cat species, hinders a full understanding of their population structure, historical population size, and current levels of genetic diversity. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing data for 41 snow leopards (37 newly sequenced) to offer insights into these unresolved aspects of snow leopard biology. Among our samples, we find evidence of a primary genetic divide between the northern and southern part of the range around the Dzungarian Basin—as previously identified using landscape models and fecal microsatellite markers—and a secondary divide south of Kyrgyzstan around the Taklamakan Desert. Most noteworthy, we find that snow leopards have the lowest genetic diversity of any big cat species, likely due to a persistently small population size throughout their evolutionary history rather than recent inbreeding. We also find that snow leopards have significantly less highly deleterious homozygous load compared to numerous Panthera species, suggesting effective purging during their evolutionary history at small population sizes. Without a large population size or ample standing genetic variation to help buffer them from any forthcoming anthropogenic challenges, snow leopard persistence may be more tenuous than currently appreciated.",

The observed dissolution anisotropy is readily explained by this mechanism, which was further supported by density functional tight-binding simulations of detachment activation energies.

Here, we present an approach for visualizing the anisotropic distribution of lanthanide 4f electrons in pyrochlore oxides by combining high-photon-energy X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis based on the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method. The observed VED distributions around the lanthanide site reveal the parameters of the ground-state wavefunction, which roughly agree with point-charge calculations for the trigonal crystal electric field under the LS coupling scheme.

However, we find that even if the agent updates its belief via, arguably objective, Bayesian inference, fitting the above model demonstrates both the biases. This finding seems particularly surprising, as Bayesian inference, when written as an effective Q -learning algorithm, is described by unbiased (and temporally decreasing) learning rates. In this article, we explain the reasons behind this observation, by studying the stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using Master equations. In particular, we show that both confirmation bias and unbiased but temporally decreasing learning rates have the same behavioral signature: decreased action switching probabilities, as compared to temporally constant and unbiased learning rates. Our analysis underscores the need for modeling temporally varying learning rates in subjects before any claims can be made about their choices being biased.",

Herein, genetically encoded biosensors targeted to the plasma membrane and early endosomes were used to analyze compartmentalized signaling of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2 ); the propensity of nanoparticles (NPs) to accumulate in endosomes was leveraged to preferentially antagonize intracellular PAR 2 signaling of pain. PAR 2 agonists evoked sustained activation of PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 in early endosomes and activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytosol and nucleus, measured with targeted biosensors. Fluorescent dendrimer and core-shell polymeric NPs accumulated in endosomes of HEK293T cells, colonic epithelial cells, and nociceptors, detected by confocal microscopy. NPs efficiently encapsulated and slowly released AZ3451, a negative allosteric PAR 2 modulator. NP-encapsulated AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, rapidly and completely reversed PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 activation in early endosomes and ERK activation in the cytosol and nucleus. When administered into the mouse colon lumen, fluorescent dendrimer NPs accumulated in endosomes of colonocytes and polymeric NPs accumulated in neurons, sites of PAR 2 expression. Both NP formulations of AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, caused long-lasting analgesia and normalized aberrant behavior in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. These results provide evidence that PAR 2 endosomal signaling mediates pain and that nanomedicines that antagonize PAR 2 in endosomes effectively relieve pain.

To date, the relative contribution of each developmental mechanism to the origins of neoteny remain unclear. We examined this question in the plant genus, Acacia Mill., which contains species that undergo the juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition (vegetative phase change) early in shoot development, as well as species that remain permanently juvenile, or have delayed vegetative phase change. Mapping the timing of vegetative phase change onto a molecular phylogeny of Acacia revealed that permanent juvenility has evolved multiple times and is sometimes associated with a delay in vegetative phase change in related species. In three cases, the absence or delay in vegetative phase change was associated with either higher amounts or a delayed decline in the level of miR156, the master regulator of vegetative phase change in plants. These findings support the hypothesis that neoteny in Acacia has evolved not by a loss in the capacity to produce the adult leaf phenotype but by a change in the timing of genes that promote juvenile leaf identity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding complex living systems requires identifying universal phenomenological laws that are independent of species and molecular-biological details. The Monod equation is a cornerstone of phenomenological microbial growth laws, depicting the growth rate as a saturating function of a single substrate. Because of its similarity in functional form to the Michaelis–Menten equation, cellular growth is often thought to be limited by a single reaction. However, cellular growth generically results from the coordination of thousands of metabolic reactions and diverse intracellular limited resources. Consequently, the mechanistic origins of the Monod equation remain controversial, and its extension has encountered limitations. Here, we propose the global constraint principle for cellular growth: As one nutrient becomes more available, other intracellular resources become limiting, driving transitions to distinct modes of resource allocation. Based on a general framework of constraint-based modeling and its dual formulations, we mathematically prove that, in general, microbial growth kinetics curves are monotonically increasing and concave with respect to nutrient availability. Numerical simulations using genome-scale Escherichia coli models with proteome allocation, molecular crowding, and membrane capacity constraints reproduce these features in a multiphasic manner. In contrast to the original Monod’s growth law, the global constraint principle also captures the dependence of microbial growth on the availability of multiple nutrients, by generalizing the Liebig’s law of the minimum, another phenomenological growth law for higher organisms, into a terraced landscape of diminishing returns. It thus integrates the classical phenomenological laws proposed by Monod and Liebig into a comprehensive theory of cellular growth.",

By contrast, many biological and environmental settings—ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet—feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner “core” that coexists with a more dilute, highly motile surrounding “shell.” By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use biophysical theory and simulations to quantitatively describe this interplay. Our work thus sheds light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations in confined environments, with implications for understanding ecological niches and engineering artificial systems.",

Lightweight kernel or decision tree-based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized convolutional many-body distribution functionals (cMBDF) as highly compute and data-efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atomic densities weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on predefined grids. In the generalized form, each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo–lumo gaps, heat capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures, and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9, and VQM24 datasets. Due to its compactness, model training and testing times are reduced from 23 h to 8 min, implying a corresponding reduction in carbon footprint.",

Exosomes contain a diverse range of cargo such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules but whether these contents have a biological function remains an area of intense investigation. Over the last decade, numerous studies have described the transcriptome of exosomes but very little is known about the RNA content of the MVBs, the source compartment for exosome biogenesis. Here, we determine the small-RNA transcriptome of highly purified MVBs and report that various classes of nuclear small regulatory RNAs such as small-Cajal body associated RNAs, small-nucleolar RNAs, and small-nuclear RNAs traffic to MVBs. We show that this RNA-trafficking requires the function of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery but is independent of canonical LC3 lipidation mediated selective autophagy. Furthermore, blocking the activity of a PI3K Class 3 enzyme, VPS34, required for recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to the endosome, prevents the turnover of these nuclear RNAs in MVBs. Our results provide a mechanism for targeting nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, such as Cajal bodies, for degradation and turnover by the cytoplasmic endo-lysosomal pathway.",

          "abstract": "Chimeric RNA formation represents a critical mechanism for expanding protein functional diversity, yet its role in invertebrate immune adaptation remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that two C-type lectin genes ( MnLec2 and MnLec3 ) from distinct genomic loci in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense undergo positionally flexible chimeric RNA formation via alternative trans-splicing and transcriptional slippage, generating 11 structurally diverse chimeric isoforms ( MnLec1 , MnLec4–13 ) with bidirectional exon joining. Crucially, pathogen challenges reprogram chimeric RNA frequencies to shift immune equilibrium, universally suppressing detrimental MnLec9 while promoting protective MnLec7 formation. Functional dissection confirms dual-action pathogen suppression, recombinant MnLec7 (rMnLec7) suppresses white spot syndrome virus replication by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and RNAi effectors, while accelerating Vibrio parahaemolyticus clearance and improving survival. Conversely, suppression of MnLec9 removes its immunosuppressive activity, synergistically enhancing host defense. This coordinated isoform rebalancing enables effective pathogen clearance. Thus, positional flexibility in chimeric RNA formation generates antagonistic isoforms that maintain immune homeostasis and deploy targeted defense upon infection, revealing an adaptive transcriptional strategy in arthropods.",

During that journey, the protein may visit shallow basins corresponding to metastable structures, potentially of biological importance. Structural characterization of transiently populated metastable states is challenging due to their low population, which limits traditional NMR, and also makes crystallization for X-ray diffraction difficult without stabilizing mutations, covalent modifications, or the addition of antibodies. Here, we report the structural characterization of the on-pathway folding intermediate of a pressure-sensitized ubiquitin mutant. The obtained non-native β-sheet registry was previously shown to be necessary in the PINK1 mitophagy pathway. We used fast pressure jumps to repeatedly initiate folding and advanced NMR measurements to probe the evolving ensemble of protein conformations. The results reported here demonstrate that the non-native β-sheet hydrogen bond registry can act as a metastable trap during protein folding. This work provides a template for future investigation of metastable conformations and protein folding with rich structural detail.",

Using estimates of the phylogenetic origin of each Drosophila melanogaster Sfp gene, based on genomic resources that include outgroup species to the Drosophila genus, we examined the functional attributes and evolutionary characteristics of 357 Sfp genes relative to their evolutionary age. Contrary to the perception that many Sfp genes are evolutionarily young, 62% existed in the genome of the ancestor to this genus. These ancient genes have broader expression profiles, more expansive biological roles, and have more interactions with non-Sfp genes. This increased pleiotropy has imposed constraints on the rate of sequence evolution in ancient Sfp genes compared to younger ones. Notably, these younger Sfp genes evolve substantially faster as a result of both adaptive and nonadaptive evolutionary forces. Within the Sfp interactome, we identified a fast-evolving core subnetwork of younger genes with more restricted tissue expression and functions. Our systematic approach has uncovered a large set of ancient Sfp genes with distinct genomic, functional, and evolutionary characteristics compared to the younger, more commonly studied Sfp genes. With increased refined genomic and functional data acquisition across a wider variety of taxa, our approach and results serve as proof of the importance of systemic strategies applied to broadly defined gene sets based on their time of evolutionary origination.",

          "abstract": "Activating the adra2a receptors of the brain’s norepinephrine (NE) system produces NREM-like sleep and hypothermia. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α2 receptor ( adra2a ) agonist, is an important drug used in intensive care for arousable sedation. But for some patients, even slight decreases in body temperature during sedation could pose health risks such as increasing the likelihood of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Where are the adra2a receptors at which DEX acts to induce hypothermia? A popular theory is that inhibitory adra2a receptors expressed on norepinephrinergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are DEX’s prime targets. To examine this, we genetically lesioned galanin ( gal )-expressing norepinephrinergic LC neurons in adult mice. In these ΔLC mice, baseline sleep–wake levels were unchanged, but surprisingly, core body temperatures were lower. Maintaining body temperature depended on NE/ gal projections from the LC to the medial preoptic (MPO) hypothalamus. Furthermore, without these LC neurons, DEX induced hypothermia more strongly. Knockdown with adra2a shRNA revealed that DEX induces hypothermia via adra2a receptors on MPO glutamate cells. When ΔLC mice were kept warm, DEX could induce the same amount of NREM-like sleep as well as it did for mice with an intact LC, and this sleep-like state in ΔLC mice had a higher delta frequency power than in control mice. Our results emphasize that inhibition of the LC by DEX is not required to induce robust sedation. By contrast, the LC likely has a fortuitous background action in protecting against drug-induced hypothermia and speeds recovery from hypothermia.",

Murine (Mm)Mx1 induced an abnormal nuclear accumulation of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) at late time points postinfection. This block was observed to a lower extent with human (Hs)MX1; however, HsMX1 strongly impacted cytoplasmic trafficking of de novo synthesized viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Indeed, live imaging experiments revealed a transient association of HsMX1 with Rab11a-associated vRNPs, which induced their clustering and their dynein-dependent retrograde transport toward the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). There, vRNPs remained sequestrated together with cellular cofactors YBX1 and Rab11a in large clusters, while MX1 dissociated from them. Dynein inhibition prevented the vRNP clustering and sequestration and significantly rescued infectious IAV production in the presence of HsMX1. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of IAV vRNPs being rerouted and accumulated away from the plasma membrane through the coordinated action of HsMX1 restriction factor, dynein, and the microtubule network.",

          "abstract": "How sleep maintains our healthy brain function has remained one of the biggest mysteries in neuroscience, medical settings, and daily lives. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during sleep has been implicated in metabolic waste reduction in animals, how CSF dynamics are driven in the healthy human brain during deep sleep remains elusive. A myriad of research has shown that crucial cognitive processing manifests in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting that a key to maintaining brain functions lies in deep sleep. By leveraging a simultaneous sparse-functional MRI and polysomnography method, we demonstrate that deep sleep–specific CSF dynamics are associated with spontaneous brain oscillations in healthy young human participants. Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep are tightly linked to short-cycle, frequent, and moderate CSF fluctuations. In contrast, slow waves during light sleep and arousals produce slow, infrequent, and steep CSF signal changes. Rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during REM sleep are also linked to CSF signal changes. Furthermore, CSF signals are significantly faster in frequency during deep than light sleep. These brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruit essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep involving memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of facilitating CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here, we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting null signal template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius 1.5 R ⊕ , a period of 384 d, and KOI 2194.03 with radius 1.8 R ⊕ and a period of 445 d, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.",

While the formation of ampullate and eggcase silks has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanism underlying the self-assembly of the aciniform spidroin, AcSp1, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered linkers of AcSp1 play a critical role in driving spidroin assembly through liquid–liquid phase separation in solution. The N-terminal domain (NTD) exhibits pH-independent dimerization over a physiological pH range (5.0 to 7.0) and undergoes concentration-dependent tetramerization. Quaternary structure of AcSp1-NTD shows a hierarchical assembly process mediated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which enhances phase separation in both salt-free and salt-containing solutions. Finally, inspired by this mechanistic insight, we developed a fully aqueous spinning method to fabricate artificial aciniform fibers with excellent extensibility and toughness. These findings uncover a pivotal molecular strategy that transforms our understanding of diverse molecular mechanisms governing spidroin assembly and establish a foundation for designing and manufacturing elastic and tough silk-based biomaterials.",

In addition, we elucidate how these nonlinear pathways structure the persistence or dissolution of cities.

Microbial habitat and decomposition functions were among the last to respond to aridity, with thresholds occurring under more arid conditions compared to plant productivity and soil fertility. Combining metagenomic sequencing with physiological assays to characterize microbial life history strategies of high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A), and stress tolerance (S), we introduce a microbial trait-based framework to mechanistically link community-level microbial life history strategies to EMF. Our results reveal that microbial Y-strategy is positively correlated with EMF across aridity gradients, A-strategy exhibits a negative association with EMF across aridity gradients, and S-strategy is negatively correlated with EMF in arid ecosystems. Collectively, this study offers empirical evidence and insights into how aridification interacts with soil microbiomes in shaping EMF, highlighting the pivotal role of microbial life history strategies in understanding the mechanisms behind EMF variation in an increasingly arid world.",

It then covers widely used generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models, and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before and that generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry.

It greatly contributes to natural carbon sinks by enhancing atmospheric CO 2 sequestration/mineralization in mineral ion-rich aqueous systems, which is demonstrated by freezing the solutions of Ca(OH) 2 , binary NaCl–CaCl 2 solutions, and artificial seawater. The acceleration is caused by the impacts of freezing on nucleation and growth processes of CaCO 3 crystals. Freezing accelerates nucleation by concentrating reactants within ice crystal boundaries, increasing supersaturation, and thus lowering the nucleation energy barrier. At the post–thaw stage where nuclei already form and reactant concentration is decreased, the crystals undergo the barrier-free growth process. Our findings reveal the freezing-enhanced CO 2 sequestration that is omitted in the current global carbon budget models and signal an urgent need to integrate cryogenic mineralization into climate predictions.",

          "abstract": "When bacteria form a biofilm, complex behaviors emerge. Biofilm bacteria differ from their free-living counterparts, exhibiting heterogenous, spatiotemporally patterned behavior. Can we explain these patterns by defining the rules that govern single-cell behavior in biofilms? By understanding these rules, can we explain emergent functions at the biofilm scale? Here we reveal how the architecture of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the biofilm matrix is controlled by single-cell lysis during Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development. We extend single-cell imaging methods to capture complete biofilm development over 5+ d, characterizing the stages of biofilm development and visualizing eDNA matrix morphogenesis from start to finish. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of single-cell lysis events shows that cell lysis is spatiotemporally patterned, concentrated in a region 5 µm below the biofilm surface that moves with the biofilm as it grows. Using analytical modeling, we examined the consequences of patterning at the biofilm scale. Cell lysis patterning defines eDNA in the matrix: Patterned lysis is sufficient to explain the final eDNA distribution. Cell lysis and biofilm growth are coupled such that the amount of eDNA in the biofilm scales with its volume; this patterning results in a predominantly uniform eDNA matrix architecture, which could not occur without patterning. Finally, we find that patterning of cell lysis is self-organized by nutrient gradients, with maximal lysis occurring in regions where oxygen is present and carbon is limited. The ability of cells to use self-generated nutrient gradients as positioning cues to establish depth-based patterning is a striking feature of bacterial biofilm development.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the computational principles of the brain and translating them into neuromorphic hardware and modern deep learning architectures is critical for advancing neuro-inspired AI (NeuroAI). Here, we develop an experimentally constrained, biophysically realistic model of neocortical microcircuits in the mouse primary visual cortex (layers 2 to 3) to examine how four major interneuron classes—Parvalbumin, Somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and LAMP5—interact within a competitive–cooperative motif to implement soft winner-take-all (sWTA) circuit dynamics. In a conductance-based network grounded in in vitro physiology, we show that this circuit motif selectively amplifies strong inputs while suppressing, without silencing, weaker ones, enabling gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a gain-matching strategy, we mapped the motif onto IBM’s TrueNorth neuromorphic chip, revealing a principled correspondence between cell-type-specific roles and hardware primitives. Sparse coupling of sWTA modules generated persistent up-states and a two-state neural machine approximating working memory. We then embedded the sWTA circuit as a preprocessing filter in a Vision Transformer, which significantly enhanced out-of-distribution generalization across diverse tasks, including zero-shot digit classification, cross-domain transfer between digit datasets, and nighttime semantic segmentation.

          "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is a dynamic ecosystem where bacteria engage in interspecies competition using molecular weapons such as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Here, we characterize BteO–BtiO, a unique effector–immunity pair in Bacteroides fragilis that mediates antagonism via a nonenzymatic mechanism. Microscopy reveals that BteO exposure leads to cell elongation, membrane blebbing, and lysis in sensitive strains. Structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that BteO disrupts cell wall homeostasis by binding to conserved C-terminal domains of OmpA-family proteins (OmpAs), which are critical for outer membrane integrity. The immunity protein BtiO neutralizes BteO by mimicking the OmpA-binding interface. We further show that bile salts enhance BteO-mediated killing in vitro and that BteO confers a competitive advantage in the mammalian gut. Remarkably, BteO exhibits broad-spectrum activity across Bacteroides species. These findings reveal a nonenzymatic strategy of bacterial antagonism and broaden our understanding of T6SS effector diversity within Bacteroides .",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen (H 2 ) is a promising energy carrier for decarbonization. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of the H 2 supply and its adoption across various demand sectors in the US remains unclear. Here, we couple prospective life cycle assessment with a process-based integrated assessment model to evaluate the GHG mitigation of H 2 from supply and demand perspectives. Our results show the critical role of H 2 production mix in determining supply-side GHG mitigation potential. Without national carbon pricing or large-scale electrolysis in the near future, biomass-based H 2 (Bio-H 2 ) emerges as a critical transitional clean H 2 production technology. Bio-H 2 reduces the life cycle GHG emission intensity of the H 2 supply mix by 1.8 to 5.5 kg CO 2 kg −1 H 2 , resulting in a national reduction of 606 to 1,706 Mt CO 2 e from 2025 to 2050. This represents 1.6 to 2 times greater mitigation potential compared to scenarios without Bio-H 2 . On the demand side, we identify a misalignment: industrial sectors with high mitigation intensity (e.g., iron and steel, 147 Mt CO 2 e EJ −1 ) receive limited H 2 deployment (0.8 EJ), while the transportation sector accounts for 75% of H 2 use (e.g., passenger and light-duty vehicles, 10 EJ) despite their lower mitigation intensities (54 Mt CO 2 e EJ −1 ). While economy-wide climate policies (e.g., carbon prices) could direct more industrial H 2 usages, implementing these policies is challenging; sector-specific strategies can be more practical. Our results highlight the importance of near-term support for Bio-H 2 and sector-specific demand strategies to enhance the climate effectiveness of US H 2 deployment.",

          "abstract": "Autophagy is a crucial intracellular pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It involves forming double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which deliver cytosolic cargoes to the lysosomes/vacuoles for degradation. Biogenesis of autophagosomes is a membrane-intensive process wherein the membrane expansion steps are poorly understood. The tethering complex, exocyst, canonically implicated in secretion, also participates in autophagosome biogenesis in yeast, plants, and mammals. However, the contribution of the exocyst complex in autophagosome biogenesis is unclear. In this study, using yeast temperature-sensitive mutants of the exocyst, we observed the accumulation of multiple abortive PAS incapable of autophagosome biogenesis. These dysfunctional abortive structures were enriched with core autophagy proteins involved in initiation and membrane expansion. However, the membrane expansion ability required for cargo capture was severely compromised in these mutants. Further investigations, including a comprehensive epistasis analysis, revealed that the exocyst plays a role downstream of the Atg1 complex. However, it was required at a stage before phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K complex I), Atg2–Atg18, and Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complexes. Taken together, we show that productive PAS formation and membrane expansion during autophagosome biogenesis are exquisitely orchestrated by the autophagy-specific exocyst subcomplex, which excludes Exo70.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthetic organisms rely on sophisticated photoprotective mechanisms to prevent oxidative damage under high or fluctuating solar illumination. Cyanobacteria, which have evolved a unique, water-soluble light-harvesting complex—the phycobilisome—achieve photoprotection through a photoactivatable quencher called the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Phycobilisomes are highly symmetric and modular, formed by hierarchical assembly of conserved subunits into diverse geometries ranging from simple bundles to elaborate fan- or bouquet-like macromolecular architectures. Although OCP is known to provide photoprotection across species of cyanobacteria with different phycobilisome structures, it is not known whether or how these structural variations relate to changes in the photoprotective function of OCP. For example, OCP was recently discovered to bind as a dimer at two specific instances of an abundant structural motif on the tricylindrical phycobilisome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, yet these sites are sterically inaccessible on a more common pentacylindrical phycobilisome ( Anabaena sp. PCC 7120). To understand how structural modularity and binding specificity contribute to conservation of OCP binding sites and function across different phycobilisome architectures, here we compare experimentally measured photophysical states accessible to these prototypical tricylindrical and pentacylindrical phycobilisomes, with and without OCP, at the single-molecule level. Together with Monte Carlo simulations of exciton transfer in OCP-quenched phycobilisomes, our results suggest that OCP binds at distinct and specific sites in each type of phycobilisome, yet provides nearly identical quenching strength to both phycobilisomes. Our findings highlight the utility of modular phycobilisome structures in balancing robust conservation of photoprotective function with adaptability of site-specific binding across species.",

          "abstract": "The early olfactory system is canonically described by a “one-receptor-to-one-neuron” model: each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses a single type of olfactory receptor (OR). Although the olfactory systems of many model organisms approximately follow this canonical organization, a number of exceptions are known. In particular, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes coexpress multiple types of ORs in many OSNs. Why do some olfactory systems follow the canonical organization while others violate it? We approach this question from the normative perspective of efficient coding. We find that the canonical and noncanonical organizations optimally encode odor signals in different types of olfactory environment. Noncanonical olfaction is beneficial when relevant sources emit correlated odorants and the environment contains odorants from ethologically irrelevant odor sources. Our theory explains previous observations of receptor coexpression and provides a framework from which to understand the structure of early olfactory systems.",

          "abstract": "During origin licensing, the origin recognition complex (ORC) loads two Mcm2-7 helicases onto DNA in a head-to-head conformation, establishing the foundation for subsequent bidirectional replication. Single-molecule experiments support a helicase-loading model in which one ORC loads both Mcm2-7 helicases at origins. For this to occur, ORC must release from its initial Mcm2-7 and DNA binding sites, flip over the helicase, and bind the opposite end of the Mcm2-7 complex and adjacent DNA to form the MO complex. Importantly, this binding-site transition occurs without ORC releasing into solution. Using a single-molecule FRET assay, we show that the N-terminal half of Orc6 tethers ORC to the N-terminal region of Mcm2 during ORC’s binding-site transition. This interaction involves both the folded Orc6 N-terminal domain (Orc6N) and the adjacent unstructured linker and forms before ORC releases from its initial Mcm2-7 interaction. The absence of this interaction increases the rate of ORC release into solution, consistent with a tethering function. CDK phosphorylation of ORC inhibits the tethering interaction, providing a mechanism for the known CDK inhibition of MO complex formation. Interestingly, we identify mutations in the Orc6 linker region that support MO complex formation but prevent double-hexamer formation by inhibiting stable second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Our study provides a molecular explanation for a one-ORC mechanism of helicase loading and demonstrates that Orc6 is involved in multiple stages of origin licensing.",

          "abstract": "Like many viruses, HIV relies on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton for successful infection. MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT functions and thus bear the potential to modulate viral infection. However, while several MAPs are known to exert proviral effects on HIV, little is known about antiviral ones. We previously described the Tripartite motif protein 69 (Trim69) as an innate immune factor that remodels MTs, leading to inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV. Through in silico modeling, TIRF microscopy, and cell-based assays, we determine that Trim69 binding to MTs is determined by a basic surface in its SPRY domain that interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulins. This surface is conserved among mammalian Trim69s and is critical for its functions. We demonstrate that by binding and remodeling MTs, Trim69 inhibits the docking and the migration of virion cores on MTs by promoting the stalling of the dynein/dynactin motor complexes. Altogether, these findings shed light on a mechanism of viral defense that involves an innate immune regulation of the MT cytoskeleton.",

          "abstract": "Development requires the coordinated action of many genes across space and time, yet numerous species can develop discrete, alternate phenotypes. Such complex balanced polymorphisms are often controlled by supergenes: multiple tightly linked loci that function together to control development of a complex phenotype. Supergenes are widespread in nature. However, the evolution and functions of supergene alleles remain obscure because the identities of the functional loci, and the causative variation between them, remain essentially unknown. The doublesex supergene controls mimicry polymorphism in the swallowtail butterflies Papilio polytes and Papilio alphenor. Alternate alleles cause development of discrete mimetic or nonmimetic wing patterns. We found that the mimetic allele evolved by gaining six new cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and an inversion that locked those CREs together with dsx and the novel noncoding gene U3X . At least four of these new CREs are essential for dsx expression and mimetic pattern development. Genome-wide assays of DSX binding suggest that dsx controls mimetic pattern development by directly regulating the expression of both itself and a handful of unlinked genes. The dsx supergene thus contains multiple functional genetic elements, each required for the phenotype switch and linked together by an inversion, and likely exerts its effects on color pattern development through direct regulation of unlinked “modifier” genes. Our results therefore support classic theories of supergene evolution, but update those ideas to match what we have learned about gene regulation since their development over a half century ago.",

          "abstract": "As experiments advance to record from tens of thousands of neurons, statistical physics provides a framework for understanding how collective activity emerges from networks of fine-scale correlations. While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information—providing a better description of the population—than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.",

In the rodent brain, the prefrontal cortex is limited to this earlier agranular stage and is often referred to as the “medial prefrontal cortex.” The primate mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical for the monitoring of information in working memory, including the monitoring of the precise serial order of flexible randomly varying sequences of stimuli. Thus, a fundamental question arises: what are the functional limits of serial order processing in the rodent brain which, anatomically, possesses only the earlier stage in the evolution of the prefrontal cortex? The present study examined the ability of normal rats to monitor the serial order of sequences of spatial stimuli (locations). The normal rodent brain can code accurately the order of directional left-to-right or right-to-left sequences of locations. However, the serial order of nondirectional randomly varying sequences can be processed only to a limited extent: when performance relies considerably on the salient memory of the most recent stimulus to code an approximate order of the earlier stimuli within working memory. Thus, the development of the granular prefrontal cortex in the primate brain provides an additional higher level of executive control permitting precise coding of the order of stimuli in working memory that is essential to manipulate information to plan action.",

          "abstract": "Tumor genomic profiling has uncovered many cancer drivers whose implications in terms of tumor biology and therapeutic actionability remain understudied. Hotspot mutations in SF3B1 induce widespread transcriptomic alterations and occur across multiple cancer types. Despite this, the biological and clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutations remain elusive. Characterization of the largest SF3B1 mutant breast cancer clinical cohort to date identifies SF3B1 driver mutations in approximately 2.5% of HR+ HER2- breast cancer, with strong enrichment of K700E substitutions, substantial variation in variant allele fraction (VAF), and significantly improved overall survival due to enrichment in Luminal A disease. In vitro and in vivo studies in representative cell models suggest several of the most prevalent SF3B1 mutations have deleterious effects on cell growth, leading to selective loss of the mutation over time, providing a rationale for the low frequency and low VAF of SF3B1 mutations in breast cancer. Though all introduced hotspot mutations limit growth and are reverted to wildtype (WT) over time, mutations at position R625 have a more pronounced phenotype than K700E, providing an explanation for the clinically observed skew in mutation frequencies. RNA and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify characteristic pathway-level transcriptomic changes in SF3B1 -mutant cells and identify copy number alterations as a mechanism of both improved mutation tolerability and a means to eliminate the mutation over time. These data suggest that while SF3B1 mutations are enriched in some clinical contexts, their role in breast tumorigenesis is highly complex and dependent on secondary events that overcome their deleterious effects on cell growth and survival.",

In humans, defective radial spokes can cause a genetic disorder known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), resulting in respiratory defects and infertility. Despite their critical role in ciliary motility, the molecular composition and related physiological functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify EF-hand calcium-binding domain protein 10 (EFCAB10) and adenylate kinase (AK8) as radial spoke proteins and describe their roles in mouse motile cilia. Using Efcab10 −/− and Ak8 −/− mice, we show that loss of either protein can affect ciliary motility and lead to PCD-related phenotypes in mice. Interestingly, ciliary AK8 is completely absent in Efcab10 −/− cilia, but the loss of AK8 has no effect on ciliary EFCAB10. Further biochemical analyses reveal that EFCAB10 interacts with AK8 and RSPH3B, which fastens AK8 to the radial spoke. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of EFCAB10 as a radial spoke protein in maintaining the integrity of the radial spoke and provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of related ciliopathies.",

          "abstract": "Tumor-targeted T cell therapies of various types have been booming, but T cell therapy is limited by its inability to penetrate the collagen barrier surrounding tumors. The destruction of tumor collagen is significant because collagen both suppresses T cells and contributes to the formation of the extracellular matrix. Our previously reported cell-surface vimentin (CSV)–targeted and membrane-anchored interleukin 12-armed (attIL12) T cells can reduce collagen production by killing cancer-associated fibroblasts, but fail to reduce collagen expression by tumor cells, resulting in resistance to attIL12-T cell treatment. In this study, we found that CCKAR directly boosts collagen production by tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. attIL12-modified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) disabled collagen production by CCKAR-high autologous tumor cells in vitro and sarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in vivo. This disruption of collagen production by tumor cells by attIL12-TILs overcomes resistance to attIL12-T cell treatment and required a simultaneous interaction between the CSV on autologous tumor cells, which is targeted by attIL12, and human leukocyte antigen-T cell receptor on attIL12-TILs; When either interaction was abrogated, collagen production and CCKAR expression were not shut down. Mechanistically, the interaction between attIL12-TILs and autologous tumor cells induced interferon gamma production synergistically, which in combination with CCKAR downregulation reduced collagen expression through suppression of both transforminggrowth factor beta-stimulated SMAD activation and CCKAR-AKT signaling. Diminishing collagen expression from tumor cells significantly increased T cell infiltration and improved tumor growth inhibition in PDX sarcomas.

          "abstract": "Oceanic islands are hotspots of both species extinctions and introductions, which led to marked changes in species composition. This may disrupt key ecological interactions, such as animal-mediated seed dispersal, with potential long-term impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. While some recent studies on individual taxa and islands report functional shifts, there has been no globally comprehensive study of how these changes vary in intensity and direction across islands. Importantly, it remains unclear how changes in traits of animal communities actually translate to ecologically relevant mismatches with native plant species. We report widespread functional remodeling of frugivore communities based on frugivory-specific traits of all native, extinct, and introduced vertebrate frugivores (birds, mammals, reptiles) from 120 islands in 22 archipelagos. There is a trend for taxonomic and functional substitution, mainly of nonvolant terrestrial mammalian omnivores replacing large-gaped flying frugivores, which caused a mismatch between gape size and seed size. This shift in seed dispersal potential risks underestimation in single-taxon studies. Overall, vertebrate introductions outnumbered extinctions both in terms of species (44 vs. 23%) and islands affected (92 vs. 76%). Moreover, introductions have driven stronger shifts in frugivore trait space compared to extinctions. However, the general patterns are modulated by substantial spatial variation and idiosyncratic functional shifts within frugivore communities on some islands. This, coupled with differences in plant seed size distributions, leads to variability in realized functional mismatches among islands. These results emphasize challenges with predicting functional responses to anthropogenic activities, while highlighting that remodeling of ecosystem interactions is a global concern.",

          "abstract": "Self-organization of individual organisms at a very small scale may result in recognizable functional ecosystem structures at a larger spatial scale. Drylands, which cover almost half of emerged lands, host some of the most remarkable vegetation patterns on Earth, including “disordered hyperuniformity,” a recently defined class of such emergent self-organization structures. Yet, the extent, causes, and consequences of disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns in drylands remain virtually unknown. Here, we analyzed high-resolution remote sensing images of 425 spot-like drylands across the globe and found that disordered hyperuniformity shapes vegetation patterns in about one out of ten drylands, with the distribution of plants appearing to be “disordered” to the naked eye, but supporting highly recognizable (uniform) patterns at larger scales ( ca. 50 to 500 m). Using mathematical models, we identify three potential mechanisms that can generate disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns. These mechanisms are not limited to the well-studied Turing patterns and represent key general processes with respect to plant–plant or plant–sediment interactions. Further modeling indicates that disordered hyperuniformity enhances ecosystem functioning in terms of water retention use, and expands the range of aridity conditions under which the system can maintain itself, but may slow recovery of vegetation structure from disturbances. In a wider context, we also show that disordered hyperuniformity is likely to pertain to diverse dryland systems, such as termite-mound or fairy-circle landscapes. Our findings highlight that exploring disordered hyperuniformity of vegetation pattern of drylands (and potentially other large-scale systems) offers insights into the organization and resilience of ecosystems globally.",

          "abstract": "The retina, located outside the cranium, serves as an ideal structure for investigating information processing within the central nervous system due to its well-organized neurovascular unit comprising diverse cell types, including neurons, glial cells (such as microglia, Müller glia, and astrocytes), pericytes, and vascular endothelial cells. Disrupted retinal homeostasis contributes to various ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa. However, noninvasive in vivo imaging methods to study the pathogenesis of these disorders remain limited. Here, we developed a two-photon microscopy technique for real-time, transpupillary in vivo visualization of the retinal neurovascular unit in mice. Our approach integrates systematic head fixation, a custom-made polymethyl methacrylate contact lens, and a glycerin immersion objective lens with an extended working distance and a higher numerical aperture, specifically designed for two-photon microscopy. This method enabled us to visualize dynamic microglial process activity around retinal blood vessels. Our results revealed that retinal microglia exhibit enhanced surveillance under diabetic conditions, which is undetectable by static confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist commonly used for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, reversed the enhanced microglial behaviors in the diabetic retina. Our simple yet effective approach mitigates the need for advanced optical systems like adaptive optics, providing an effective tool for real-time imaging of the retina. This method offers a valuable resource for visual neuroscience research and holds great potential for clinical applications, particularly in the early diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of retinal diseases.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates mediate diverse and essential cellular functions by compartmentalizing biochemical pathways. Many condensates have internal subdomains with distinct compositional identities. A major challenge lies in dissecting the multicomponent logic that relates biomolecular features to emergent condensate organization. Nuclear paraspeckles are paradigmatic examples of multidomain condensates, comprising core and shell layers with distinct compositions that are scaffolded by the lncRNA NEAT1, which spans both layers. A prevailing model of paraspeckle assembly proposes that core proteins bind directly and specifically to core-associated NEAT1 domains. Combining informatics and biochemistry, we unexpectedly find that the essential core proteins FUS and NONO bind and condense preferentially with shell-associated NEAT1 domains. The shell protein TDP-43 exhibits similar NEAT1 domain preferences on its own but forms surfactant-like shell layers around core protein-driven condensates when both are present. Together, experiments and physics-based simulations suggest that competitive RNA binding and immiscibility between core and shell proteins order paraspeckle layers. More generally, we propose that subcondensate organization can spontaneously arise from a balance of collaborative and competitive protein binding to the same domains of a lncRNA.",

However, the intracellular signaling networks that temporally coordinate these inputs to reinforce Th1 lineage commitment remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify protein kinase A (PKA) as a time-gated regulator of IL-12 responsiveness and Th1 differentiation. Using a conditional knockout mouse model that deletes both catalytic PKA subunits in CD4 + T cells, we show that PKA is dispensable for early T cell activation but is essential for the late-phase induction of IL-12 receptor β2 ( Il12rb2 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT4). PKA-deficient CD4 + T cells fail to differentiate into Th1 cells in vitro and cannot induce Th1-mediated colitis in vivo. Instead, they adopt a Th2-skewed phenotype and drive eosinophilic lung inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, prolonged TCR stimulation induces the expression of the peptide hormone Adrenomedullin and its receptor component Ramp3, which activate PKA and its downstream effector cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Activated CREB drives Il12rb2 and Stat4 transcription, establishing a feedforward circuit that integrates signal duration with cytokine responsiveness. In the absence of PKA, this transcriptional program fails to initiate, leading to impaired IL-12 signaling and a loss of Th1 identity. These findings define a PKA–CREB signaling module that links sustained antigen stimulation to transcriptional and epigenetic commitment in CD4 + T cells, offering a mechanistic explanation for the temporal gating of Th1 differentiation and the prevention of Th2-driven tissue pathology.",

A recent two-state model proposed for high-pressure potassium, which exhibits a similar melting anomaly, attributes this behavior to changes in the distribution of non-nuclear localized electrons (electrides), resulting in distinct liquid phases. To test this hypothesis for sodium, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine its atomic dynamics and electronic properties under high pressure. Our results reveal no discontinuities in atomic or electronic transport properties, nor any evidence of multiple inherent structural forms. Furthermore, the electronic screening potential governing liquid structure remains largely unchanged above 50 GPa. Instead, we find that the key parameter responsible for the melting anomaly arises from differences in the average number of electrons per non-nuclear maximum, which affects the relative packing densities of the liquid and solid phases.",

Goblet cell activity significantly influences mucosal infection outcomes; increased mucus secretion effectively blocks viral entry, while its reduction facilitates viral dissemination. Notably, PEDV activates acetylcholine-cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 signaling in submucosal enteric neurons to induce goblet cell-associated antigen passages. This mechanism enables the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the lamina propria in early infection, even when the epithelial barrier remains intact, triggering inflammation and exacerbating mucosal damage.

However, numerous recent theoretical works have predicted the existence of a disorder-driven non-Anderson phase transition that differs from Anderson localization. The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. These observations provide direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition occurring in real quantum systems, a finding long anticipated by theoretical physicists.",

Equivariant neural nets leverage ideas from group representation theory and express all variables in the generalized Fourier space corresponding to the underlying group. In this article, we review this formalism and derive the general form of operations allowable in equivariant neural networks.

Monitoring real-time soil conditions and tree physiological responses, we observed consistent impacts on soil biogeochemistry aligned with belowground drivers of tree mortality, but no consistent responses in aboveground vegetation immediately following flooding.

Methanogenesis inhibitors such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) decrease methane emissions in ruminants when supplemented in feed. Yet we lack a system-wide, species-resolved understanding of how the rumen microbiota remodels following inhibition and how this influences animal production. Here, we conducted a large-scale trial with 51 dairy calves to analyze microbiota responses to 3-NOP, pairing host performance, emissions, and nutritional profiles with genome-resolved metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. 3-NOP supplementation decreased methane emissions by 62%, modulated short-chain fatty acid and H 2 levels, and did not affect dietary intake or animal performance. We created a rumen microbial genome catalogue (27,884 genomes) that mapped to the meta-omic data at high rates. There was a strong reduction of methanogens and stimulation of reductive acetogens, primarily uncultivated lineages such as “ Candidatus Faecousia.” However, there was a shift in major fermentative communities away from acetate production in response to hydrogen gas accumulation. In vitro incubations recapitulated these results and showed an enrichment of acetate from reductive acetogenesis. Altogether, the divergent responses of the fermentative and hydrogenotrophic communities lead to net hydrogen build-up and limit potential productivity gains from methane reduction. By linking ruminant greenhouse gas emissions and productivity to specific microbial species, this study emphasizes the importance of microbiota-wide analysis for optimizing methane mitigation strategies and identifies promising strategies to simultaneously reduce emissions while increasing animal production.",

The classical generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system’s linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system’s score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system’s characteristics: i) a clustering-based algorithm (K-means Gaussian Mixture Modeling) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier–Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system’s response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.",

One attractive control strategy would be based on the understanding of the virulence mechanisms of BPH at the molecular level and then designing targeted methods to neutralize such mechanisms. Salivary proteins of BPH are important players in mediating rice–BPH interactions. Here, we describe a pivotal role of a watery saliva protein, Nilaparvata lugens Annexin-like5 ( Nl ANX5), in the rice–BPH interaction. RNA interference (RNAi) of NlANX5 greatly compromised BPH feeding performance and survival rate on rice plants. NlANX5 -RNAi BPH triggered a rapid calcium ion influx in rice cells. The feeding and survival defects of NlANX5 -RNAi BPH can be restored in NlANX5 -expressing transgenic rice plants. Nl ANX5 targets rice annexin ( Os ANN) proteins, including Os ANN2 and Os ANN8. Further analysis with Nl ANX5 and Os ANN2 as well as Os ANN8 showed that Nl ANX5 displaces Os ANN2 and Os ANN8 from the rice cell membrane. The osann2 osann8 mutant rice plants are hypersusceptible to BPH infestation. In contrast, enhanced expression of OsANN2 and OsANN8 genes resulted in robust rice resistance against BPH. This study highlights a successful example of identifying and augmenting the expression of the host targets of a major BPH virulence effector as a promising antivirulence strategy against an important crop pest.",

The obstacles that prevented their use as H 2 oxidation catalysts in fuel cells are being removed one by one, thanks to the continuous discovery of hydrogenases that have unexpected catalytic properties, the development of new methods for their scalable production and matrices that protect them. Obtaining an efficient biohybrid electrode that is scalable and robust under a large range of experimental conditions is still challenging. The FeFe hydrogenase of Clostridium beijerinckii is a very active catalyst of H 2 evolution and can be handled under O 2 , and its production can potentially be scaled up. However, it was believed that it cannot be used for H 2 oxidation, as it is easily oxidized to an O 2 -stable but inactive state. Here, we show that when the enzyme is embedded into a redox-active film whose reduction potential is finely tuned to the equilibrium potential of the H + /H 2 couple, the potential that the enzyme experiences can be buffered in a sharp window that is actually compatible with enzyme-catalyzed H 2 oxidation and prevents anaerobic inactivation. This leads us to provide the demonstration of an FeFe hydrogenase-based system that can be used for H 2 oxidation and that can be repeatedly exposed to O 2 during and between operational cycles.",

          "abstract": "Cutting onions often leads to tear-inducing aerosol release, yet the underlying mechanics remain poorly understood. In this work, via high-speed characterizations, we show that droplet formation occurs via a two-stage process: an initial high-speed outburst followed by slower ligament fragmentation. By systematically varying blade sharpness and speed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the number and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping reveals that the onion’s tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying mesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture. Developing a simplified bilayer model, we experimentally and theoretically capture the mechanism behind, with numerical calculations of the onion critical fracture forces matching independent Instron results. The work highlights the importance of blade sharpening routines to limiting ejected droplets infected with pathogens in the kitchen, which pack additional outburst energy due to vegetables’ outer strong casings.",

Here, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans larvae reared at high density develop into adults that exhibit exploratory behavior in the associative-learning paradigm known as thermotaxis. While animals grown at low density prefer the temperature previously associated with food, those exposed to high density during larval stages instead disperse from this temperature. The high-density experience alters the neural representation of thermal valence, a process that requires a gap junction network spanning multiple neural circuit layers. This network connects density-sensing neurons to the circuit that processes temperature information. Furthermore, these gap junction components also control the decision to enter developmental diapause in response to high density. Our results suggest that the multilayered gap junction network enables early social experience to influence adult behavior and is essential for developmental and behavioral plasticity in social contexts.",

Classically, biomarkers are measurable indicators of the state of biological processes. Given the large number of molecules in modern datasets, a major challenge is identifying the best biomarkers for a particular setting. Here, we apply observability theory to establish a general methodology for biomarker selection. We demonstrate that observability identifies biologically meaningful sensors in a range of time series transcriptomics data. To address unique biological constraints, we introduce the method of dynamic sensor selection to maximize observability over time, thus enabling observability over regimes where system dynamics themselves are subject to change. Our observability-guided biomarker discovery framework extends to multiple data modalities, as demonstrated with the joint use of transcriptomics and chromosome conformation data. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by evaluating the observability of neural activity measured in movies and electroencephalograms. These applications highlight the broad utility of observability-guided biomarker selection, spanning agriculture, biomanufacturing, and neural systems.",

Mechanistically, the picorna-like virus triggers the ISR through transcriptional suppression of ppp1r15 , a key regulator of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) dephosphorylation. ISR activation subsequently induces the autophagy-lysosomal pathway by up-regulating Atg1 transcription in an ATF4-dependent manner. This process leads to selective degradation of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and other core components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby suppressing the host RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and enhancing viral replication.

Such condensates, also called membraneless organelles, are increasingly observed in cells and serve as transient hubs for spatial organization and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Along with the transiency of formation and dissolution, their ability to sequester molecules has inspired us to develop BCs as potential vehicles to transport and deliver molecular cargo. We recently reported the design of disulfide bond cross-linked phase-separating peptide (PSP) condensates that spontaneously dissolve in reducing conditions. Based on the premise that the highly reducing cytoplasm could dissolve PSP condensates and release partitioned cargo, here, we demonstrate the ability of PSP condensates to deliver molecular cargo to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. We show that PSP condensates deliver a variety of cargos that differ in their sizes and chemistries, including small molecules, peptides, GFP (31 kDa), DNA (1.7 kbp), and mRNA. The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent. With room to tailor the condensate properties based on cargo and cell types, these results showcase the potential of disulfide-cross-linked PSPs as effective and customizable cellular delivery vehicles, filling a critical demand gap for such delivery systems.",

However, the evolvability of phages and the fitness cost they impose on susceptible bacteria challenge the evolutionary stability of the coexistence. Understanding this dynamic is critical for predicting phage–bacteria coevolution with implications for phage therapy, where resistance hinders treatment success. To address this point, we built on the discovery that heterogeneously expressed alterations of the O-antigen (phase variation) enable phenotypic resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium ( S .Tm) against the T5-like phage 37 (Φ37). We observed that phase variation allowed prolonged phage–bacteria coexistence in liquid medium. In contrast, phase variation only delayed the fixation of genetically phage-resistant S .Tm mutants when the phage–bacteria interaction took place in the gut of infected mice. The emergence of evolved phages capable of infecting both phenotypically susceptible and resistant phase variants of wild-type S .Tm selected for genetically resistant S .Tm mutants. Experimental in vitro evolution in a viscous medium recapitulated the short-lived coexistence of phages with susceptible S .Tm observed in the gut. This demonstrates that conditions in the gut increase the evolvability of phages by potentiating the effect of mutations that increase the phage host range, thereby negating the protection conferred by phase variation.",

Developmentally, neutrophils and macrophages share common progenitors, whose fate is tightly controlled by transcriptional programs. Dysregulation of these programs causes severe hematological disorders, including neutropenia, neutrophilia, leukemia, and inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of neutrophils through these programs are poorly understood. Here, we revealed that Ikzf1 and Myb were enriched in neutrophils. Overactivation of Ikzf1 promoted neutrophil generation while suppressing macrophage emergence. Conversely, the simultaneous loss of Ikzf1 and Myb, but not the individual mutations, drastically impaired neutrophil production and enlarged the macrophage pool in both zebrafish and mice. Mechanistically, Ikzf1 and Myb formed a complex that targeted irf8 and induced the expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), irf8-2 , through a regulatory element. LncRNA irf8-2 biased neutrophil commitment by modulating irf8 dosage via Zfp36l1. The deletion of irf8-2 resulted in defective neutrophil development and enhanced macrophage production. However, a partial ratio of neutrophils and macrophages was restored when Ikzf1, Myb, and Irf8 were all compromised. Overall, our study reveals that Ikzf1 and Myb cooperatively bias neutrophil development against Irf8 via the lncRNA irf8 -2 and Zfp36l.

Combined pesticide markedly elevated the abundance of phage-encoded ARGs under nitrogen deposition. By enhancing phage–host interactions and increasing the co-occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes with ARGs, phages may further facilitate the transfer of ARGs to bacterial hosts, conferring hosts a competitive edge in intensified microbial competition driven by combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition. The phage-driven mechanism was supported by in vitro cultivation experiments, demonstrating that phages harboring ARGs, shaped by long-term combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition, can infect bacterial hosts and confer resistance.

However, there are few ambient measurements (or none) of various HAPs in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans (BR-NO). We measured 17 carcinogenic volatile organic compounds using fast-response in situ instrumentation aboard a mobile laboratory. Using spatially resolved concentrations, we estimate cancer risk in 15 census tracts along an 81 km-long stretch of the BR-NO corridor. In 14 of 15 tracts, our estimates of total cancer risk were higher (range: 0.9 to 11.6 × ; median: 5 × ) than those from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) 2020 Air Toxics Screening Assessment (AirToxScreen). Our maximum estimate for total tract-level cancer risk was 560-in-one million excess cancer cases, far exceeding the upper limit of USEPA’s acceptable risk range (100-in-one million). This discrepancy is largely explained by differences between measured vs. modeled ethylene oxide concentrations, though there are important contributions from a number of additional HAPs. Our risk estimates are dominated by ethylene oxide, which contributes between 39.5 and 92.2% of total cancer risk across all tracts; chloroprene (0.2 to 36.8%); and formaldehyde (4.1 to 14.6%). AirToxScreen also identifies these three compounds as primary drivers of risk in this location. Together, these three compounds account for between 63 and 96.9% of total cancer risk. There is substantial spatial variability in total cancer risk and the relative contribution of each HAP, both between and within tracts. These data substantiate claims that the region has high HAPs-related cancer risk and quantify which individual HAPs are of highest concern.",

While cell line engineering and bioprocess optimization have yielded high protein titers for some recombinant proteins, many remain difficult to express. Here, we investigated factors influencing protein expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, expressing 2,135 Human Secretome Project proteins. While the abundance of mRNA from recombinant proteins explained less than 1% of observed variation in secretion titers, analysis of 218 biochemical and biophysical descriptors uncovered intrinsic protein features that account for ~15% of secretion variability, pinpointing key drivers such as molecular weight, cysteine content, and N-linked glycosylation, and establishing a roadmap for rational design of difficult-to-express proteins. We subsequently analyzed RNA-Seq data from 95 CHO cell cultures, each expressing a distinct recombinant protein, spanning a wide range of titers. Host cell transcriptomic signatures showed strong correlations with titer, thereby providing insights into cellular processes that covary with expression. Cells failing to produce proteins exhibited increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, including ER-associated degradation; whereas high-producing cells demonstrated enhanced lipid metabolism and a stronger response to oxidative stress, suggesting these factors may support successful recombinant protein productions. Together, using this resource, we quantified the contributions of various protein and cellular factors that correlate with the expression of diverse recombinant human proteins in a heterologous host, thereby providing insights for next-generation CHO cell engineering.",

We evaluated 52 voluntary REDD+ projects across 12 tropical countries using synthetic control methods.

Nonetheless, many underperforming projects still delivered partial climate benefits, with an estimated 13.2% of tradable credits supported by counterfactual analysis. Effectiveness varied by region, with stronger performance in Brazil and Africa. Although systematic over-crediting remains a concern, our results suggest greater climate benefits than previous assessments.

          "abstract": "Understanding how genetic variation translates into complex phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we address this by mapping genome-to-proteome relationships in 800 progeny of a cross between two yeast strains adapted to distinct environments. Despite the modest genetic distance between the parents, we observed notable proteomic diversity and mapped more than 6400 genotype-protein associations, with more than 1600 linked to individual genetic variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged from a conserved network of cis- and trans-regulatory variants, often originating from proteins not traditionally linked to gene regulation. This atlas allowed us to forecast organismal fitness effects across diverse conditions. By connecting genomic and proteomic landscapes at unprecedented resolution, our study provides a framework for predicting the phenotypic outcomes of natural genetic variation.",

Selectively blocking the RAS-PI3Kα interaction may represent a strategy for treating RAS-dependent cancers as it would avoid the toxicity associated with inhibitors of PI3Kα lipid kinase activity. We developed compounds that bind covalently to cysteine 242 in the RBD of PI3K p110α and block RAS activation of PI3Kα activity. In mice, inhibitors slow the growth of RAS mutant tumors and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing tumors, particularly when combined with other inhibitors of the RAS/Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, without causing hyperglycemia. Oncogenic mutations in the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS occur in 20% of human cancers, with RAS proteins activating both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways ( 1 – 3 ). As each of these pathways has oncogenic potential, simultaneous activation, as occurs in mutant RAS driven cancers, generates aggressive disease. In RAS-driven cell and animal models, inhibition of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways is more efficacious than targeting the individual pathways ( 4 ); however, dose-limiting toxicities in humans prevent clinical success of this strategy. Although physiological activation of the MAPK pathway is RAS-dependent, the interaction between RAS and the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, p110α, serves as an amplifier but not a primary activator of this pathway, and is less important in normal cellular regulation than it is in cancer ( 5 ).",

Loss of Aster-A increased cholesterol accumulation in the PM, which enhanced TCR nanoclustering and signaling. Aster-A associated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and negatively regulated calcium (Ca 2+ ) flux. Aster-A deficiency promoted CD4 T cells to acquire a T helper 17 (T H 17) phenotype and stimulated interleukin-22 production, which reduced intestinal fat absorption and conferred resistance to diet-induced obesity.

Mechanisms must have evolved to moderate the impact of mtDNA mutagenesis but are poorly understood. Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We also found that high mutant burden, or heteroplasmy, impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, explaining how mutations can evade quality control to cause disease. Inhibiting USP30 unleashes latent mitophagy, reducing mutant mtDNA in high-heteroplasmy cells. These findings suggest a potential strategy to prevent mitochondrial disorders.",

L1 retrotransposition critically depends on its endonuclease and reverse transcriptase subunit open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p), which targets genomic loci and nicks DNA using an evolutionarily distinct yet not fully understood mechanism. Our structural and biochemical analyses revealed that ORF2p is a structure-dependent endonuclease. It binds a double-stranded DNA region upstream of the nicking site and recognizes a downstream forked or flap structure for efficient DNA nicking.

Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors.

Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity.

          "abstract": "High-power fiber lasers are powerful tools used in science, industry, and defense. A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.",

          "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) accelerate evolution by rapidly diversifying variable proteins. The human gastrointestinal microbiota harbors the greatest density of DGRs known in nature, suggesting that they play adaptive roles in this environment. We identified &gt;1100 distinct DGRs among human-associated Bacteroides species and discovered a subset that diversify adhesive components of type V pili and related proteins. We show that Bacteroides DGRs are horizontally transferred across species, display activity levels ranging from high to low, and preferentially alter the functional characteristics of ligand-binding residues on adhesive organelles. Specific variable protein sequences are enriched when Bacteroides strains compete with other commensal bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. Analysis of &gt;2700 DGRs from diverse phyla in mother-infant pairs shows that Bacteroides DGRs are disproportionately transferred to vaginally delivered infants where they actively diversify. Our observations provide a foundation for understanding the potential roles of targeted genome plasticity in shaping host-associated microbial communities.",

Structural studies on chlorophyll f-containing photosystem I could identify some chlorophylls f sites, but none among the photochemically active pigments and concluded that chlorophyll f plays no photochemical role. Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of far-red PSI from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, allowing the assignment of eight chlorophylls f molecules, including the redox active A -1B . Simulations of absorption difference spectra induced by charge separation indicate that the experimental spectra can be reproduced only by considering the presence of a chlorophyll f at the A -1B site. The chlorophyll f locations, wavelength assignments, and conserved far-red-specific residues provide functional insights for efficient use of long wavelength photons.",

          "abstract": "Efficient DNA repair might make possible the longevity of naked mole-rats. However, whether they have distinctive mechanisms to optimize functions of DNA repair suppressors is unclear. We find that naked mole-rat cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) lacks the suppressive function of human or mouse homologs in homologous recombination repair through the alteration of four amino acids during evolution. The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span. Manipulating cGAS might therefore constitute a mechanism for life-span extension.",

To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.",

Most SSEs remain largely confined to single-anion systems (e.g., sulfides, oxides, halides, and polymers). Through mixed-anion design strategy, we develop crystalline Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 (LTOC) and its derivatives with excellent ionic conductivities (up to 13.7 millisiemens per centimeter at 25°C) and electrochemical stability. The LTOC structure features mixed-anion spiral chains, consisting of corner-shared oxygen and terminal chlorine atoms, which induces continuous “tetrahedron-tetrahedron” Li-ion migration pathways with low energy barriers. Additionally, LTOC demonstrates holistic cathode compatibility, enabling solid-state batteries operation at 4.9 volts versus Li/Li + and low temperature, down to −50°C. These findings describe a promising class of superionic conductors for high-performance solid-state batteries.",

Under 2-hertz mechanical excitation, the PEET achieves a current density of 2.5 amperes per square centimeter, an average power output of 4.46 watts per square meter per hertz, and an energy conversion efficiency of 19%—two orders of magnitude higher than conventional electrostatic energy harvesting technologies, e.g., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and capacitive systems.

Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices.

During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Oral bacteriotherapy is increasingly exploited but faces challenges in simultaneously monitoring treatment process and achieving desirable efficacy. Here, we develop theranostic bacteria by depositing a protective visual therapeutic nanocoating via in situ sequential mineralization. Using two-step metal ion adsorption and nucleation, bacterial surface is successively mineralized with an inner manganese dioxide/ferric oxide nanoparticle layer and an outer calcium carbonate layer. Upon ingestion, the outer layer neutralizes gastric acid through double-decomposition reaction, protecting bacterial viability and the inner layer. During intestinal passage, the inner layer enables T1/T2 dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging for real-time tracking, whereas the lesion-triggered release of manganese ions allows T1 single-mode pathological detection. The inner layer also exhibits superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, synergizing therapeutic effects with bacteria. Further supported by satisfactory performances in two murine models of Salmonella -induced colitis and apolipoprotein E–deficient atherosclerosis, this work provides a platform to generate innovative theranostic agents for advanced bacteriotherapy.",

We found that loss of clh-1 extends life span, improves stress resistance, reduces neuronal damage, and extends health span. These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor.

Herein, we present a photoactivatable immunostimulator based on nanoengineered microalgae (PCC@AuNP) to simultaneously enhance tumor immunogenicity and remodel the TME. Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues. Collectively, this innovative PCC@AuNP platform offers a safe and effective therapeutic strategy, heralding a pioneering era of cascade-augmented gas-driven cancer immunotherapy with superior precision and biosafety.",

In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics.

Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms.

Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits.

Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a lithium-6 (^{6}Li) atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at megacycles per second frequencies. This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.",

Using micropillar-based force microscopy and FA-targeted FRET biosensors, we monitored real-time traction forces and FAK activity at individual FAs during assembly and disassembly. Our results demonstrate oscillatory temporal coupling of traction force and FAK activity in high-tension FAs before FA disassembly. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that force precedes FAK activation, guiding FA turnover. Atomistic molecular simulations unveiled a force-induced mechanism where traction forces disrupt autoinhibitory FERM-kinase interactions in FAK, enabling catalytic activity without structural unfolding.

Our approach involved three strategies: (i) development of a tailored focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy, augmented by virtual screening and iterative mutagenesis, to design mutant Mut4-1 (S367A/V274A/F82V/I132T) with a 128-fold enhancement in relative catalytic activity; (ii) enhancement of the enzyme’s compatibility with a broader spectrum of sugar donors achieved through structural-based engineering, yielding mutant S14G/F366H/S367G and demonstrating effective utilization of diverse donors; (iii) construction of a targeted mutant library to enhance regioselectivity by active site analysis, leading to mutants with high selectivity for targeted glycosylation sites. This comprehensive study tackles predominant challenges in UDP-glycosyltransferases protein engineering, providing innovative approaches and insights that enhance the development of flavonoid glycosides.",

However, within bulk materials from traditional synthesis and modeling, achieving flexible and precise arrangements of the microscopic units is challenging, which restricts the capabilities to fully understand and manipulate their polydomain-based properties. Here, we present a metastructure to mimic both mesoscale phase change and macroscopic mechanical properties of polydomain materials such as liquid crystal elastomers, which achieves unprecedented tunability over domain structures through the rational design of unit cells and their spatial arrangements. These metastructure system is used to explore and directly visualize the complex mesoscale topological deformation mechanisms hidden at molecular scales, providing fundamental insights into the mechanical properties of these materials. Beyond mimicking known polydomain materials, we demonstrate functionalities including mechanical encoding/decoding and programmable shape morphing.

In this study, we use cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr 46.8 Ti 8.2 Cu 7.5 Ni 10 Be 27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermomechanical processing.",

We analyze large behavioral datasets of larval zebrafish engaged in a “coherent dot” optomotor assay and find that animal performance is bimodal. Performance can be separated into two “states”—an engaged (attentive) state with high performance, where fish consistently turn in the direction of coherent motion, and a second, disengaged (inattentive) state, where performance drops to chance. A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity. EVs from melanoma tumors were analyzed, identifying miR-99a-5p in CD19 + EVs as up-regulated in responders. Silencing miR-99a-5p in B cells reduces T cell antitumor activity, suggesting its role in immune modulation. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p promotes B cell maturation via class-switch recombination.

Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.",

For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure. While aspects of chikungunya outbreak severity are predictable, innovative approaches are needed that look beyond the impacts of climate on R 0 .",

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations. Thus, ThrCo LNP–based vaccines efficiently deliver mRNA to splenic antigen-presenting cells, boosting immune responses and improving therapeutic outcomes.",

Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems.

In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience.

Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.",

In the peptidoglycan biogenesis pathway in Escherichia coli , MurJ, the lipid II flippase, is an essential membrane protein. The 37-residue protein M from the Levivirus phage, known as Lys M or Sgl M , targets MurJ and induces cell lysis; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and pull-down assays revealed key residues responsible for Lys M function, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that Lys M stabilizes MurJ’s outward-facing state. These findings demonstrate an unprecedented phage-derived mechanism for blocking lipid II transport, providing a structural framework for designing MurJ-targeted antimicrobial agents.",

We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact.

Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation.

Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution.

Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress.

Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes.

This violation becomes pronounced toward the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties—specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients—coincides with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength.

Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy.

          "abstract": "Embedding information processing into mechanical metamaterials is conductive to constructing multifunctional mechanical systems, which has unique advantages to provide information processing platforms in extreme environments. However, achieving high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information processing in most mechanical metamaterials remains a challenge. Here, we report a multibit programming spine structure strategy to create a magnetorheological metamaterial with high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information encoding capacities. Inspired by spine features, the magnetorheological spine beams, exhibiting substantial stiffness variation by bistable transition, meticulously conceived the stiffness reprogrammable magnetorheological metamaterial (SRMM). The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions. Such stiffness-based magnetorheological metamaterial offers expansive information encoding spaces, stable operation capabilities, and convenient readout approaches, advancing mechanical information processing system design for extreme environments.",

          "abstract": "Climate change risks triggering abrupt weakening in two climatically important North Atlantic Ocean circulation elements, the subpolar gyre and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.",

          "abstract": "Centriole assembly involves the coordination of centriolar modules. One module is the A-C linker, an enigmatic protein assembly connecting the A-microtubule of one microtubule triplet to the C-microtubule of the neighboring triplet. Here, we integrated biochemistry, multiscale cryo–electron microscopy, and AlphaFold modeling to investigate the architecture of the centriole. Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold. Our findings show that the A-C linker is a highly integrated component of the centriole whose polymorphism may orchestrate the assembly of spatially distinct centriolar modules, and provide a framework for dissecting the biology of centrioles.",

          "abstract": "Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic RNA-protein assemblies that form in response to cellular stress and must be efficiently disassembled to restore normal cell function. Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Paleogeography of the Ediacaran Period has remained poorly understood because of paleomagnetic studies commonly yielding perplexing or conflicting data. Here, we report new magnetostratigraphic data from the Ediacaran Ouarzazate Group in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco, which have primary magnetizations supported by a positive conglomerate test and stratigraphically consistent directions within volcanic units across multiple localities. Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation. Our analysis produces a late Ediacaran paleogeographic reconstruction that is consistent with paleomagnetic and geologic constraints.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials hold the potential for ultrascaled ferroelectric (FE) devices due to their silicon compatibility and robust polarization down to atomic scale. However, the inherently weak vdW interactions enable facile sliding between layers, introducing complexities beyond those encountered in conventional ferroelectric materials and presenting substantial challenges in uncovering intricate switching pathways. Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.",

          "abstract": "Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are an abundant class of compounds in atmospheric particulate matter, exerting considerable impacts on air quality, climate, and public health. They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.",

          "abstract": "Americans have not responded to rising income inequality by demanding higher taxes on top incomes. Does this mean that ideological beliefs trump material conditions for explaining voters’ views on taxing the rich? We argue that it does not. Though Americans may be insensitive to rising inequality as long as their own finances are stable, we propose that the experience of financial strain changes individuals’ views about inequality and makes them more supportive of progressive tax hikes. Using panel survey evidence, we show that financial strain in the form of income loss leads to greater support for raising taxes on high incomes. This is true among both Republicans and Democrats. Financial strain appears to shift respondents’ tax preferences by inducing discontent and anger about economic inequality. This suggests that voters’ beliefs about the fairness of market outcomes are endogenous to changes in their material circumstances.",
