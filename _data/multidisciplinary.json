          "abstract": "Lymphatic capillaries continuously take up interstitial fluid and adapt to resulting changes in vessel calibre 1–3 . The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) 4 maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis 5,6 , LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell–cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.",

          "abstract": "In the course of antibody affinity maturation, germinal centre (GC) B cells mutate their immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in a process known as somatic hypermutation (SHM) 1–4 . Panels of mutant B cells with different binding affinities for antigens are then selected in a Darwinian manner, which leads to a progressive increase in affinity among the population 5 . As with any Darwinian process, rare gain-of-fitness mutations must be identified and common loss-of-fitness mutations avoided 6 . Progressive acquisition of mutations therefore poses a risk during large proliferative bursts 7 , when GC B cells undergo several cell cycles in the absence of affinity-based selection 8–13 . Using a combination of in vivo mouse experiments and mathematical modelling, here we show that GCs achieve this balance by strongly suppressing SHM during clonal-burst-type expansion, so that a large fraction of the progeny generated by these bursts does not deviate from their ancestral genotype. Intravital imaging and image-based cell sorting of a mouse strain carrying a reporter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity showed that B cells that are actively undergoing proliferative bursts lack the transient CDK2 low ‘G0-like’ phase of the cell cycle in which SHM takes place. We propose a model in which inertially cycling B cells mostly delay SHM until the G0-like phase that follows their final round of division in the GC dark zone, thus maintaining affinity as they clonally expand in the absence of selection.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated potassium (K V ) channels contain cytoplasmically exposed β-subunits 1–5 whose aldo-keto reductase activity 6–8 is required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep 9 . Here we show that Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the K V 1 channel Shaker in Drosophila 7 , forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls 10–13 , such as 4-oxo-2-nonenal or an endogenous analogue generated by illuminating a membrane-bound photosensitizer 9,14 , abstract an electron pair. NADP + remains locked in the active site of K V β until membrane depolarization permits its release and replacement with NADPH. Sleep-inducing neurons 15–17 use this voltage-gated oxidoreductase cycle to encode their recent lipid peroxidation history in the collective binary states of their K V β subunits; this biochemical memory influences—and is erased by—spike discharges driving sleep. The presence of a lipid peroxidation sensor at the core of homeostatic sleep control 16,17 suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep.",

          "abstract": "The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform us about the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, providing insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development 1 . Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections 2 from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic ‘driver’ mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A , ARID1B , ARID2 , CTNNB1 and KDM6A . The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.",

          "abstract": "Entangled photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) 1 are central to many quantum applications 2–6 . SPDC is typically performed in non-centrosymmetric systems 7 with an inherent second-order nonlinearity ( χ (2) ) 8–10 . We demonstrate strong narrowband SPDC with an on-chip rate of 0.8 million pairs per second in Si 3 N 4 . Si 3 N 4 is the pre-eminent material for photonic integration and also exhibits the lowest waveguide loss (which is essential for integrated quantum circuits). However, being amorphous, silicon nitride lacks an intrinsic χ (2) , which limits its role in photonic quantum devices. We enabled SPDC in Si 3 N 4 by combining strong light-field enhancement inside a high optical Q -factor microcavity with an optically induced space-charge field. We present narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness. The quantum nature of the down-converted photon pairs is verified through coincidence measurements. This light source, based on Si 3 N 4 integrated photonics technology, unlocks new avenues for quantum systems on a chip.",

          "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nucleocytoplasmic exchange, catalysing a massive flux of protein and nucleic acid material in both directions 1 . Distinct trafficking pathways for import and export would be an elegant solution to avoid unproductive collisions and opposing movements. However, the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of macromolecules traversing the NPC remains challenging to visualize on the timescale of millisecond-scale transport events. Here we used 3D MINFLUX 2 to identify the nuclear pore scaffold and then to simultaneously monitor both nuclear import and nuclear export, thereby establishing that both transport processes occur in overlapping regions of the central pore. Whereas translocation-arrested import complexes bound at the pore periphery, tracks of translocating complexes within the central pore region revealed a preference for an approximately 40- to 50-nm diameter annulus with minimal circumferential movement, indicating activity-dependent confinement within the permeability barrier. Movement within the pore was approximately 1,000-fold slower than in solution and was interspersed with pauses, indicating a highly restricted environment with structural constraints and/or transient binding events during transport. These results demonstrate that high spatiotemporal precision with reduced photobleaching is a major advantage of MINFLUX tracking, and that the NPC permeability barrier is divided into annular rings with distinct functional properties.",

We test whether explicitly expressing trust in players’ capability to maintain cooperation after the removal of sanctions, i.e., vertical communication of trust, has the potential to alleviate this drop in compliance. Four incentivized public-goods experiments ( N = 2,823) find that the vertical communication of trust maintains cooperation upon the removal of centralized (Study 1), third-party (Study 2a, 2b), and peer punishment (Study 3), and this effect extends beyond single interactions (Study 4). In all studies, vertical trust communication increases mutual trust among players, providing support to the idea that vertically communicating trust can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Extrapolating our findings to natural environments, they suggest that authorities should carefully consider how they communicate the lifting of rules and sanctions.",

          "abstract": "Deforestation frequently accompanies poverty, yet various antipoverty programs in many countries have exhibited mixed results in addressing deforestation. Poverty Alleviation Resettlement (PAR) stands out as one of the few government-led resettlement programs designed to alleviate poverty, offering comprehensive follow-up support for quality of life and employment after relocation. Our study uncovered empirical evidence of the PAR program’s impact on forest quality. Through a multiperiod difference-in-differences analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we found that the PAR program significantly curbed deforestation in the participating counties and reduced forest-clearing activities among the resettled households, even those relocating to rural villages. Mechanism analysis revealed that the program discouraged deforestation by enhancing market accessibility, fostering nonfarm employment opportunities, and elevating income levels. The study underscores that altering livelihood strategies and lifestyles is essential for resettlement programs to effectively mitigate ecological degradation.",

Here, we examined how naturalistic ups and downs in state motivation influence the subjective value of reward and effort. In a microlongitudinal design (N = 155, state timepoints = 3,344, decision-making tasks = 845), we captured fluctuations in state and effort-based decision-making using smartphone-based momentary assessments as people went about their daily lives. We found that both state and trait have independent and multiplicative effects on decision-making. State–behavior coupling was particularly pronounced in individuals with higher trait apathy, meaning that their choices were even more state dependent. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that state motivation prospectively boosted reward sensitivity, making people more willing to exert effort in future. Our results show that day-to-day fluctuations in state and cognition are tightly linked and critical for understanding fundamental human behaviors and mental ill-health.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic processes involving biomolecules are essential for the function of the cell. Here, we introduce an integrative method for computing models of these processes based on multiple heterogeneous sources of information, including time-resolved experimental data and physical models of dynamic processes. First, for each time point, a set of coarse models of compositional and structural heterogeneity is computed (heterogeneity models). Second, for each heterogeneity model, a set of static integrative structure models is computed (a snapshot model). Finally, these snapshot models are selected and connected into a series of trajectories that optimize the likelihood of both the snapshot models and transitions between them (a trajectory model). The method is demonstrated by application to the assembly process of the human nuclear pore complex in the context of the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic cell division, based on live-cell correlated electron tomography, bulk fluorescence correlation spectroscopy–calibrated quantitative live imaging, and a structural model of the fully assembled nuclear pore complex. Modeling of the assembly process improves the model precision over static integrative structure modeling alone. The method is applicable to a wide range of time-dependent systems in cell biology and is available to the broader scientific community through an implementation in the open source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software.",

          "abstract": "The origin of birds represents a pivotal transition in vertebrate evolution, marked by significant changes in both brain size and feeding biomechanics. The evolution of the avian skull involved dramatic modifications, such as a segmented palate and the development of powered cranial kinesis in neognath birds. Powered kinesis, the ability to move parts of the skull independently, is considered a key innovation behind the dietary diversity and evolutionary success of birds. However, the processes driving the emergence of avian kinesis have remained unclear until recently. By analyzing data from Mesozoic birds, including reinterpretations of palate homology, 3D jaw muscle biomechanics, and linkage analysis, researchers have quantified changes in muscle forces and their effects on palate mechanics during the transition from theropods to birds. As the neurocranium expanded in non-avian theropods, temporal muscles shifted to more rostrocaudal positions in birds, aiding in the segmentation of the pterygoid. This musculoskeletal transformation increased fore-aft muscle force in neognaths, enabling powered cranial kinesis. A critical change was the separation of the epipterygoid ossification from the braincase, leading to the breakdown of primitive kinematic linkages and the development of a new basicranial joint, which allowed for greater cranial flexibility. These findings shed light on how the neurosensory and feeding systems coevolved during bird origins and offer new methods for identifying cranial kinesis in extinct vertebrates.",

Voltage spikes measured on these electrodes display depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization phases with amplitudes similar to the action potentials of neurons but with the markedly slower duration of 1 to 2 s. Some propagate distances up to hundreds of μm from the wound with a mean speed of around 10 mm s −1 . Generation and transmission of bioelectric signals are significantly influenced by the perturbation of mechanosensitive cationic ion channels. These direct measurements confirm bioelectric signaling that previous work has hypothesized to regulate epithelial cell development and may have relevance to the frequency parameter selection of bioelectric devices.",

Here, we identified a connectional axis in the edge-level FC variability. The variability declined continuously along this axis from within-network to between-network connections and from the edges linking association networks to those linking the sensorimotor and association networks. This connectional axis of functional variability is associated with spatial pattern of structural connectivity variability. Moreover, the connectional variability axis evolves in youth with an flatter axis slope. We also observed that the slope of the connectional variability axis was positively related to the performance in the higher-order cognition. Together, our results reveal a connectional axis in functional variability that is linked with structural connectome variability, refines during development, and is relevant to cognition.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a prominent force shaping genome evolution, and understanding why recombination rates vary within and between species has remained a central, though challenging, question. Variation in recombination is widely thought to influence the efficacy of selection in purging transposable elements (TEs), prevalent selfish genetic elements, leading to widely observed negative correlations between TE abundance and recombination rates across taxa. However, accumulating evidence suggests that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence of this relationship. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked an approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches–analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing TE landscape can actively modify recombination, shaping genome evolution within and between species.",

Here, integrating transcriptomic and proteomic approaches with AI-guided structure predictions, we discover a group of evolutionarily conserved leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins in velvet worm slime that readily adopt a receptor-like, protein-binding “horseshoe” structure. Our structural predictions suggest dimerization of LRR proteins and support their interactions with conserved β-sheet-rich domains of high-molecular-weight proteins, the primary building blocks of velvet worm slime fibers. This suggests that LRR proteins might be involved in reversible, receptor-based supramolecular interactions in these biofibers, providing potential avenues for fabricating fully recyclable (bio)polymeric materials.",

Here, we show that static mechanical stretch of cells in 3D tissues can either increase or decrease fibroblast activation depending upon recursive cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) feedback and demonstrate control of this activation through integrated in vitro and mathematical models. ECM viscoelasticity, signaling dynamics, and cell mechanics combine to yield a predictable, but nonmonotonic, relationship between mechanical stretch and long-term cell activation. Results demonstrate that feedback between cells and ECM determine how cells retain memory of mechanical stretch and have direct implications for improving outcomes in skin grafting procedures.",

Here, we investigate the potential of reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning technique that efficaciously acquires knowledge from the environment and systematically optimizes dynamic decisions, in modeling and informing adaptive climate decision-making. We consider coastal flood risk mitigations for Manhattan, New York City, USA (NYC), illustrating the benefit of continuously incorporating observations of sea-level rise into systematic designs of adaptive strategies. We find that when designing adaptive seawalls to protect NYC, the RL-derived strategy significantly reduces the expected net cost by 6 to 36% under the moderate emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 (9 to 77% under the high emissions scenario SSP5-8.5), compared to conventional methods. When considering multiple adaptive policies, including accomodation and retreat as well as protection, the RL approach leads to a further 5% (15%) cost reduction, showing RL’s flexibility in coordinatively addressing complex policy design problems. RL also outperforms conventional methods in controlling tail risk (i.e., low probability, high impact outcomes) and in avoiding losses induced by misinformation about the climate state (e.g., deep uncertainty), demonstrating the importance of systematic learning and updating in addressing extremes and uncertainties related to climate adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1), a pore-forming component of the mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel in cochlear outer hair cells, is subject to numerous mutations causing deafness and hair cell death. We studied mice harboring semidominant mutations Tmc1 p.T416K, p.M412K, and p.D569N, which all display functional MET channels at postnatal day (P)6 but become deaf by P21. Early signs of concomitant hair cell apoptosis were assayed in neonatal Tmc1 mutants by labeling with Calcein-acetomethyl ester (AM), MitoTracker, and Annexin V, the latter labeling scramblase externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Reduced labeling with Calcein-AM was correlated with reduced MitoTracker, the targeting of mitochondria being confirmed with the uncoupling agent carbonylcyanide p -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and use of MitoLight to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential. These markers demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in Tmc1 mutants, even at P6 when MET currents were still present. Acoustic brainstem responses established that Tmc1 p.D569N and Tmc1 p.M412K mice were deaf by P15 and Tmc1 p.T416K by P21. Two methods of blocking the stereociliary PMCA2 Ca 2+ pump both elicited scramblase activity, suggesting that apoptosis is promoted by elevation of hair bundle [Ca 2+ ]. Reduced PMCA2 density was found in the stereocilia of Tmc1 mutants and was correlated with a decrease in MET channel Ca 2+ permeability. Cre-Lox excision of the mutant M412K exon at P1 fully preserved hearing across all frequencies by P19 and promoted recovery to wild type of PMCA2 density. These results demonstrate that hair cells in Tmc1 mutants have embarked on apoptosis at P6 and argue for connections between stereociliary PMCA2 density, hair cell apoptosis, and deafness.",

          "abstract": "Thermally induced ripples are intrinsic features of nanometer-thick films, atomically thin materials, and cell membranes, significantly affecting their elastic properties. Despite decades of theoretical studies on the mechanics of suspended thermalized sheets, controversy still exists over the impact of these ripples, with conflicting predictions about whether elasticity is scale-dependent or scale-independent. Experimental progress has been hindered so far by the inability to have a platform capable of fully isolating and characterizing the effects of ripples. This knowledge gap limits the fundamental understanding of thin materials and their practical applications. Here, we show that thermal-like static ripples shape thin films into a class of metamaterials with scale-dependent, customizable elasticity. Utilizing a scalable semiconductor manufacturing process, we engineered nanometer-thick films with precisely controlled frozen random ripples, resembling snapshots of thermally fluctuating membranes. Resonant frequency measurements of rippled cantilevers reveal that random ripples effectively renormalize and enhance the average bending rigidity and sample-to-sample variations in a scale-dependent manner, consistent with recent theoretical estimations. The predictive power of the theoretical model, combined with the scalability of the fabrication process, was further exploited to create kirigami architectures with tailored bending rigidity and mechanical metamaterials with delayed buckling instability.",

          "abstract": "Desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria are able to survive frequent cycles of hydration and dehydration, which are closely linked to diurnal light oscillations. Previous studies have shown that light serves as a crucial anticipatory cue, activating desert cyanobacteria to prepare for desiccation. However, the mechanisms underlying their light-coupled desiccation tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that red-light-induced photosynthetic genes are positively regulated by a LuxR family transcription factor NfSrr1. We further identified the cyanobacteriochrome NfPixJ as interacting with NfSrr1 and functioning as a red light sensor. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the red-light signaling module NfPixJ-NfSrr1 plays a key role in preparing cyanobacteria for desiccation tolerance. This module also regulates the synthesis of protective compatible solutes, suggesting that red light functions as a global regulatory signal for the broader stress response. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the presence of this red-light signaling pathway, mediated by NfPixJ-NfSrr1 module, correlates with the ability of cyanobacteria to thrive in water-deficit habitats. Overall, our findings uncover a red-light signaling pathway that enhances desiccation tolerance as desert cyanobacteria encounter red light at dawn, before water limitation. These results provide insights into the mechanisms behind light-induced anticipatory stress tolerance in photosynthetic organisms.",

We present an approach to identify the influence of agriculture on the water–energy balance using empirical data. We explore the departure from the Budyko curve for catchments with agricultural expansion and their associations with changes in the water–energy balance using a causal discovery algorithm. Analyzing data from 1,342 catchments across three Köppen-Geiger climate classes—temperate, snowy, and others—from 1980 to 2014, we show that temperate and snowy catchments, which account for over 90% of stations, exhibit distinct patterns. Cropland percentage (CL%) emerges as the dominant factor, explaining 47 and 37% of the variance in deviations from the Budyko curve in temperate and snowy catchments, respectively. In temperate catchments, CL% shows a strong negative correlation with precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) causal strength (Spearman ρ = − 0.75 ), suggesting that cropland exacerbates precipitation-driven deviations. A moderate negative correlation with aridity-streamflow (AR-Q) causal strength ( ρ = − 0.42 ) indicates additional influences of cropland through aridity-driven interactions. In snowy catchments, CL% is similarly influential, with a positive correlation with P-Q causal strength ( ρ = 0.51 ). However, the negative correlation with AR-Q causal strength ( ρ = − 0.45 ) underscores the role of aridity as a secondary driver. While vegetation and precipitation seasonality also contribute to the deviations, their impacts are comparatively lower. These findings underscore the need for inclusion of agricultural activities in changing water–energy balance to secure future water supplies.",

Developing these nano–bio hybrid systems necessitates a deep understanding of charge-transfer dynamics at the nano–bio interface. Photoexcited carrier transfer from QDs to microbes is driven by complex interactions, with emerging insights into the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The heterogeneities of both microbes and QD ensembles pose significant challenges in mechanistic understanding, which is critical for designing advanced nano–bio hybrids. We used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to analyze charge transfer between a CdSe QD film and Shewanella oneidensis microbes. We correlated the spatiotemporal fluorescence data with an analytical model. Our analysis revealed two distinct distributions of QD de-excitation pathways. The characteristics of these distributions: 1) a faster transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 1 = 1.5   10 9   s - 1 ), with a lower acceptor number ( N ¯ a 1 = 0.03 ) and 2) a slower transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 2 = 4.1   10 8   s - 1 ) with a higher acceptor number ( N ¯ a 2 = 0.18 ). We assign these distributions to the indirect and direct electron transfer mechanisms, respectively. Our findings demonstrate how spectroscopic imaging can uncover fundamental electron transfer mechanisms at complex interfaces, offering valuable design principles for future nano–bio hybrids.",

However, their wave attenuation capacity during extreme storms, when risks are highest, is rarely measured and remains challenging to predict. Here, we compile a unique dataset on the largest incident wave heights (0.39 to 1.44 m) ever recorded in forested wetlands, including our own measurements and literature data. Our analysis reveals that forested wetlands can significantly attenuate storm waves (35% over 3 wavelengths) except in rare near-submerged cases. Notably, 19 of the 20 existing formulations for vegetation drag coefficient, a key parameter for wave attenuation modeling, are inapplicable in storm conditions. Hence, we introduce an new approach to reliably predict wave attenuation during storms, without the need for drag coefficient determination nor modeling expertise. This approach offers coastal practitioners a new user-friendly tool to assess the effectiveness of nature-based solutions for storm hazard mitigation.",

Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe—a specialized slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behavior and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.",

Genetic accommodation is an evolutionary process by which natural selection acts on novel phenotypes generated through repeated encounters with extreme environments. In this study, polyphenic and monophenic strains of the black mutant tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta , were evolved via genetic accommodation of heat stress-induced phenotypes, and the molecular differences between the two strains were explored. Transcriptomic analyses showed that epigenetic and hormonal differences underlie the differences between the two strains and their distinct responses to temperature. DNA methylation had diverged between the two strains potentially mediating genetic assimilation. Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling in the polyphenic strain was temperature sensitive, whereas in the monophenic strain, JH signaling remained low at all temperatures. Although 20-hydroxyecdysone titers were elevated under heat shock conditions in both strains, the strains did not differ in the titers. Tyrosine hydroxylase was also found to differ between the two strains at different temperatures, and its expression could be modulated by topical application of a JH analog. Finally, heat shock of unselected black mutants demonstrated that the expression of the JH-response gene, Krüppel-homolog 1 ( Kr-h1 ), increased within the first 30 min of heat shock, suggesting that JH levels respond readily to thermal stress. Our study highlights the critical role that hormones and epigenetics play during genetic accommodation and potentially in the evolution of populations in the face of climate change.",

          "abstract": "The global sulfur cycle plays a critical role in the redox evolution of Earth’s surface and upper mantle, yet the distribution and origin of sulfur in the mantle remains largely unconstrained. El Hierro is a volcanic island in the Canary archipelago that is fed by sulfur-rich magmas. To constrain the origin of sulfur in these melts, we combine in situ sulfur isotope analyses with regression modeling. We calculate that undegassed El Hierro melts have δ 34 S values of 0 ± 2‰. The average δ 34 S of undegassed El Hierro melts is 0.3‰ to 1‰ higher than magmas erupting at mid-ocean ridges. Mass balance calculations reveal that El Hierro’s mantle source contains 310 ± 120 μg/g sulfur and that on average 60% of sulfur in the source is of recycled origin. This recycled material should contain &gt;1,800 μg/g sulfur to satisfy isotopic constraints on its mass fraction in the mantle source. The sulfur and oxygen isotopic signature in serpentinites and sediments deviate significantly from the upper mantle, making them unsuitable candidates for the recycled material. An oxidized partial melt of recycled oceanic crust that retained one third of its sulfur budget after subduction zone processing can explain excess sulfur in the Canary Island mantle. Recycled oceanic crust is expected to contain sulfur as sulfide, which is not capable of oxidizing the mantle. The presence of ferric iron in the recycled component is necessary to produce metasomatic melts that are oxidizing enough to carry sufficient sulfur into the mantle source of ocean island basalts.",

Here, we optimize IAV inoculation to enhance replication in the nasal turbinate (NT) and study local B cell immunity. We demonstrate that URT-targeted IAV infection stimulates robust local B cell responses, including germinal center (GC) B cell formation in the NT, outside of classical nasal-associated lymphoid tissues. NT GC contributes to local tissue-resident B cell generation and enhances local antibody production. Furthermore, URT-focused immunization also induces significant GC formation in the NT. Finally, we detect steady-state GC in the NT of both mice and healthy humans, suggesting continuous immune surveillance triggered by environmental stimuli. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the NT in local and systemic immunity, with important implications for future mucosal vaccines targeting the upper airways.",

          "abstract": "During fetal stage, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo rapid proliferation with a tight control of genomic stability. Although histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation has been reported to stabilize the genome in proliferating cells, its specific role in HSPC development remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein 5 (Wdr5)-mediated H3K4 methylation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability of proliferating HSPCs in zebrafish embryos. Loss of wdr5 led to a severe reduction of HSPC pool in the caudal hematopoietic tissue, accompanied with attenuated H3K4 methylation level and evident p53 -dependent apoptosis in the HSPCs. Mechanistically, Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation maintains genomic stability by inhibiting the formation of abnormal R-loops in the HSPCs, whereas accumulation of R-loops exacerbates DNA damage. Moreover, the absence of H3K4 trimethylation leads to an inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is deleterious to DNA damage repair and genomic stability. Subsequently, we found that DDR-associated genes, mutL homolog 1 and breast and ovarian cancer interacting helicase 1 , are important to ensure HSPC survival, likely by stabilizing their genome. In summary, these findings reveal that Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation is essential for HSPC development through tight control of R-loop accumulation and DDR-associated program to ensure genomic stability and survival of proliferating HSPCs.",

The latter has potential for transferring energy and information with unprecedented efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a topological diode effect on the surface of a three-dimensional material, SmB 6 , a candidate topological Kondo insulator. The diode effect is evidenced by pronounced rectification and photogalvanic effects under electromagnetic modulation and radiation at radio frequency. Our experimental results and modeling suggest that these prominent effects are intimately tied to the spatially inhomogeneous formation of topological surface states (TSS) at the intermediate temperature. This work provides a manner of breaking the mirror symmetry (in addition to the inversion symmetry), resulting in the formation of pn -junctions between puddles of metallic TSS. This effect paves the way for efficient current rectifiers or energy-harvesting devices working down to radio frequency range at low temperature, which could be extended to high temperatures using other topological insulators with large bulk gap.",

          "abstract": "The problem of combining P -values is an old and fundamental one, and the classic assumption of independence is often violated or unverifiable in many applications. There are many well-known rules that can combine a set of arbitrarily dependent P -values (for the same hypothesis) into a single P -value. We show that essentially all these existing rules can be strictly improved when the P -values are exchangeable, or when external randomization is allowed (or both). For example, we derive randomized and/or exchangeable improvements of well-known rules like “twice the median” and “twice the average,” as well as geometric and harmonic means. Exchangeable P -values are often produced one at a time (for example, under repeated tests involving data splitting), and our rules can combine them sequentially as they are produced, stopping when the combined P -values stabilize. Our work also improves rules for combining arbitrarily dependent P -values, since the latter becomes exchangeable if they are presented to the analyst in a random order. The main technical advance is to show that all existing combination rules can be obtained by calibrating the P -values to e-values (using an α -dependent calibrator), averaging those e-values, converting to a level- α test using Markov’s inequality, and finally obtaining P -values by combining this family of tests; the improvements are delivered via recent randomized and exchangeable variants of Markov’s inequality.",

While ventral CA1 (vCA1) shows direct and reciprocal connections with mPFC, dorsal CA1 (dCA1) forms indirect pathways to mPFC, notably via the thalamic reuniens nucleus (Re). Neuroanatomical tracing has documented structural connectivity of this indirect pathway through Re however, its functional operation is largely unexplored. Here, we used in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology along with optogenetics to address this question. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse brain slices revealed both monosynaptic excitatory responses and disynaptic feedforward inhibition at Re–mPFC synapses. However, we also identified a prolonged excitation of mPFC by Re. These early monosynaptic and late recurrent components are in marked contrast to the primarily feedforward inhibition characteristic of thalamic inputs to the neocortex. Local field potential recordings in mPFC brain slices revealed prolonged synaptic activity throughout all cortical lamina upon Re activation, with the late excitation enhanced by blockade of parvalbumin neurons and GABA A Rs. In vivo Neuropixels recordings in head-fixed awake mice revealed a similar prolonged excitation of mPFC units by Re activation. In summary, Re output produces recurrent feedforward excitation within mPFC suggesting a potent amplification system in the Re–mPFC network. This may facilitate amplification of dCA1-&gt;mPFC signals for which Re acts as the primary conduit, as there is little direct connectivity. In addition, the capacity of mPFC neurons to fire bursts of action potentials in response to Re input suggests that these synapses have a high gain.",

Species radiations established by long-distance, and especially transoceanic, dispersal can cause substantial shifts in regional biodiversity. Here, we investigate the occurrence and timing of the greatest known long-distance oceanic dispersal event in the history of terrestrial vertebrates—the rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji. Iguanas are large-bodied herbivores that are well-known overwater dispersers, including species that colonized the Caribbean and the Galápagos islands. However, the origin of Fijian iguanas had not been comprehensively tested. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary timescale of the iguanid lizard radiation using genome-wide exons and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Those data indicate that the closest living relative of extant Fijian iguanas is the North American desert iguana and that the two taxa likely diverged during the late Paleogene near or after the onset of volcanism that produced the Fijian archipelago. Biogeographic models estimate North America as the most probable ancestral range of Fijian iguanas. Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America, and which spanned a fifth of the earth’s circumference (&gt;8,000 km). Overwater rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji strengthens the importance of founder-event speciation in the diversification of iguanids and elucidates the scope of long-distance dispersal across terrestrial vertebrates.",

Upon severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, platelets become hyperactivated, releasing molecules such as cytokines, granule contents, and bioactive lipids. The key effector biolipids produced by platelets include 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and prostaglandins and thromboxane, produced by cyclooxygenase-1. While prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were previously associated with lung inflammation in severe COVID-19, the role of platelet 12-LOX in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using mice deficient for platelets’ 12-LOX, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher lung inflammation characterized by histopathological tissue analysis, increased leukocyte infiltrates, and cytokine production relative to wild-type mice. In addition, distinct platelet and lung transcriptomic changes, including alterations in NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome-related gene expression, were observed. Mass spectrometry lipidomic analysis in 12-LOX-deficient-infected mice revealed significant changes in bioactive lipid content, including reduced levels of 12-HETrE that inversely correlated with disease severity. Finally, platelet 12-LOX deficiency was associated with increased morbidity and lower survival rates relative to wild type (WT) mice. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between 12-LOX-related lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating severe outcomes, emphasizing the pivotal role of platelet enzymes in the host response to viral infections.",

After adding Ac-CoA, the single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and cryo-EM data indicated that pNuA4 prefers to bind H4 and undergoes a dynamic conformational change to complete the acetylation. We also obtained previously unseen structures in states associated with the acetylation of H2A.Z. These cryo-EM structures and smFRET results suggest a complex acetylation process on H4 and H2A.Z by pNuA4. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanism by which pNuA4 acetylates its substrates within an H2A.Z-containing nucleosome.",

Individual complexes have been extensively studied in vitro, but functional co-reconstitution of several mammalian complexes into proteoliposomes, in particular, the combination of a primary pump with the ATP synthase, is less well understood. Here, we present a generic and scalable strategy to purify mammalian respiratory complexes I, III and the ATP synthase from enriched mitochondria in enzymatically fully active form, and procedures to reassemble the complexes into liposomes. A robust functionality can be shown by in situ monitoring of ATP synthesis rates and by using selected inhibitors of the respiratory chain complexes. By inclusion of cytochrome c oxidase, our procedures allowed us to reconstruct the entire mitochondrial respiratory chain (complexes I, III, IV, and V) in ubiquinone Q 10 containing liposomes, demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen driven ATP synthesis. The system was fully coupled at all levels and was used to probe cardiolipin as an essential component to activate the mammalian respiratory chain. Structural characterization using electron cryomicroscopy allowed us to resolve apo-state complex III and complex V at high and medium resolution, respectively, using in silico particle sorting, confirming the presence of all protein subunits and cofactors in native stoichiometry and conformation. The reported findings will facilitate future endeavors to characterize or modulate these key bioenergetic processes.",

          "abstract": "The high resource intensity of industrial beef in high-income economies has prompted growing interest in alternative, potentially lower environmental impact beef production pathways. Of those, grass feeding is promoted by some as one such alternative, but rigorous quantification of this claim is required. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap, we integrate empirical evidence with a model based on authoritative equations governing beef cattle performance to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of producing grass-fed beef. Because geographical specificity and dependence on agricultural intensity are key, we model widely varied herds, from extensive operations on semiarid, marginal rangelands to partially industrial, intensive ones in lusher, more accommodating settings. We find that emissions per kg protein of even the most efficient grass-fed beef are 10 to 25% higher than those of industrial US beef and 3- to over 40-fold higher than a wide range of plant and animal alternatives. Soil sequestration enhancement by rangeland grazing reduces these emissions from 280–390 to 180–290 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , still somewhat above industrial beef’s 180 to 220 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , and well above nonbeef alternatives’ 10 to 70 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 . These differences prove robust across a broad set of combinations of grass-fed beef operation types, management practices, and ration qualities. Consequently, even with maximal credit for putative sequestration enhancement, grass-fed beef is still no less carbon intensive than industrial beef, and severalfold more intensive than nonbeef alternatives.",

          "abstract": "Motile cilia are organelles found on many eukaryotic cells that play critical roles in development and fertility. Human CFAP298 has been implicated in the transport/assembly of ciliary dyneins, and defects in this protein cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, neither the exact function nor the structure of CFAP298 have been elucidated. Here, we took advantage of Chlamydomonas , a ciliated alga, to study the structure and function of FBB18, an ortholog of CFAP298. Multiple ciliary dyneins were greatly reduced in cilia of Chlamydomonas fbb18 mutants. In addition, we found that both the stability of ciliary dynein heavy chains (HCs) and the association between HCs and intermediate/light chains (IC/LCs) are greatly reduced in fbb18 cytoplasm, strongly suggesting that FBB18 functions in the cytoplasmic assembly (the so-called “preassembly”) of dynein complexes from HC/IC/LCs. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography revealed that FBB18 forms a bilobed structure with globular domains at both ends of the molecule, connected by an α-helical bundle. Unexpectedly, one globular domain shows high similarity to ubiquitin, a small protein critical for the modification of a variety of protein complexes, and this ubiquitin-like domain is indispensable for the molecular function of FBB18. Our results demonstrate that FBB18, a specialized member of the ubiquitin-like protein family, plays a critical role in dynein preassembly, most likely by mediating diverse interactions between dynein HCs, molecular chaperone(s), and other preassembly factor(s) using the ubiquitin-like domain as well as other regions, and by facilitating the proper folding of dynein HCs.",

Mechanistically, androgens directly activate AR-positive CRH neurons, enhancing the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation. This results in elevated corticosterone levels in response to restraint stress, leading to increased immune cell apoptosis and immune organ atrophy in male mice. Conditional knockout of ARs in CRH neurons eliminated this sexual dimorphism, highlighting ARs in CRH neurons as pivotal regulators of sex-specific immune responses to stress.",

          "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are closely related mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses that share common transmission cycle and can infect humans. However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells. We conclude that MITD1 plays a key role in the cellular defenses against neurotropic flaviviruses.",

Epidemiological dynamics of many infectious diseases have highlighted the importance of considering the demographics of the societies in which they spread, particularly with respect to age structure. In addition, the waves of the recent COVID-19 pandemic driven by variant replacements at an unprecedented speed show that it is vital to consider the evolutionary aspects. The classic trade-off theory of virulence addresses aspects of pathogen evolution, but here we explore in more detail the possibility of society-specific evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) during an unfolding pandemic. Theory posits the existence under some conditions of an ESS representing the evolutionary endpoint of change. By using a demographically realistic model incorporating infection rates that vary with age, we outline which evolutionary scenarios are plausible. Focusing on the rate of infection and duration of infectivity, we ask whether an ESS exists, what characterizes it, and as a result which long-term public-health consequences may be expected. We demonstrate that the ESS of an evolving pathogen depends upon the background age-dependent frailty and mortality rates. Our findings shed important light on the plausible long-term trajectories of highly evolvable novel pathogens.",

          "abstract": "The phenological timing of leaf out in temperate forests is a critical transition point each year that alters the global climate system, which in turn, feeds back to plants, driving leaf out to occur nearly 3 d earlier per decade as temperatures rise. To improve predictions of leaf out timing, urban heat islands (UHIs) or densely developed areas that are hotter than surrounding undeveloped regions are often used to approximate warming via space-for-time substitutions (i.e., rural-to-urban temperature gradients). However, more than just environment changes along these gradients—urban regions are highly managed systems with limited-to-no within species diversity. We demonstrate here that recent observations that UHI gradients underpredict leaf out response to temperature when compared to temperature gradients through time is likely because both genetics and environment are changing across rural-to-urban gradients, whereas only environment is changing through time. We tested this hypothesis using genomic, phenological, and temperature data of northern red oak ( Quercus rubra ) over several years between an urban and rural site. Across our gradient, models that included just temperature predicted moderate advancement of leaf out. However, if we account for the genetic diversity of our trees in our model, leaf out phenology is predicted to advance significantly more in response to temperature. We demonstrate that this stronger relationship between phenological timing and climate is because urban trees have reduced genetic diversity as they are planted from limited stock by humans and, moreover, are most closely related to individuals at the rural site that leaf out later on average.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen responsible for numerous antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying vulnerabilities in S. aureus is crucial for developing new antibiotics to treat these infections. With this in mind, we probed the function of GdpS, a conserved Staphylococcal membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic GGDEF domain. These domains are canonically involved in cyclic-di-GMP signaling processes, but S. aureus is not known to make cyclic-di-GMP. Using a transposon screen, we found that loss of GdpS is lethal when combined with disruption in synthesis of the glycolipid anchor of a cell surface polymer called lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or with deletion of genes important in cell division. Taking advantage of a small molecule that inhibits LTA glycolipid anchor synthesis, we selected for suppressors of Δ gdpS lethality. The most prevalent suppressors were hypermorphic alleles of dgkB , which encodes a soluble diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase required to recycle DAG to phosphatidylglycerol. By following up on these suppressors, we found that the GGDEF domain of GdpS interacts directly with DgkB, orienting its active site at the membrane to promote DAG recycling. DAG kinase hypermorphs also suppressed the lethality caused by combined loss of gdpS and cell division factors, highlighting the importance of lipid homeostasis for cell division. GdpS’ positive regulation of DAG kinase function was dependent on the GGDEF domain but not its catalytic residues. As the sole conserved GGDEF-domain protein in Staphylococci, GdpS promotes an enzymatic process independent of cyclic-di-GMP signaling, revealing a new function for the ubiquitously conserved GGDEF domain.",

Currently, antibody candidates are exhaustively tested one-by-one in animal models to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles. The simultaneous analysis of antibody mixtures in single animals, called cassette-dosing, could in principle overcome this bottleneck, but is currently limited to small cassette sizes. Here, we demonstrate how the use of genetically encoded peptide tags (flycodes), designed for maximal detectability in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, can allow for the simultaneous characterization of large pools of drug candidates, from single cassette–dosed mice. We demonstrate the simultaneous assessment of PK parameters for a group of &gt;20 marketed/development-stage antibodies. Biodistribution experiments in mice bearing EGFR-expressing tumors correctly identified the two pool members recognizing EGFR, while organ analysis registered liver accumulation of an antibody targeting glucagon receptor, a protein profoundly expressed in that organ. In analogy to an early-phase drug development campaign, we performed biophysical and PK analysis for a cassette of 80 unique bispecific DARPin-sybody molecules. The data shown in this study originate from only 18 cassette-dosed mice, thereby demonstrating how flycode technology efficiently advances preclinical discovery pipelines allowing a direct comparison of drug candidates under identical experimental conditions.",

As a result, calibrating mammalian evolution has been largely restricted to the semicircular application of paleomagnetic inferences combined with temporally ill-constrained and geographically remote biochronological deductions. For example, fossils from three Greek localities and one Anatolian locality assigned to the primate genus Ouranopithecus lack datable samples, leaving its ages poorly constrained.

          "abstract": "Why are jellyfish round? Animals get their shapes as they develop. After development, however, how animals keep their shapes is less understood. Moon jellies respond to perturbations to body shape, such as being halved or quartered, by reorganizing existing body parts and regaining radial symmetry, i.e., their round shape. The robust recovery of radial symmetry led us to investigate, in this study, how being round is encoded. We tested perturbing shape by grafting body sections in varying configurations. Testing these perturbations confirms the moon jellies’ ability to recover their round shape from many perturbations. However, in response to some perturbations, the jellies can also adopt other stable body shapes, such as oval, quadrilateral, and triangular. Thus, although the jellies are characterized by a radially symmetrical body plan, perturbations can lead to them recovering to bilateral shapes. Employing mathematical modeling, we find that interactions between forces from muscle contractions and viscoelastic tissues can explain the recovery to different shapes. A stable body shape is achieved when the mechanical forces are locally balanced, regardless of symmetry. Consistent with the model prediction that stable shape is the outcome of balancing mechanical forces, modulating the mechanical parameter in the system, i.e., the muscle contraction rate, can produce shape-shifting. Maintaining shapes dynamically as the balance of mechanical forces may enable the animals to readily adapt to changing physical environments.",

Here, we present results from a Lagrangian metatranscriptomic time series survey in the Sargasso Sea and demonstrate temporally partitioned phosphorus uptake in this phosphorus-limited environment. In the Sargasso, heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria express genes for phosphorus assimilation during the morning, day, and dusk, respectively.

To date, there is no fundamental understanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and alters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have identified a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well’s radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.",

          "abstract": "Delivering audible content to a targeted listener without disturbing others is paramount in audio engineering. However, achieving this goal has long been challenging due to the diffraction of low-frequency (long-wavelength) audio waves in linear acoustics. Here, we introduce an approach for creating remote audio spots, dubbed audible enclaves, by harnessing the local nonlinear interaction of two self-bending ultrasonic beams with distinct spectra. The self-bending ultrasonic beams created by acoustic metasurfaces, though inaudible, can bypass obstacles such as human heads. At their intersection behind obstacles, highly localized audible enclaves are formed due to the local nonlinear interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the ultrabroadband capabilities of our metasurface-based implementation both numerically and experimentally, spanning from 125 Hz to 4 kHz (6 octave bands), covering the majority of the audible frequency range. The practicality of our proposed technique is underscored by its compact implementation size (0.16 m, equivalent to 0.06 wavelengths at 125 Hz), as well as its robust performance under wideband transient audio signal excitation and in a common room with reverberations. Our proposed audible enclaves hold significant potential for various applications in advanced audio engineering, including private speech communications, immersive spatial audio reproduction, and high-resolution sound/quiet zone control.",

          "abstract": "The mandible, also known as the lower jaw, is the only bone in the skull that can move and is essential for speaking and chewing. Meckel’s cartilage (MC) is a temporary structure that supports the formation of the mandible, but how MC is involved in the ossification of the mandible is poorly understood. Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses, a spatiotemporal atlas of MC in human fetuses from 7 to 15 wk postconception was established, highlighting the role of MC in the ossification of the mandible. Importantly, we revealed that two populations of MC contributed to mandibular ossification through different mechanisms. The anterior MC can differentiate into osteolineage cells, as shown in an in vivo lineage tracing mouse model. The intermediate MC facilitates intramembranous ossification through cell–cell communications, possibly through signaling ligands like BMP5 , BMP7 , SEMA3A , PDGFC , and FGF7 . This study suggests that MC plays a crucial role in mediating mandibular ossification through distinct mechanisms, providing valuable insights for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders in the future.",

Away from the exactly solvable regions, the steady state can be obtained numerically for 100s to 1,000s of sites. We study the nonequilibrium phase diagram and phase transitions, which qualitatively matches the equilibrium phase diagram, agreeing with the intuition that increasing the intensity of the light is equivalent to changing the bosonic chemical potential.

          "abstract": "At the end of their growth phase, Drosophila larvae remodel their bodies, glue themselves to a substrate, and harden their cuticle in preparation for metamorphosis. This process—termed pupariation—is triggered by a surge in the hormone ecdysone. Substrate attachment is achieved by a pupariation subprogram called glue expulsion and spreading behavior (GSB). An epidermis-to-CNS Dilp8-Lgr3 relaxin signaling event that occurs downstream of ecdysone is critical for unlocking progression of the pupariation motor program toward GSB, but the factors and circuits acting downstream of Lgr3 signaling remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific RNA interference and behavioral monitoring, we identify Myoinhibiting peptide (Mip) as a neuromodulator of multiple GSB action components, such as tetanic contraction, peristaltic contraction alternation, and head-waving. Mip is required in a pair of brain descending neurons, which act temporally downstream of Dilp8-Lgr3 signaling. Mip modulates GSB via ventral nerve cord neurons expressing its conserved receptor, sex peptide receptor (SPR). Silencing of Mip descending neurons by hyperpolarization completely abrogates GSB, while their optogenetic activation at a restricted competence time window triggers GSB-like behavior. Hence, Mip descending neurons have at least two functions: to act as GSB command neurons and to secrete Mip to modulate GSB action components. Our results provide insight into conserved aspects of Mip-SPR signaling in animals, reveal the complexity of GSB control, and contribute to the understanding of how multistep innate behaviors are coordinated in time and with other developmental processes through command neurons and neuropeptidergic signaling.",

However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little response to diverse nonlinguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and programming languages. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n = 19 speakers) and four fictional conlangs [Klingon (n = 10), Na’vi (n = 9), High Valyrian (n = 3), and Dothraki (n = 3)]. These findings suggest that conlangs and natural languages share critical features that allow them to draw on the same representations and computations, implemented in the left-lateralized network of brain areas. The features of conlangs that differentiate them from natural languages—including recent creation by a single individual, often for an esoteric purpose, the small number of speakers, and the fact that these languages are typically learned in adulthood—appear to not be consequential for the reliance on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. We argue that the critical shared feature of conlangs and natural languages is that they are symbolic systems capable of expressing an open-ended range of meanings about our outer and inner worlds.",

Such interactions motivate general investigations into the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite exchanges. Here we study by experiment and theory a model system: a coculture of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis , an obligate aerobe that is chemotactic to oxygen, and a nonmotile mutant of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , which photosynthetically produces oxygen when illuminated. Strikingly, when a shaft of light illuminates a thin, initially uniform suspension of the two, the chemotactic influx of bacteria to the photosynthetically active region leads to expulsion of the algae from that area. We propose that this effect arises from advection by the inhomogeneous bacterial concentration. The resulting generalization of Fick’s law has been proposed in the context of chemotaxis and is mathematically related to the “turbulent pumping” in magnetohydrodynamics.",

HLA-G, a nonclassical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule exclusively expressed in extravillous trophoblasts (EVT), is a crucial factor in establishing maternal–fetal immune tolerance by interacting with inhibitory receptors on various maternal immune cells residing in the uterus. While trophoblast-specific cis-regulatory elements impacting HLA-G transcription have been described, the identity of trans-acting factors controlling HLA-G expression in EVT remains poorly understood. Utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we find that the WNT signaling pathway negatively regulates HLA-G expression in EVT. In addition, we identified two trophoblast-specific transcription factors, TEAD1 and TEAD3, required for HLA-G transcription in EVT in a Yes-associated protein-independent manner. Altogether, we systematically elucidated essential genes and pathways underlying HLA-G expression in EVT, shedding light on the mechanisms of maternal–fetal tolerance and potentially providing insights into controlling HLA-G expression beyond EVT to protect allogeneic cells from immune rejection.",

To date, PEARLs have been reported that can conjugate Cys, Ala, Trp, Gly, Leu, Asn, and Thr residues, but the basis of peptide substrate and aminoacyl-tRNA recognition is not known. Cell-free expression (CFE) has emerged as a powerful tool to rapidly assay activity of substrate variants, and we used the technique in this study to investigate the peptide substrate specificity of the PEARL B h a B C T r p . This enzyme that adds Trp was discovered previously during genome mining for ribosomally synthesized and posttranslational modified peptides (RiPPs). The enzyme is remarkably tolerant of changes to the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide substrate, and truncation and replacement experiments suggest a minimal sequence requirement. An AlphaFold3 model provided insights into binding interactions of the substrate peptide BhaA-Ala to B h a B C T r p and also generated predictions for tRNA, ATP, and Mg 2+ binding modes that were tested by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that several highly conserved residues in PEARLs recognize the 3′-CCA sequence present in all tRNAs. The minimal sequence required for Trp incorporation by B h a B C T r p was employed as a protein tag for C-terminal labeling of eGFP, lysozyme, and MBP with Trp and 5-Br-Trp.",

          "abstract": "PAS domains are ubiquitous sensory modules that transduce environmental signals into cellular responses through tandem PAS folds and PAS-associated C-terminal (PAC) motifs. While this conserved architecture underpins their regulatory roles, here we uncover a structural divergence in the metazoan PAS domain–regulated kinase (PASK). By integrating evolutionary-scale domain mapping with deep learning-based structural models, we identified two PAS domains in PASK, namely PAS-B and PAS-C, in addition to the previously known PAS-A domain. Unlike canonical PAS domains, the PAS fold and PAC motif in the PAS-C domain are spatially segregated by an unstructured linker, yet a functional PAS module is assembled through intramolecular interactions. We demonstrate that this assembly is nutrient responsive and serves to remodel the quaternary structure of PASK that positions the PAS-A domain near the kinase activation loop. This nutrient-sensitive spatial arrangement stabilizes the activation loop, enabling catalytic activation of PASK. These findings revealed an alternative mode of regulatory control in PAS sensory proteins, where the structural assembly of PAS domains links environmental sensing to enzymatic activity. By demonstrating that PAS domains integrate signals through dynamic structural rearrangements, this study broadens the understanding of their functional and regulatory roles and highlights potential opportunities for targeting PAS domain–mediated pathways in therapeutic applications.",

The structural ensembles reveal a progressive decrease in compartmentalization from interphase to mitosis, accompanied by the appearance of a second diagonal in prometaphase, indicating an organized array of loops.

Genome analysis indicated that members of CSP1-3 were actively replicating in situ and were widely involved in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. We identified potential adaptive traits of CSP1-3 members for the oligotrophic deep soil environments, including a mixotrophic lifestyle, flexible energy metabolisms, and conservation pathways. The ancestor of CSP1-3 likely originated in an aquatic environment, subsequently colonizing topsoil and, later, deep soil environments, with major CSP1-3 clades adapted to each of these distinct niches. The transition into the terrestrial environment was associated with genome expansion, including the horizontal acquisition of a range of genes for carbohydrate and energy metabolism and, in one lineage, high-affinity terminal oxidases to support a microaerophilic lifestyle.

In vitro without antibiotics, wild-type Mtb hastens death of the macrophages, but the processes leading to rapid cell death are not well understood. Our earlier work indicated that the death of Mtb-infected mouse macrophages in vitro is markedly exacerbated by induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) [L. Zhang et al., J. Exp. Med. 18 , e20200887 (2021)]. Here, we identified a key downstream response to IFN-β in the context of Mtb infection as the massive induction of cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), not only in its canonical subcellular localization in mitochondria but also in the cytosol, where it bound to the lysosome-stabilizing protein HSP70. ACOD1’s product, itaconate, protected Mtb-infected macrophages. However, the contrasting and predominant effect of high-level ACOD1 expression was to act in a noncatalytic manner to promote HSP70’s degradation, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Mtb-induced macrophage death was markedly diminished by inhibitors of cysteine proteases, consistent with lysosome-mediated cell death. Neither ACOD1 inhibitors nor cysteine protease inhibitors are suitable for potential host-directed therapy (HDT) of tuberculosis. Instead, this work directs attention to how ACOD1 acts nonenzymatically to promote the degradation of HSP70.",

          "abstract": "A sustained blood supply is critical for tumor growth, as it delivers the nutrients and oxygen required for development. Targeting of blood vessel formation via immunotherapies is an area of great importance. Knowing that certain embryonic genes, such as carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and oncofetal fibronectin, become reexpressed in malignant transformation, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon holds true for tumor endothelial cells (TECs) as well. An approach for identification of highly selective tumor endothelial markers was conducted to develop targeted antiangiogenic immunotherapies. We first queried the transcriptome that is present during embryo development. We then performed a systematic search for genes selectively expressed in the mouse embryo at days E11 and E18, as compared to the transcriptome of the adult mouse. Subsequently, we queried for expression of these embryonic genes in sorted murine TECs. This approach identified among others the tumor endothelial antigens fibrillin-2 (Fbn2), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 2 (Emilin2) as well as the tumor endothelial antigens lysyl oxidase (Lox) and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1; Pai-1). For these selected genes, functional involvement in angiogenesis was confirmed in in vitro bioassays. We subsequently used iBoost conjugate vaccine technology to develop vaccines against the selected targets. For all four targets, vaccination readily induced target-specific antibody responses in mice, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Access to highly specific tumor endothelial markers provides opportunities for direct targeting of the tumor vasculature with high specificity, without affecting healthy vasculature.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between humans and pigs has changed dramatically since their domestication in southwest Asia and subsequent human-induced introduction into Europe. Introgression between incoming southwest Asian pigs and European boar resulted in the gradual replacement of southwest Asian ancestry in European pigs. However, we currently lack genomic data required to explore the regional trajectories, nature, and extent of contact between European boar and pigs that led to this turnover, and how this process was facilitated by human activity. We addressed this deficit by sequencing four Mesolithic boar and seven Neolithic pig samples from six archaeological sites in the Netherlands and Britain ranging from the Mesolithic (5500 BCE) to Neolithic (2500 BCE). Our data show that despite continuous gene flow with European boar, Neolithic European pigs show varying levels of southwest Asian ancestry. The low and varying southwest Asian ancestry in pigs from the Early Neolithic Dutch settlement Swifterbant indicates a high contribution of wild ancestry. The genetic profile, enriched δ 15 N values, on-site presence, and wide size distribution of Swifterbant Sus scrofa suggest a commensal relationship. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) imply that both closed-breeding and free-ranging management occurred in Neolithic communities, where the former showed an extreme burden of long segments of ROH.

          "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) can achieve near-unity quantum efficiency of light harvesting in ideal conditions and can dissipate excess light energy as heat to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light stress. Understanding how this pigment–protein complex accomplishes these opposing goals is a topic of great interest that has so far been explored primarily through the lens of the system energetics. Despite PSII’s known flat energy landscape, a thorough consideration of the entropic effects on energy transfer in PSII is lacking. In this work, we aim to discern the free energetic design principles underlying the PSII energy transfer network. To accomplish this goal, we employ a structure-based rate matrix and compute the free energy terms in time following a specific initial excitation to discern how entropy and enthalpy drive ensemble system dynamics. We find that the interplay between the entropy and enthalpy components differ among each protein subunit, which allows each subunit to fulfill a unique role in the energy transfer network. This individuality ensures that PSII can accomplish efficient energy trapping in the reaction center (RC), effective nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the periphery, and robust energy trapping in the other-monomer RC if the same-monomer RC is closed. We also show that entropy, in particular, is a dynamically tunable feature of the PSII free energy landscape accomplished through regulation of LHCII binding. These findings help rationalize natural photosynthesis and provide design principles for more efficient solar energy harvesting technologies.",

          "abstract": "Plants produce diverse specialized metabolites with important ecological functions. It has recently become apparent that the genes for many of these pathways are not dispersed in plant genomes, but rather are arranged like beads on a string in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Pathways encoded by BGCs are as a rule dedicated linear pathways that do not form parts of wider metabolic networks. In contrast, the genes for the biosynthesis of widely distributed more ancestral metabolites such as carotenoids and anthocyanins are not clustered. Little is known about how these more recently evolved clustered pathways interact with general plant metabolism. We recently characterized a 12-gene BGC for the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial defense compound avenacin A-1, a triterpene glycoside produced by oats. Avenacin A-1 is acylated with the fluorophore N -methyl anthranilate and confers bright blue fluorescence of oat root tips under ultraviolet light. Here, we exploit a suite of &gt;100 avenacin-deficient mutants identified by screening for reduced root fluorescence to identify genes required for the function of this paradigm BGC. Using a combination of mutant chemotyping, biochemical and molecular analysis, and genome resequencing, we identify two nonclustered genes ( Sad4 and Pal2 ) encoding enzymes that synthesize the donors required for avenacin glycosylation and acylation (recruited from the phenylpropanoid and tryptophan pathways). Our finding of these Cluster Auxiliary Enzymes (CAEs) provides insights into the interplay between general plant metabolism and a newly evolved lineage-specific BGC.",

However, broadening their clinical utility remains a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a high-throughput kinase inhibitor screen to identify potential targets exhibiting synthetical lethality with PARP inhibitors. Our results show that thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAOK1) plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response by phosphorylating ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7), thereby promoting its enzymatic activity and preventing the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RAD51, a crucial protein in the filament formation of HR repair. Notably, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TAOK1, as well as blocking peptide targeting the USP7 phosphorylation site, impaired USP7 function, leading to RAD51 degradation, disruption of HR repair, and increased tumor cell and sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This study highlights TAOK1 as a critical regulator of HR repair pathway in human cancer cells and presents a therapeutic strategy overcoming resistance to PARPi inhibitors. These findings support the potential clinical application of combining PARP inhibitors with TAOK1 inhibition or peptide treatment to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

In this study, we observed lower Forkhead box protein O3 (FoxO3), a transcription factor associated with cellular oxidative stress, enhanced osteoclastogenesis in osteoporosis (OP). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on the human femoral head indicated that FoxO3 is widely expressed in macrophages. Furthermore, Lysm-Cre;FoxO3 f/f OVX mice showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and more bone loss than normal OVX mice. Mechanistically, we identified FoxO3 promoter methylation as a crucial factor contributing to decreased FoxO3, thereby influencing osteoclastogenesis and OC function. Intriguingly, we observed that Dnmt3a, highly expressed during osteoclastogenesis, played a pivotal role in regulating the methylation of the FoxO3 promoter. Knockdown of Dnmt3a promoted FoxO3 expression, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and mitigating OP. Interestingly, we observed that Dnmt3a alleviated osteoclastogenesis by suppressing ROS via upregulating FoxO3 rather than inducing the dissociation of RANK and TRAF6. Collectively, this study elucidates the role and mechanism of FoxO3 in osteoclastogenesis and OP, providing a epigenetic target for the treatment of OP.",

However, the contribution of CAMs to opioid-induced rewiring of the reward circuit has not been explored. Here, we used unbiased molecular profiling to identify CAMs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) modulated by morphine administration. We found that opioid exposure induces the expression of ELFN1, a CAM selectively expressed in cholinergic interneurons in the NAc. We determined that ELFN1 acts trans-synaptically to modulate the strength and plasticity of the glutamatergic inputs onto cholinergic neurons via the recruitment of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4). Disruption of Elfn1 diminished morphine reward and intake in self-administering mice.

However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity.

Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.",

Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.",

Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite.

However, the molecular details of this process remain unclear. Here, we present high-resolution (up to 2.8 angstrom) cryo–electron microscopy structures of T. brucei flagellar doublet microtubules (DMTs). Integrated modeling identified 154 different axonemal proteins inside and outside the DMT and, together with genetic and proteomic interrogation, revealed conserved and trypanosome-specific foundations of flagellum assembly and motility. We captured axonemal dynein motors in their pre–power stroke state. Comparing atomic models between pre– and post–power strokes defined how dynein structural changes drive sliding of adjacent DMTs during flagellar beating. This study illuminates structural dynamics underlying flagellar motility and identifies pathogen-specific proteins to consider for therapeutic interventions targeting neglected diseases.",

However, little is known about the coloration of Mesozoic mammaliaforms that coevolved with dinosaurs. In this study, we used a dataset of melanosome (melanin-containing organelle) morphology and quantitatively measured hair colors from 116 extant mammals to reliably reconstruct the coloration of six Mesozoic mammaliaforms, including a previously undescribed euharamiyidan. Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality. Our results suggest that the melanosome variation and color expansion seen in extant mammals may have occurred during their rapid radiation and diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.",

          "abstract": "Interstellar dust grains cause extinction (absorption and scattering) of light from background astronomical sources. The spectral shape of the extinction curve depends on the dust composition. We used low-resolution optical spectra to measure the extinction curve of 130 million stars. By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameter R ( V ) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4 + T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt + APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses.",

Working in developing mouse cardiac morphogenesis models, we used a variety of cellular, imaging, and genetic approaches to elucidate this question. We found that myocardium and endocardium interacted directly through microstructures termed tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs). TNTLs extended from cardiomyocytes (CMs) to contact endocardial cells (ECs) directly. TNTLs transported cytoplasmic proteins, transduced signals between CMs and ECs, and initiated myocardial growth toward the heart lumen to form ventricular trabeculae-like structures. Loss of TNTLs disturbed signaling interactions and, subsequently, ventricular patterning.",

These materials exhibit shear PE strain coefficients that reach ~38 and 33 picocoulombs per newton in ZrNiSn and TiCoSb, respectively, which are high values for noncentrosymmetric nonpolar materials. We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor. The PE effect in HHs remains thermally stable up to 1173 kelvin, underscoring their potential for high-temperature applications.

In this work, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of DMTs from two trypanosomatid species, Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata , at resolutions up to 2.7 angstrom. The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior. Our study shows that proper B-tubule closure is critical for flagellar motility, exemplifying how integrating structural identification with systematic gene deletion can dissect individual protein contributions to flagellar motility.",

          "abstract": "The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.",

          "abstract": "Tissue stiffness plays a crucial role in regulating morphogenesis. The ability to measure and monitor the dynamic progression of tissue stiffness is important for generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. Methods to measure tissue properties in vivo have been emerging but present challenges with spatial and temporal resolution especially in 3D, by their reliance on highly specialized equipment, and/or due to their invasive nature. Here, we introduce light sheet elastography, a noninvasive method that couples low-frequency shear waves with light sheet fluorescence microscopy by adapting commercially available instruments. With this method, we achieved in toto stiffness mapping of organ-stage mouse and zebrafish embryos at cellular resolution. Versatility of the method enabled time-lapse stiffness mapping during tissue remodeling and of the beating embryonic heart. This method expands the spectrum of tools available to biologists and presents opportunities for uncovering the mechanical basis of morphogenesis.",

A 30-m-long sediment core from the Great Blue Hole, a marine sinkhole offshore Belize, provides the longest available, continuous, and annually resolved TC-frequency record. This record expands our understanding, derived from instrumental monitoring (73 years), historical documentations (173 years), and paleotempestological records (2000 years), to the past 5700 years. A total of 694 event layers were identified. They display a distinct regional trend of increasing storminess in the southwestern Caribbean, which follows an orbitally driven shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Superimposed short-term variations match Holocene climate intervals and originate from solar irradiance–controlled sea-surface temperature anomalies and climate phenomena modes. A 21st-century extrapolation suggests an unprecedented increase in TC frequency, attributable to the Industrial Age warming.",

Here, we produce 100-million-membered macrocyclic libraries containing natural and nonnatural amino acids. Near-quantitative intramolecular disulfide formation is facilitated by rapid oxidation with iodine in solution. After use in affinity selection, treatment with dithiothreitol enables near-quantitative reduction, rendering linear peptide analogs for standard tandem mass spectrometry. We use these libraries to discover macrocyclic binders to cadherin-2 and anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone 12ca5. Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar). Overall, we expect that this work will improve the use of macrocyclic libraries in therapeutic peptide development.",

Radiocarbon analyses indicate the hidden occurrence of younger dissolved organic carbon components, assumed to be accessible to deep-sea microorganisms but not yet demonstrated. Using compound-class radiocarbon analysis, molecular characterization, and bioassay experiments, we provide direct evidence for rapid microbial utilization of young, labile, high–molecular weight proteinaceous material in bathypelagic waters. The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton. Our results indicate the presence of labile organic molecules at bathypelagic depths and reveal a nonlinear supply of plankton-derived substrates that support microbial metabolism and carbon sequestration in the deep ocean.",

Here, we developed acid-resistant, gut-environment–responsive composite microparticles based on microfluidic electrospray for the oral codelivery of probiotic [ Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA)] biofilm and postbiotics (indole-3-propionic acid). Montmorillonite was selected for supporting biofilm formation due to its cation-exchange capability and clearly defined biosafety. The montmorillonite-LA biofilm was effectively protected by the microparticles and markedly improved the intestinal retention. Upon oral administration, the composite microparticles notably alleviated colitis in mice, including reducing the inflammatory response, improving intestinal barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiota. Consequently, the composite microparticles show high potential for enhancing probiotic delivery efficacy and present a promising strategy for UC treatment.",

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.",

          "abstract": "Highly functionalized structural motifs with extended chiral carbon chains are prevalent in a wide range of bioactive compounds and play critical roles in the production of various functionalized molecules. Here, we describe a nickel-catalyzed asymmetric radical-based electrochemical functionalization of silyl polyenolates at α-, γ-, ε-, and η-positions. Driven by electric current, this methodology provides a sustainable route to access enantioenriched dicarbonyls via vinylogous radical pathways. It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide.",

By developing a Gαi-biased agonist (LM189), we provide structural and biophysical evidence supporting that distinct conformations at ICL2 and TM6 are required for coupling of the different G protein subtypes Gαs and Gαi.

This study explores low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) as a resuscitation strategy. Cervical LIPUS stimulation effectively elevated blood pressure in shocked rats. It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment. This method holds potential for improving blood pressure and organ perfusion in shock patients, especially in resource-limited environments.",

In this study, we characterized the function of y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in mammalian cells and determined the cryo-EM structures of the human y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in two distinct conformations: the apo state in an inward-open conformation and the native substrate-bound state in an outward-open conformation. Structural analysis suggests that Asp 243 in y + LAT1 plays a crucial role in coordination with sodium ion and substrate selectivity. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations further revealed the different transport mechanism of cationic amino acids and neutral amino acids.

Comparative characterization of PTEFb complex participation and chromatin binding indicates BRD4-redundant and BRD4-distinct BRDT functions. Unlike dual depletion, individual BRD4 or BRDT knockdown did not impair transcriptional responses to hypoxia in BRDT-expressing cells, consistent with redundant function. However, BRD4 depletion/BRDT complementation revealed that BRDT can also release paused RNA polymerase II independently of its bromodomains as we previously demonstrated not to be required for Pol II pause/release function of BRD4, underscoring the functional importance of the C-terminal domains in both BRD4 and BRDT and their potential as therapeutic targets in solid tumors.

Despite recent advances in understanding the disease etiology and applying emerging treatment methodologies, glucocorticoid derivatives remain the only general therapeutic option that can slow disease development. However, the precise molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action remains unclear, and there is still need for additional remedies to complement the treatment. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to Dmd mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids. Our analysis reveals pathogenic mechanisms that can be readily targeted by extant therapeutic options for DMD.",

We analyzed 22 steroids from 148 serum samples of individuals aged 20 to 73, using 98 samples for model training and 50 for validation. Our model reflects the often-overlooked fact that aging heterogeneity expands over time and uncovers sex-specific variations in steroidogenesis. This study leveraged key markers, including cortisol (COL), which underscore the role of stress-related and sex-specific steroids in aging. The resulting model establishes a biologically meaningful and robust framework for predicting BA across diverse datasets, offering fresh insights and supporting more targeted strategies in aging research and disease management.",

Our findings demonstrated that the nanosensor provided distinct signals in atherosclerotic versus healthy mice at early AS stages, indicating its diagnostic potential. Moreover, toxicity tests showed no notable adverse effects, supporting its safety for diagnostic applications.

          "abstract": "Implant-associated infections are urgently addressed; however, existing materials are difficult to kill bacteria without damaging cells. Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials.",

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with kidney diseases, but the causal variants, genes, and pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we identified a kidney disease gene called pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) through integrating GWAS on kidney function and multiomic analysis. PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction. These findings strongly support targeting PPDPF as a potential therapy for kidney fibrosis, offering possibilities for future CKD interventions.",

Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts. Our work unveiled that in A. deanei an endosymbiont division machinery of dual genetic origin evolved in which a neo-functionalized host protein compensates for losses of endosymbiont division genes.",

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 . The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 , thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants. Our findings reveal a critical role of SlKD1 in modulating the auxin-response gradient and abscission initiation.",

We analyze WUI fire impacts on air quality and health at the global scale using a multi-scale atmospheric chemistry model—the Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols model (MUSICA). WUI fires have notable impacts on key air pollutants [e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), and ozone (O 3 )]. The health impact of WUI fire emission is disproportionately large compared to wildland fires primarily because WUI fires are closer to human settlement. Globally, the fraction of WUI fire–caused annual premature deaths (APDs) to all fire–caused APDs is about three times of the fraction of WUI fire emissions to all fire emissions. The developed model framework can be applied to address critical needs in understanding and mitigating WUI fires and their impacts.",

Here, we use a bidentate molecule to control ripening toward a notable performance boost in CsPbI 3 QDs. The strong interaction between QDs and the bidentate molecules maintains stable surface states of QDs, inhibiting QDs’ undesirable ripening and generation of defects.

Two different approaches are needed to completely remove the dissolved colorants during the STRAP process including (i) adding an activated carbon (AC) adsorbent to the solvent after polymer dissolution and (ii) proper mechanical filtration of the polymer-solvent cake to remove as much solvent from the cake as possible. Colorless recycled PE can be produced by a combination of the proposed approaches (choosing the proper solvent, adding an AC adsorbent, and doing proper mechanical filtration) with minimal accumulation of colorants in the recycled STRAP solvents. This study demonstrated that high-quality STRAP low-density PE can be obtained from printed plastic films, enhancing the potential circularity of these packaging materials.",

A multivalent vaccine encapsulating both insoluble and soluble bacterial antigens was developed, addressing the shortcomings of traditional antibacterial vaccines by balancing broad antigen coverage with effective immune activation. This vaccine induces robust downstream immune responses to eliminate F. nucleatum , S. sanguis , E. faecalis , and S. xylosus , demonstrating notable therapeutic and preventive efficacy in bacteria-induced cancer metastasis models. Unexpectedly, vaccinated infected mice showed even slower tumor metastasis than uninfected mice. Overall, this study validates the potential of nanovaccines in modulating the intratumoral microbiome for tumor therapy and highlights tumor-associated bacterial infections as potential promising antitumor targets.",

This study focuses on the fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.",

Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any previous information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector.

The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O 2 and H 2 O, efficiently generating H 2 O 2 . The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H 2 O 2 /Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death.

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment. This research fills a critical gap in adhesion physics.",

These results underscore the important contribution of Bcl-xL to healthy aging, a phenomenon that is conserved across mammalian species.",

Inspired by the natural electrosensory capabilities of electrogenic fishes, we introduce an organic electrosense transistor designed to detect electric fields generated by nearby objects, facilitating the creation of impalpable perception systems. Unlike traditional sensors, our electrosense transistor perceives bipolar electric fields with high sensitivity and stability. We use compact models and device simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of charge induction and transport within organic electrosense transistors when exposed to spatial electric fields. Demonstrating its practical utility, we show that robots equipped with our electrosense transistor can successfully navigate and detect concealed objects without requiring direct contact. This work not only advances the understanding of charge dynamics in electrosensory systems but also establishes a platform for developing highly sensitive, noninvasive artificial sensing technologies applicable in surveillance, search and rescue, and other challenging environments.",

However, the structural origin of the large energy barriers preventing interconversion between these folding pathways is unknown. Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics.",

The hydrogen bonds shorter than 2.5 angstrom are expected to accelerate the ion transport. However, short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) can hardly form naturally because of the electron-withdrawing capability of O atom, which impedes its applications in water-mediated ion transport. This work develops an interlayer confinement strategy to construct SHB networks in a two-dimensional (2D) nanocapillary assembled by bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets and boost the ionic conductivity of HEMs. With confined nanochannels and adjustable hydrophilic groups in BiOI-based HEMs, the number of SHBs increases by 12 times, creating a shortcut for the Grotthuss-type anion transport, which in turn affords a high ionic conductivity of 168 millisiemens per centimeter at 90°C, higher than polymeric HEM and 2D-based HEM. This work demonstrates the facile approach to generating SHB networks in 2D capillaries and opens a promising avenue to developing advanced HEMs.",

The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes.",

Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties. These findings highlight B-site engineering as an effective microstructural strategy for controlling ion migration, with important implications for stable and lead-reduced perovskite devices.",

By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering.

While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective, timely and accurate HCV diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The current two-step HCV testing process is costly and time-intensive, often leading to patient loss before treatment. Point-of-care (POC) HCV antigen (Ag) testing offers a promising alternative, but no FDA-approved test meets the required sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed a fully automated, smartphone-based POC HCV Ag assay using platinum nanoparticles, deep learning image processing, and microfluidics.

          "abstract": "The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.",

We present terahertz (THz) spectra, which directly probe the intermolecular interactions of water under these extreme conditions. While we spectroscopically detect the liquid-gas phase transition just below the critical point, THz spectra of the high-temperature gas phase are indistinguishable from those of supercritical water at the same density.

We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, redefining standards in reflectometry. Our method, prior-amortized neural posterior estimation (PANPE), combines simulation-based inference with adaptive priors that inform the inference network about known structural properties and controllable experimental conditions.

By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels.

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.",

Here, we discovered a plant-derived noncanonical antibacterial peptide (NCBP1) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. NCBP1 is composed of 11 amino acid residues with cationic surface potential and favorable safety and stability. Mechanistic studies revealed that NCBP1 displayed antibacterial activity by targeting phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane damage and dysfunction. Notably, NCBP1 showed promising efficacy in mice. Furthermore, NCBP1 effectively inhibited the growth of plant fungal pathogens and enhanced disease resistance in maize. Our results demonstrate the unexplored antimicrobial potential of plant-derived NCPs and provide an accessible source for the discovery of antimicrobial substances against MDR bacterial and fungal pathogens.",

          "abstract": "High-throughput production of monodisperse microdroplets has revolutionized many fields, typically relying on shear-induced emulsification in intricate microfluidic channels to induce the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.",

          "abstract": "Chiral molecule sensing is typically performed using techniques like chromatography, electrophoresis, enzymatic assays, mass spectrometry, and chiroptical methods. While polarimetry allows for in vivo sensing up to 1 mm depth using ultraviolet-visible light, it is limited by dominant light scattering beyond this depth. We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing. PAPEORS holds promise for in vivo sensing and easy miniaturization using single wavelength.",

We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of eight different S-proteins from SARSr-CoVs found across Asia, Europe, and Africa. These S-proteins all adopt tightly packed, locked, prefusion conformations. These structures enable the classification of SARSr-CoV S-proteins into three types, based on their receptor-binding motif (RBM) structures and ACE2 binding characteristics. Type-2 S-proteins often preferentially bind bat ACE2 (bACE2) over hACE2. We report a structure of a type-2 BtKY72-RBD in complex with bACE2 to understand ACE2 specificity. Structure-guided mutagenesis of BtKY72-RBD reveals that multiple synergistic mutations in four different regions of RBM are required to achieve high-affinity hACE2 binding. Similar RBM changes can also confer hACE2 binding to another type-2 BM48-31 S-protein, which is primarily non-ACE2 binding. These results provide an understanding of how high-affinity hACE2 binding may be acquired by SARSr-CoV S-proteins.",

          "abstract": "When neutral water is sprayed, oppositely charged microdroplets are formed. The close approach of oppositely charged microdroplets causes an electrical discharge and leads to luminescent emission. The light emission happens without any external voltage applied, and the electrical discharge is sufficiently energetic to excite, dissociate, or ionize surrounding neutral gas molecules. Thus, sprayed water microdroplets cause chemical reactions to occur. Similar findings to the Urey-Miller experiment were observed by spraying room temperature water microdroplets into a gas mixture containing nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, which leads to the synthesis of organic molecules containing carbon-nitrogen (C─N) bonds. These observations provide another explanation for unique reactivity at the gas-water interface, as well as a possible mechanism for making the building blocks of life on early Earth.",

Here, we develop monolithically integrated solid-state vertical OECTs to fully explore polyelectrolyte’s strengths, enabling the OECTs to switch between neuromorphic and logic functions. This transition capability is achieved by mastering the complex transport of large-size polycations within the channel through well-designed drain electrodes. Frame drains positioned atop the organic channel act as ion barriers, regulating the penetration and relaxation of polycations. This regulation allows our multilevel synaptic OECTs to transform from short-term depression (STD) to STD-based long-term memory, and eventually to long-term depression (LTD). Conversely, placing frame drains beneath the channel exposes the polyelectrolyte fully, hence yielding high-density logic OECTs, which have been successfully used to construct unipolar integrated circuits such as NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These achievements represent a substantial advancement in manipulating polyelectrolyte-based ionic-electronic interactions, introducing more possibilities beyond small ion-based OECTs.",

          "abstract": "Nicotine is an addictive substance that poses substantial health and societal challenges. Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels. This discovery advances our understanding of neuronal excitability control and nicotine addiction.",

In this study, gate-induced ON-OFF switchable spin-orbit torque in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device using the ionic gating technique is reported. By canceling the spin currents from Pt layers, the OFF state is attained in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device. Notably, under a strong negative gate electric field applied to the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device, the damping-like spin-orbit torque is markedly enhanced over sixfold compared with the applied positive gate electric field. We show that the gate modulation of the spin-orbit torque in the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device can be explained by considering the change of the spin-charge interconversion by electric gating.

In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage. These findings suggest that nMITO is a promising therapeutic strategy for managing acute organ injuries.",

They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, modifying light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay enables spectral shaping for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities. Here, we propose a framework that uses interference of multiple transverse modes within a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our method applies to orthogonal modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, offering potential for sensing, calibration, metrology, and computing.",

          "abstract": "Whether the rapid warming of the Arctic, particularly the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS), substantially affects the Eurasian winter climate has been debated for over a decade. Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales. These findings advance the understanding of the complex causal relationships between Arctic and mid-latitude climates.",

However, the mechanism by which assembly occurs remains poorly understood, and few intermediate states are available to illuminate the expansion of meta-stable procapsids into robust mature capsids. Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.",

We find that cohabitation is positively associated with women’s and men’s wealth across contexts, without meaningful gender differences. For France, entering a Pacs (i.e. registered cohabitation) is associated with an additional premium beyond the (unregistered) cohabitation premium—though these effects may not be causal. Overall, our results suggest that the regulatory treatment of cohabitation plays a more significant role in shaping the wealth accumulation of cohabiting women and men than normative acceptance, while gender has little impact on the associated benefits.",
