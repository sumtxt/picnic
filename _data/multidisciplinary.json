          "abstract": "Signals from the microenvironment are known to be critical for development, stem cell self-renewal and oncogenic progression. Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified 1–5 , concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies 6 to identify LSC–niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine–taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.",

          "abstract": "Choice behaviour of animals is characterized by two main tendencies: taking actions that led to rewards and repeating past actions 1,2 . Theory suggests that these strategies may be reinforced by different types of dopaminergic teaching signals: reward prediction error to reinforce value-based associations and movement-based action prediction errors to reinforce value-free repetitive associations 3–6 . Here we use an auditory discrimination task in mice to show that movement-related dopamine activity in the tail of the striatum encodes the hypothesized action prediction error signal. Causal manipulations reveal that this prediction error serves as a value-free teaching signal that supports learning by reinforcing repeated associations. Computational modelling and experiments demonstrate that action prediction errors alone cannot support reward-guided learning, but when paired with the reward prediction error circuitry they serve to consolidate stable sound–action associations in a value-free manner. Together we show that there are two types of dopaminergic prediction errors that work in tandem to support learning, each reinforcing different types of association in different striatal areas.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical CO 2 reduction into chemicals and fuels holds great promise for renewable energy storage and carbon recycling 1–3 . Although high-temperature CO 2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolysis cells is industrially relevant, current catalysts have modest energy efficiency and a limited lifetime at high current densities, generally below 70% and 200 h, respectively, at 1 A cm − 2 and temperatures of 800 °C or higher 4–8 . Here we develop an encapsulated Co–Ni alloy catalyst using Sm 2 O 3 -doped CeO 2 that exhibits an energy efficiency of 90% and a lifetime of more than 2,000 h at 1 A cm − 2 for high-temperature CO 2 -to-CO conversion at 800 °C. Its selectivity towards CO is about 100%, and its single-pass yield reaches 90%. We show that the efficacy of our catalyst arises from its unique encapsulated structure and optimized alloy composition, which simultaneously enable enhanced CO 2 adsorption, moderate CO adsorption and suppressed metal agglomeration. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design of catalysts for high-temperature reactions that overcomes the typical trade-off between activity and stability and has potential industrial applications.",

          "abstract": "The human cerebral cortex is composed of six layers and dozens of areas that are molecularly and structurally distinct 1–4 . Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have advanced the molecular characterization of human cortical development, a substantial gap exists owing to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation 5–8 . Here we used multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) 9 , augmented with deep-learning-based nucleus segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular and cytoarchitectural development of the human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing more than 18 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across seven developmental time points. We uncovered the early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable by the laminar distribution of excitatory neuron subtypes, 3 months before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, we discovered two distinct modes of cortical areal specification during mid-gestation: (1) a continuous, gradual transition observed across most cortical areas along the anterior–posterior axis and (2) a discrete, abrupt boundary specifically identified between the primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortices as early as gestational week 20. This sharp binary transition in V1–V2 neuronal subtypes challenges the notion that mid-gestation cortical arealization involves only gradient-like transitions 6,10 . Furthermore, integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with MERFISH revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific layer 4 neurons. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This study establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm and paves the way for the construction of a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.",

          "abstract": "In quantum mechanics, empty space is not void but is characterized by vacuum-field fluctuations, which underlie phenomena such as the Lamb shift 1 , spontaneous emission, and the Casimir effect 2 . Due to their quantitatively small relative contributions in free-space atomic physics, they were traditionally overlooked in solid-state systems. Recently, however, the interplay between electronic correlations and quantum electrodynamical effects in low-dimensional systems has become a rapidly advancing area in condensed matter physics 3–5 , with substantial implications for quantum materials and device engineering. High-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime 6 offer an ideal platform to investigate how vacuum electromagnetic fields affect strongly correlated electronic states. Here we demonstrate that adjusting the coupling strength between a two-dimensional electron gas and the vacuum fields of a hovering split-ring resonator leads to a significant reduction in exchange splitting at odd-integer filling factors, along with an enhancement of fractional quantum Hall gaps at filling factors 4/3, 5/3 and 7/5. Theoretical analysis indicates that these effects stem from an effective long-range attractive interaction mediated by virtual cavity photons in regions with strong vacuum electric field gradients. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which cavity vacuum fields can reshape electronic correlations in quantum Hall systems, establishing a new approach for manipulating correlated quantum phases in low-dimensional materials and paving the way for engineering tailored many-body interactions in compact devices.",

These tests have been realized, for example, in antiprotonic helium 3 and antihydrogen 4 . In our cryogenic Penning-trap experiments 5 , we measure the magnetic moments 6,7 and charge-to-mass ratios of protons and antiprotons and now provide the most precise test of CPT invariance in the baryon sector 8 . Our experiments are limited by magnetic field fluctuations imposed by the decelerators in the AMF; therefore, we are advancing the relocation of antiprotons to dedicated precision laboratories. Here we present the successful transport of a trapped proton cloud from the AMF using BASE-STEP 9 —a transportable, superconducting, autonomous and open Penning-trap system that can distribute antiprotons into other experiments. We transferred the trapped protons from our experimental area at the AMF onto a truck and transported them across the Meyrin site of CERN, demonstrating autonomous operation without external power for 4 h and loss-free proton relocation. We thereby confirm the feasibility of transferring particles into low-noise laboratories in the vicinity of the AMF and of using a power generator on the truck 10 to reach laboratories throughout Europe. This marks the potential start of a new era in precision antimatter research, enabling low-noise measurements of antiprotons, the charged antimatter ions $${\\bar{{\\rm{H}}}}^{+}$$ H ¯ + 11 and $${\\bar{{\\rm{H}}}}_{2}^{-}$$ H ¯ 2 − (ref. 12 ), and other accelerator-produced ions, such as hydrogen-like lead or uranium ions 13,14 .",

We use data from the NASA GRAIL spacecraft 5–9 to recover the time-varying lunar gravity field, including a degree-3 gravitational tidal Love number, k 3 . Here, we report our estimated value of k 3 = 0.0163 ± 0.0007, which is about 72% higher than that expected for a spherically symmetric moon 10 . Such a large k 3 can be explained if the elastic shear modulus of the mantle varies by about 2–3% between the nearside and farside 4 , providing an observational demonstration of lateral heterogeneities in the deep lunar interior. This asymmetric structure suggests preservation of a predominantly thermal anomaly of roughly 100–200 K in the nearside mantle that formed surface mare regions 3–4 billion years ago 11 and could influence the spatial distribution of deep moonquakes 12 .",

          "abstract": "Based on seminal work in placental species (eutherians) 1–10 , a paradigm of mammalian development has emerged wherein the genome-wide erasure of parental DNA methylation is required for embryogenesis. Whether such DNA methylation reprogramming is, in fact, conserved in other mammals is unknown. Here, to resolve this point, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps in gametes, embryos and adult tissues of a marsupial, the opossum Monodelphis domestica , revealing variations from the eutherian-derived model. The difference in DNA methylation level between oocytes and sperm is less pronounced than that in eutherians. Furthermore, unlike the genome of eutherians, that of the opossum remains hypermethylated during the cleavage stages. In the blastocyst, DNA demethylation is transient and modest in the epiblast. However, it is sustained in the trophectoderm, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function for DNA hypomethylation in the mammalian placenta. Furthermore, unlike that in eutherians, the inactive X chromosome becomes globally DNA hypomethylated during embryogenesis. We identify gamete differentially methylated regions that exhibit distinct fates in the embryo, with some transient, and others retained and that represent candidate imprinted loci. We also reveal a possible mechanism for imprinted X inactivation, through maternal DNA methylation of the Xist-like noncoding RNA RSX 11 .

          "abstract": "The known fossil record of crown-group amniotes begins in the late Carboniferous with the sauropsid trackmaker Notalacerta 1,2 and the sauropsid body fossil Hylonomus 1–4 . The earliest body fossils of crown-group tetrapods are mid-Carboniferous, and the oldest trackways are early Carboniferous 5–7 . This suggests that the tetrapod crown group originated in the earliest Carboniferous (early Tournaisian), with the amniote crown group appearing in the early part of the late Carboniferous. Here we present new trackway data from Australia that challenge this widely accepted timeline. A track-bearing slab from the Snowy Plains Formation of Victoria, Taungurung Country, securely dated to the early Tournaisian 8,9 , shows footprints from a crown-group amniote with clawed feet, most probably a primitive sauropsid. This pushes back the likely origin of crown-group amniotes by at least 35–40 million years. We also extend the range of Notalacerta into the early Carboniferous. The Australian tracks indicate that the amniote crown-group node cannot be much younger than the Devonian/Carboniferous boundary, and that the tetrapod crown-group node must be located deep within the Devonian; an estimate based on molecular-tree branch lengths suggests an approximate age of early Frasnian for the latter. The implications for the early evolution of tetrapods are profound; all stem-tetrapod and stem-amniote lineages must have originated during the Devonian. It seems that tetrapod evolution proceeded much faster, and the Devonian tetrapod record is much less complete, than has been thought.",

          "abstract": "When two massive objects (black holes, neutron stars or stars) in our universe fly past each other, their gravitational interactions deflect their trajectories 1,2 . The gravitational waves emitted in the related bound-orbit system—the binary inspiral—are now routinely detected by gravitational-wave observatories 3 . Theoretical physics needs to provide high-precision templates to make use of unprecedented sensitivity and precision of the data from upcoming gravitational-wave observatories 4 . Motivated by this challenge, several analytical and numerical techniques have been developed to approximately solve this gravitational two-body problem. Although numerical relativity is accurate 5–7 , it is too time-consuming to rapidly produce large numbers of gravitational-wave templates. For this, approximate analytical results are also required 8–15 . Here we report on a new, highest-precision analytical result for the scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a black hole or neutron star scattering encounter at the fifth order in Newton’s gravitational coupling G , assuming a hierarchy in the two masses. This is achieved by modifying state-of-the-art techniques for the scattering of elementary particles in colliders to this classical physics problem in our universe. Our results show that mathematical functions related to Calabi–Yau (CY) manifolds, 2 n -dimensional generalizations of tori, appear in the solution to the radiated energy in these scatterings. We anticipate that our analytical results will allow the development of a new generation of gravitational-wave models, for which the transition to the bound-state problem through analytic continuation and strong-field resummation will need to be performed.",

          "abstract": "Human attachment theory outlines three organized types: secure, insecure avoidant and insecure resistant, all considered adaptive responses to maternal care for offspring survival. In contrast, disorganized attachment is hypothesized to be maladaptive and therefore uncommon in wild mammals, though this remains untested. We assessed attachment types in 50 wild chimpanzees (ages 0–10 years) in Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. Using 3,795 h of mother and offspring focal observations, we found no behaviours indicative of disorganized attachment. To explore organized attachment, we analysed a subset of 18 immature chimpanzees and their behavioural responses to 309 natural threatening events. Their responses showed organized attachment patterns: some sought maternal closeness (secure-like), while others displayed independence (insecure avoidant-like). Our study supports the hypothesis that organized attachment types are adaptive and have a long evolutionary history.",

          "abstract": "Autism is clinically defined by social communication deficits, suggesting that autistic people may be less effective at sharing information, particularly with one another. However, recent research indicates that neurotype mismatches, rather than autism itself, degrade information sharing. Here, using the diffusion chain method, we examined information transfer in autistic, non-autistic and mixed-neurotype chains ( N = 311), replicating and extending a key study. We hypothesized that information transfer would deteriorate faster and rapport would be lower in mixed-neurotype compared with single-neurotype chains. Additionally, we examined whether informing participants of the diagnostic status of their chain and whether information was fictional or factual impacted performance and rapport. We found no difference in information transfer between single-neurotype and mixed-neurotype chains. Non-autistic chains indicated higher rapport, and disclosing diagnosis improved rapport. This result challenges assumptions about autistic communication deficits but contrasts with prior findings. Enhanced participant heterogeneity and methodological differences may explain these unexpected results.

          "abstract": "Chronic pain is a multifactorial condition presenting significant diagnostic and prognostic challenges. Biomarkers for the classification and the prediction of chronic pain are therefore critically needed. Here, in this multidataset study of over 523,000 participants, we applied machine learning to multidimensional biological data from the UK Biobank to identify biomarkers for 35 medical conditions associated with pain (for example, rheumatoid arthritis and gout) or self-reported chronic pain (for example, back pain and knee pain). Biomarkers derived from blood immunoassays, brain and bone imaging, and genetics were effective in predicting medical conditions associated with chronic pain (area under the curve (AUC) 0.62–0.87) but not self-reported pain (AUC 0.50–0.62). Notably, all biomarkers worked in synergy with psychosocial factors, accurately predicting both medical conditions (AUC 0.69–0.91) and self-reported pain (AUC 0.71–0.92). These findings underscore the necessity of adopting a holistic approach in the development of biomarkers to enhance their clinical utility.",

          "abstract": "It is common to say that people feel entitled to rewards—they think they have earned or deserve them—based on their effort and achievement. However, effort and achievement draw on different principles to justify reward. They can also conflict over when people should feel entitled to rewards. These observations raise the question: In everyday settings, do people feel entitled to rewards because of their effort, achievement, or some combination of the two? To determine how effort and achievement contribute to feelings of entitlement, we hired online workers and varied the feelings of effort and achievement that their work induced. We then let those workers decide how large of a bonus we then paid them. Achievement strongly predicted how much participants paid themselves. Hard work, by contrast, played little-to-no detectable role.",

          "abstract": "After many elections, the accuracy of the vote count is assessed by retabulating a small percentage of ballots. These audits form one of the richest bodies of evidence regarding electoral legitimacy, which is particularly important in democracies where the accuracy of elections has been prominently questioned. In decentralized democracies such as the United States, however, there is tremendous variation in the conduct and reporting of audits, which are never compiled into one place to facilitate precise analysis of their results. Here, we introduce a nation-scale audit result dataset, which we use to estimate the error rate in vote counting during the 2020 U.S. election. The dataset includes all available postelection tabulation audits, spanning 856 regional governments across 27 states, with 71,702,471 individual votes and a further 1,210,528 ballots, including about 6.2% of all votes cast for Donald Trump and 6.9% of those cast for Joe Biden. We find that election audits shifted the net presidential vote count by only about 0.007%, with similarly minuscule errors across all major types of electoral contests. The construction of a nation-scale election audit dataset represents a novel approach to benchmarking electoral legitimacy and provides particularly direct and comprehensive evidence that Americans’ votes were counted correctly in 2020.",

          "abstract": "In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional protection of abortion rights established in Roe v. Wade . In doing so, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization moved status quo on abortion policy more into line with the Republican Party’s stance. Subsequent research has documented the decision’s impact on mass political behavior and opinion, yet less is known about its impact on the behavior of political elites. I provide evidence on congressional candidates’ strategic responses to the decision with original data on campaign platforms ( N = 4,703) from election cycles before and after Dobbs . After the decision, Democrats became significantly more likely to campaign on abortion and to do so using unambiguous language, while Republicans increasingly obfuscated their positions on the issue. Pre-post- Dobbs change in partisan divergence in campaign attention to abortion was driven most strongly by candidates in states with abortion bans set to take effect upon overturning of Roe (i.e., trigger laws and/or pre- Roe laws). Importantly, these shifting patterns of campaign attention were not present in other issue domains, consistent with changes in attention to abortion being driven by Dobbs rather than other contemporaneous factors.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has identified several effective strategies for reducing Americans’ animosity toward supporters of opposing political parties. However, whether these strategies can durably reduce partisan animosity in a scalable manner and in everyday life remains unclear. We bridge the gap between prior research and useful application by assessing whether exposure to multiple, scalable treatments that portray inparty and outparty members interacting positively, receiving accurate information about one another’s views, and learning about cross-party similarities can a) durably shift partisans’ sentiments and b) influence partisans’ sentiments toward specific, personally known others encountered in everyday life—not only general, hypothetical, or one-off rival partisans. In a longitudinal survey experiment, we find that exposure to three brief, scalable treatments over a week reduces partisan animosity, with effects persisting for at least a month. Moreover, the treatments durably ameliorate animosity toward both general outparty members and a personally known outparty member, specified prior to the treatments. These findings suggest promising avenues for redressing social divisions in real-world contexts.",

          "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires urgent action at individual, collective, and institutional levels. However, individuals may fail to act because they perceive climate change as a threat that is distant or not personally relevant, or believe their actions are not impactful. To address these psychological barriers, we conducted a large-scale “intervention tournament.” In a sample of 7,624 participants, we systematically tested 17 interventions that targeted psychological mechanisms described by three key themes: Relevance, Future Thinking, and Response Efficacy. Interventions that emphasized social relevance were the most effective for motivating people to share news articles and petitions about climate change. Interventions that targeted future thinking were the most effective for broadly motivating individual actions (e.g., driving less, eating vegetarian meals) and collective actions (e.g., donating, volunteering) to address climate change. Interventions that emphasized the environmental impact of these actions reliably increased the perceived impact of pro-environmental actions, but did not consistently motivate action. Notably, interventions that targeted two or more mechanisms—such as imagining a future scenario that involved oneself or close others—were most effective. Importantly, our leading interventions were substantially more effective than prevalent existing strategies (e.g., carbon footprint information). Our findings are relevant to theories of behavior change, motivation, and information sharing, with potential applications across domains. Insights from our tournament could be applied to develop scalable online interventions and mass communication campaigns to address climate change.",

          "abstract": "While most people believe that women (vs. men) experience more discriminatory treatment at work, especially in male-dominated professions, relatively few women report experiencing such treatment themselves. These low levels of reporting may arise either because discriminatory treatment has declined, even while laypeople’s assumptions of widespread discrimination persist, or because it is difficult for individuals to know when they are experiencing discriminatory treatment, leading to underreporting. In investigating this puzzle, we theorized four types of nonsexual workplace experiences that may target women and accumulate to harm well-being, yet may be difficult to recognize as discrimination. To test our predictions, we conducted a longitudinal, multisite experience-sampling study of surgeons, capturing workplace experiences over 5 mo. This approach addresses methodological limitations of past research, which include recall biases, demand characteristics, and low external validity. Consistent with hypotheses, female (vs. male) surgeons had more experiences in which their role was challenged or their authority questioned. Moreover, the frequency and severity of these experiences predicted increased burnout over time and decreased intentions to persist in surgery, regardless of whether participants attributed their experiences to their gender. Contrary to hypotheses, female surgeons did not encounter more presumptions of their helpfulness. Female surgeons also received more positive feedback, especially from other women, which yielded increases in professional efficacy and intentions to persist in surgery. Thus, while difficult to detect, workplace discriminatory treatment continues to harm women’s well-being and career opportunities, impede organizations’ efforts to recruit and retain women professionals, and exacerbate burnout among health care providers.",

It remains unclear whether mitochondria impact antigen presentation by the MHC-class-I-related antigen-presenting molecule, MR1, which presents small molecules to MR1-restricted T-lymphocytes. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial complex III and the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are essential for the cell-surface expression of MR1 and for generating uridine- and thymidine-related compounds that bind to MR1 and are produced upon oxidation by reactive oxygen species. One mitochondria-derived immunogenic formylated metabolite we identified is 5-formyl-deoxyuridine (5-FdU). Structural studies indicate that 5-FdU binds in the A’-antigen-binding pocket of MR1, positioning the deoxyribose toward the surface of MR1 for TCR interaction. 5-FdU stimulates specific T cells and detects circulating T cells when loaded onto MR1-tetramers. 5-FdU-reactive cells resemble adaptive T cells and express the phenotypes of naïve, memory, and effector cells, indicating prior in vivo stimulation. These findings suggest that mitochondria may play a role in MR1-mediated immune surveillance.",

Conventional understanding of liquid manipulation relies on inhomogeneous chemical modifications or single-scale structure design. Here, we present how water is directionally navigated and spontaneously reallocated at high efficiency via the cross-scale topology on Tillandsia capitata leaves. These leaves feature transversely curved lanceolate macrostructures decorated by a layer of microtrichomes with varied morphologies. The macrostructure creates a lanceolate effect in the transport direction for fundamental navigation. At the same time, the microtrichomes serve dual functions: constructing a self-wetting superhydrophilic surface to facilitate the water transport speed and implementing water spreading in the opposite direction for autonomous reallocation. We explain the multiscale transport behavior through theoretic analysis and finite element simulations. Our findings demonstrate how cross-scale topographies jointly function in efficient autonomous fluid manipulation, with potential applications such as droplet driving, fog harvesting, and seawater desalination, offering pathways for improving liquid processing efficiency and reducing energy consumption.",

          "abstract": "Diverse genetic strategies are being pursued to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases. These strategies often rely on the release of nonbiting males to either reduce the target mosquito population or render them resistant to pathogens. Male-only releases are important as any contaminating females can bite and potentially transmit pathogens. Despite significant efforts, it remains a major bottleneck to reliably and efficiently separate males from females, especially when nontransgenic males are preferred. In the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti , sex is determined by a pair of homomorphic sex chromosomes, with the dominant male-determining locus (the M locus) and its counterpart (the m locus) embedded in an M-bearing and an m-bearing chromosome 1, respectively. We utilized both naturally occurring and engineered sex-linked recessive lethal alleles (RLAs) to create sex separation strains for Ae. aegypti on the basis of differential elimination of marked sex chromosomes (DeMark). DeMark strains are self-sustaining and produce nontransgenic males that are readily separated from individuals carrying RLA- and transgene-marked m chromosomes. For example, the marked m chromosome in the heterozygous mother in some strains was only inherited by her female progeny due to RLA-mediated incompatibility with the M-bearing chromosome in the father, producing nontransgenic males and transgenic females, generation after generation. We further explore strategies to conditionally eliminate females that contain marked sex chromosomes. We also discuss DeMark designs that are applicable for efficient sex separation in organisms with well-differentiated X and Y chromosomes, such as the Anopheles mosquitoes.",

In fact, phase separation is involved in various mitochondrial activities including nucleoid assembly, autophagy, and mitochondria-related inflammation.

          "abstract": "Buckling in compression is the archetype of elastic instability: when compressed along its longest dimension, a thin structure such as a playing card will buckle out-of-plane accommodating the imposed compression without a significant change of length. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to sheets with microscopic structure leads to out-of-plane deformation in applications from “groovy metasheets” for multistable morphing to kirigami grippers. Here, we demonstrate that this counterintuitive behavior—a large transverse folding induced by a relatively small imposed longitudinal tension—occurs also in unstructured sheets of isotropic material. The key to this behavior is that a localized uniaxial tension induces giant folding; we refer to this as “localized tension-induced giant (TUG) folding” to reflect the importance of localized tension, and its mode of actuation and the similarity of the loading condition to ‘tugging’ the sheet. We show that localized TUG folding occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression—a geometric consequence of a localized applied tension. We determine scaling results for the folding angle as a function of applied strain in agreement with both experiments and simulations. The generic nature of localized TUG folding suggests that it might be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures than previously realized.",

The most abundant envelope glycolipid is trehalose dimycolate (TDM). TDM compromises the host response to mycobacterial species via multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of phagosome maturation. The molecular mechanism by which TDM inhibits phagosome maturation has been elusive. We find that a clickable, photoaffinity TDM probe recapitulates key phenotypes of native TDM in macrophage host cells and binds several host Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins Receptor (SNARE) proteins, including Vesicle Transport through Interaction with t-SNAREs 1B (VTI1B), Syntaxin 8 (STX8), and Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 2 (VAMP2). VTI1B and STX8 normally promote endosome fusion by forming a complex with VAMP8. However, in the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis , VTI1B and STX8 complex with VAMP2, which in turn decreases VAMP8 binding. VAMP2 acts together with mycolate structure to inhibit phagosome maturation and promotes intracellular M. tuberculosis replication. Thus one mechanism by which TDM constrains the innate immune response to M. tuberculosis is via noncanonical SNARE complexation.",

          "abstract": "B cells discriminate antigens in immune synapses by capturing them from antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This discrimination relies on the application of mechanical force to B cell receptor (BCR)-antigen bonds, allowing B cells to selectively disrupt low-affinity interactions while internalizing high-affinity antigens. Using DNA-based tension sensors combined with high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the magnitude, location, and timing of forces within the immune synapse are influenced by the fluidity of the antigen-presenting membrane. Transitioning antigens from a high-mobility to a low-mobility substrate significantly increases the probability and speed of antigen extraction while also improving affinity discrimination. This shift in antigen mobility also reshapes the synapse architecture, altering spatial patterns of antigen uptake. Despite these adaptations, B cells maintain consistent levels of proximal and downstream signaling pathway activation regardless of antigen mobility. They also efficiently transport internalized antigens to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-positive compartments for processing. These results demonstrate that B cells mount effective responses to antigens across diverse physical environments, though the characteristics of that environment may influence the speed and accuracy of B cell adaptation during an immune response.",

          "abstract": "Substance use disorders disrupt the dopaminergic system of the human brain, which plays a central role in movement and reward processing, altering perception, and cognition. The pleasurable urge to move to music, known as groove, relies on dopamine for reward, anticipation, beat perception, and motor system activity. Using a well-established paradigm, which shows an inverted-U relationship between groove and musical complexity, we investigated how dopamine downregulation from long-term cocaine and heroin use affects the experience of music. Drug users experienced stronger groove with high rhythmic and harmonic complexities than nonusers, while moderate complexities elicited similar responses across groups. This pattern differs from other populations with altered dopaminergic function, such as Parkinson’s disease or musical anhedonia, highlighting a distinct effect of drug addiction on music perception. The findings suggest that drug users seek more intense and complex stimulation, supporting the hypothesis that a hypodopaminergic state associated with drug use raises the threshold for nondrug stimuli to engage the reward system.",

          "abstract": "8-oxoguanine (8-oxoGua) is one of the most frequent forms of oxidative DNA base lesions, repaired by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) via base excision repair (BER) pathway to maintain genome fidelity. The human allelic variant hOGG1 S326C , prevalent in Caucasians and Asians, has been regarded as a susceptibility factor for various diseases, yet its pathogenic mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that Ogg1 S326C/S326C mice exhibit increased and sustained airway inflammation compared with wild-type (WT) Ogg1 S326/S326 mice. Mechanistically, in response to inflammatory stimulation, OGG1S326C undergoes reactive oxygen species-induced dimerization, which impairs its base excision function, but prolongs its association with promoter-embedded substrate(s), leading to an increase in NF-κB’ DNA occupancy, subsequently the excessive expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the exacerbated lung inflammation. In contrast, Serine at position 326 in WT -OGG1 is constitutively phosphorylated by CDK4. To fulfill the requirement for its function in transcriptional regulation, the phosphorylated OGG1 needs to undergo dephosphorylation to rescue DNA binding ability. In this scenario, OGG1S326C lacks this phosphorylation site, disrupting this regulatory cycle. Notably, administration of a small molecule inhibitor of OGG1 prevents OGG1S326C from binding to DNA and significantly decreases gene expression and inflammatory responses. Our findings elucidate a molecular basis for the increased disease susceptibility of individuals carrying the hOGG1 S326C variant and propose the therapeutic potential of OGG1 inhibitors in mitigating inflammation-driven pathologies.",

          "authors": "Quran Wu, Jonathan M. Gregory, Laure Zanna, Samar Khatiwala",
          "abstract": "The global energy budget is fundamental for understanding climate change. It states that the top-of-atmosphere imbalance between radiative forcing (which drives climate change) and radiative response (which resists the forcing) equals energy storage in Earth’s heat reservoirs (i.e. the ocean, atmosphere, land, and cryosphere). About 90% of Earth’s energy imbalance is stored as heat content in the ocean interior, which is poorly sampled before 1960. Here, we reconstruct Earth’s energy imbalance since 1880 by inferring subsurface ocean warming from surface observations via a Green’s function approach. Our estimate of Earth’s energy imbalance is consistent with the current best estimates of radiative forcing and radiative response during 1880–2020. The consistency is improved in this study compared to previous ones. We find two distinct phases in the global energy budget. In 1880–1980, Earth’s energy imbalance closely followed the radiative forcing. After 1980, however, Earth’s energy imbalance increased at a slower rate than the forcing; in 2000–2020, the imbalance amounted to less than 50% of the forcing. In simulations of historical climate change, the model-mean energy imbalance is consistent with observations within uncertainties, but individual models with a “weak” response to anthropogenic aerosol agree better with observations than those with a “strong” response. Because the global energy budget before and after 1980 implies very different global warming in the future, further studies are required to better understand the cause of this historical variation.",

ETBF infection in mice led to increased neutrophil and γδ T cell infiltration into the PCL implant site. ETBF infection alone promoted systemic inflammation, increased levels of neutrophils in lymphoid tissues, and altered skeletal muscle gene expression. At the PCL implant site, we found significant changes in the transcriptome of sorted stromal cells between infected and control mice, including differences related to ECM components such as proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. However, we did not observe ETBF-induced differences in fibrosis levels.

          "abstract": "While paradigms for patterning of cell fates in development are well established, paradigms for patterning morphogenesis, particularly when organ shape is influenced by the extracellular matrix (ECM), are not. Morphogenesis of the Drosophila egg chamber (follicle) depends on anterior–posterior distribution of basement membrane (BM) components such as Collagen IV (Col4), whose gradient creates tissue mechanical properties that specify the degree of elongation. Here, we show that the gradient is not regulated by Col4 transcription but instead relies on posttranscriptional mechanisms. The metalloprotease ADAMTS-A, expressed in a gradient inverse to that of Col4, limits Col4 deposition in the follicle center and manipulation of its levels can cause either organ hyper- or hypoelongation. We present evidence that ADAMTS-A acts within the secretory pathway, rather than extracellularly, to limit Col4 incorporation into the BM. High levels of ADAMTS-A in follicle termini are normally dispensable but suppress Col4 incorporation when transcription is elevated. Meanwhile, the terminally expressed metalloprotease Stall increases Col4 turnover in the posterior. Our data show how an organ can employ patterned expression of ECM proteases with intracellular as well as extracellular activity to specify BM properties that control shape.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a frequent culprit in implant-associated infections and employs many virulence factors to escape killing by the host immune system. The specific immune evasion strategies used by small aggregates of S. aureus on a surface, precursors to mature biofilm, are still relatively unknown. Time-lapse confocal microscopy was leveraged to quantify interactions between S. aureus aggregates and human neutrophils in vitro and identify specific mechanisms of resistance to neutrophil killing. Surface-associated wild-type S. aureus rapidly formed small biofilm aggregates when grown in human serum. Conversely, aggregation was inhibited when the SaeR/S two-component gene regulatory system was deleted. Wild-type aggregates began to show individual and population-level resistance to neutrophil killing upon reaching sizes of approximately 50 to 75 µm 2 , whereas Δ sae clusters failed to reach these sizes and were readily cleared. Aggregation of Δ sae strains was impaired by serum complement, and this inhibition required complement proteins C3 and factor B, but not C4 or C5, suggesting that this activity primarily occurs at the level of the alternative pathway. Several complement-inhibiting genes regulated by SaeR/S were identified that collectively facilitate biofilm aggregate formation in human, but not murine serum. Finally, aggregation of two related opportunistic pathogens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis , was inhibited by serum. These data demonstrate a function of serum complement, the ability to inhibit bacterial aggregation, that is potently blocked by S. aureus through the production of multiple complement-interfering proteins that are regulated by the SaeR/S system.",

          "abstract": "This study presents the results of geochemical compositional analysis through portable X-ray fluorescence of 788 artifacts from the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. The results reveal that the Mexica (Aztecs) preferred green obsidian from Sierra de Pachuca. However, a diachronic analysis (c. 1375-1520 CE) demonstrated that they continuously consumed obsidian from seven additional sources with some temporal variations related to the sociopolitical transformations of the empire. In the early phases, obsidian from Tulancingo, El Paraíso, and Zacualtipán is more common. After the consolidation of the Mexica Empire c.1430 CE, the patterns shifted to obsidian from Otumba, Paredón, and Ucareo. The study of artifacts from ritual and nonritual contexts demonstrates that most inhabitants used obsidian from multiple regions in the form of blades and flakes, probably acquired in local markets. Conversely, the elites and ritual specialists clearly preferred green obsidian from Pachuca to elaborate ritual objects due to its unique color and symbolic value. Ritual objects may arrive directly at the sacred precinct from the workshops outside the city, such as those found in Otumba and Pachuca. This study highlights the importance of analyzing large samples that combine ritual and nonritual artifacts, as well as objects from different phases, to explore temporal and social patterns of obsidian consumption among Pre-Hispanic societies.",

At least four known stoichiometries have been established, each with distinct structures. These compounds have potential applications as refractory coatings, catalysts, and magnetic materials. We modeled the stability of RE 3 PO 7 [RE 3 (PO 4 )O 3 ] with respect to rare earth sesquioxides (RE 2 O 3 ) and orthophosphates (REPO 4 ) using DFT computations with the GGA-PBE and r2SCAN exchange-correlation functionals. Phase stability predictions were consistent between the two functionals, while r2SCAN calculations of formation enthalpies for REPO 4 showed better agreement with experimental data. RE 3 PO 7 phases for La–Dy were predicted to be stable at 0 K, with a space group change from Cm to C 2 /m starting with Sm. RE 3 PO 7 phases for Y, Ho, and Er were found to be stabilized by lattice vibrational entropies at temperatures above 800 K, 1,000 K, and 1,600 K, respectively. The formation of predicted cerium (III) oxyphosphate, isostructural to Nd 3 (PO) 4 O 3 , was confirmed through laser melting of monazite (CePO 4 ).

We found that microbial P limitation, which was especially strong at low latitudes, was more prevalent globally than microbial N limitation, which prevailed in cold environments. We also found widespread N and P colimitation in soil microorganisms in the tropics, contradicting the long-held paradigm that P, and not N, is the primary limiting nutrient at low latitudes. This colimitation could be attributable to elevated microbial N demand for the synthesis of P-acquiring enzymes under P limitation. Upscaling (0.1 × 0.1° spatial resolution) suggested that soil microorganisms were limited by N and P in 39% and 57%, respectively, of natural terrestrial surface areas, with 21% of areas with N and P colimitation.

Therefore, we directly determined the effects of increasing [P i ] on rabbit psoas muscle myosin’s ability to generate force against progressively higher resistive loads in a laser trap assay, with the requisite spatial and temporal resolution to discern the mechanism of inhibition. Myosin’s force-generating capacity decreased with increasing [P i ], an effect that became more pronounced at higher resistive loads. The decrease in force resulted from myosin’s accelerated detachment from actin, which also increased at higher resistive forces. These data are well fit by a cross-bridge model in which P i rebinds to actomyosin in a postpowerstroke, ADP-bound state before accelerating myosin’s detachment from actin. Thus, these findings provide important molecular insight into the mechanism underlying the P i -induced loss of force during muscle fatigue from intense contractile activity.",

However, despite increasing exposure risks from nanoparticles (NPs), their potential infiltration into human breast milk remains poorly understood. This study provides a comprehensive chemical profile of NPs in human breast milk, analyzing their elemental composition, surface charge, hydrodynamic size, and crystallinity. NPs were detected in 42 out of 53 milk samples, with concentrations reaching up to 1.12 × 10 11 particles/mL. These particles comprised nine elements, with O, Si, Fe, Cu, and Al being the most frequently detected across all samples. We establish a mechanistic axis for NP infiltration, involving penetration of the intestine/air–blood barriers, circulation in blood vessels, crossing the blood–milk barrier via transcytosis or immune cell-mediated transfer, and eventual accumulation in milk. Structure–activity relationship analysis reveals that smaller, neutral-charged NPs exhibit stronger infiltration capacity, offering potential for regulating NP behavior at biological barriers through engineering design. This study provides the chemical profiles of NPs in human breast milk and uncovers their infiltration pathways.",

          "abstract": "Delivering biomedicines to specific sites of disease using remote-controlled devices is a long-standing vision in biomedical research. However, most existing externally triggered delivery systems are based on complex micromachines that are controlled with electromagnetic waves and require custom external instrumentation. Here, we present a drug delivery platform based on a simple protein-containing hydrogel that can be both imaged and triggered to release drugs at specific locations using widely available diagnostic ultrasound devices. This technology is based on the addition of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs) to hydrogel delivery vehicles. While intact, GVs sterically block the release of drug payloads and allow the vehicle to be imaged with ultrasound. An increase in ultrasound pressure causes the collapse of GVs within the delivery vehicles at the desired anatomical location, instantly creating percolation channels in the hydrogel, massively increasing diffusivity, and leading to rapid drug release. Unlike previous ultrasound-actuated delivery approaches, both the imaging and release are performed using a simple diagnostic ultrasound probe ubiquitously available in clinical settings. We implement this concept by quantifying ultrasound-controlled drug diffusion and release in vitro and demonstrating image-guided protein delivery in vivo in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract following oral administration. We further validate this technology by using it to deliver anti-inflammatory antibodies to effectively treat a rat model of colitis. Targeted acoustic percolation switches (TAPS) open a conduit for local, image-guided drug delivery with a simple formulation and commonplace ultrasound equipment.",

          "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) is a protein–pigment complex that utilizes sunlight to catalyze water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction, initiating the electron transfer (ET) cascade in oxygenic photosynthesis. The D1 and D2 proteins are the most important transmembrane subunits of PSII that bind all redox-active components involved in primary charge separation (CS) and ET. D1 is susceptible to oxidative photodamage, particularly under high light, and protection partly involves genetic regulation. Cyanobacterial D1 is encoded by the psbA gene family that expresses distinct isoforms (PsbA1–3) depending on environmental conditions. Most differences in D1 isoforms are close to the active-branch reaction center (RC) pigments P D1 , P D2 , Chl D1 , and Pheo D1 . Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with multiscale quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations on the membrane-bound PSII monomer of each variant to compare the redox and excited state properties of RC pigments using long-range-corrected density functional theory. We identify specific amino acid substitutions responsible for electrochromic shifts on distinct pigments and pigment groups. Our results indicate that the Pheo D1 acceptor is the primary regulatory target. The redox properties of the Chl D1 –Pheo D1 pair and the energetics of Chl D1 δ+ Pheo D1 δ- charge-transfer states are distinctly modulated in the three isoforms: Compared to the standard psbA 1 , charge separation is inhibited in psbA 2 and facilitated in psbA 3 PSII. The results provide a microscopic description of how genetic variations modulate protein electrostatics and influence primary processes in photosynthetic reaction centers.",

          "abstract": "The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AaRSs) are an ancient family of structurally diverse enzymes that are divided into two major classes. The functionalities of most AaRSs are inextricably linked to their oligomeric states. While GluRSs were previously classified as monomers, the current investigation reveals that the form expressed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a rotationally pseudosymmetrical homodimer featuring intersubunit tRNA binding sites. Both subunits display a highly bent, “pipe strap” conformation, with the anticodon binding domain directed toward the active site. The tRNA binding sites are similar in shape to those of the monomeric GluRSs, but are formed through an approximately 180-degree rotation of the anticodon binding domains and dimerization via the anticodon and D-arm binding domains. As a result, each anticodon binding domain is poised to recognize the anticodon loop of a tRNA bound to the adjacent protomer. Additionally, the anticodon binding domain has an α-helical C -terminal extension containing a conserved lysine-rich consensus motif positioned near the predicted location of the acceptor arm, suggesting dual functions in tRNA recognition. The unique architecture of Pa GluRS broadens the structural diversity of the GluRS family, and member synthetases of all bacterial AaRS subclasses have now been identified that exhibit oligomerization.",

Here, we report the isolation, biochemical characterization, cryo-EM structure, and phylogenetic analysis of photosystem I (PSI) from a recently discovered thylakoid-free cyanobacterium, Anthocerotibacter panamensis , a distant relative of the genus Gloeobacter . We find that A. panamensis PSI exhibits a distinct carotenoid composition and has one conserved low-energy chlorophyll site, which was lost in G. violaceus . Furthermore, PSI in thylakoid-free cyanobacteria has changed at the sequence level to a degree comparable to that of other strains, yet its subunit composition and oligomeric form might be identical to that of the most recent common ancestor of cyanobacteria.

Efforts to rescue the NWR from its inevitable demise have inspired the exploration of unconventional conservation methods, including the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the in vitro generation of artificial gametes. The integrity of iPSC genomes is critical for in vitro gametogenesis to be used for assisted reproductive technologies using NWR iPSCs. We generated a chromosome-level NWR reference genome that meets or exceeds the metrics proposed by the Vertebrate Genome Project, using complementary sequencing and mapping methods. The genome represents 40 autosomes, an X and a partially resolved Y chromosome, and the mitochondrial genome. Using comparative FISH mapping, we confirmed a general gene order conservation between the NWR and horse genomes. We aligned the NWR genome with that of the southern white rhinoceros (SWR; Ceratotherium simum simum ), a population that has been physically separated from the NWR for tens of thousands of years, and we found that the two subspecies are very similar on the chromosome level. Comparing long-read data from NWR iPSC lines and the fibroblast cultures used for reprogramming, we identified copy number variations that were likely to have been introduced during in vitro iPSC expansion. The NWR reference genome allows for efficient, rapid, and accurate assessment of the genomic integrity of iPSC lines to direct their differentiation. This will assist in strategies to rescue the NWR through extraordinary measures like cloning and the generation of embryos from iPSC-derived gametes.",

Recent studies have revealed both catalytic and noncatalytic oncogenic functions of LSD1, which cannot be effectively addressed by traditional small-molecule inhibitors. Therefore, to remove LSD1 and mitigate its oncogenic activity, we utilized the proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) approach and developed an LSD1 PROTAC degrader MS9117, which recruits the E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN). MS9117 induces LSD1 degradation in a concentration-, time-, CRBN-, and proteasome-dependent manner. Importantly, MS9117 effectively degrades LSD1 and demonstrates superior antiproliferative effects in AML cells, compared to the existing pharmacological LSD1 inhibitors. Furthermore, MS9117 also sensitized nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML cells to all-trans retinoic acid treatment. Moreover, we developed two negative controls of MS9117, MS9117N1 and MS9117N2, which do not degrade LSD1 or inhibit leukemia cell growth, further confirming the mechanism of action of MS9117. Overall, MS9117 serves as a valuable chemical tool and a potential therapeutic to target both the catalytic and scaffolding functions of LSD1. With several LSD1 inhibitors already in clinical development, the LSD1 degraders such as MS9117 offer an additional option for future clinical studies.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen is one of the most limiting nutrients to forest productivity worldwide. Recently, it has been established that diverse ecosystems source a substantial fraction of their water from weathered bedrock, leading to questions about whether root-driven nitrogen cycling extends into weathered bedrock as well. In this study, we specifically examined nitrogen dynamics using specialized instrumentation distributed across a 16 m weathered bedrock vadose zone (WBVZ) underlying an old growth forest in northern California where the rhizosphere—composed of plant roots and their associated microbiome—extends meters into rock. We documented total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), and CO 2 and O 2 gases every 1.5 m to 16 m depth for 2 y. We found that TDN concentrations increased with depth, were an order of magnitude greater at 15 m than in the upper 30 cm, and that the majority of TDN throughout the weathered bedrock vadose zone was organic. We also found that TDN concentrations are influenced by depth, season, and interannual precipitation patterns. Carbon isotope composition of the DOC suggests that dissolved organic matter in the WBVZ is primarily derived from plant sources, and not the nitrogen-rich bedrock. We conclude that nitrogen dynamics in the WBVZ may be driven, in part, by an active rhizosphere, meters below the base of soil, and we argue that weathered bedrock horizons may play a key role in C-N cycling in ecosystems with deep-rooted plants.",

Moisture utilization at the bulk sorbent scale is improved through the hierarchical pore structure of scalable biomass gel sheets enabling rapid regeneration and is further upscaled to system-level performance through a kinetics-matched, continuously multicyclic operation protocol in a multilayered device. Solar energy utilization is enhanced by thermoresponsive hydrogels that lower the energy threshold for water desorption and by efficient thermal and mass flow management that increases energy efficiency. Our system delivers up to 235.09 mL d −1 of water with an energy efficiency as high as 26.4%, excluding solar panel power.

          "abstract": "Caveolin is a monotopic integral membrane protein, widely expressed in metazoans and responsible for constructing enigmatic membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active, intercalating into lipid monolayers of various compositions. CAV1-8S can also incorporate into preformed bilayers, but only upon removal of phospholipids from the outer-facing leaflet. Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this “leaflet replacement” model and also reveal that CAV1-8S accumulates 40 to 70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein–protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.",

          "abstract": "Many phenotypic traits, such as fermentation activity, have been shown to be instable due to stochastic gene expression and environmental influence. While previous studies only have obtained understanding at the level of the microbial community, the fate of extraordinary traits of an individual through generations of reproduction has yet to be adequately investigated. This work uses the lactic acid bacteri Lactiplantibacillus plantarum as a research model to study the activity inheritance between parental generations and filial generations. An integrated single-cell manipulation strategy is established, including fluorescent screening using an extracellular pH probe and a microwell array, micropicking using a micropipette, and amplifying an individual bacterium via single-cell culture. Consequently, it is found that daughter bacteria can well inherit the strong acid-producing activity from their parental bacterial individuals, although as the reproduction proceeds over 30 generations, the offspring gradually regresses to the mediocre, thus setting a caveat for the limiting generations for desired inheritance. This is likely due to the deterioration of the cell living environment. This work illustrates the inheritable features of bacterial metabolic traits at the level of individual bacteria and is therefore fundamentally insightful for biotechnological applications like bioenergy production that require consistent or at least predictable metabolic performance.",

          "abstract": "New immunosenescence targets for preventing senescence-associated pathological cardiac hypertrophy (SA-PCH) need to be explored. In the present study, with physiologically aged human and mouse samples, the IL-17A level increased with physiological aging, heart failure (HF), and SA-PCH and was negatively correlated with thymic Bmi-1 expression. Bmi-1 f/f LckCre + mice and Bmi-1 f/f littermates were generated to determine whether Bmi-1 delayed T cell aging by maintaining thymic T cell development to prevent SA-PCH. As a result, Bmi-1 promoted thymic T cell development by upregulating Notch signaling and prevented DN1 T cells from differentiating into γδT17 cells by downregulating γδT17 cell differentiation signaling. Bmi-1 upregulated Notch signaling by inhibiting p53-mediated Ikzf1 transcription at the −1,863 to −1,849 Ikzf1 promoter region. Bmi-1–RING1B promoted RORγt ubiquitination and degradation by proteasome to inhibit the production of IL-17A in γδT17 cells. Bmi-1 also downregulated Rorc transcribed by c-Maf by trimethylating H3K27 at the −1,511 to −1,497 Rorc promoter region. Subsequently, the number of peripheral γδT17 cells infiltrating the heart tissues was reduced, while alleviating IL-17A-dependent cardiac aging, hypertrophy, dysfunction, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and macrophage–myofibroblast transition, ultimately improving SA-PCH. The RORγt inhibitor SR1001 and IL-17A neutralizing antibody ixekizumab prevented thymic RORγt-IL-17A-dependent SA-PCH. Furthermore, RORγt bound to Bmi-1 through ARG237 and to RING1B through GLU235, which could be used as a therapeutic strategy for SA-PCH to construct binding peptides promoting Bmi-1–RING1B binding to RORγt and degrading RORγt for inhibiting γδT17 cell differentiation and IL-17A production. Thus, thymic Bmi-1 prevented IL-17A-dependent SA-PCH by decreasing γδT17 cell numbers.",

The channel is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel superfamily and an emerging therapeutic target to mitigate severe inflammatory injury involving NLRP3 activation. We report the cryo-EM structure of human TWIK-2. In comparison to other K2P channels, the structure reveals an unusual “up” conformation of Tyr111 in the selectivity filter and a resulting SF1-P1 pocket behind the filter. Density for acyl chains is present in fenestrations within the transmembrane region that connects the central cavity of the pore to the lipid membrane. Despite its importance as a drug target, limited pharmacological tools are available for TWIK-2. A previous study suggested that the FDA-approved small molecule pimozide might inhibit TWIK-2. Using a reconstituted system, we show that pimozide directly inhibits the channel and we determine a cryo-EM structure of a complex with the drug. Pimozide displaces the acyl chains within the fenestrations and binds below the selectivity filter where it would impede ion permeation. The drug may access its binding site by lateral diffusion in the membrane, suggesting that other hydrophobic small molecules could have utility for inhibiting TWIK-2. The work defines the structure of TWIK-2 and provides a structural foundation for development of more specific inhibitors with potential utility as anti-inflammatory drugs.",

Yet, the mechanism underlying this bidirectional processing of bodily and external stimuli, as well as its persistence or modulation in unconscious states, remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac activity on auditory regularity processing in coma. We recorded continuous electroencephalography and electrocardiography in 48 comatose patients on the first day after cardiac arrest during a closed-loop auditory paradigm. We tested whether sounds presented in synchrony with the ongoing heartbeat and sounds presented with fixed, isochronous intervals, would facilitate auditory processing, compared to an asynchronous sequence with variable heartbeat-to-sound and sound-to-sound intervals and a baseline without auditory stimulation. To assess sound prediction based on sequence regularity, we introduced sound omissions within the sequences, violating expected auditory patterns. In coma survivors only, the neural omission response differed in the synchronous against both control conditions. These results were corroborated by a multivariate decoding analysis of the single-trial neural responses to the synchronous omissions and baseline wherein survivors exhibited a higher degree of cardio-audio regularity encoding compared to nonsurvivors. Furthermore, omissions within the synchronous sequence elicited a heart rate deceleration exclusively in coma survivors, which was predictive of patient outcome. We show that the unconscious human brain infers on the temporal relationship across cardiac and auditory inputs and that the neural and cardiac correlates of cardio-audio regularity encoding are predictive of patient outcome.",

When played well, players can last for several minutes before the ball bounces twice on the floor. There is, however, an unanswerable shot. When the ball hits the nick between a vertical wall and the floor, under certain conditions, it rolls without any vertical bounce. We study this process experimentally. We determined that the ball must hit the vertical wall first at a narrow range of heights above the floor, but most importantly, it must touch the floor before finishing its rolling time on the vertical wall. When the rolling time is shorter than the contact time, the vertical momentum is canceled due to a mechanical frustration condition. This behavior is explained considering a contact model, which agrees with the experimental observations.

          "abstract": "Proton transport plays a fundamental role in many biological and chemical systems. In life, proton transport is crucial for biochemical and physiological functions. It is usually accepted that the main mechanism of proton transfer is a result of hopping between neighboring water molecules and amino acid side chains. It was recently suggested that the proton transfer can be simultaneously coupled with electron transfer. As life is homochiral, proton transfer in biology is occurring in a chiral environment. In this environment, the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect relating to electron transfer and chirality is expected to occur. The present work establishes that the proton transfer is coupled to a specific electron spin polarization in lysozyme crystals, associating proton transfer to electron movement and polarization. To preserve total angular momentum, this motion may be coupled to chiral phonons that propagate in the crystal. Our work shows that the interaction of the electrons’ spin and phonons is very significant in proton transfer through lysosome crystals. Injecting the opposite electron spin into the lysosome crystal results in a significant change in proton transfer impedance. This study presents the support for the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism and indicates the importance of spin polarization in the process.",

          "abstract": "Spreading depolarizations (SDs) have been identified in various brain pathologies. SDs increase the cerebral energy demand and, concomitantly, oxygen consumption, which indicates enhanced synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, SDs are considered particularly detrimental during reduced supply of oxygen and glucose. However, measurements of intracellular neuronal ATP ([ATP] i ), ultimately reporting the balance of ATP synthesis and consumption during SDs, have not yet been conducted. Here, we investigated neuronal ATP homeostasis during SDs using two-photon imaging in acute brain slices from adult mice expressing the ATP sensor ATeam1.03 YEMK in neurons. SDs were induced by application of potassium chloride or by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and detected by recording the local field potential, extracellular potassium, as well as the intrinsic optical signal. We found that, in the presence of oxygen and glucose, SDs were accompanied by a substantial but transient drop in neuronal ATP sensor signals, corresponding to a drop in ATP. OGD, which prior to SDs was accompanied by only a slight reduction in ATP signals, led to a large, terminal drop in ATP signals during SDs. Subsequently, we investigated whether neurons could still regenerate ATP if oxygen and glucose were promptly resupplied following SD detection, and show that ATP depletion was essentially reversible in most cells. Our findings indicate that SDs are accompanied by a substantial increase in ATP consumption beyond production. This, under conditions that mimic reduced blood supply, leads to a breakdown of [ATP] i . Therefore, our findings support therapeutic strategies targeting SDs after cerebral ischemia.",

          "abstract": "Establishing a dominance hierarchy in social organisms is important for access to resources. Stress has been proposed as a major factor influencing an animal’s likely position in a social hierarchy. Although individual differences in vulnerability to stress are increasingly recognized, how social hierarchy affects vulnerability remains relatively understudied. Here, we examined how the social dominance status of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats influences their response to stress in interactions with a familiar animal living in the same cage, and separately when confronting an unfamiliar rat of uncertain dominance status from another cage, using the tube test. Having determined the relatively stable within-cage social dominance status of animals, half were subjected to a single episode of 2-h immobilization stress. Cagemates, both control and stressed rats, again faced one another 1 d and 10 d after stress. First, the predetermined hierarchical rank among familiar cagemates was relatively unaffected by stress. However, second, the same stress had a differential impact in competitions between unfamiliar rats. Socially dominant control rats continued to win competitions but subordinate control rats, that had previously lost, sometimes started to win against previously dominant rats that had been stressed. Strikingly, subordinate stressed rats displayed consistent submissive-like behavior and they alone showed differential effects on dendritic spine density in the amygdala. Thus, an individual’s social rank can influence its response to stress, an effect that is detectable in interactions with unfamiliar animals. These findings provide an additional dimension to animal models of stress used for exploring facets of social anxiety and withdrawal in stress-related psychiatric disorders.",

          "abstract": "Predicting the exact many-body quantum dynamics of polarons in materials with strong carrier–phonon interactions presents a fundamental challenge, often necessitating one to adopt approximations that sacrifice the ability to predict the transition from nonequilibrium relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we exploit a recent breakthrough that generalizes the concept of memory beyond its conventional temporal meaning to also encompass space. Specifically, we leverage our finding that the dynamics of observables in systems with local couplings satisfy Green’s functions with kernels that are local in time and space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short times to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of finite-size effects. We thus interrogate the exact nonequilibrium formation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only asymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D systems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics, illustrating how energy variations can cause localization—a phenomenon observable via current microscopy experiments.",

          "abstract": "Flamingos feature one of the most sophisticated filter-feeding systems among birds, characterized by upside-down feeding, comb-like lamellae, and a piston-like tongue. However, the hydrodynamic functions of their L-shaped chattering beak, S-curved neck, and distinct behaviors such as stomping and feeding against the flow remain a mystery. Combining live flamingo experiments with live brine shrimp and passive particles, bioinspired physical models, and 3D CFD simulations, we show that flamingos generate self-induced vortical traps using their heads, beaks, and feet to capture agile planktonic prey in harsh fluid environments. When retracting their heads rapidly (~40 cm/s), flamingos generate tornado-like vortices that stir up and upwell bottom sediments and live shrimp aided by their L-shaped beak. Remarkably, they also induce directional flows (~7 cm/s) through asymmetric beak chattering underwater (~12 Hz). Their morphing feet create horizontal eddies during stomping, lifting, and concentrating sediments and brine shrimp, while trapping fast-swimming invertebrates, as confirmed by using a 3D-printed morphing foot model. During interfacial skimming, flamingos produce a vortical recirculation zone at the beak’s tip, aiding in prey capture. Experiments using a flamingo-inspired particle collection system indicate that beak chattering improves capture rates by ~7×. These findings offer design principles for bioinspired particle collection systems that may be applied to remove pollutants and harmful microorganisms from water bodies.",

In this study, we analyzed circadian time-dependent changes in cell types within the mouse tongue epithelium. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed circadian time-dependent changes in the populations of stem/progenitor cells and the differentiated cells in mice tongues. Notably, we observed time-dependent changes in the type II taste cell population, which were abolished by ablation of taste bud stem cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation within the taste cell population. Through experiments with taste bud organoids (TBOs), we found a 24-h cell cycle period, which was disrupted by the knockdown of the core-clock gene Bmal1 . In TBOs, both cell divisions and apoptotic cells exhibited circadian time-dependent phenotypes. Interestingly, the time-dependent changes in cell death disappeared in the stem cell–ablated TBOs, indicating that the diurnal supply of newly born cells is essential for the rhythmic cell death phenotype. Additionally, taste tests conducted at different times of the day revealed time-dependent sensitivity changes originating from type II taste cells in mice. These findings suggest that the time-dependent changes in taste cell population are driven by circadian clock–regulated cell cycle progression and control time-dependent physiological regulation in the mouse tongue.",

          "abstract": "The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is the most notable global biodiversity pattern, but its underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) posits that molecular rates play a crucial role in shaping the LDG, suggesting that higher temperatures accelerate molecular rates, thereby facilitating rapid speciation and accumulation of biodiversity in the tropics. However, whether ESH can explain the LDG across diverse taxonomic groups remains debated, and systematic examinations of its two key predictions using consistent datasets and methodologies across vertebrates are lacking. Here, we tested ESH using molecular rates from mitochondrial (5,424 species) and nuclear (1,512 species) genomes across major vertebrate groups, including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. Our findings revealed distinct latitudinal patterns in the absolute synonymous substitution rate (dS), which were influenced by thermoregulatory strategies. Specifically, the dS increases with ambient temperature and decreases with latitude in ectotherms but shows no correlation in most endotherms. These distinct patterns are likely attributed to different key predictors of dS between thermogroups, with temperature playing a major role only in ectotherms. For mitochondrial genes, absolute nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) increase with temperature, likely driven by mutation rates in ectotherms and purifying selection in endotherms. However, neither mitochondrial dS nor dN correlates with diversification rates across vertebrates, contradicting the second prediction of ESH. For nuclear rates, the ESH was supported in reptiles and amphibians but not in mammals, birds, or fishes. In conclusion, our results provide limited support for ESH in vertebrates, underscoring the intricate processes that shape the LDG.",

          "abstract": "RAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. RAS proteins show high sequence similarities in their G-domains but are significantly different in their C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVR). These regions interact with the cell membrane via lipid anchors that result from posttranslational modifications (PTM) of cysteine residues. KRAS4b is unique as it has only one cysteine that undergoes PTM, C185. Small molecule covalent modification of C185 would block any form of prenylation and subsequently inhibit attachment of KRAS4b to the cell membrane, blocking its biological activity. We translated this concept to the discovery and development of disulfide tethering screen hits into irreversible covalent modifiers of C185. These compounds inhibited proliferation of KRAS4b-driven mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but not cells driven by N-myristoylated KRAS4b that harbor a C185S mutation and are not dependent on C185 prenylation. Top–down proteomics was used to confirm target engagement in cells. These compounds bind in a pocket formed when the HVR folds back between helix 3 and 4 in the G-domain (HVR-α3-α4). This interaction can happen in the absence of small molecules as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations and is stabilized in the presence of C185 binders as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering and solution NMR. NOESY-HSQC, an NMR approach that measures internuclear distances of 6 Å or less, and structure analysis identified the critical residues and interactions that define the HVR-α3-α4 pocket. Further development of compounds that bind to this pocket could be the basis of a new approach to targeting KRAS cancers.",

Our methodology employs a physics-informed machine learning pipeline that operates in two stages: the characteristic peak extraction (CaPE) algorithm, which isolates distinctive spectral features, and the characteristic peak similarity (CaPSim) algorithm, which identifies analytes with high robustness to spectral shifts and amplitude variations. Validation of this approach showed strong similarity values (&gt;0.6) between DFT-calculated and experimental Surface-enhanced Raman spectra for multiple PAHs, confirming its accuracy and discriminative capability. This study establishes the viability of DFT-calculated spectra as reliable references for identifying analytes that lack experimental reference spectra, including those formed through environmental modification of PAHs.

These beneficial effects are primarily driven by suppressed excitation in the primary thermosensory AFD neurons, particularly at elevated temperatures that trigger hyperactivation. In the thermosensory neural circuit, suppression of AFD neuron activity promotes the release of INS-1/insulin from AIZ, which in turn activates DAF-16/FOXO in the intestine.

These phenomena provide essential resources for enhancing quantum sensing capabilities. Our results show that magnetic fields can be amplified by at least two orders of magnitude, enhancing magnetic sensitivity to the femtotesla per root hertz level. Additionally, we report a counterpart phenomenon, deamplification, where the magnetic noise response is suppressed by at least one order of magnitude within certain frequency regimes.

Of those, 9,061 users also self-reported complete blood count Hgb levels for comparison, resulting in accuracy and performance that match gold standard laboratory testing and a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 93%, respectively, when using an anemia cutoff of 12.5 g/dL. Geotagged data enabled construction of an “anemia map” of the United States, which demonstrated that Hgb levels correlate with socioeconomic status, and that the app is more likely to be used in counties with higher median income counties, more Black residents, and more primary care physicians. In addition, “personalization” of the app’s AI-augmented algorithm empowers self-monitoring of Hgb levels for those already diagnosed with anemia, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. After personalization, the app’s mean absolute error improved from 1.36 to 0.74 g/dL ( P = 3.13E-11) and from 0.69 to 0.57 g/dL ( P = 0.006) for CKD patients and real-world users with known anemia, respectively.

          "abstract": "COP1 is a conserved ubiquitin ligase found in plants and animals. In plants, COP1 acts together with SPA proteins to suppress light signaling in darkness by promoting the degradation of transcription factors involved in photomorphogenesis. Substrates of this ubiquitin ligase share a Valine-Proline (VP) motif that interacts with the WD-repeat domain of COP1 in plants and humans. Here, we have identified the transcription factor TCP3 as a noncanonical substrate of COP1/SPA that lacks a VP motif. The TCP domain of TCP3 directly interacts with the WD-repeat domains of COP1 and SPA1. TCP3 requires the VP-binding cleft of COP1 for protein–protein interaction. We further show that the TCP3 protein is degraded in darkness and preferentially in short day through a COP1-dependent manner, while TCP3 is stabilized by red, far-red, blue light, and long day conditions. COP1/SPA-mediated degradation of TCP3 inhibits anthocyanin accumulation by reducing the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. COP1/SPA-mediated degradation of TCP3 is also important in regulating flowering time. Taken together, our results have identified a noncanonical substrate of the COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase, thereby also uncovering TCPs as a transcription factor family that is targeted by COP1/SPA.

          "abstract": "Wnt signaling orchestrates gene expression in a plethora of processes during development and adult cell homeostasis via the action of nuclear β-catenin. Yet, little is known about how β-catenin generates context-specific transcriptional outcomes. Understanding this will reveal how aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling causes neoplasia specifically of the colorectal epithelium. We have previously identified the transcription factor TBX3 as a tissue-specific component of the Wnt/β-catenin nuclear complex during mouse forelimb development. In this study, we show that TBX3 is functionally active in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, genome-wide binding and transcriptomics analyses reveal that TBX3 regulates cancer metastasis genes in cooperation with Wnt/β-catenin. Proteomics proximity labeling performed across Wnt pathway activation shows that TBX3 engages with several transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes found at Wnt responsive elements (WRE). Protein sequence and structure analysis of TBX3 revealed short motifs, including an exposed Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF), that mediate these interactions. Deletion of these motifs abrogates TBX3’s proximity to its protein partners and its ability to enhance the Wnt-dependent transcription. TBX3 emerges as a key modulator of the oncogenic activity of Wnt/β-catenin in CRC, and its mechanism of action exposes protein-interaction surfaces as putative druggable targets.",

However, it is also possible that an individual can reduce fear responses by predicting that they can transition to a safe environment through their own actions, even if a fear-inducing context appears. Here, by conducting two virtual reality (VR) experiments (Exp 1 and Exp 2) involving height and flight scenarios, we examined whether participants’ fear responses to height decrease after actively experiencing low-altitude VR flight, which allowed them to predict that they would be in a safe state by flying even if they fell from a height. Specifically, participants in the flight group (n = 44 and 46) flew over a city at altitudes below 5 m for 7 min, while participants in the control group (n = 41 and 28) watched a video of a flight group participant’s experience. Before and after the active flight or passive viewing task, both groups walked on a plank while having their skin conductance response (SCR) and subjective fear score (SFS) measured. In both Exp 1 and Exp 2, the active flight group exhibited a greater reduction in both SCR and SFS compared to the control group. Additionally, a multivariate regression of SCR using the questionnaires collected in Exp 2 revealed that the action-dependent safety prediction has a positive contribution to the SCR reduction in the flight group. These results clarified that the ability to transition to safe states by self-actions can reduce physiological and subjective fear responses.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells frequently reprogram one-carbon metabolic pathways to fulfill their vigorous demands of biosynthesis and antioxidant defense for survival and proliferation. Dysfunction of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes is critically involved in this process, but the precise mechanisms by which cancer cells actively trigger one-carbon metabolic alterations remain incompletely elucidated. Here, by using untargeted metabolomic analysis, we identify the oncoprotein SE translocation (SET) as a key regulator of one-carbon metabolism in cancer cells. SET physically interacts with mitochondrial SHMT2 and facilitates SHMT2 enzymatic activity. Loss of SET profoundly suppresses serine-derived one-carbon metabolic flux, whereas reexpression of ectopic SET leads to the opposite effect. Notably, although the presence of SHMT2 is critical for SET-mediated one-carbon metabolic alterations, the depletion of SHMT2 alone is insufficient to antagonize SET-induced tumor growth, probably due to functional compensation by its cytosolic isozyme SHMT1 upon SHMT2 knockdown. Instead, pharmacological targeting of cellular SHMT (including both SHMT1 and SHMT2) activity results in dramatic suppression of SET-induced tumor growth. Moreover, by using a Kras/Lkb1 mutation-driven lung tumor mouse model, we demonstrate that the loss of SET compromises both tumor formation and intratumoral SHMT2 enzymatic activity. Clinically, the overexpression of SET and SHMT2 is observed in lung tumors, both of which correlate with poor prognosis. Our study reveals a SET–SHMT2 axis in regulating serine-derived one-carbon metabolism and uncovers one-carbon metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism for SET-driven tumorigenesis.",

          "abstract": "Collagen has been evolutionarily selected as the preferred building block of extracellular structures. Despite inherent thermodynamic instability of individual proteins at body temperature, collagen manages to assemble into higher-order structures that provide mechanical support to tissues. Sequence features that enhance collagen stability have been deduced primarily from studies of collagen-mimetic peptides, as collagen’s large size has precluded high-resolution studies of its structure. Thus, methods are needed to analyze the structure and mechanics of full-length collagen proteins. In this study, we used AFM imaging to investigate the thermal response of collagen type IV, a key component of basement membranes. We observed a time-dependent loss of folded structures upon exposure to body temperature, with structural destabilization along the collagenous domain reflected by shorter contour lengths (seen also for collagens type I and III). We characterized the sequence-dependent bending stiffness profile of collagen IV as a function of temperature and identified a putative initiation site for thermally induced unfolding. Interchain disulfide bonds in collagen IV were shown to enhance thermal stability and serve as primary nucleation sites for in vitro refolding. In contrast to the canonical C-to-N-terminal folding direction, we found an interchain cystine knot to enable folding in the opposite direction. A multiple sequence alignment revealed that this cystine knot is evolutionarily conserved across metazoan phyla, highlighting its significance in the stabilization of early collagen IV structures. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the unfolding and refolding pathways of collagen IV, and how its heterogeneous sequence influences stability and mechanics.",

Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the degree of event-related synchronization in the alpha and beta bands during a basic motor imagery task was correlated with imagery-evoked motor learning. Thus, both behavioral and neural evidence indicate that motor imagery’s benefits extend beyond the imagined movements, improving performance in linked overt movements.

The latter switches from a helical hairpin packed against the NTD to a five-stranded β-roll upon displacement by RNA polymerase binding. Here, we use exchange-based NMR to probe fold-switching intermediates sampled by the isolated CTD. In addition to the predominant (~76 to 77%), semistable β-roll conformation (state A), we identify four structurally and kinetically distinct states: A′, B, B′, and B″. State B is NMR observable with an occupancy of ~23%, exchanges slowly (τ ex ~ 300 ms) with the major A species, and comprises a largely unfolded ensemble with transient occupancy of helical (α5*) and β-hairpin (β1*/β2*) elements. Backbone chemical shift-based structure predictions using the program CS-ROSETTA suggest that the two transient structural elements within the B state may interact with one another to form a semicompact structure. A′ (~0.35%) is an off-pathway state that exchanges rapidly (τ ex ~ 1 ms) with state A and likely entails a minor localized conformational change in the β1/β2 loop. State B′ (~0.3%) exchanges rapidly (τ ex ~ 1.2 ms) with state B and exhibits downfield 15 N backbone shifts (relative to B) in the α5* region indicative of reduced helicity. Finally state B″ (~0.05%) exchanges rapidly (τ ex ~ 0.8 to 1 ms) with either B′ (linear model) or B (branched model), displays significant differences in absolute 15 N chemical shift from states B and B′, and likely represents a further intermediate with increased helicity along the fold-switching pathway.",

Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form de novo pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.",

          "abstract": "Scheduled surgeries elicit stress in many patients. Levels of preoperative stress, anxiety, and female gender are known risk factors for increased and prolonged postoperative pain. The mechanisms by which psychological stress increases postoperative pain, especially in women, remain unknown. We hypothesized that stress amplifies postoperative pain by sensitizing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Prolactin (PRL) is a female-predominant neurohormone that is controlled by estrogen and stress. PRL signals at the prolactin receptor long (PRLR-L) and short (PRLR-S) isoforms to induce gene transcription and nociception, respectively. Critically, prolactin sensitizes female, but not male, murine, Macaque and human nociceptors, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with high translational potential for human therapy. Prior restraint stress (RS) increased the magnitude and duration of incisional injury–induced postoperative pain hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. In females, RS or incisional injury downregulated PRLR-L and increased PRL-dependent nociceptor excitability. Female selective inhibition of postoperative pain hypersensitivity was produced by a) pharmacological inhibition of pituitary PRL b) overexpression of DRG PRLR-L to bias PRL signaling away from PRLR-S and c) CRISPR/Cas9 editing of PRLR isoforms. PL200,019, our recently discovered monoclonal antibody against human PRL (hPRL), prevented hPRL-induced sensitization of human female nociceptors. Using female mice genetically modified to express hPRL, rather than murine PRL, PL200,019 prevented both stress and incisional injury–induced hypersensitivity. Preemptive inhibition of stress-induced nociceptor sensitization with a monoclonal antibody to sequester PRL can improve female postoperative pain, diminish the need for postoperative opioids and decrease the risks of transition to chronic pain.",

Here, we reported that the GDGT ring synthases mutant, deficient in GDGT cyclization, inhibited archaellum formation and reduced cell motility in thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius . This inhibition was caused by decreased transcription of the archaellum operon, likely due to cleavage of the C-terminal domains in transmembrane proteins ArnRs, the transcription factors that regulate archaellum operon expression. The transcriptomic and proteomic analysis showed deficiency of GDGT cyclization broadly impacted the expression of membrane associate proteins, including respiratory chain proteins, and decreased cellular ATP concentration. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the correlation between GDGT cyclization and archaellum formation is widespread among (hyper)thermophilic archaea, and this was further verified in the euryarchaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis.

This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogy. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on regular linguistic phenomena, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: Focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J’s behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J’s linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting analogy as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.",

          "abstract": "Many biological studies involve inferring the evolutionary history of a sample of individuals from a large population and interpreting the reconstructed tree. Such an ascertained tree typically represents only a small part of a comprehensive population tree and is distorted by survivorship and sampling biases. Inferring evolutionary parameters from ascertained trees requires modeling both the underlying population dynamics and the ascertainment process. A crucial component of this phylodynamic modeling involves tree simulation, which is used to benchmark probabilistic inference methods. To simulate an ascertained tree, one must first simulate the full population tree and then prune unobserved lineages. Consequently, the computational cost is determined not by the size of the final simulated tree, but by the size of the population tree in which it is embedded. In most biological scenarios, simulations of the entire population are prohibitively expensive due to computational demands placed on lineages without sampled descendants. Here, we address this challenge by proving that, for any partially ascertained process from a general multitype birth–death–mutation-sampling model, there exists an equivalent process with complete sampling and no death, a property which we leverage to develop a highly efficient algorithm for simulating trees. Our algorithm scales linearly with the size of the final simulated tree and is independent of the population size, enabling simulations from extremely large populations beyond the reach of current methods but essential for various biological applications. We anticipate that this massive speedup will significantly advance the development of novel inference methods that require extensive training data.",

A number of these studies emphasize the early life origins of these effects. For example, in several social mammals, more socially engaged mothers have infants with higher rates of survival compared to less socially engaged mothers, suggesting that positive maternal social relationships causally improve offspring survival. Here, we show that the relationship between infant survival and maternal sociality is confounded by previously underappreciated variation in female social behavior linked to changes in reproductive state and the presence of a live infant. Using data from a population of wild baboons living in the Amboseli basin of Kenya—a population where high levels of maternal sociality have previously been linked to improved infant survival—we find that infant- and reproductive state-dependent changes in female social behavior drive a statistically significant relationship between maternal sociality and infant survival. After accounting for these state-dependent changes in social behavior, maternal sociality is no longer positively associated with infant survival in this population. Our results emphasize the importance of considering multiple explanatory pathways—including third-variable effects—when studying the social determinants of health in wild populations.",

Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of human Na v 1.5 in open states, revealing sequential conformational changes in gating charges of the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) and several intracellular regions. Despite the channel being in the open state, these structures show repositioning, but no dislodging of the IFM motif in the receptor site. Molecular dynamics analyses show our structures with CTD conduct Na + ions.

Electrophysiological studies confirm that disrupting this interaction alters fast inactivation of Na v 1.5. Together, our structure–function studies establish a foundation for understanding the gating mechanisms of Na v 1.5 and the mechanisms underlying CTD-related channelopathies.",

Here, using a time-resolved in vitro reconstitution system, we show that MEX-5 dissolves preassembled liquid-like PGL-3/RNA condensates by altering RNA availability and shifting the phase boundary. We develop a microfluidic assay to systematically analyze how MEX-5 influences phase separation. By measuring the contribution of PGL-3 to phase separation, we show that MEX-5 reduces the free energy of PGL-3, shifting the equilibrium toward dissolution.

          "abstract": "Gating in voltage-dependent ion channels is regulated by the transmembrane voltage. This form of regulation is enabled by voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) that respond to transmembrane voltage differences by changing their conformation and exerting force on the pore to open or close it. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to study the neuronal K v 2.1 channel in lipid vesicles with and without a voltage difference across the membrane. Hyperpolarizing voltage differences displace the positively charged S4 helix in the voltage sensor by one helical turn (~5 Å). When this displacement occurs, the S4 helix changes its contact with the pore at two different interfaces. When these changes are observed in fewer than four voltage sensors, the pore remains open, but when they are observed in all four voltage sensors, the pore constricts. The constriction occurs because the S4 helix, as it displaces inward, squeezes the right-handed helical bundle of pore-lining S6 helices. A similar conformational change occurs upon hyperpolarization of the EAG1 channel but with two helical turns displaced instead of one. Therefore, while K v 2.1 and EAG1 are from distinct architectural classes of voltage-dependent ion channels, called domain-swapped and non-domain-swapped, the way the voltage sensors gate their pores is very similar.",

          "abstract": "Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology—a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics—necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs—either the left or right—depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a “bipolar” skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.",

          "abstract": "Developmental time (or time to maturity) strongly correlates with an animal’s maximum lifespan, with late-maturing individuals often living longer. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. This may be because most previously identified longevity genes regulate growth rate rather than developmental time. To address this gap, we genetically manipulated prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the primary regulator of developmental timing in Drosophila , to explore the genetic link between developmental time and longevity. Loss of PTTH delays developmental timing without altering the growth rate. Intriguingly, PTTH mutants exhibit extended lifespan despite their larger body size. This lifespan extension depends on ecdysone signaling, as feeding 20-hydroxyecdysone to PTTH mutants reverses the effect. Mechanistically, loss of PTTH blunts age-dependent chronic inflammation, specifically in fly hepatocytes (oenocytes). Developmental transcriptomics reveal that NF-κB signaling activates during larva-to-adult transition, with PTTH inducing this signaling via ecdysone. Notably, time-restricted and oenocyte-specific silencing of Relish (an NF-κB homolog) at early 3rd instar larval stages significantly prolongs adult lifespan while delaying pupariation. Our study establishes an aging model that uncouples developmental time from growth rate, highlighting NF-κB signaling as a key developmental program in linking developmental time to adult lifespan.",

          "abstract": "The distinction between “reinforcement” and “cloaking” has been overlooked in optimization-based design of devices intended to conceal a defect in an elastic medium. In the former, a so-called “cloak” is severely biased toward one or a few specific elastic disturbances, whereas in the latter, an “unbiased cloak” is effective under any elastic disturbance. We propose a two-stage approach for optimization-based design of elastostatic cloaks that targets true, unbiased cloaks. First, we perform load-case optimization to find a finite set of worst-case design loads. Then we perform topology optimization of the cloak microstructure under these worst-case loads using a judicious choice of the objective function, formulated in terms of energy mismatch. Although a small subset of the infinite load cases that the cloak must handle, these highly nonintuitive, worst-case loads lead to designs that approach perfect and unbiased elastostatic cloaking. In demonstration, we consider elastic media composed of spinodal architected materials, which provides an ideal testbed for exploring elastostatic cloaks in media with varying anisotropy and porosity, without sacrificing manufacturability. To numerically verify the universal nature of our cloaks, we compare the elastic response of the medium containing the cloaked defect to that of the undisturbed medium under many random load cases not considered during design. By using digital light processing additive manufacturing to realize the elastic media containing cloaked defects and analyzing their response experimentally using compression testing with digital image correlation, this study provides a physical demonstration of elastostatic cloaking of a three-dimensional defect in a three-dimensional medium.",

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers a potential solution. Given a nanoscale map of two putative interaction partners, it should be possible to assign molecules either to the class of coupled pairs or to the class of noncoupled bystanders. Here, we developed a probabilistic algorithm that allows accurate determination of both the absolute number and the proportion of molecules that form coupled pairs. The algorithm calculates interaction probabilities for all possible pairs of localized molecules, selects the most likely interaction set, and corrects for any spurious colocalizations. Benchmarking this approach across a set of simulated molecular localization maps with varying densities (up to ∼55 molecules μm −2 ) and localization precisions (1 to 50 nm) showed typical errors in the identification of correct pairs of only a few percent. At molecular densities of ∼5 to 10 molecules μm −2 and localization precisions of 20 to 30 nm, which are typical parameters for SMLM imaging, the recall was ∼90%. The algorithm was effective at differentiating between noninteracting and coupled molecules both in simulations and experiments. Finally, it correctly inferred the number of coupled pairs over time in a simulated reaction–diffusion system, enabling determination of the underlying rate constants. The proposed approach promises to enable direct visualization and quantification of intermolecular interactions using SMLM.",

The importance of the transcription factors estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in controlling innate mitochondrial energetics has been recently demonstrated. However, whether different ERR isoforms display distinct functions in glycolytic versus oxidative myofibers is largely unknown. Moreover, their roles in regulating exercise-induced adaptive mitochondrial biogenesis remain unclear. Using muscle-specific single and combinatorial knockout mouse models, we have identified both cooperative and distinct roles of the ERR isoforms ERRα and ERRγ in regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism in different muscles. We demonstrate the essential roles of both these ERRs in mediating adaptive mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise training. We further show that PGC1α-induced mitochondrial biogenesis is completely abolished in primary myotubes with ERRα deletion but not ERRγ, highlighting distinct roles of these two isoforms in adaptive mitochondrial remodeling. Mechanistically, we find that both ERRs directly bind to the majority of mitochondrial energetic genes and control their expression, largely through collaborative binding to the same genomic loci. Collectively, our findings reveal critical and direct regulatory roles of ERRα and ERRγ in governing both innate and adaptive mitochondrial energetics in skeletal muscle.",

Field behavioral experiments demonstrated that resin use is critical for hunting success, as the predator uses resin to stimulate the colonial defense of stingless bees, luring attacking bees toward its optimal hunting position. Chemical analysis revealed that resin processing by the assassin bug enhances the emission of volatile compounds, making the resin more attractive and stimulating to guard bees. Through these experiments, we empirically demonstrate how an invertebrate predator adapts to the colony defense of social insects via tool use behavior. We further propose that complex tool use can evolve under selective pressures driven by diet specialization.

          "abstract": "In the insect realm, liquids become traps due to capillary and viscous forces dominant at their scale. Yet, aphids handle the highly viscous honeydew droplets they secrete by coating them with hydrophobic wax powder which maintains an air layer between their body and the liquid. These coated droplets, known as liquid marbles, exhibit low friction and high mobility, enabling manipulation of small liquid volumes which is useful for biomedical analysis where sample volumes are limited, chemistry to reduce chemical waste, or digital microfluidics for large-scale cell culturing and drug testing. For such applications—including exothermic reactions or biological studies typically conducted above room temperature—the ability to carry hot liquid is important but remains unexplored. This article investigates the stability and static friction of hot liquid marbles placed on a substrate cooler by ∆ T . We show that for large ∆ T , the core liquid evaporates and condenses within the air layer below the marbles creating liquid bridges resulting in marble rupture on hydrophilic substrates and increased static friction on hydrophobic ones. The temperature difference modifies the nature of static friction: solid friction dominates at small ∆ T , while at larger ∆ T , it is replaced by a liquid pinning force caused by the increased liquid bridge density resulting from condensation. Finally, our study provides ways to avoid the rupture and increased static friction of hot liquid marbles due to the bridge formation by increasing the particle size, decreasing the liquid volatility, or using nanostructured superhydrophobic substrates.",

Delineating the driver(s) and tempo of the GOE and its impact on microbial evolution and biogeochemistry can be aided by characterizing the cycling of redox-sensitive elements such as nitrogen. While previous studies have shown that the transition to a broadly aerobic marine nitrogen cycle occurred in step with the final phase of the GOE ~2.33 billion years ago (Ga), an evolving understanding of the GOE as a dynamic oscillatory process and the narrow spatial distribution of existing studies highlight ambiguity in the marine nitrogen cycle in the lead up to permanent atmospheric oxygenation.

A significant negative carbon isotope excursion (6 to 8‰) in the Duitschland Formation indicates massive oxidation of organic carbon in close association with a putative snowball Earth event and an earlier pulse of atmospheric oxygen at 2.43 Ga. Further, consistently positive δ 15 N values (≤ +20.3‰) within the Duitschland Formation, combined with a broad temporal shift across global δ 15 N records to a distribution comparable to modern marine sediments, signify an aerobic nitrogen cycle ~100 My earlier than previously accepted.

NonA-nonB-ICs (nA/nB-ICs) also produce Slc26a4 though their function is unclear. Though both nephron and ureteric progenitor lineages generate A-ICs, the former also generates nA/nB-ICs and the latter B-ICs. Lineage and cell type restricted transporter gene expression in the mouse and human kidney is preceded by expression of the transcriptional regulators Dmrt2/DMRT2 in A-ICs, and either, or both, Hmx2/HMX2 and Hmx3/HMX3 in B- and nA/nB ICs. CRISPR/Cas9-directed removal of Dmrt2 and the linked Hmx2 / Hmx3 genes resulted in IC-subtype switching. A-ICs adopted an Hmx2 + /Slc26a4 + B-IC cell fate on Dmrt2 removal while B-ICs initiated a Dmrt2 + /Slc4a1 + A-IC program on Hmx2/Hmx3 removal. Triple knockout of Dmrt2 , Hmx2 , and Hmx3 resulted in hybrid ICs expressing both Slc4a1 and Slc26a4 . Thus, restricted expression of these regulators is essential for specifying IC subtypes. To explore these mechanisms, Hmx2 and Dmrt2 were activated ectopically in ureteric organoid cultures. Introduction of Foxi1 —a pan determinant of ICs—activated early Dmrt2 + A-IC development while cointroduction of Hmx2 silenced Foxi1-dependent Dmrt2 expression and led to an upregulation of Slc26a4. In contrast, coexpression of Foxi1 and Dmrt2 upregulated Slc4a1 . These data support a model in which mutually repressive interactions between Dmrt2 and Hmx2/3 establish distinct IC identities and ongoing activity of these factors supports gene regulatory programs specific to each IC subtype.",

However, existing day-ahead electricity dispatch approaches primarily focus on the transmission network and lack the capability to manage the spatiotemporal risks associated with the vast distribution networks, which can potentially lead to significant power imbalances due to the mismatches between scheduled generation and actual demand. To address this increasingly critical gap under intensifying climate extremes and growing distributed renewable integration, we introduce Risk-aware Electricity Dispatch under Climate Extremes with Renewable integration (REDUCER), a risk-aware day-ahead electricity dispatch model that incorporates high-resolution spatiotemporal risk analysis for distribution networks with large-scale distributed renewable integration into an Entropic Value-at-Risk-constrained mixed-integer convex optimization framework. Applied to the 2022 Puerto Rico power grid under Hurricane Fiona, the proposed REDUCER model is seen to effectively manage these risks with substantially less reliance on additional flexibility resources to cope with power imbalances, reducing overall operational costs by about 30% under extreme cases compared to standard unit commitment strategies already informed by average demand loss. Also, the proposed REDUCER model consistently demonstrates its effectiveness in managing the increasing temporal net demand variability introduced by growing large-scale distributed solar integration while maintaining minimal operational costs. This model offers a practical solution for cost-effective and resilient electricity dispatch of modern power systems with large-scale renewable integration facing intensifying climate risks.",

          "abstract": "Using pulsed-power magnetic field sources to compress gallium to gigapascal pressures on nanosecond timescales, we report here experiments on shockless dynamic compression of a liquid metal. Time-resolved velocimetry data reveal signatures of rapid freezing from a metastable liquid state, and we demonstrate that the kinetics of this nonequilibrium solidification can be accurately simulated with a computational modeling framework we have developed in previous studies, where classical nucleation theory is coupled with hydrodynamics. Notably, velocity traces in some of our experiments show evidence of a phase transition, while others do not, even though other types of evidence suggest that solidification may be occurring in all of them. We explain how predictions made by our models regarding the presence or absence of these phase-transition signatures motivated additional experiments that later confirmed the theoretical predictions. Our analysis shows that due to the rapid, quasi-isentropic nature of the loading path, our experiments were able to compress liquid gallium to metastable states that are undercooled below the equilibrium melt temperature by more than 300 K and exhibit pressures that approach five times the equilibrium melt pressure. The understanding gained in this study should form the basis for future dynamic-compression experiments aimed at interrogating melt curves at high pressures.",

          "abstract": "Evaporation of sessile multicomponent droplets is ubiquitous in many common processes, such as printing, cooling, and coating. The evaporation rate is not evenly distributed across the surface of the droplet. As a result, there are regions with high evaporation rates in which the more volatile part evaporates preferentially; this can induce local surface tension gradients, which, in combination with density differences, can lead to flows within the droplet originating from local concentration gradients. Current experimental methods are based on the addition of markers that can alter liquid properties. Thus, marker-free experimental evidence for the concentration fields proposed is needed. In this work, we use Raman imaging and MRI to quantify concentration gradients in 4.2 μL droplets of 90 mol% water and 10 mol% glycerol. MRI concentration maps with 33 μm resolution enable the investigation of local concentrations as close as 100 μm to the 3-phase contact line. Raman imaging allows even higher resolution and longer observation times. The results of both methods are in excellent agreement. In accordance with the simulations, an increasing glycerol content close to the 3-phase contact line was found. Close to the droplet apex, the glycerol content decreased. The horizontal and vertical concentration gradients were on the order of 1 × 10 −2 mol%μm −1 . These findings can be used for the development and optimization of inks, medical diagnostic devices, food processing procedures, 3D bioprinting, and many more; they might provide the experimental concentration fields sought for the optimization of simulations.",

Fire-PM 2.5 exposure occurs mainly indoors, where people spend most of their time. As an effective and timely approach of mitigating indoor PM 2.5 pollution, air purifiers incur notable associated costs. However, the long-term global population exposure to indoor fire-PM 2.5 and the economic burden of using air purifiers remain unknown. Here, we estimated the indoor fire-PM 2.5 concentration and the cost of reducing indoor PM 2.5 exposure, along with the extra cost incurred because of fire-PM 2.5 , at a resolution of 0.5° by 0.5° globally during 2003 to 2022. Our findings revealed 1009 million individuals exposed to at least one substantial indoor wildfire-air pollution day per year. We identified pronounced socioeconomic disparities in the costs of mitigating indoor PM 2.5 exposure, with low-income countries bearing a disproportionately higher economic burden, emphasizing the critical need for addressing these disparities.",

As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.",

          "abstract": "Tectonic tremor tracks the repeated slow rupture of certain major plate boundary faults. One of the most perplexing aspects about tremor is that some fault segments produce strongly periodic, spatially extensive tremor episodes, while others have more disorganized, asynchronous activity. Here, we measure the size of segments that activate synchronously during tremor episodes and the relationship to regional earthquake rate on major plate boundaries. Tremor synchronization in space seems to be limited by the activity of small, nearby crustal and intraslab earthquakes. This observation can be explained by a competition between the self-synchronization of fault segments and perturbation by regional earthquakes. Our results imply previously unrecognized interactions across subduction systems, in which earthquake activity far from the fault influences whether it breaks in small or large segments.",

However, the limitations posed by the incompatibility of perovskite thin film with wet lithography greatly hinder its potential in many important applications, including ultrahigh-density displays, high-resolution image sensors, high-density memristors, and integrated photonic circuitry. To tackle this bottleneck problem, we develop the self-aligned close-spaced sublimation growth of perovskite quantum wires and demonstrate 0.18-micrometer feature size perovskite patterns, meanwhile achieving a pixel density of 63,500 pixels per inch, the highest reported for perovskite. We showcase pixelation of perovskite quantum wires with color conversion films, addressing the need for full-color microdisplays. In addition, we demonstrate these films on curved substrates, holding promise for near-eye microdisplays.

The electrostatic potential at the surface of the t-hBN substrate provides a simple way to confine excitons in the MoSe 2 monolayer. The excitons confined within the domains and at the domain walls are spectrally separated because of a pronounced Stark shift. Moreover, the patterned light emission can be dynamically controlled by electrically gating the ferroelectric domains, introducing a functionality beyond other semiconductor moiré superlattices.

This is accomplished using at-distance wirelessly recharged, wearable biosymbiotic devices for powering and communication with fully implantable NFC-enabled implants.

We investigated this further by engineering murine B16 melanoma cells to overexpress various IFN-I subtypes, where a spectrum of outcomes was observed. Characterization of these tumors by RNA sequencing revealed a tumor immune phenotype, where potent IFN-I signaling concomitant with diminished type 2 inflammation failed to confer durable tumor control. T cell–mediated rejection of these tumors was restored by introducing interleukin-4 (IL-4) into the tumor microenvironment, either through ectopic expression or in a preclinical adoptive T cell therapy model.

Here, we uncover a hormonal cross-talk framework that orchestrates the age-related balance between plant growth and herbivore defense. We demonstrate that the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), synthesized by Nicotiana benthamiana phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 6 (NbPAL6), dictates insect resistance in adult plants. NbPAL6 expression is driven by the key transcription factor, NbMYB42, which is regulated by two interacting auxin response factors, NbARF18La/b. In juvenile plants, higher auxin levels activate Nb miR160c, a microRNA that simultaneously silences NbARF18La/b , subsequently reducing NbMYB42 expression, lowering SA accumulation, and thus weakening herbivore defense. Excessive SA in juvenile plants enhances defense but antagonizes auxin signaling, impairing early growth. Our findings suggest a seesaw-like model that balances growth and defense depending on the plant’s developmental stage.",

Their formation is often linked to plume-lithosphere interactions, with some coronae showing signs of plate boundary-like processes such as subduction. However, the low resolution of Venus gravity data limits detailed analysis of these features. Using 3D geodynamic models, we predict gravity signals under various plume-induced corona formation scenarios. Comparing these predictions to observations, we show that combining topography and gravity data is more effective for understanding dynamic processes than using topography alone. Of the 75 resolved coronae, gravity indicates buoyant mantle material beneath 52. We predict a range of plume-lithosphere interactions and activity stages across these coronae. Moreover, we find that the limited resolution of the Magellan gravity field can obscure gravity signatures otherwise indicative of plume activity.

However, the role of 26 S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 (PSMD14) in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains to be determined. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that silencing PSMD14 notably attenuated the growth, invasion, and metastasis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of PSMD14 produced the opposite results. Mechanistically, PSMD14 decreased K63-linked ubiquitination on SF3B4 protein to de-ubiquitin and stabilize SF3B4 protein. Then, SF3B4/HNRNPC complex bound to FADS1 mRNA and promoted exon inclusion in the target mRNA through m 6 A site on FADS1 mRNA recognized by HNRNPC, thereby up-regulating the expression of FADS1 and activating Akt/mTOR signaling. Exogenous arachidonic acid supplementation combined with PSMD14 knockdown induced synthetic lethality, which was further confirmed in TNBC organoid (PDO) and TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal an oncogenic role of PSMD14 in TNBC progression, which indicates a potential biomarker and ferroptosis-mediated therapeutic strategy for TNBC.",

However, their practical application is limited by a low coulombic efficiency (CE) and a short lifespan resulting from a large volume change and the growth of Na dendrites. Here, we propose a three-dimensional versatile host composed of interconnected N,P-codoped carbon macroporous fibers incorporated with CoP nanoparticles (denoted as CoP@N/P-CMFs) for selective nucleation and uniform deposition of Na. The porous skeleton reduces structural stress and inhibits dendrite growth by decreasing local current density and homogenizing Na + flux. Furthermore, the sodiophilic CoP and N,P-codoped carbon reduce the energy barrier for Na nucleation, further manipulating homogeneous Na growth. Consequently, the CoP@N/P-CMFs exhibit an ultrahigh CE of more than 99.97% (10 milliamperes per square centimeter and 10 milliampere-hours per square centimeter) and dendrite-free Na deposition.

          "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in the PINK1 kinase lead to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate ubiquitin and Parkin, triggering mitophagy. PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates Rab GTPases, such as Rab8A. Using an siRNA library targeting human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells, we identified EIF2AK1 [heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase], a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), as a negative regulator of PINK1. EIF2AK1 knockdown enhances mitochondrial depolarization–induced PINK1 stabilization and phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. These results were confirmed in SK-OV-3, U2OS, and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of DELE1, an activator of EIF2AK1, produced similar effects. Notably, the ISR inhibitor ISRIB also enhanced PINK1 activation. In human cells with mito-QC mitophagy reporters, EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment increased PINK1-dependent mitophagy without affecting deferiprone-induced mitophagy. These findings suggest that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR pathway is a negative regulator of PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Further evaluation in PD-relevant models is needed to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway.",

Recent studies have documented the efficient generation of spin torque using spin-orbit interactions (SOIs); however, SOI use relies on the employment of rare metals such as platinum. Here, we demonstrate that a nanometer-thick gradient from silicon to aluminum, which consists of readily available elements from earth resources, can produce a spin torque as large as that of platinum despite the weak SOI of these compositions. The spin torque efficiency can be improved by decreasing the thickness of the gradient, while a sharp interface was not found to increase the spin torque. Moreover, the electric conductivity of the gradient material can be up to twice as large as that of platinum, which provides a way to reduce Joule heating losses in spintronic devices.",

Here, a multifunctional nanozyme MET-CMS@FeTA (MCMSFT) formulated to induce nonapoptotic ferroptosis and boost immune recognition/attack, where compensatory mechanisms collectively overcome intrinsic tumor therapeutic limitations and improve medical intervention outcomes. Leveraging the multienzyme-like activity of MCMSFT to achieve oxygen generation, hydroxyl radical production, and glutathione depletion promotes hypoxia relief and triggers apoptosis/ferroptosis. Notably, MCMSFT-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) facilitates direct tumor thermal ablation and offers exogenous heat to accelerate nanocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, PTT/ferroptosis-caused immunogenic cell death favors antitumor immunity initiation. Simultaneously, metformin administration and hypoxia amelioration down-regulate programmed death ligand 1 alleviating immune evasion. Interferon-γ secretion poses positive feedback to ferroptosis, thereby establishing a ferroptosis-immune mutual amplification loop. Antitumor performances illustrate that MCMSFT eliminates primary tumors and suppresses metastasis/rechallenge tumors.

Individual agents choose their own actions based solely on information in their immediate environment, with no centralized control. The structures that these processes produce are the result of the collective action of the individual agents, rather than a predetermined design. We build an integrated platform for determining “rule-structure-property” relationships, analogous to process-structure-property relationships in materials science. The platform simulates agent behaviors to show how different rules and different environments result in different structures. We then three-dimensional print these and perform finite element analysis to experimentally and numerically characterize mechanical properties, including tensile strength and energy dissipation.",

It is thought that melt storage becomes deeper and ephemeral with the transition from highly voluminous tholeiitic (shield stage) to the less voluminous alkaline (post-shield and rejuvenation stages) magmatism. To quantitatively test this, we applied high-precision fluid inclusion barometry via Raman spectroscopy to samples from representative volcanoes of different evolutionary stages. This suggests an evolution from shield-stage shallow magma storage (~1 to 2 kilometers) for Kīlauea to a post-shield stage that includes crustal magma storage within the volcanic edifice (~2 kilometers) and deeper storage below the Moho (~20 to 27 kilometers) for Haleakalā. The rejuvenation stage (Diamond Head) displays mantle-dominated storage (~22 to 30 kilometers). High melt fluxes likely form stable conduits from the mantle to a shallow reservoir in the shield volcanoes. As melt flux decreases, the Moho becomes the boundary controlling melt stagnation and evolution.",

The robot integrates complex functions with a simple, cost-effective, and compact construction, allowing placement inside a tissue culture hood for sterile workflows.

A variety of emergent properties arises from this active polymer-like system, including locomotion, navigation, transportation, and competitive or cooperative interactions. By adjusting a few link parameters, we show how link-bots can perform diverse tasks, including traversing or obstructing narrow spaces, passing by or enclosing objects, and propelling loads in different directions. Overall, the reconfigurability of link-bots indicates their potential in developing programmable soft robotic systems with simple components and materials at any scale.",

Using 20 statistically equivalent phylogenies of the bacterial cutinase family, we generated 48 ancestral sequences revealing a wide range of PETase activities, highlighting the value of mASR in uncovering functional variants. Our findings show PETase activity can evolve through multiple pathways involving mutations remote from the active site. Moreover, analyzing the PETase fitness landscape with local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE) revealed that LASE can capture sequence features linked to PETase activity.

The detector demonstrates an excellent zero-bias responsivity of 0.62 ampere per watt (A/W), a low-noise equivalent power of 19.6 picowatt per square root of hertz (pW/Hz 1/2 ), and a fast response time of 4.5 nanosecond (ns) at 0.1 terahertz (THz). The metal doping effect and asymmetric terahertz heating play vital roles in the hot-carrier PTE response at the metal-semimetal interfaces. Moreover, scanning photocurrent mapping shows that the short-wave zero-bias photoresponse is closely localized to the metal-semimetal interfaces, further revealing the metal doping effect. The bias-dependent photocurrent indicates that the short-wave photoresponse still originates from the PTE effect and the photovoltaic response is negligible.

In terrestrial vertebrates, inhaled odorants diffuse through olfactory epithelial mucus (OEM) before activating olfactory receptors (ORs) on olfactory sensory neurons and initiating adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)–mediated signaling. Impaired OEM secretion is associated with impaired olfactory sensitivity in humans and mice, but it remains unclear whether OEM directly improves sensitivity and whether specific active factors exist. Here, using a cAMP imaging–based heterologous OR expression assay, we demonstrate that fibronectin from human OEM increases the sensitivity of OR response to odorant. Fibronectin application partially restores electrical olfactory response of the mouse olfactory epithelium after OEM removal. In humans, OEM fibronectin levels are significantly decreased in patients with idiopathic olfactory disorder. These findings shed light on the role of OEM fibronectin in olfaction and may lead to sensitivity-enhancing additives for odorant sensors and treatments for hyposmia.",

In four experiments, we used cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to enhance (ccPAS PMv-M1 ) or inhibit (ccPAS M1-PMv ) PMv-to-M1 connectivity via Hebbian plasticity. Leveraging state-dependent properties of transcranial magnetic stimulation, we targeted function-specific visuomotor neurons within the pathway, testing their physiological/behavioral relevance to AVMM. State-dependent ccPAS PMv-M1 , applied during motor responses to target visual cues, enhanced neurophysiological and behavioral indices of AVMM, while ccPAS M1-PMv had an opposite influence, with the effects being more pronounced for target relative to control visual cues.

          "abstract": "Mars hosts various auroral processes despite the planet’s tenuous atmosphere and lack of a global magnetic field. To date, all aurora observations have been at ultraviolet wavelengths from orbit. We describe the discovery of green visible-wavelength aurora, originating from the atomic oxygen line at 557.7 nanometers, detected with the SuperCam and Mastcam-Z instruments on the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover. Near–real-time simulations of a Mars-directed coronal mass ejection (CME) provided sufficient lead-time to schedule an observation with the rover. The emission was observed 3 days after the CME eruption, suggesting that the aurora was induced by particles accelerated by the moving shock front. To our knowledge, detection of aurora from a planetary surface other than Earth has never been reported, nor has visible aurora been observed at Mars. This detection demonstrates that auroral forecasting at Mars is possible, and that during events with higher particle precipitation, or under less dusty atmospheric conditions, aurorae will be visible to future astronauts.",

Recent advancements in computationally augmented systems have dramatically reduced device form factors toward those compatible with consumer tech integration. However, for a commercial reality, most applications demand operation across visible to short-wave infrared (SWIR) range. In this regard, existing miniaturized devices are either constrained by physical properties; use complex, costly, or unscalable fabrication techniques; or require multiple components to address separate parts of the spectrum. Here, we report on a low-cost, visible to SWIR, miniaturized spectrometer design enabled by a mass-producible, nonlithographic method of engineering planar dispersive elements from widely available plastics. By deforming shape memory epoxies, we encode spectral information, which is processed by a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor array and reconstructed via algorithms. This design offers broadband capability from 400 to 1600 nanometers and enables line-scanning spectral imaging, paving the way for affordable spectrometers.",

We then investigate the effects of the coexistence of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b by comparing various chlorophyll compositions. Our results reveal that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy to preferentially flow through specific domains that act as safety valves, preventing downstream overflow. Our findings suggest that the light-harvesting proteins in a photosystem II supercomplex achieve evolutionary advantages with the natural chlorophyll a/b ratio, capturing light energy efficiently and safely across various light intensities.

However, conventional strain is below 0.5%, limiting exploration of unique properties under substantial strain. In addition, while uniaxial strain modifies magnetic interactions anisotropically, its influence on skyrmions is underexplored. Here, we integrate skyrmion-hosting multilayers with a flexible liquid crystal film, enabling multistep skyrmion phase transitions through light-induced uniaxial strain up to 1%. Our results demonstrate that skyrmion transitions are sensitive to strain magnitude and orientation. Strain below 0.6% parallel to stripes transforms them into skyrmions. Above 0.6%, skyrmions elongate perpendicularly to the strain direction, exhibiting a negative Poisson effect, with deformation up to 40% at 0.8% strain. Further strain reverts skyrmions back into stripes. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that these phenomena stem from strain-induced anisotropic modulation of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This approach, which combines flexibility, light activation, and substantial uniaxial strain, offers a promising strategy for low-power, multistate spintronic devices.",

Our data reveal that myeloid-specific Mac-1 significantly increases EAE severity and hinders disease regression. Loss of Mac-1 increases Gr-1 + cells in peripheral tissues and the CNS and preferably accelerates the transition of Ly6C hi monocytes from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in a disease stage–dependent manner. Mechanistically, our results demonstrate that Mac-1 suppresses interferon-γ production and prevents monocytes from acquiring immunosuppressive functions by reducing the expression of iNOS, IDO, and CD84.

While volcanic ash (VA) has been shown to nucleate ice crystals efficiently in laboratory settings, its importance for ice formation in the atmosphere remains elusive. Here, we show evidence of cirrus modification by volcanic eruptions through ice nucleation on VA, revealed by abrupt changes in cirrus properties following volcanic eruptions based on satellite measurements. The distinct changes captured are a phenomenal decrease in number, an increase in size of ice crystals in cirrus clouds, and an increase in cirrus occurrences after ash-rich volcanic eruptions. Conversely, no such changes were detected following the ash-poor eruption. We propose a cirrus formation mechanism where VA nucleates ice heterogeneously, suppressing homogeneous freezing and resulting in fewer but larger ice crystals. This suppression of homogeneous freezing by VA is supported by process-level cloud microphysical simulations. Our findings advance the understanding of aerosol–ice cloud interactions and illuminate cirrus geoengineering.",

Using AlphaFold-3 modeling and in vitro mutational analysis, we identified residues in the WD40 domain of SEC13 and SUMO2/3’s C terminus involved in the interaction. Furthermore, SIM-binding groove mutants failed to interact with SUMO E3 ligases belonging to the PIAS family, RANBP2, ZNF451, and TOPORS, leading to loss of covalent conjugation to most of SUMO target proteins.

Here, we examine maturation of an MA triple mutant, L20K/E73K/A82T, which, despite replicating similarly to wild-type (WT) in some cell lines, exhibits distinct biochemical behaviors that suggest altered MA-MA interactions. Cryo–electron tomography with subtomogram averaging reveals that, although the MA lattice in immature L20K/E73K/A82T virions closely resembles that of the WT, mature L20K/E73K/A82T virions lack a detectable MA lattice. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this absence results from destabilized inter-trimer MA interactions in mature L20K/E73K/A82T mutant virions.

Mutation in dpy19l1l resulted in idiopathic scoliosis (IS)–like body axis curvature in the absence of muscle or cilia defects. URP2 expression was down-regulated in dpy19l1l −/− mutants. Notably, RF formation was impaired in dpy19l1l −/− mutants, and a similar phenotype was induced in wild-type embryos by injecting messenger RNA encoding a C-mannosylation catalytic site-mutated dpy19l1l variant (E106A mdpy19l1l ).

This suggests that changes in mean rainfall are primarily controlled by the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of Earth’s main greenhouse gases: water vapor and carbon dioxide. Consistent with comprehensive general circulation models, our results explain why mean rainfall increases with surface warming at about 2% per kelvin, why this rate is largely unchanged over numerous doublings of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and why mean rainfall decreases in hothouse climates.",

Using LiTa 2 PO 8 as a case study, we have shown that the combination of LiF as a sintering agent with Hf 4+ implantation improves grain-grain contact, resulting in smaller, evenly distributed pores, reduced chemical contrast, and minimized nonconductive impurities. A suite of techniques has been used to decouple the effects of LiF and Hf 4+ . Specifically, LiF modifies particle shape and breaks large pores into smaller ones, while Hf 4+ addresses the chemical mismatches between grains and grain boundaries. Consequently, this approach achieves nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in ion conduction. Tuning mesoscale structures offers a cost-effective method for enhancing ion transport in polycrystalline systems and has notable implications for synthesizing high-performance ionic materials.",

To address this, we developed a conditioning paradigm using a looming visual stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) in mice and identified a distinct neural circuit for visual threat conditioning. Parabrachial CGRP neurons were necessary for both conditioning and memory retrieval. Upstream neurons in the posterior insular cortex (pIC) responded to looming stimuli, and their projections to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) induced aversive states and drove conditioning. However, this pIC-to-PBN pathway was not required for foot-shock conditioning.

          "abstract": "Language is a combinatorial communication system able to generate an infinite number of meanings. Nonhuman animals use several combinatorial mechanisms to expand meanings, but maximum one mechanism is reported per species, suggesting an evolutionary leap to human language. We tested whether chimpanzees use several meaning-expanding mechanisms. We recorded 4323 utterances in 53 wild chimpanzees and compared the events in which chimpanzees emitted two-call vocal combinations (bigrams) with those eliciting the component calls. Examining 16 bigrams, we found four combinatorial mechanisms whereby bigram meanings were or were not derived from the meaning of their parts—compositional or noncompositional combinations, respectively. Chimpanzees used each mechanism in several bigrams across a wide range of daily events. This combinatorial system allows encoding many more meanings than there are call types. Such a system in nonhuman animals has never been documented and may be transitional between rudimentary systems and open-ended systems like human language.",

          "abstract": "The mechanisms that regulate HIV-1 latency are not fully elucidated. Our previous studies showed that an HIV-1 antisense transcript (AST) promotes the deposition of histone modifications at the HIV-1 5′ long terminal repeat, causing a closed chromatin state that suppresses viral transcription. Here, we report that ectopic expression of AST in CD4 + T cells from people living with HIV-1 undergoing antiretroviral therapy hinders the reactivation of viral transcription in response to ex vivo stimulation with pharmacologic and T cell receptor agonists, thus preventing the reversal of latency. We defined the structural domains and sequence motifs of AST that contribute to its latency-promoting functions. Last, we carried out an unbiased proteomic screen of AST interactors that revealed an array of host factors both previously known and not known to suppress HIV-1 expression. Our studies identify AST as a first-in-class biological molecule that is capable of enforcing HIV-1 latency and with actionable curative potential.",

          "abstract": "During asymmetric cell division (ACD) of radial glia progenitors (RGPs), the cortical polarity regulator Par-3 is detected in the cytoplasm colocalizing with dynein and Notch ligand DeltaD (Dld). What drives Par-3 to the cytoplasm and its impact on RGP ACD remain unknown. Here, we visualize cytoplasmic Par-3 using in vivo time-lapse imaging and find that Ser 954 of zebrafish Par-3 is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase A (AurkA) in vitro. Expression of the nonphosphorylated mutant Par-3 S954A dominant negatively affects embryonic development, reduces cytoplasmic Par-3, and disrupts the anteroposterior asymmetry of cortical Par-3 and Dld endosomes and, in turn, daughter cell fate. AurkA in mitotic RGPs shows dynamic pericentrosomal distribution that transiently colocalizes with cortical Par-3 preferentially on the posterior side. AurkA is both necessary and sufficient to increase cytoplasmic while decreasing cortical Par-3, disrupts Par-3 cortical asymmetry, and perturbs polarized Dld endosome dynamics. These findings suggest that AurkA regulates Par-3 cortical-cytoplasmic dynamics that is critical for ACD and daughter cell fate.",

In this study, we demonstrate that MCB can also have a significant impact on both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, and discuss the processes via which such an influence could occur. Our results demonstrate the inherent coupling between the troposphere and the stratosphere and underscore the need to assess not just the potential surface climate impacts of MCB, or any other climate intervention, but also their holistic interaction with the whole Earth system, including the middle atmosphere.",

The syndrome is linked to subfertility and pregnancy complications, yet the independent effects of exposure to hyperandrogenism and obesity on endometrial function remain unclear. Here, PCOS-like mice were generated using prenatal androgenization (PNA) with dihydrotestosterone, followed by a prepubertal high-fat (HF) or standard diet. In ovariectomized mice, PNA impaired uterine closure during the implantation window, disrupted decidualization, and altered extracellular matrix– and inflammation-related gene expression. The effects were aggravated by the HF diet. In naturally mated, ovary-intact mice, PNA and HF diet affected decidual and placental gene expression, suggestive of placental dysfunction and inflammation, and induced fetal growth restriction. This study underlines the role of the uterus in adverse pregnancy outcomes in PCOS and identifies possible underlying mechanisms for future studies. Prepregnancy interventions targeting metabolic health and hyperandrogenism should be the next steps to optimize PCOS pregnancy outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Dystonia, characterized by repetitive twisting movements or abnormal postures, has been linked to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). However, the specific roles of distinct neuronal populations within the DCN in driving dystonic behaviors remain unclear. This study explores the contributions of three distinct groups of DCN neurons in an animal model of paroxysmal dystonia harboring a mutation in the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 ( Prrt2 ) gene. We observed sustained calcium activity elevation across glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic inferior olive (IO)–projecting neurons within the DCN during episodes of dystonia in Prrt2 -mutant mice. However, only the optogenetic activation of DCN glutamatergic neurons, but not glycinergic or GABAergic IO-projecting neurons, elicited dystonia-like behaviors in normal mice. Selective ablation of DCN glutamatergic neurons effectively eliminated aberrant cerebellar DCN outputs and alleviated dystonia attacks in both Prrt2 -associated and kainic acid–induced dystonia mouse models. Collectively, our findings highlight the pivotal role of aberrant activation of DCN glutamatergic neurons in the neuropathological mechanisms underlying cerebellar-originated dystonia.",

          "authors": "Lucrezia C. Ferme, Allyson Q. Ryan, Robert Haase, Carl D. Modes, Caren Norden",
          "abstract": "Correct organogenesis depends on the timely coordination of developmental processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This coordination is particularly critical in crowded tissues, such as pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) that are often found as organ precursors. They are composed of elongated epithelial cells with densely packed nuclei aligned along the apicobasal axis. While cell cycle–dependent nuclear movements in PSE are well studied, less is known about how nuclear packing influences tissue morphogenesis. To investigate this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes, and neighborhood statistics in zebrafish neuroepithelia, focusing on the retinal PSE. We found that nuclei exhibit elongated shapes and biaxial nematic-like orientational order but remain positionally disordered. During retinal development, nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical limits. This occurs when the tissue transitions to a laminated structure and nuclear shapes are remodeled. Timely neurogenesis is critical as failure to initiate neurogenesis leads to tissue deformations. These findings highlight the influence of nuclear shape and positioning for organ morphogenesis.",

This approach enables ultrawide modulus tunability (10 pascals to 1 megapascal) and superior mechanical properties, including negligible hysteresis and high creep resistance. These features allow the sensor to detect a broad spectrum of pressures, from acoustic waves to body weight, with high performance. The proposed sensors have high sensitivity (up to 5884 per kilopascal), high linearity ( R 2  = 0.999), low hysteresis (&lt;0.5%), and fast response (0.1 milliseconds). We demonstrate applications in human-computer interaction and health care, showcasing their potential in various fields.

          "abstract": "Symmetric snap-through buckling, although both theoretically achievable and practically advantageous, has remained rare in bistable systems, with most studies favoring asymmetric snapping due to its lower energy barrier. Previous observations of symmetric snapping have been limited to high loading rates. In this work, we present a universal strategy to achieve symmetric snapping under quasi-static conditions by designing magnetization (M)–interface patterns that effectively suppress asymmetric modes. A simplified theoretical model demonstrates that this behavior results from the interplay between pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, with predictions validated through simulations and experiments using hard magnetic elastomers. Resisting forces generated by multiple M-interfaces counteract asymmetric snapping, enabling distinct symmetric configurations. Extending this approach to higher-order symmetric snapping, we uncover a quasi-linear scaling law between critical fields and snapping order. These findings establish a robust framework for designing snapping systems with enhanced control and predictability, as demonstrated by a mechanical-magnetic snapping switch, paving the way for advanced applications in precision engineering and magnetic-mechanical actuation.",

Insect muscles display a remarkable functional diversity: they operate at extremely different contraction frequencies (ranging from ~1 to 1000 hertz) and amplitudes during flying, walking, and crawling. This is puzzling because sarcomeres are built from essentially the same actin-myosin components. Here, we address how functionally different sarcomeres are made. We show that the giant protein titin and the regulation of developmental contractility are key for the sarcomere specializations. I-band titin spans and determines the length of the sarcomeric I-band in a muscle type–specific manner. Unexpectedly, I-band titin also rules the length of the force-generating myosin filament using a feedback mechanism that is modulated by myosin contractility. We propose a model of how sarcomere specializations in insects are tuned, provide evidence for this model, and discuss its validity beyond insects.",

In most of the advanced world, the policy package of socio-economic compensation has been broadly similar. We argue that the social and labor policies to counter lockdown effects in Latin America displayed way more diversity. The study identifies four national patterns of socio-economic responses, Coordinated (Argentina), Assistentialist (Brazil), Liberal (Chile), and Residual (México), according to (1) the type of initiatives directed to formal (insiders) and/or informal (outsiders) sectors of the labor market and (2) the volume of policies catered to each segment. We argue that traditional social policy drivers and contemporary theories on labor market dualization are unable to explain this wide variation. Rather, the study focuses on the coalitional incentives of presidents and the direct pressure of organized social actors.",
