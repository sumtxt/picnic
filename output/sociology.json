          "title": "The Cultural Devaluation of Feminized Work: The Evolution of U.S. Occupational Prestige and Gender Typing in Linguistic Representations, 1900 to 2019",
          "authors": "Wenhao Jiang",
          "abstract": "Previous research on occupational devaluation typically evaluates the potential wage declines associated with a significant inflow of women into an occupation; results have been mixed. Few studies, however, examine the cultural mechanism central to the thesis, where an occupation’s symbolic value in multiple dimensions changes in response to the dynamics of its cultural association with women. This article proposes a new semantic approach to trace the devaluation process in U.S. culture, where occupation titles appear in scholarly and public discourses with varied semantic proximity to gender- and prestige-signaling phrases over time. Decade-specific occupation embedding (1900 to 2019) from 127 billion words of American English across genres and a novel fixed-effects estimator show a latent cultural bias against women’s work, such that an occupation’s general prestige and perceived potency (but not its moral standing) declines when it becomes increasingly stereotyped as female. The largest penalties are found in lower- and middle-wage occupations; most high-wage occupations, despite experiencing large increases in female share in recent years, are persistently stereotyped as male professions without a prestige loss. In total, the cultural mechanism of devaluation accounts for 22.4 to 25.9 percent of the observed negative link between occupations’ female typing and hourly wages.",

          "title": "The affective landscapes of the Swedish far right",
          "authors": "Ryan Switzer",
          "abstract": "This article ethnographically charts the emotional relations to place which run through the Swedish far right social movement—theorized as an affective landscape. Throughout interviews and participant observations at a movement free space, The House of the Swedes, rural “heartland” regions were melancholically and intentionally portrayed as neglected \"places that don’t matter.\" The nostalgic promise of reestablishing an ethno-racially homogenous “homeland” justified intervention and activism in the name of the heartland community. “Badland” urban ghettos were simultaneously warnings and roadmaps—transformed from spaces of fear into aspirational sites of political potentials of segregation and intra-ethnic solidarity. The circulation and reproduction of these imaginaries relied on physical infrastructures: trusted free spaces, online and off, where white national identities could be expressed without potential sanctioning. These spaces facilitated the formation of affective bonds through rituals and cultural practices, generating the emotional and financial conditions necessary to sustain the movement. Emotional dynamics, all rooted in place, are key to understanding the far right’s resilience and persistence, offering broader insights into the emotional lives of social movements and the study of the far right.",

          "title": "When expectations backfire: educational differences in declining destination attachment among recent immigrants",
          "authors": "Andreas Genoni, Didier Ruedin",
          "abstract": "Immigrants with higher levels of education tend to report more discrimination and a weaker attachment to their destination country than immigrants with lower levels of education. This so-called integration paradox may be caused by two basic, mutually independent mechanisms: highly educated immigrants (1) more often experience unmet migration expectations, and (2) show stronger negative reactions when their expectations about their life abroad are not met. Existing research mainly focused on the first mechanism, while empirically tracing the second has been hampered by a lack of evidence comparing less- and more-educated immigrants over time. Here, we address this gap and examine how unmet migration expectations contribute to education-related differences in destination attachment. The mechanism we investigate is rooted in the educational background, but migration amplifies the dynamics, contributing to higher hopes while confronting individuals with unpredictable realities and limited control. Using panel data on recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey (N = 5242 immigrants and 13,890 observations, 2016–2022), we assessed the extent of unmet expectations and associated disappointment through a question on dissatisfaction with the decision to migrate. Consistent with theory, we found that increasingly negative evaluations of the migration decision were linked to reduced destination attachment, especially for immigrants with higher levels of education. Analyses further revealed that these detrimental reactions were not limited to immigrants with distinct ethno-racial background. These results suggest a fundamental mechanism for the emergence of the integration paradox, enhancing our understanding of educational inequalities in expectation management and immigrant integration.",

          "title": "Black in blue networks: social network integration and racial disparities in police use of force",
          "authors": "Scott W Duxbury, Marie Ouellet, Sadaf Hashimi",
          "abstract": "Explanations for police behavior argue that “us versus them” group dynamics shape officer interactions with the public. Yet, studies on racial disparities in policing overlook the interpersonal networks central to scholarship on group boundaries. We integrate insights from the literature on networks, group identity, and intergroup relations to consider how social network size and racial composition affect racial disparities in police officer use of force, and how those social network effects are conditioned by officer race. We test our perspective by analyzing newly collected longitudinal network data on the friendship relations between officers in one large department and linking these data to administrative records on officer use of force. The number of friendship ties to other officers is associated with within-officer increases in use of excessive force against Black victims, but not against White victims. Ties to White officers are only associated with use of excessive force against Black victims and only among Black officers. These findings suggest that social network integration contributes to racial disparities in police use of force and carries broader implications for intra- and intergroup discrimination in organizations characterized by strong institutional attachments.",

          "title": "Indigeneity in the Americas: how language, skin color, and nation shape indigenous identification",
          "authors": "Caroline Martínez, Edward Telles, Florencia Torche",
          "abstract": "Indigenous peoples have long been classified based on cultural features. Reflecting changing nation-state projects and scholarly trends, Latin American censuses traditionally used Indigenous language proficiency to classify Indigenous populations. However, most Latin American censuses now prioritize the internationally sanctioned standard of self-identification. There is little understanding, though, of how language and physical traits are related to self-identification. Using America’s Barometer surveys for four countries with over two-thirds of the Indigenous population of the Americas (Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru), we find that Indigenous language proficiency and darker skin color predict Indigenous identification. However, we also find that many Indigenous language speakers, particularly those with light skin color, do not identify as Indigenous, while some non-Indigenous language speakers, particularly those with dark skin color, identify as Indigenous. Our findings also suggest that national contexts dilute Indigenous identification through identity-eroding mestizaje projects but bolster it where there are strong Indigenous movements. Findings from this study highlight the interplay of physical and cultural traits, embedded in diverse nation-state contexts, in shaping Indigenous identification.",

          "authors": "Felix J. Clouth, Maarten J. Bijlsma, Steffen Pauws, Jeroen K. Vermunt",
          "abstract": "The parametric g-formula can be used to estimate causal effects of time-varying exposures on observable outcomes. It resolves intermediate confounding in such settings by specifying several parametric models, one each for every time-varying variable, and by performing micro-simulations. However, its restriction to applications with observable outcomes limits its usability for social sciences where variables of interest are often unobservable constructs. In such cases, measurement models are needed. We propose a new approach utilizing bias-adjusted three-step latent Markov models (LMMs) within the parametric g-formula. LMMs estimate the probability of membership in an unobservable state conditional on observed indicator variables. By replacing the parametric models in the g-formula with LMMs, micro-simulations are performed as usual to estimate a causal effect of the time-varying exposure. We illustrate this new approach by estimating the average treatment effect of unemployment on several unobservable mental health states utilizing longitudinal data from the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences panel.",

          "authors": "Cody Spence, James D. Bachmeier, Claire E. Altman, Jennifer Van Hook, Kendal Lowrey",
          "abstract": "Research on the stratifying effects of migration status has increased sharply in the last two decades, although efforts have been hampered by the near absence of representative data that include detailed migration status measures. Researchers have developed various statistical and logical imputation methods that have produced widely varying estimates. In this article, we introduce a new indicator of migration status constructed from two federal surveys matched to the Social Security Administration's Numident file, a database that includes all citizens and legal residents of the United States. In models predicting poverty, our measure produces estimates comparable to those based on respondents’ own self-reports, in one federal survey, of their migration status. Both the administrative and survey-based measures produce poverty gradients that diverge from those produced by logic-based measures. Our findings contribute to mounting evidence of bias in the use of certain kinds of logic-based algorithms to impute migration status and demonstrate the promise of administrative record linkages in migration status research.",
