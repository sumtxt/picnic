          "title": "Time and Climate Change: U.S. Media Representations of Climate Actions, Horizons, and Events (2000 to 2021)",
          "authors": "Oscar Stuhler, Iddo Tavory, Robin Wagner-Pacifici",
          "abstract": "Questions of temporality are at the heart of climate change discourse: Does one think of climate change primarily as an event happening in the present, or as something that will take place in the future? By when must we take action to prevent its worst consequences? This article presents the first large-scale assessment of the structure and evolution of temporalities expressed in U.S. media discussions on climate change (2000 to 2021). To do so, we developed a novel computational framework for detecting and interpreting temporal expressions in textual data. Our analyses yield three main findings: First, temporal horizons for climate change have continuously shrunk since 2000, stably targeting, on average, the year 2060. However, second, while anticipated effects are getting closer, horizons for the coordination of climate action have remained highly stable, averaging around 16 years into the future at any given time. Third, contrasting the stability of explicitly stated horizons, we find a sharply expanding discourse of urgency patterned by outbursts of urgency: sudden surges in calls for immediate action or warnings against climate change’s devastating consequences during events like the 2020 California wildfires. By uncovering this disjuncture of different forms of temporality, we illuminate a crucial aspect of the climate change debate, contribute to the sociological theory of events, and identify some of the conditions underlying climate inaction.",

          "title": "The Changing Role of Mothers’ Status in Children’s College Completion",
          "authors": "Christine R. Schwartz, Michael D. King",
          "abstract": "Despite vast changes in women’s status in society and in the home, we have little understanding of the changing role of mothers in shaping children’s life chances. Has mothers’ influence on their children’s educational outcomes grown alongside these shifts? Using data from three large nationally representative U.S. surveys, we find that the returns to mothers’ status—measured as their education, occupational status, and earnings—have remained relatively stable and similar to the returns to fathers’ status among children born from the 1930s to the 1980s, thus accounting for little of the observed increase in children’s college completion. This surprising continuity of the returns to mothers’ status aligns with past evidence of relatively stable intergenerational associations in the face of social change. But this does not mean nothing has changed. Our decomposition results show that increases in women’s education, occupational status, and earnings have meant that increased levels of mothers’ status account for more of the increase in children’s college completion than does fathers’ status among cohorts born since the 1960s. That continued increases in college completion have more to do with the rising status of mothers than fathers has been overlooked by previous research.",

          "title": "Beyond absolute education: relative educational attainment and perceived discrimination among immigrants",
          "authors": "Frank van Tubergen",
          "abstract": "The integration paradox—the positive association between absolute education and perceived discrimination among more visible immigrant groups—has been a central puzzle in migration research. This study asks whether this pattern truly reflects absolute education, as prior work assumes, or whether it is in fact driven by a factor with which it strongly correlates: immigrants’ relative premigration education, defined as their position within the educational distribution of their country of origin. Using survey data on immigrants in France (TeO1 and TeO2) and across 14 European countries (EU MIDIS II), two key findings emerge. First, relative education is positively and significantly associated with perceived discrimination among more visible immigrant groups. Second, once relative education is taken into account, the association between absolute education and discrimination becomes statistically insignificant, suggesting that, where distinguishable, education is better understood as relative rather than absolute effect. Additional analyses provide evidence that status loss—measured as the gap between subjective social status in origin and destination countries—is linked to stronger perceptions of discrimination, lending cautious support to the proposed mechanism of relative education. More broadly, the findings invite a reconceptualization of education: not only as an absolute good that brings skills and awareness, but also as a positional good, where expectations and social comparisons shape perceptions of discrimination. While this study focuses on immigrants’ premigration education, the positional perspective may also help explain positive educational gradients in perceived discrimination among the second generation and among other groups, such as women.",

          "authors": "Youngjoo Cha, Lena Hipp, Soocheol Cho",
          "abstract": "Before the pandemic, remote workers were often perceived as less committed than their in-office counterparts. Have these perceptions persisted in the postpandemic era of global remote work expansion? Does working remotely affect how people are viewed as parents and not just as workers? How do these relationships differ across cultural contexts with different work and parenting norms? We address these questions using original, preregistered survey experiments in three countries with distinct work cultures and gender norms: Germany, South Korea, and the United States. In all three countries, remote workers are perceived as less committed to work but as better parents. These effects, however, differ across countries in gender-specific ways: when working remotely, South Korean fathers face larger penalties in perceived work commitment than fathers in Germany, and South Korean mothers receive larger parental rewards than mothers in both Germany and the United States. These findings suggest that workers face competing pressures from work and family, and that remote work can produce distinctively gendered outcomes—drawing mothers into remote work while pushing fathers away from it. However, this pattern only occurs in cultural contexts where work and parenting norms are strongly gendered, such as South Korea.",

          "abstract": "Despite a growing body of elder care literature on the Korean population, how the so-called sandwich generation perceives and practices filial norms in the Korean and United States context has not been clearly addressed. Using data from in-depth interviews with 100 Koreans and 136 Korean immigrant adults, this study explores how sandwich generation Koreans and Korean immigrants in the United States perceive filial obligation for their aging parents, what they do to prepare for their own later life and what they expect from their children when they become older and need care from others. The findings indicate that almost all of the study participants maintain traditional notions of filial piety, but they show ambivalent attitudes toward the practice of filial obligation and their expectation from their own children in their later lives in Korea and the United States. Depending on the individual or familial factors, their filial practices have adapted to changing demographic and social realities, constructing the new forms of filial piety.",
