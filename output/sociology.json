          "authors": "Kathleen M. Blee, Francesca Scrinzi",
          "abstract": "The role of gender in far-right parties and movements received little attention until the twentieth century, when feminist and masculinity studies began to draw attention to women's participation in these politics and the gendered nature of men's far-right activism. In the past decade, research in this area has flourished, creating a distinct subspecialty. This review focuses on recent scholarship on the discourse and practices of femininity/women and masculinity/men in the far-right and the transnational antigender movement opposed to feminist and LGBTQ+ political gains. It also suggests topical and methodological directions for the next stage of research and reflects on the ethical, political, and safety challenges that scholars of the far-right and gender encounter today.",

          "title": "Automation risks versus skill requirements: occupational determinants of expectations and political preferences in knowledge societies",
          "authors": "Anton B. Andersson, Arvid Lindh, Johan Westerman",
          "abstract": "Over the past half-century, structural developments in production systems and labour markets have brought about substantial shifts in the occupational structure. Individuals’ positions within these societal transformations are widely understood to shape their expectations of the future and their political preferences. While the focus in much recent research in this regard has been on occupations’ susceptibility to automation, this study places the level of skill requirements at the centre of the analysis. Using data from the European Social Survey, we find robust support for this perspective. Individuals in occupations with higher skill requirements tend to anticipate fewer personal economic difficulties and hold more positive views about the direction of societal development, while also being less supportive of government redistribution and less inclined to vote for the radical right. In contrast, the theoretically expected relationships between automation-risk measures and these outcomes generally disappear once skill level requirements are controlled for. Our theoretical arguments and empirical findings suggest that the role of automation risk may be overstated in understanding how occupational positions shape social and political outcomes, and that the level of skill requirements carries greater explanatory weight in shaping individuals’ expectations about the future and their political preferences in knowledge societies.",

          "title": "Social solidarity and justice principles in the European Union",
          "authors": "Zsófia S. Ignácz, Irina Ciornei",
          "abstract": "In recent years, research has extensively examined the factors shaping support for social policies at the EU level. However, the role of justice principles as an explanatory mechanism remains underexplored. While these principles have been known to influence attitudes toward national welfare policies, their relevance to social policies at the supranational level has yet to be systematically investigated. This study addresses this gap by examining a multidimensional concept of European welfare policies, encompassing proposals for a uniform supranational welfare system, and supranational schemes for unemployment, pensions and health care. We investigate how the core distributive justice principles of equality, need, and equity shape individual support for these diverse types of EU welfare policies. Using data from the TESS dataset, collected in 2016 across 13 European countries, our findings reveal that the principles of equality and need are the strongest predictors of support for EU welfare policies, even when controlling for key explanatory factors identified in prior research. Furthermore, the analysis provides limited evidence that the influence of justice principles on support for supranational welfare policies is moderated by variations in national welfare regimes. Instead, the broader national context shapes how European citizens apply their justice beliefs when endorsing solidarity at the supranational level.",

          "authors": "Selin Siviş, Jonathan Banks, Jeremy Dixon, Theresa Redaniel, Paul Scott, Rebecca Wilson",
          "abstract": "This qualitative study investigates how care homes in South-West England managed and responded to the everyday challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many studies explore the impact of the pandemic on care home staff, residents, and families, limited research addresses care homes’ experiences with filtering top-down rules and guidelines during ‘uncertain times’. Drawing on the concept of street-level bureaucracy, this study examines how professionalism operates under crisis conditions and how it impacts discretion and organizational response within care homes. Based on fourteen semi-structured interviews with care home staff, including managers, analysis highlights care homes engaged in effective response mechanisms and developed innovative practices in response to the needs of staff, residents and their families by moving beyond the scope of established guidelines. The mobilization of professional discretion under crisis conditions by both care workers and managers centre around four key categories: strengthening infection control and prevention, promoting socialisation, enhanced communication and fostering intra- and inter-professional teamwork. Pioneering, which emerges as a common element across these categories, shapes care home workers and managers professional discretionary responses in relation to policy mediation and implementation during the pandemic. This study, thus, emphasises the ability of care home staff to take action and their resilience in facing pandemic-induced challenges.",

          "authors": "Tobias Roth, Klaus Pforr, Andreas Horr, Natalie Backes",
          "abstract": "We investigate whether migrants pay higher rents for comparable housing than natives with similar characteristics using nationally representative data from the 2018 German Microcensus. The dataset enables us to adjust for all micro-level neighborhood characteristics of the dwelling by employing sampling district fixed effects models and to simultaneously distinguish between migrant groups and generations. On average, across all origin groups and generations, we find no evidence for substantive migrant rent penalties. Refined analyses indicate that, while most origin groups do not face rent penalties, migrants and their descendants from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia pay moderately higher rents for comparable housing than natives do. Unexpectedly, we also observe rent differentials for first-generation Western Europeans but no penalty for Turkish migrants and their descendants. These findings underscore the importance of distinguishing between origin groups and generations, as aggregate analyses can mask group-specific disadvantages. The observed heterogeneity in rent penalties also highlights the need for a differentiated framework that conceptualizes such penalties as a multifaceted phenomenon, and for targeted policy measures addressing the needs of specific groups.",

          "authors": "Giampiero Tarantino, Pablo Gracia, Alina Cosma",
          "abstract": "Adolescents with disability conditions and from disadvantaged socioeconomic status (SES) report disproportionately low mental health. Yet, how disability status and inequalities interplay in explaining adolescent mental health across countries is unclear. Using an intersectional micro-macro approach, this study examined how adolescent mental health outcomes (i.e., life satisfaction and psychological complaints) differ by disability condition both within and across countries, and how country-level factors (i.e., public spending, income inequalities) and family-level SES moderate this relationship. We applied a two-step meta-analytic approach to data from 16 countries participating in the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study (N = 90,882; Age = 13.5). Results showed that adolescents with disabilities reported lower life satisfaction and higher psychological complaints than non-disabled adolescents in all countries. Country-level public spending and income inequalities were weak moderators of the relationship between adolescent disability and mental health. Adolescent mental health gaps by disability status were constant across SES groups in most of the countries that were examined. Yet, mental health gaps by adolescent disability status declined with family SES in some countries (i.e., Denmark, Ireland) and increased with family SES in some other countries (i.e., Austria, Czech Republic, France). The study implications and future research avenues are discussed.",

          "authors": "Yang Hu, Yue Qian",
          "abstract": "Bringing economic and family sociology into the digital era, this study examines and highlights the transformative potential of online banking in reconfiguring household financial organization. Using an instrumental-variable approach to analyzing data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2019–2023), we examine the impact of partners’ online banking use on who manages the couple’s money and controls major financial decisions. We reveal an ‘empowering effect’ whereby one’s use of online banking bolsters their control of both money management and major financial decisions, and this effect is particularly pronounced when one’s partner does not use online banking. Online banking similarly bolsters the power of women and men in money management, but subtle gender differences are observed in financial decision-making. Whereas online banking increases men’s exclusive control of major financial decisions, it bolsters women’s exclusive or joint control of such decisions. We also find an ‘individualizing effect’ whereby both women’s and men’s use of online banking increases the likelihood of partners’ independent money management, and independent money management is least likely when only one partner uses online banking. Our study provides novel insights into how digitalization, seen through online banking, redistributes power in and reconfigures the nature of couple relationships.",

          "abstract": "Legitimated authorities enjoy approval, support, and compliance from subordinates. Thus, legitimacy enhances authorities’ effectiveness across broad arenas, such as the judiciary, law enforcement, and the workplace. Understanding what shapes subordinates’ personal view of an authority as legitimate (propriety) elucidates how authorities can gain propriety. We investigate the relative impact of instrumental, relational, and moral bases of legitimacy on subordinates’ assessments of their workplace authorities’ propriety. We additionally consider social influences (i.e., “what others think”) captured by perceived collective support for the authority from superiors (authorization) and peers (endorsement). Results from a survey of 2,062 US workers indicate that all individual bases, as well as support by superiors and peers, positively contribute to propriety. Among the individual bases, instrumental concerns are most impactful, and the effect of endorsement far exceeds that of authorization. In an exploratory analysis, we show that perceptions of collective support moderate the effects of some of the individual bases of propriety. Our study reveals that it is not only how an authority behaves toward subordinates but also “what others think” that influences propriety.",

          "authors": "Diana Dávila Gordillo, Joan C. Timoneda, Sebastián Vallejo Vera",
          "abstract": "Extant work has identified two discursive forms of racism: overt and covert. While both forms have received attention in scholarly work, research on covert racism has been limited. Its subtle and context-specific nature has made it difficult to systematically identify covert racism in text, especially in large corpora. In this article, we first propose a theoretically driven and generalizable process to identify and classify covert and overt racism in text. This process allows researchers to construct coding schemes and build labeled datasets. We use the resulting dataset to train XLM-RoBERTa, a cross-lingual large language model (LLM) for supervised classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets relating to the Ecuadorian indígena community between 2018 and 2021.",

          "authors": "Jiazhou Liang, Jolomi Tosanwumi, Ethan Fosse, Daniel Silver, Scott Sanner",
          "abstract": "Analyzing social change requires detecting patterns of continuity and difference over time. While time-series clustering offers a valuable approach, existing techniques are often limited by assuming fixed cluster definitions and static assignments of entities to clusters. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified framework of temporal clustering methods that allows for both dynamic cluster definitions and the transition of entities between clusters, generalizing and extending previous work. We also provide new algorithms for this dynamic clustering that optimize global objectives, with optional constraints on the transitions of entities across clusters. This framework expands the methodological toolkit for analyzing social change, and we provide guidelines for its application. We illustrate our approach with three case studies: polarization of social and political attitudes across U.S. states; cross-national cultural change; and the evolution of neighborhood business patterns. We conclude with directions for further research.",
