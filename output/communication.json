          "authors": "Emily M. Buehler, Jenny L. Crowley",
          "abstract": "Online social network members provide more varied and impartial support within a reduced-risk environment; however, not all online observers react favorably when viewing a support-seeking message. Grounded in the attribution-emotion-action model, this study examines how responsibility for stigma, coping effort, and message visibility influence observers’ emotions and verbal person-centered responses when viewing a support-seeking message on Facebook. Results from an experiment ( N = 798) indicated observers’ feelings of sympathy mediate the association between responsibility for stigma and verbal person-centered responses, but only when coping effort is high. Analyses also revealed effects related to message visibility, such that observers reported higher levels of sympathy when a seeker indicated lower responsibility for stigma and higher effort in a private message, which then elicited higher verbal person-centered responses. Results have implications for the attribution-emotion-action model and communication theory of visibility and offer practical insights for people seeking support for stigmatized health conditions.",

          "authors": "Wang Liao, Ya-Ching Lee, Haoning Xue, Emily McKinley",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for understanding people’s relational introspections with machines. Through a social information processing lens, we argue that such introspections begin with relative perceptions of two basic traits: communion (prosocial intentionality) and agency (goal-pursuit capacities) for both machine and user. These relative perceptions are then interpreted through relational schemas in the short term and regulated by trust in the long term––jointly shaping relational behaviors toward the machine (e.g., intention to use). We surveyed three US samples of various AI-technology users (college students, N = 438; MTurk participants, N = 1,023; Prolific participants, N = 726, matched to census demographics). Results consistently showed that (a) intention to use such a machine was driven by self-agency followed by machine-communion, whereas machine-agency and self-communion had no direct impact, and (b) the relative importance of these trait perceptions was mediated by certain relational schemas and moderated by trust across respondents.",

          "abstract": "Media messages shape our knowledge about the world, but measuring individual exposure and attention remains challenging. Emerging media offer a solution to studying message reception in simulated real-world environments, which may soon become the actual media environments in which we encounter messages. Here, we utilized virtual reality (VR) and eye-tracking to investigate message processing in a realistic virtual city environment populated with billboards. We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking. Our findings show this algorithmic manipulation, undetected by participants, significantly boosted message memory retention for the targeted messages. This study reveals a path of media influence, demonstrating how undetected algorithmic manipulations can shape individual and collective memory. The findings carry practical and theoretical implications for diverse communication contexts, from advertising and public health to political messaging in the emerging metaverse ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "This commentary aims to gain a more nuanced understanding of the production of nationalism in Chinese cyberspace, providing insights into the roles of and dynamics between the state, digital platforms, and non-state actors. This commentary argues that nationalism remains a resilient, predominant and taken-for-granted discursive resource that can be mobilized by various social actors for individual, political or commercial purposes in different contexts. Notably, the roles of and relations among these actors in producing nationalism online are always dynamic, contested, and contextual. This commentary advances debates on Chinese digital nationalism by analyzing the roles of diverse social actors and the dynamic relationships among them. In doing so, it challenges the prevalent ‘party-propaganda’ perspective or the binary of ‘state–netizen interaction’.",

          "authors": "Gebru Kahsay Kiflu, Hagos Nigussie",
          "abstract": "This study examines the evolving media landscape in Ethiopia, focusing on transformations following the 2018 leadership change under Abiy Ahmed. This study reveals a nuanced progression in Ethiopia’s media sphere using a mixed–methods approach, including semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and quantitative statistical analysis. The initial period showed promising developments, such as releasing imprisoned journalists and politicians and lifting website bans. However, these advancements proved temporary as authoritarian practices persisted. The government has modified legal frameworks, including media regulations, laws addressing disinformation and hate speech, and counterterrorism measures. These modifications appeared to reinforce government control rather than enhance media freedom. Journalists continue to face significant dangers, including arbitrary arrests, physical attacks, and forced flees. More than 54 journalists fled the country between 2018 and 2024, owing to threats and persecution. This pattern demonstrates that brief periods of optimism following leadership changes consistently follow authoritarian repression. The regression toward repression highlights deep-rooted challenges in Ethiopia’s political system and the difficulty of breaking established governance patterns. The government maintained strict control over the media environment, limiting freedom of expression and stifling opposition voices. This resulted in a highly regulated information landscape in which official narratives dominated the public discourse.",
