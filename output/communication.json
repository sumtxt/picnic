          "title": "Disconnect to Recharge: Well-Being Benefits of Digital Disconnection in Daily Life",
          "authors": "Alicia Gilbert, Julius Klingelhoefer, Adrian Meier",
          "abstract": "Well-being is among the prime motivations to reduce one’s digital media use. This study examines momentary and lagged associations between digital disconnection and positive, negative, and relational indicators of well-being. In an experience sampling design, N = 237 participants reported T = 12,407 situations over 2 weeks. Results show that when participants disconnected more than usual, they reported higher affective well-being, energy, and social connectedness (within-person associations). In contrast, after adding controls, those who generally disconnected more than others reported no differences in well-being (between-person associations). Disconnection was not related to stress, neither within nor between persons. However, associations partly depended on controlling for work versus leisure media use. Intrinsic motivation for disconnection positively moderated associations with affective well-being, energy, and social connectedness between persons. We further explored how associations differed across disconnection levels and time lags. Overall, digital disconnection was related to higher well-being situationally – but not over time.",

          "authors": "R Amanda Cooper, Alice Fanari",
          "abstract": "Exiting the totalistic and intensively focused structure of missionary service prompts sense-making as missionaries return and adapt to life at home. Drawing from organizational, religious, and interpersonal communication literature, we use the communicated sense-making model to explore how 26 Christian missionaries made sense of their experiences and post-missionary identity. Our findings suggest that missionaries used three sense-making devices—metaphors, memorable messages, and personifications—to find certainty in uncertainty, mobilize identity work, and position themselves toward others. We extend the communicated sense-making model by clarifying the functions of sense-making devices, introducing personification as a novel sense-making device, and proposing in-group vernacular as a shared set of linguistic and ideological resources that can enable or constrain sense-making surrounding difficult life events and transitions.",

          "authors": "Yannic Meier, Philipp K Masur",
          "abstract": "Using internet technologies exposes individuals to constant surveillance by companies and other actors. Perceptions of constant surveillance—termed “dataveillance”—are theorized to induce chilling effects (i.e., inhibiting legal and legitimate online activities) posing risks to individuals and societies. In this preregistered longitudinal 3-wave experiment (N = 774), we investigate whether news articles addressing constant online surveillance induce feelings of dataveillance and behavioral inhibitions. Moreover, we extend theoretical notions of dataveillance by examining whether perceived dataveillance relates to other factors that drive privacy behaviors—privacy resignation and critical privacy literacy. Results of Bayesian random-effects within–between models indicate that perceived dataveillance is positively associated with inhibited behaviors, resignation, and literacy. However, these relations only pertain to the between-person level as the within-person associations are possibly too small to be meaningful. Critical privacy literacy might be central for privacy behaviors as we find both between- and within-person associations with self-inhibition.",

          "abstract": "This study synthesized research from 4 theoretical frameworks that explicitly conceptualize media and communication as dynamic processes over time, emphasizing reciprocal and self-causing effects. A meta-analysis of 223 effect sizes from 103 studies supported the presence of both reciprocal and self-causing relationships, suggesting their robustness as communication phenomena. Time lag moderated self-causing effects, such that longer intervals weakened these effects. Longer lags attenuating the influence of media/communication on subsequent outcomes approached but did not reach statistical significance, and did not significantly alter the reverse pathway. Exploratory moderation analyses showed that effect sizes varied by audience age, analytic methods, topic areas, and media types. Findings highlight the importance of time lag specification in studying dynamic media effects.",

          "authors": "Katherine Sender, Bya Beatrys, Margaret E. Foster, Tianen Chen, Hanyu Wang",
          "abstract": "This article considers the productive frictions among audience research methodologies, queer methods, and critical translation studies. We reflect on the process of conducting audience research with LGBTQ+ viewers of Netflix’s makeover show Queer Eye (2018–present) in Brazil, China, Germany, and the United States. We examine the methodological challenges of studying transnational LGBTQ+ audiences while accounting for differences in language, culture, and identity. Drawing on insights from queer media studies, decolonial theory, and translation studies, we propose “strategic methodological essentialism” as a framework for conducting cross-cultural audience research. Adapting Gayatri Spivak’s concept of strategic essentialism, this approach advocates the careful use of language and identity categories for the pragmatic purposes of data collection and political engagement, while remaining critically aware of their limitations. Strategic methodological essentialism advocates an embrace of queer failure as a critical method to encourage context-specific approaches that challenge dominant paradigms in audience research and media studies. We conclude by offering a model for future audience research that embraces the productive tensions between methodological rigor and the fluid, unpredictable qualities of LGBTQ+ lived experiences across global contexts.",

          "authors": "Rafael Grohmann, Alexandre Costa Barbosa",
          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of sovereignty-as-a-service to describe how Big Tech companies, specifically Microsoft, Amazon, and Google/Alphabet, are strategically redefining digital sovereignty through their programs of cloud infrastructure. Drawing on critical discourse analysis of official materials released between 2022 and 2023, we show how these companies respond to regulatory pressures, particularly in Europe, by offering modular and branded solutions that frame sovereignty as a technical, legal, and infrastructural matter. Rather than sovereignty being exercised over platforms, it is now provisioned by them, on their terms. We argue that sovereignty-as-a-service constitutes a form of discursive capture that empties the concept, aligning it with the ideological legacy of the Californian Ideology. In this reframing, digital sovereignty becomes a service to be purchased, configured, and optimized through proprietary platforms. By conceptualizing sovereignty as a site of contested meanings open to appropriation, this article contributes to critical debates on digital sovereignty and technology governance.",

          "title": "Platformize Asia—Reimagining Asia in Platform Capitalism",
          "authors": "Lin Zhang, Jingyan Elaine Yuan",
          "abstract": "This introduction repositions “platform” and “Asia” as unstable, contested imaginaries rather than fixed objects of analysis. Bringing platform studies into dialogue with Asian studies, we argue for a double move of deconstruction and reconstruction: interrogating how platforms are historically framed through metaphors, archives, and business genealogies, and how “Asia” has been imagined through colonial, Cold War, and postcolonial projects. Using Asia as method, we show how regional trajectories of platformization—superapps and platform business groups, infrastructuralization, and the absorption of informal economies—both provincialize Euro-American frameworks and generate new concepts. At a conjuncture marked by an uneven transition beyond neoliberalism, platforms in Asia formalize informality, extend state infrastructures, and mediate global capital, producing hybrid labor regimes and renewed state–platform entanglements while intensifying inequalities. We organize the special issue around four productive tensions: (1) technological/media affordances vs. cultural specificities; (2) methodological localism vs. theory-building; (3) state power vs. transnationalism; and (4) inter-Asia references vs. power inequalities. Across these frictions, contributors trace alternative genealogies (e.g., from Japanese convenience stores to K-pop fandom platforms), analyze platformized labor and entrepreneurial subjectivities, and rethink governance through fragmented, conjunctural state formations. We contend that metaphors are useful to think with—yet the dominance of “platform” as a corporate framing also calls for critical pivots to alternative figures that open different political and analytic possibilities. Viewed from Asia, platform capitalism appears as a dynamic, contested world-making process that renders visible the uneven, emergent shapes of post-neoliberal futures.",
