          "authors": "Yuchi Anthony Chen, Catalina L Toma",
          "abstract": "Social media activities do not occur in isolation, and it is possible that the well-being effects of an initial activity modify the effects of a subsequent one. This article examines this possibility by focusing on a specific, theoretically grounded sequence of social media activities: engaging with one’s own profile self-presentation (i.e., a self-affirmational activity) followed by browsing a superior peer’s profile (i.e., an activity eliciting upward social comparison). Two pre-registered experiments were conducted. Study 1 confirmed that both reviewing and crafting one’s own Instagram self-presentation provided self-affirmational benefits, reducing participants’ defensiveness and inducing positive affect. Study 2 showed that becoming self-affirmed by engaging with one’s own Instagram self-presentation diminished feelings of envy resulting from browsing a superior peer’s self-presentation. By conceptualizing and empirically testing the interdependence of social media activities, this research offers a framework for examining how sequences of social media activities jointly shape users’ psychological experiences.",

          "authors": "Maren Hartmann, David Lowis, Vera Klocke",
          "abstract": "Digital disconnection is frequently framed as a voluntary practice, epitomized by the phenomenon of “digital detoxing.” Conversely, disconnection among populations in the Global South or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in the Global North is predominantly considered an externally imposed hardship. Yet this binary framing overlooks the nuanced realities of disconnection as both a constraint and a deliberate strategy, often framed as digital divide. Drawing on a 3-year study with roofless individuals in Berlin, this article advances the concept of the “disconnection divide” to foreground the complex interplay between “voluntary” and imposed forms of digital dis/connection. Our ethnographic findings illustrate that maintaining digital access is often precarious, shaped by device theft, limited charging opportunities, and unstable internet connections. Nonetheless, our participants also opt to disconnect, seeking respite from familial demands, intrusive relationships, or expectations imposed by social services. Frequently, they even use digital technology, such as gaming and streaming, to disconnect from their surroundings. These shifting fault lines – where disconnection simultaneously operates as an act of resistance, a coping mechanism, and an enforced condition – connect existing literature on voluntary disconnection in privileged contexts and imposed disconnection in marginalized settings. By emphasizing this ambivalence, the disconnection divide provides a critical new lens on digitally mediated inequality.",

          "authors": "Anirban K. Baishya, Darshana S. Mini",
          "abstract": "This paper maps how South Asian media is marketed by streaming aggregators such as Sling TV and ZEE5 Global for diasporic audiences in the United States and Canada. Examining questions of access, availability, and marketing, and analyzing popular press coverage, media industry reports, advertisements, as well as the platforms themselves, we show how South Asian diasporic consumers are envisaged as a target constituency by streaming platforms. In the era of bundled entertainment capsules, such aggregators capitalize on the multiple sub-identities within the umbrella of “South Asian diaspora.” Through this analysis, we also show how “South Asia” is produced as a territorial category and a potential market through the nexus of cultural hegemony and capitalist markets, rather than a taken-for-granted identity of emotional belongingness.",

          "title": "The Limits of Virality: Music Creators and Platform Negotiation in the Era of Short-Form Video",
          "authors": "Alexandria Arrieta",
          "abstract": "As the lifespan of virality on TikTok has become increasingly short and operates at a smaller scale, music creators are grappling with what it means to be successful in this later stage of the platform. For this study, I conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with music artists and creators about how short-form video platforms like TikTok have affected the way they work and create music. Many participants believe that while the creation of viral content based on memes and covers of popular songs affords constant visibility, it does not result in the monetary or career milestones that they desire, so they need to use different approaches. In this article, I characterize this new period of online musical labor as a period defined by “platform negotiation,” in which creators evaluate platform demands and work to approach their content creation in ways that prioritize their personal and professional goals. This includes strategic decision-making to negotiate their presence—which can include their identity, brand, image, etc.—across platforms over time. As they engage in relational labor to support continued work, music creators cannot simply rely on the tenets of optimization to be successful. Rather, many are pivoting to utilizing content creation in ways that aim to prioritize fandom and career sustainability. This article examines the ways in which music creators grapple with the challenges of short-form video and how musical labor is changing online.",
