          "authors": "Nhung C. Vu, Yuwei Li, Andrew C. High",
          "abstract": "Since its inception, advice response theory (ART) has generated considerable research on informational support. Because empirical support for the theory is not uniform, we conducted a series of meta-analyses to synthesize existing evidence and evaluate theoretical claims. Consistent with ART, advice message features were positively associated with advice outcomes; however, the associations between provider characteristics and advice outcomes received qualified support. Study artifacts moderated several bivariate associations. Message content influenced implementation intention more strongly than on the other two advice outcomes, whereas provider characteristics and politeness had a greater impact on evaluation of advice quality and facilitation of coping. Finally, we tested the conventional source-message-outcome model of ART and four theoretically-derived alternative models with meta-analytic data. Results suggested neither provider characteristics nor message features are uniformly more proximal causes of variations in the outcomes. Implications for future studies and potential refinements to ART are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study conducts a conceptual replication and extension of prior research on overconfidence in discerning political misinformation, shifting focus to health. Using data from a national survey of American adults linked to web-browsing records (N=593), we investigated the prevalence and correlates of overconfidence in this domain. Consistent with earlier findings, overconfidence was most pronounced among low-performing individuals, replicating the “Dunning–Kruger Effect.” However, decomposition analyses revealed that the associations between overconfidence and behavioral correlates—exposure to low-credibility health websites and belief in cancer-related misinformation—are primarily accounted for by deficits in actual discernment ability rather than a lack of metacognitive insight. This replication highlights the robustness of the link between poor discernment and behavioral outcomes across domains. These results highlight the need for interventions that improve evaluation skills or address underlying dispositional factors, such as distrust in science and conspiracist worldviews.",

          "abstract": "Despite a rise in identity-centric communication scholarship, there is a lack of theory and evidence regarding how media use relates to the on-going alignment between political and social identities (i.e., identity alignment). We offer a framework for theorizing this dynamic and apply it to examine the relationship between Americans’ media diets and on-going psychological alignment between political and social identities in the United States (i.e., partisan social sorting). We use data from 33,690 American respondents from three national surveys: one longitudinal (1972–2020) and two fielded in 2020. There is evidence that identity alignment (i.e., sorting) has grown over time, but only among those who are most interested and attentive to politics and media. In 2020 surveys, we find no evidence that the frequency of media use was a significant predictor of social sorting. Instead, the composition of individuals’ media diets predicted the alignment between their social and political identities.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes how streaming users in Latin America experience time in relation to platforms. Drawing on a mixed-methods approach that employed daily reports of platform usage, focus groups, and “rich picture” analysis, we examine the cases of two countries with some of the highest digital media usage statistics in Latin America: Brazil and Costa Rica. We conceptualize platform users in these countries as “temporal publics,” defined by their varied experiences of time and the complexity of their “time work” practices. The article discusses how individuals engage in recalibration practices to navigate the temporal ambivalences of everyday life and what they perceive as the power of streaming platforms to control their time. By doing so, we demonstrate how users simultaneously reproduce and subvert specific temporal orders through their everyday interactions with streaming services, reflecting a sustained and intentional ambivalence toward the platforms’ power.",

          "abstract": "Trends are a common feature in the contemporary media and cultural environment as well as media and communication research. Yet trends remain undertheorized. This article seeks to address this gap. Rather than just a synonym for shift or change, I define trend as a temporally bounded, dynamic pattern of observable change and argue that such a concept deserves greater prominence within the study of media and communication. In addition to this definition, I theorize trends by characterizing the trend’s key features, exploring its relationship to media, and mapping its connection to questions that animate media and communication research. The case of “brat summer” of 2024 is offered as an exemplary case from which trend’s core features may be discerned. The article’s primary contribution is to advance the trend as a central concept through which communication and media studies researchers may think more comprehensively and critically about change.",

          "abstract": "The rapid dissemination of misinformation has raised concerns about its persistence despite corrective efforts, as the influence of fact-checking often diminishes quickly. This study explores “time” as a central theoretical and methodological construct in understanding the effects of fact-checking interventions. Across two large-scale, pre-registered panel experiments (N = 6,983), we examine the temporal dynamics of both the persuasive and unintended consequences of factual corrections. Results show that while fact-checks yield immediate belief updating, their effects largely fade within two weeks and do not produce durable belief echoes. In Study 2, we introduce a novel design treating time lag as an experimental treatment and show that simple interventions aimed at increasing the temporal accessibility of corrections—termed “accuracy reminders”—significantly extend the durability of their effects. These findings reconceptualize correction effects as inherently temporal processes, advancing communication theory and offering scalable, time-sensitive strategies for sustaining the influence of fact-checking in dynamic information environments.",

          "abstract": "Disabled people are overrepresented as victims of sexual violence and family violence, but are often excluded from research and the development of communication campaigns, laws, and interventions. Grounded in the culture-centered approach, we undertook 77 qualitative interviews with predominantly Māori (Indigenous) and low-income disabled individuals to identify primary prevention needs for reducing family and sexual violence. Participants articulated disability as being structural, intersectional, and layered with erasure, contributing to conditions that perpetuate violence. Erasure and the resulting loss of agency were pervasive across diverse disabilities and participant groups, with Māori bearing a disproportionate burden. Emergent in the participants’ narratives were strategies around addressing communication inequalities and grounding prevention resources within local community contexts, set against structural determinants of violence perpetuated by the settler colonial State. This study challenges the hegemonic approach to addressing sexual violence and family violence, revealing a relationship between communicative and material forms of violence.",

          "abstract": "In the competition to connect the next billion users, Africa’s last mile is becoming a frontier for big tech companies to experiment with new infrastructure ideas. Based on interviews and archival research, this article examines two cases of connecting the last mile through high-latitude balloons in the sky (Google Loon) and rural base stations on the ground (Huawei RuralStar). Following the “volumetric turn,” this article approaches infrastructure as “volumetric practice” to elucidate the politics and promises of the last mile in Africa. Recognizing the agency of various “elements” in the volume – wind, rain, air, and sunlight, this article illustrates ballooning as a socio-technical assemblage of the sky and RuralStar as a flexible object that integrates multiple sources of volumetric knowledge. It argues that the contested nature of last-mile infrastructure is articulated through the navigation, calculation, and commodification of the volumes. While both Google and Huawei articulate techno-optimist views of bridging the digital divide, their unfolding through different technologies presents distinctive sociotechnical imaginaries and knowledge-making dynamics. This article sheds new light on the volumetric competition for the global internet and makes theoretical contributions by introducing a volumetric approach to studying media infrastructure.",

          "abstract": "Democratic citizenship is continuously evolving, shaped by changing political, social, and media contexts. Digital natives—those who have come of age in environments where digital technologies are embedded in everyday life—have experienced citizenship in markedly different ways than previous generations. While the internet has broadened the repertoire of participatory behaviors, existing research has struggled to capture the complexity of contemporary citizenship. Drawing on deliberative systems theory and a triadic framework of citizenship—examining normative expectations, behaviors, and attitudes—this study develops a nuanced exploration of citizenship orientations. Using an innovative questionnaire and latent profile analysis of survey data from Norwegian digital natives (aged 18–40), we identify seven distinct citizenship types that reveal the multidimensional nature of contemporary citizenship. Our research moves beyond binary distinctions between active and passive citizenship, emphasizing the importance of both expressive and receptive behaviors across online and offline contexts. By highlighting the diverse roles citizens play in sustaining democratic processes, we offer new insights into citizenship in the digital age, demonstrating how different citizens contribute to the democratic system through varied and interdependent forms of engagement.",

          "abstract": "The rise of short-video platforms has transformed identity into a hyper-commodified asset, merging performative self-presentation with algorithmic governance. This article introduces the fetishized identity economy (FIE), a theoretical framework that reinterprets Marxian commodity fetishism, Bourdieusian symbolic capital, and Baudrillardian hyperreality to analyze how digital personas are constructed, staged, and monetized. The FIE framework centers on three interrelated concepts: persona capital (algorithmically optimized self-performance), staged class (the commodification of social status as symbolic spectacle), and platform capitalism (the cultural and ideological shaping of profitable identity performances). Through a case study of Chinese influencer Sister Yu, the article illustrates how identity under the FIE is engineered rather than expressed, shaped by state-platform synergies that reward particular narratives of gender, labor, and class. By doing so, this study critiques the neoliberal assumptions embedded in Western influencer discourse and offers an alternative lens to understand the complex interplay of identity, governance, and platform logics. The research contributes to ongoing debates on platform labor, attention economies, and the global contours of influencer culture.",

Using secondary data consisting of comments shared over a 3-week period to an online news community, we identified three sequences that reflect collective incivility practices. Whereas the persistent incivility sequence included a large proportion of uncivil comments, incivility occurred infrequently in the sporadic incivility sequence and not at all in the no incivility sequence. Once the persistent incivility or sporadic incivility sequences appeared, discussions were more likely to return to these sequences than the no incivility sequence. Contrary to our predictions, sequences containing incivility shaped discussion processes by depressing explicit expressions of agreement and disagreement. The results of this study demonstrate how the collective behavior of online community members contributes to the production and effects of incivility.",

          "abstract": "Since their inception, social media platforms have continuously developed innovations and discourses centered on affective and emotional dimensions. Platform owners invest heavily in research and development to both identify and elicit feelings and emotions. However, the research conducted by these companies on this topic remains understudied. In this study, we present a systematic and critical analysis of the scientific literature published by the research teams of Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google (YouTube) regarding the analysis and processing of their users’ emotions. We first demonstrate that this literature relies on schematic definitions of emotions, thereby simplifying the complexity of affective phenomena for facilitating their automated detection. We then highlight the objectives pursued by these research efforts, the majority of which aim to promote users’ well-being through the instrumentalization of what affects them. Finally, we examine the various methods employed to identify emotions, which primarily serve to feed these platforms’ machine learning algorithms with data labeled as emotional. Beyond their scientific contributions, we consider these studies as narratives targeted at the scientific community and investors, serving to legitimize and support the development of specific innovations. Analyzing these works enables us to examine how the techniques, methods, and applications developed by these two companies commodify emotions and actively shape users’ online behaviors.",
