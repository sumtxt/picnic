          "title": "When Humor Appeals Fail and When They Succeed: Using Latent Profile Analysis to Identify Audience Receptivity to Humorous Messages",
          "authors": "Nick Carcioppolo, Geyi Wang, Kaixu Yuan, Zixiao Yang, Dongya Wang",
          "abstract": "This study contributes to theory in persuasion and humor by hypothesizing distinct audience segments that determine how people respond to humor appeals. Across two studies, using a multiple message design and two different humor appeals, we specify and validate four discrete audience segments, referred to here as audience receptivity profiles, that align with previous theorizing and are differentially related to persuasion. Findings suggest that those with different audience receptivity profiles vary in whether they find humor appeals humorous, resulting in increased perceptions of humor and message-consistent persuasive effects among audiences who belong to supportive audience receptivity profiles, and decreased humor as well as increased likelihood of unintended effects among audiences who belong to non-supportive audience receptivity profiles. These findings align with previous theorizing in this area, and highlight when humor may have deleterious effects on audiences whose attitudes and values suggest they are most open to persuasive attempts.",

          "title": "Advancing Agenda Building Theory: Conceptualizing and Analyzing Processes Among Events, Publics, and Media in #StopAsianHate",
          "authors": "Yini Zhang, Hyunyi Cho",
          "abstract": "We extend agenda building theory by integrating social movement and connective action research to explain how marginalized groups elevate issue salience. Our framework comprises three dynamics: exogenous conditions (key events &amp; real-world indicators), interpublic processes on social media, and intermedia processes between news and social media. We apply this framework to the #StopAsianHate movement on Twitter/X using network and time-series analyses. Results show that the Atlanta spa shootings, a key event, intensified attention to anti-Asian hate among AAPI activists’ allies (liberals &amp; K-pop fans) and elite media, whereas hate crime indicators had limited impact. AAPI activists had modest influence on other Twitter users and elite news, but their allies, especially liberals, proved influential. Elite media attention was driven by attention from both liberals and aggregate Twitter, with liberals’ effect lasting longer. The framework illuminates how key events, networked publics, and movement resources interact to build issue salience in digital media.",

          "title": "Multi-Actor Supportive Communication and the Emergence of Solidarity in Online Communities: A Situated Social Exchange Framework",
          "authors": "Wang Liao, Chelsea Kim, Bo Feng",
          "abstract": "This essay proposes that studying the emergence of solidarity through multi-actor supportive communication offers a useful lens for understanding the increasingly complex structures, dynamics, and communal nature of supportive communication in online communities. Drawing on research of social exchange, online community affordance, and social support type, the essay explores the links between multi-actor supportive communication patterns and solidarity experiences in online communities. It develops three propositions that connect four forms of exchange—reciprocal, negotiated, generalized, and productive—to the experiences of solidarity, moderated by affordance and support type as key communication-situational factors. Directions for empirical testing of these propositions are also discussed, along with implications for supportive communication research and the study of online communities.",

          "title": "Surprise Me: Serendipitous News Discovery and News Consumption",
          "authors": "Zhixin Pu, Erin Ruppel",
          "abstract": "Users of news recommender systems read news recommended by algorithms and can discover useful information unintentionally or serendipitously. The feeling of surprise from this discovery can elicit users to continue reading. Increasing serendipity is believed to be a solution to isolated information bubbles; however, little research has explored its impact on news consumption. The study investigates the interactions between surprise, serendipity, and news consumption. Participants ( N = 463) recruited from Amazon MTurk in the United States participated in the online experiment. The findings suggest that serendipitous news discovery directly increases news consumption, with this relationship mediated by the feeling of surprise. Furthermore, users who experience higher serendipitous news discovery indicate more positive attitudes toward news consumption in these systems. The research integrates serendipity into news selection theories and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how algorithmic systems can enhance user engagement. The results offer key implications for communication scholars and practitioners.",
