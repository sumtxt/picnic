          "authors": "Yuge Wang, Rongbin Han",
          "abstract": "Current studies on authoritarian resilience have yet to fully explain how autocracies can effectively cope with crises that threaten regime survival. To fill the gap, we introduce the concept of “authoritarian elasticity” to theorize how an autocracy may dramatically transform, expand, and repurpose its institutions for crisis management, fine‐tune its response to crisis development, and scale back mobilization when conditions permit to sustain the crisis management mode for an extended time. We argue, the agile institutional maneuvering capacity, which differs from the long‐term institutional adaptability highlighted in the current literature, explains not only how an autocracy can swiftly mobilize its resources during a crisis, but more importantly why such exhaustive mobilization may last longer than one would normally expect. We illustrate our theory empirically by examining how China elastically mobilized its Grid Management System during different phases of the COVID‐19 pandemic.",

          "title": "Digitalization and Domestic Revenue Mobilization: Governmental Responsiveness and Capabilities Matter",
          "authors": "Seungho Lee",
          "abstract": "Although previous research has highlighted digitalization as a potential avenue for enhancing domestic revenue mobilization—a critical component for the sustainable economic and political development of nations—the relationship between digitalization and domestic revenue mobilization remains underexplored. This paper contributes to the current literature by investigating how the relationship between digitalization and the government's capacity to tax is influenced by governmental responsiveness and capabilities, an element largely disregarded in prior analyses. Empirical results from a time‐series cross‐sectional dataset that includes up to 159 countries spanning from 2004 to 2021 demonstrate that a high level of digitalization does not automatically result in an increased non‐resource tax revenue‐to‐GDP ratio. However, when digitalization is combined with robust governmental responsiveness and capabilities—specifically regarding Voice and Accountability or Regulatory Quality—it substantially enhances domestic revenue mobilization. This study also reveals that the interaction effects are more pronounced in the low–to–middle segments of digitalization and among low‐ and middle‐income countries. These findings underscore the need to bolster institutional frameworks in conjunction with digitalization endeavors to ensure the sustained success of domestic revenue mobilization.",

          "title": "Representative Bureaucracy Buffering Adverse Policy Climates: Examining Immigrant Families' Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program",
          "authors": "Jiaqi Liang, Sanghee Park, Agustina Laurito",
          "abstract": "This study explores the role of representative bureaucracy in buffering the impact of adverse policy environments on immigrants' access to public benefits. Specifically, we examine whether and to what extent a more representative government workforce influences immigrant families' participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and moderates the impact of unfavorable immigrant policy climates. Analyzing data on 49 states from 2006 to 2016, we find that a government workforce with higher Hispanic and Asian representation within the public welfare area is associated with increased SNAP participation among U.S.‐born children with immigrant parents. This link is contingent on states' immigrant policy climates. Higher shares of Hispanic and Asian public administrators are associated with higher SNAP participation in states with a more unwelcoming policy environment. However, there is no similar association between the levels of Black employees and SNAP participation, regardless of the policy climate.",

          "authors": "David Foster, Joseph Warren",
          "abstract": "In land use policymaking, institutions for resident participation are common but often associated with stark inequalities. We argue that the observed connection between participatory institutions and political inequality arises due to the circumstances in which participatory institutions are established – not due to participation itself. In a formal model, residents of two districts compete to oppose a locally costly (but socially beneficial) proposal. Participatory institutions allow residents to send a costly signal of their preferences to a politician. The politician only establishes participatory institutions when they are moderately biased toward one district. When extremely biased, the politician unilaterally benefits one district at the other’s expense; when sufficiently egalitarian, the politician allows each district to approve or veto projects themselves. We relate these results to the changing structure of urban politics in the wake of the Great Society. Despite justified concerns about inequalities in participation, eliminating participatory institutions may actually increase unequal policy outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on an extension of Valerie Braithwaite's motivational postures theory (MPT), this study provides a nuanced examination of the implementation of restorative justice (RJ) by Chinese legal professionals, including police, prosecutors, and judges. Based on qualitative data from China, the study finds that the interaction among three different selves (moral, professional, and status‐seeking) determines the social distance legal professionals maintain from the various RJ programs they implement. By shifting MPT's focus from regulatees to regulators and introducing a professional self to capture role‐specific grievances and obligations, this extension illuminates how institutional and political constraints shape adaptive postures in top‐down systems. As a result, various legal professionals displayed four motivational postures—commitment, capitulation, resistance, and disengagement—toward RJ in different contexts. This study avoids a simplistic and narrow perspective on the institutionalization of RJ and provides valuable insights into improving policy designs and institutional structures. These improvements aim to foster less defiant and more accommodating postures among legal professionals toward RJ within the mainstream justice system.",

          "abstract": "How legitimate is Financial Action Task Force (FATF)? We address this question with cross‐country evidence spanning performance‐wise aspects— standards, evaluation, strategy . FATF's legitimacy needs strengthening. Standards‐wise, compliance to FATF's Recommendations generally contributes to both FATF's and external effectiveness proxies, yet the latter has much weaker evidence. Granularly, FATF's Recommendations pose challenges for good‐faith developing states, since capacity constraints hinder compliance and effectiveness conversion. Evaluation‐wise , the effectiveness appraisal may be biased due to heavy reliance on compliance ratings, evidenced by weak correlations with external corruption control and financial transparency indicators. Strategy‐wise , though enhanced follow‐up boosts persistent compliance, the dominantly punitive strategy system is detrimental to good‐faith yet low‐capacity states. Theoretically, we build an extended framework on Mitchell's theory by deepening the analysis of effectiveness and justifying its applicability to non‐binding institutions. We also enrich the dialogue on the legitimacy of international organizations by presenting a quantitative, objective approach using official data.",

          "abstract": "The regulation of business is increasingly characterized by “soft” governance regimes that blur the boundaries of public and private authority, as signaled by the rapid proliferation of multistakeholder initiatives in global governance. This article explores how the spread of multistakeholderism creates opportunities for new forms of strategic action, enabling actors to participate in multiple fora, successively or simultaneously in order to pursue a particular agenda. The article focuses on multistakeholder initiatives in UK food policy and corporate political strategy in the regulation of ultra‐processed food. We adapt the concept of venue shopping, introducing the idea of venue hopping , which captures how actors advance agendas in multiple spaces and at multiple political levels. The analysis traces negotiations across two food policy partnerships, showing how industry actors operated in and between venues, playing one setting off against the other.",
