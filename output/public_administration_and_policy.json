          "authors": "Honorata Mazepus, Dovilė Rimkutė",
          "abstract": "Bureaucratic responsiveness scholarship focused on examining how independent agencies align with the expectations of political principals and professional standards. However, little is known about how citizens perceive the legitimacy of these different responsiveness behaviors. To address this gap, we draw on insights from political science, public administration, and psychology. We hypothesize that three responsiveness signals increase citizens' perceptions of bureaucracies' legitimacy: political independence, competence, and warmth signals in communication. We draw on a survey experiment in Slovakia and Finland, manipulating the independence, competence, and warmth of the European Food Safety Authority. The results suggest that when political representatives contest a scientific agency's advice, signals of competence and warmth strengthen citizens' legitimacy perceptions of the agency. This study advances responsiveness scholarship by expanding its focus to bureaucratic responsiveness models that emphasize adherence to professional standards, support from professional peers, and affective communication with citizens, addressing both cognitive and affective legitimacy evaluations .",

          "title": "Governing on the Edge. How International Pressures Shape the Geography of State Power",
          "authors": "Magnus Åsblad",
          "abstract": "Most explanations of the territorial unevenness of state capacity in the contemporary non‐Western world focus on domestic factors. While international causes may have been crucial in shaping state capacity in Europe in earlier centuries, the logic goes, they are of less relevance for developing countries in the postwar era. This article nuances this picture, by arguing that international factors continue to matter for state‐building. Using the geographic location of state institutions as a measure of state capacity, it finds that the spatial distribution of coercive institutions follows a U‐shaped pattern: High capacity in the capital, lower in the middle, and then increasing again as one approach a state border. The results thus suggest a need to reconsider accounts that downplay the role of international pressures in shaping state‐building after 1945, as well as highlighting the importance of distinguishing between different types of state power.",

          "authors": "Michele Scotto di Vettimo, Christel Koop",
          "abstract": "In contemporary democracies, independent technocratic bodies take many key policy decisions. The organizations are meant to avoid traditional policy responsiveness, but still have processes in place to take into account societal views. Our study analyzes how pressure on technocratic bodies affects the audience orientation of their policy explanations. Taking a reputational perspective, we argue that the policy explanations provided by technocrats whose legitimacy depends on their outcomes will be influenced by performance‐based reputational threats. We hypothesize that such threats—whether based on perceptions or performance indicators—lead technocrats to orient themselves more toward the wider public, which we operationalize as accessibility and people centeredness of the language. We test our hypotheses on a new dataset of speeches of members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (1997–2024). Though accessibility cannot be traced back to performance‐based threats, people centeredness is affected. Yet, while negative performance‐based perceptions are associated with more people‐centered policy explanation, negative measured performance leads technocrats to center less on people. Our findings contribute to the literature on reputation, audience orientation, and communicative responsiveness, and suggest differential effects based on whether performance is perceived or measured.",

          "abstract": "This paper assesses the impact of federal grants for research and development (R&amp;D) on state R&amp;D investment in the United States. We find that federal grants for academic R&amp;D do not significantly influence state allocations to academic institutions from 2006 to 2021. By contrast, R&amp;D performed by agencies of the state government is estimated to grow by $0.35 with each additional dollar of federal support. We argue that these divergent results reflect the localized nature of benefits generated from R&amp;D performed by state government agencies compared to university-based research. A computational text analysis of recent federal R&amp;D awards to academic institutions and state agencies corroborates this hypothesis.",

          "authors": "Aske Halling, Mathilde Cecchini, Benedicte Gronhoj",
          "abstract": "Research shows that frontline workers often discriminate based on race or ethnicity. However, citizens can also display discriminatory behavior—for instance, by requesting service only from workers of the same ethnic or religious background. This discrimination exercised by citizens toward frontline employees remains underexplored. Building on research on citizen–state interactions, discrimination, and political ideology, this study examines when the public considers such requests acceptable. We employ a vignette‐based survey experiment with 2067 Danish citizens, set in the context of home care services. Our findings show that requests based on language are perceived as more acceptable than those grounded in religion. Moreover, political ideology significantly shapes these attitudes: right‐leaning respondents are more likely to approve when the requester belongs to the ethnic majority, whereas left‐leaning respondents are more accepting when the requester is from an ethnic minority. While these single‐country findings may not generalize beyond one‐to‐one interactions characterized by high intimacy, they shed light on how ideology influences public attitudes toward ethnically motivated service preferences and highlight the need to further examine citizen‐driven discrimination in public service settings.",

          "authors": "Rebecca A. E. Kirley, Carlotta Varriale",
          "abstract": "Administrative restructuring is an organizational phenomenon suggested to improve under‐represented groups' managerial representation by disrupting networks and institutions. However, extant tests of a ‘disruption hypothesis’ are collectively inconclusive. We elaborate and test it with a qualitative‐to‐quantitative study of local health agency managers and mergers across the Italian NHS from 2014 to 2020. Agency leader interviews reveal disruption indicators: number of agencies merging, staff rationalization, changes in geographical scale, and agency heterogeneity. Using administrative data, we find disruption measures have some positive associations with women's share of management, post‐merger retention, and new hires, providing modest support for the disruption hypothesis. However, there is an unexpected ‘winners‐and‐losers’ dynamic: incumbent women had higher post‐merger attrition than men, but merged agencies hired more women than non‐merging agencies. We offer three abductively developed interpretations of this finding, extending the disruption hypothesis' connections with public management theory on the informal, organizational antecedents of diversity in senior management.",

          "abstract": "Are public sector workers happier than their private sector counterparts? Recent research has found an association between public sector employment and happiness but leaves many questions unanswered. The major question that remains is why this association exists. Scholars have speculated that job‐related characteristics like financial satisfaction and union status may be mediators, but this has not been established empirically. Our article provides the first empirical evidence of mediation in the relationship between public sector work and happiness. Using large sample data from the World Values Survey ( n = 124,541), we find that financial satisfaction and union status both mediate the association between public sector work and happiness, with financial satisfaction being the dominant mediator in most cases. When the association between public sector work and subjective well‐being is stratified by household income and country income, we find that the effects are strongest among low‐income government workers in low‐income countries.",

          "abstract": "A central aim of contracting is to introduce competition into public service delivery. Public organizations are facing calls to generate more competition for their contracts, yet there is conflicting evidence about the effects of competition in practice. This research aims to explain some of those mixed findings by investigating the effects of different levels of competition on contract management. It examines two crucial elements of contract management that previous literature has shown can substantially influence performance outcomes: flexibility and monitoring. In highly contested markets, relationships are likely to be shorter and the payoffs from more restrictive styles of management are higher, thereby encouraging managers to be less flexible and monitor more. Findings, from an online survey experiment with 576 public managers, indicate that high competition does indeed lead to less flexibility and more monitoring, while low competition leads to less intense monitoring.",

          "abstract": "In times of crisis, maintaining citizens' trust in government is crucial for policy legitimacy. Yet, research on how institutional design shapes trust under crisis conditions remains limited. This study addresses this gap by examining how the delegation of authority and the degree of institutional independence of public health agencies relate to citizens' trust in government across 28 European countries during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using country‐level panel data, the analysis shows that trust tends to be higher in contexts where delegated agencies enjoy substantial independence from ministerial control. Moreover, governments with either strong ministries or fully independent agencies display higher average trust levels than those with intermediate or overlapping institutional arrangements. These findings highlight an independence–legitimacy nexus, suggesting that clear authority, political insulation, and policy stability are key to sustaining public trust during crises.",

          "abstract": "This article theorizes about weak checks and balances (C&amp;B) and its plausible consequences. Drawing on empirical data from over 1100 municipal officials in Mexico, the study examines how executive dominance over three key institutions—the local council, internal comptroller offices, and human resources offices—facilitates consequences associated with abuse of power and a demise in democratic regimes. We use the case of systemic corruption in local governments to propose how C&amp;B erosion undermines institutional autonomy and capacity, thereby fostering conditions in which corruption becomes normalized and self‐sustaining. By offering theoretical propositions supported by extensive survey data, the article illustrates how C&amp;B mechanisms are systematically undermined. These findings have broader implications for understanding the global drift toward illiberal governance and the challenges to revert the situation. The study contributes to global debates on democratic backsliding by highlighting how subnational dynamics reflect broader patterns of authoritarian power consolidation.",
