          "title": "Policy Design Below the Political Radar: When Policy Bureaucracies Mobilize Expertise to Restrict Business Power",
          "authors": "Anna Simstich",
          "abstract": "Powerful business interests threaten to capture policy design. From a quiet politics perspective, businesses are especially influential in policy design under conditions of low political salience. From a bureaucratic politics perspective, bureaucratic power based on specialist expertise is also strongest in low‐salience contexts and enables them to withstand business influence. Under what conditions does bureaucratic power or business power prevail in policy design under low political salience? This article argues that policy bureaucracies can restrict business power by mobilizing expertise for a different policy design than that advocated by business if they have a strong and competing organizational interest in the policy design. This argument is illustrated in a case study on the design of Extended Producer Responsibility for single‐use plastics in Germany as a deviant case of high business influence under quiet politics. This article contributes to understanding business‐bureaucracy interaction outside business home turf and below the political radar. It enhances quiet politics by introducing the role of bureaucratic responsiveness based on organizational interests and expertise.",

          "authors": "Viroj Tangcharoensathien, Jongjit Rittirong, Pattraporn Chuenglertsiri, Pongthep Wongwatcharapaiboon, Joseph Harris",
          "abstract": "Thailand's Rural Doctor Movement (RDM) is a “civic movement” organized by rural doctors who are officials in the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). RDM's political consciousness and ideologies for social justice were cultivated by their exposures to student activism and repression in October 1973 and 1976 and fostered by the exposure to poverty and ill‐health in rural communities while doing compulsory medical service in rural hospitals in the 1970s–1980s, following graduation from medical school. This perspective highlights two major contributions by RDM. First, it fought against the 1998 Drug Scandal and 2009 potential corruption in the MOPH through whistle‐blowing role. Second, RDM advocated for legislation from various statutory bodies that support and fill the gap of MOPH. These bodies include the Thai Health Promotion Foundation, the National Health Security Office, and the National Health Commission Office. The legal mandates of these statutory bodies create conflicts with tobacco, alcohol and beverage industries, pharmaceutical industries and MOPH, which led to consistent efforts to roll back the influence of these para‐statal health organizations formed and led by RDM advocates. RDM's role as whistle‐blowers and advocates for the legislation of statutory bodies provides key lessons for practitioners and policymakers in developing countries. However, they need to adapt to their own policy contexts and policy actors and be agile to grasp the window of opportunity.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how public demand and institutional contexts shape the substantive representation of LGBTQ+ populations across Europe. I argue that while positive social constructions of LGBTQ+ populations are a necessary condition for the advances of LGBTQ+ rights, issue salience can facilitate LGBTQ+ rights only if public opinion on LGBTQ+ is positive. Furthermore, I assert that translating social constructions of LGBTQ+ populations into policy outputs is mediated by the proportionality of electoral systems. I analyze policy scores, public attitudes, and online interest concerning LGBTQ+ topics. I find that positive social constructions are correlated with more inclusive LGBTQ+ rights across countries, and the positive impact of issue salience on LGBTQ+ rights is observed only in countries with positive social constructions. Additionally, the analysis of electoral systems provides mixed evidence regarding the role of proportionality.",

          "authors": "Germà Bel, Esther Pano, Marianna Sebő",
          "abstract": "The suboptimal size of municipalities is often a challenge for service delivery due to scale limitations. Intermunicipal cooperation (IMC) has expanded as an alternative to top-down amalgamations, offering a more flexible and typically voluntary approach. Many studies have been devoted to understanding the driving factors of IMC, providing static empirical evidence on the characteristics of cooperating municipalities. This article contributes to the literature with a dynamic analysis of the drivers of cooperation, using a Cox proportional hazards model over a long period and a very large sample of municipalities in Catalonia. This dynamic analysis unravels the direction of the causal relationship in complex relationships such as fiscal restrictions or political legitimation with cooperation. Furthermore, as we have data from eight relevant local services, we improve both the theoretical and empirical analysis of cooperation dynamics based on the characteristics of the services.",

          "authors": "Liesbeth Faas, Glenn Houtgraaf, Peter Kruyen, Sandra van Thiel",
          "abstract": "“Creative discretion”—defined as street‐level bureaucrats' use of their discretion to generate novel and useful ideas for customizing services to meet the needs of service users, superiors, and themselves—is vital as governments shift from traditional public management to a more user‐centered approach, emphasizing responsiveness over technocracy. Central to this shift is creative discretion, which fosters innovative solutions tailored to citizens' needs. However, literature suggests the public sector may hinder creativity due to risk aversion and increased accountability demands. Our explorative diary and interview study examines stimulators and barriers to creative discretion among street‐level bureaucrats in Dutch integrated neighborhood teams. These frontline social work teams provide a typical context to study factors determining creative discretion. Our findings highlight the importance of creative discretion and factors influencing it in practice. This study fills a research gap and contributes to understanding creative discretion in public sector service delivery.",

Adapting the 2021 USAID higher education program framework, the article focuses on: (1) the ability of the field in Nigeria to provide quality and relevant education and training, (2) the progress of PA scholars at Nigerian universities in advancing knowledge through research, and (3) the engagement of scholars with local and international communities. The assessment finds that the number of PA departments and programs has increased considerably since the first full‐fledged department began at Obafemi Awolowo University in 1976. There is a limited but growing presence of research by scholars at Nigerian universities on international databases, and evidence of engagement between PA departments and surrounding communities. The article discusses the challenges facing the field in Nigeria, including weak identity, limited resources, and low perception of public value. Finally, the article presents a research agenda for the advancement of PA in Nigeria.",

          "authors": "Colin Knox, Serik Orazgaliyev",
          "abstract": "Kazakhstan is a post‐Soviet upper middle‐income country which claims to be a leader in regional governance in Central Asia. A key component of its development strategy since independence in 1991 has been public administration reform. This paper examines the post‐Soviet public administration legacy, its features, and how Kazakhstan has attempted to modernize. The country study considers the transition process from the Soviet period, factors which shaped the change, and the extent to which Kazakhstan is now a “democratic unitary state.” Kazakhstan has made progress beyond a post‐Soviet model of public administration. However, it cannot be described as a “democratic unitary state” but rather practices hybrid governance reflecting the demise of the authoritarian bargain. The Kazakhstan country study illustrates how public administration reforms can gain traction in non‐democratic settings and challenges the liberal democratic bias in much public administration theory.",

          "abstract": "Local government capacity gaps are primary barriers to implementing climate adaptation and disaster resilience projects. While over 85% of US municipalities have fewer than 10,000 people, the extent to which capacity restricts adaptation in rural governments is not understood. This research addresses that gap by developing a national Rural Capacity Index using indicators that highlight challenges disproportionately faced by rural places. When results are mapped, the Midwest stands out for lacking capacity at the county, county subdivision, and community scales. The index is then shown to have a positive relationship with success in securing competitive federal grants. There is an estimated 4% increase in the amount of funding awarded for every 1% increase in the index's percentile rank. The Rural Capacity Index provides scholars, practitioners, and policymakers a practical tool to identify and respond to disparities in local government capacity that constrain rural disaster resilience efforts.",

          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, the amount of quantitative data in general and performance indicators specifically within street‐level organizations has increased immensely. Although quantitative data is often perceived as information about and for practice, it must also be seen as part of practice itself. Through a bottom‐up approach to numbers using ethnographic data from Danish public employment services targeting vulnerable clients, this article examines what happens when “numbers are put on the table” in street‐level organizations, going beyond categories of “gaming” or “perverse effects.” This is done by introducing an empirically derived typology of “reactions to numbers” that includes three domains: emotions, attitudes, and actions. The research contributes to a better understanding of numbers' organizational lives and performance management systems seen from a street‐level perspective.",

          "authors": "Asel Doolotkeldieva, Till Mostowlansky",
          "abstract": "In this article, we show how the study of compliance provides significant insights into the political and social tensions that shape Chinese business conduct in Kyrgyzstan's extractive industry and beyond. Drawing on interviews and analysis of legal documents, we first examine disputes between Chinese mining companies and Kyrgyz state institutions. These disputes demonstrate how the mundane workings of government bureaucracy foster a legal environment in which compliance is indeterminate. We argue that this indeterminacy—defined here as a social setting in which an action is neither predictably compliant nor noncompliant—provides a useful framework for analyzing interactions between mining companies and the state. We then move on to discuss how the establishment of international arbitration courts in Kyrgyzstan can be seen as an attempt to create new forms of compliance beyond this indeterminacy. We argue that looking at compliance through the lens of indeterminacy and examining ways of overcoming or managing it challenge the binary of compliance vs. noncompliance that continues to dominate social science literature on the subject. Finally, we maintain that the indeterminacy of compliance and the creation of new institutions both emerge from a legal environment that is shaped by broader political debate.",

          "authors": "Valerie Braithwaite",
          "abstract": "When pandemics threaten, governments are expected to protect citizens. Trustworthiness and trust are central to meeting public expectations. Motivational posturing theory differentiates resistant and dismissive defiance during the COVID‐19 pandemic. While trust is central to responding to resistant defiance, it is less relevant for dismissive defiance. Dismissive defiance is associated with distrust, conceptualized as losing hope that trust norms will restore trust. Using multiple linear regression and path analysis of Australian survey data, pathways are identified to resistant defiance and dismissive defiance. Hypotheses are confirmed, but with some unexpected insights. Trust in government and medical experts dampens both resistant and dismissive defiance. Intervening variables on the resistant defiance pathway include disagreement with government COVID decisions and vaccine hesitancy. On the dismissive defiance pathway, intervening variables include poor information seeking on COVID and poor adherence to COVID‐safe behaviors. Resistant and dismissive defiance, while related, require different approaches to trust building.",
