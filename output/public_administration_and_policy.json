          "authors": "Niccolo Durazzi, Patrick Emmenegger, Alina Felder‐Stindt",
          "abstract": "How do states create the skills needed for high technology economic activities that hold an increasingly important role in contemporary societies? Examining economic statecraft in the higher education sector, this article shows that the policies employed by governments to expand the supply of high skills vary depending on their economies' most advanced sectors. Governments who seek to meet the demand of the high‐end services sectors pursue a strategy of “open‐ended” higher education expansion. “Targeted” expansion of higher education, instead, is the preferred option for governments in countries characterized by large advanced manufacturing sectors. The latter strategy, however, is hampered by the presence of a partly private higher education system since the ability of governments to successfully pursue their strategies is mediated by the existing institutional framework in the realm of higher education policy. Empirically, the argument finds strong support through three country case studies—Germany, South Korea, and the United Kingdom—that allow to simultaneously leverage a most‐similar and most‐different research design.",

          "title": "Coping With Competing Institutional Logics in Policy Implementation",
          "authors": "Manlin Xiao, Xueyong Zhan, Arnaud Cudennec",
          "abstract": "While recent research has studied the coping behaviors of street‐level bureaucrats (SLBs), less attention has been paid to the institutional antecedents of these coping behaviors. This paper examines how macro‐level institutional factors—specifically, competing institutional logics—shape SLBs' meso‐level organizational conflicts and micro‐level coping behaviors. We use semi‐structured interviews and archival data to investigate environmental policy implementation in China, where developmental state logic and regulatory state logic coexist and compete. We found that regulatory state logic increases SLBs' workloads and accountability, while developmental state logic limits their power and resources. These competing institutional logics result in unclear responsibilities, expanding the number of tasks but constraining resources, creating pressure for enforcement officials while providing few rewards. In response, SLBs engage in active and passive coping behaviors. Our study contributes to public administration and institutional theory research by introducing a multi‐level framework that links competing logics to organizational conflicts and individual coping.",

          "title": "People‐Processing Capacity: The Origins and Development of Institutions to Render Forced Migrants as Cases in Canada and Sweden",
          "authors": "Andreas Asplen Lundstedt",
          "abstract": "States have invested heavily in controlling forced migration for decades, with mixed results. Research often focuses on deterrence, leading to a neglect of bureaucratic boundaries within borders. This article unpacks the unrecognized importance of people‐processing capacity: a state's ability to render forced migrants legible by categorizing them as cases and selecting those perceived as desirable victims. Due to the heterogeneous nature of claims and the agency of migrants, rendering migrants as cases is a deeply complicated process. Using a historical‐institutionalist framework, the article explores the role and historical development of people‐processing capacity through a comparison of the evolution of modern migration control in Canada and Sweden, two states with similar trajectories of capacity‐building but different guiding ideas for migration policy. The results trace the institutional roots of deservingness, reveal different ideals of vulnerable and adaptable refugees, and theorize how persistent governance problems emerge from classification systems intended to order migration.",

          "authors": "Ji Hyeun Hong",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a theory of organizational memory predicting that task knowledge retained in organizational structures (i.e., agency centralization and task standardization) buffers the disruptive effects of employee turnover. Using a dataset of information technology (IT) projects implemented by 94 U.S. federal agencies between FY2015-FY2021, estimates from fractional panel probit models reveal that both centralized authority under chief information officers and task standardization reduce project delays associated with IT workforce turnover; they are particularly effective in mitigating knowledge loss from voluntary and managerial position turnover. This evidence highlights the contingent nature of the turnover–performance relationship, suggesting that government agencies with high turnover may experience fewer delays when organizational structures retain task knowledge.",

          "authors": "Bjorn Kleizen, Wouter Van Dooren, Muiris MacCarthaigh, Céline Vanden Abbeele",
          "abstract": "In recent years, there have been numerous cases where citizens have found themselves stuck in highly protracted administrative processes affecting outcomes vital to their lives and livelihoods. However, systematic inquiries into the experience of being trapped by bureaucratic procedures or state inaction for sometimes multiple years are still lacking. To study the interactions between citizens and the state when long waiting times and significant outcomes are involved, we introduce the concept of administrative limbo. We examine administrative limbo using primary and secondary interview data from the Irish defective concrete block crisis, the Dutch childcare benefits affair, and the Dutch Groningen gas crisis. Findings suggest that experiences of administrative limbo are marked by prolonged and extensive uncertainty, accumulating strain, and negatively impacted life perspectives. We find that the effects of being stuck in administrative limbo are profound, indicating that temporal experiences of inaction and action should be further explored in public administration.",

          "abstract": "Will voters punish incumbents for psychological distress associated with public policy during external shocks? This study examines this question in the empirical context of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, utilizing three novel cross-sectional surveys conducted in the first three weeks of June 2020, immediately after the national lockdown policy was officially revoked. We find that propensity to vote for the nationally incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (if hypothetical elections were held on the day of the survey) was negatively correlated with mental stress from routine disruptions in mobility (Week 1); worsening mental health (Week 2); and emotion-focused coping (Week 3). We show that these effects are strongest in BJP-ruled states. We argue that psychological distress shaped political attitudes in the midst of the pandemic and this effect was conditional on the source of distress and moderated by governmental clarity of responsibility.",

          "authors": "Yue Guo, Zihan Xu, Qian Zhang",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the intergenerational transmission mechanisms of policy feedback, focusing on how past policies influence citizens' behavioral intentions across generations in the context of China's fertility policy changes. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, we investigate how experiences with the one‐child policy affect individuals' intentions under the current pro‐natalist policy. Logistic regression analysis reveals that individuals whose parents complied with the one‐child policy are less likely to intend to have more than one child. This effect is mediated by the weakening of traditional beliefs, such as “raising children for old age” and “continuation of family lineage.” A regression discontinuity design further confirms that individuals with parents subjected to stricter birth control measures exhibit lower intentions to have more children. These findings underscore the significance of intergenerational transmission in shaping citizens' attitudes and highlight the lasting impact of historical policy experiences on contemporary policy outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive research investigating the link between government performance and citizen satisfaction, our understanding is limited regarding whether and how information disclosure affects this relationship in the digital era. This study bridges this gap by examining the interactive effects of information disclosure and performance information on citizen satisfaction. We argue that information disclosure strengthens the “performance–satisfaction” link by aligning citizens' satisfaction evaluations more closely with government performance. Using a staggered difference‐in‐differences design, we analyze individuals' environmental satisfaction from the China Livelihood Survey (2011–2017) across municipalities, while government performance is measured using satellite data and information disclosure timing is sourced from government portals. Findings indicate a consistent relationship between government performance and citizen satisfaction due to information disclosure. Further analyses reveal that this effect is mediated by citizens' information‐seeking behaviors and is particularly pronounced among informationally disadvantaged citizens. This research contributes to understanding the performance–satisfaction relationship in a digital era.",

          "authors": "Martin J. Luby, Catherine Holley, Celine Kim",
          "abstract": "In 2009, the US federal government created the Build America Bond (BAB) program to improve access to the capital markets for state and local governments. While the federal government typically subsidizes subnational capital financing indirectly through tax exemption, the BAB program provided direct cash subsidies to governments. The Budget Control Act of 2011 implemented a sequester that reduced BAB subsidies by 5.7 to 8.7% each year since 2013. This paper estimates previous and potential future sequestration losses on all outstanding BABs as of the end of 2022. It delves into BAB use and sequestration by two issuers (governments in the state of Texas and City of Chicago). The paper concludes with a discussion of the current state of BABs as it relates to recent litigation and refinancing attempts. The loss estimates provide lessons for the provision and management of federal direct subsidies available to state and local governments.",

          "abstract": "The European Union (EU) is making regulatory efforts to allow for the safe integration of drones into civilian airspace through automated means. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/664 concerning unmanned traffic management (a system referred to as “U‐Space”) furthers that commitment. Accordingly, drone operators must avail themselves of automatic traffic‐related “U‐Space services” concerning flight authorization, geo awareness, traffic information, and network identification before entering U‐Space airspace. Using infrastructural analysis, as proposed within Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article shows that while automation is meant to ensure safe traffic, it could also challenge U‐Space safety in at least three ways: by inviting reliability concerns for U‐Space infrastructure; because of the transition from human‐centric to automation‐centric systems; and by being subject to irregularities within the EU's framework. An infrastructural analysis, therefore, helps in unveiling important factors which influence the safety of automated technologies and in critically discussing the role of law in their regulation.",

          "authors": "Francesco Findeisen, Patrick Le Galès",
          "abstract": "This paper advances research on policy accumulation by analyzing its political consequences in the French housing sector. It argues that, in the context of decentralization reforms, the accumulation of policy instruments has undermined national steering capacities and intensified territorial inequalities. Decentralization accelerated accumulation by decoupling policy formulation from the costs and administrative responsibilities of implementation, shifting these burdens onto subnational governments. The resulting proliferation of instruments politicized implementation, as local authorities confronted capacity‐driven trade‐offs between adhering to national directives and pursuing local policies, while simultaneously gaining opportunities to innovate and build coalitions with non‐state actors. Consequenty, local governments in economically dynamic areas could strategically leverage policy accumulation to advance their interests, whereas those in less affluent regions faced administrative overload. By adopting an institutional perspective on policy instruments, this paper shows how accumulation research can foreground the political consequences of accumulation, which increasingly shape the problem‐solving capacities and legitimacy of modern states.",

          "authors": "Daniela Stockmann, Ting Luo",
          "abstract": "There is a continuing debate on whether the internet serves as a public sphere for meaningful political discussion and increases political engagement. Yet, we know little about how internet users in authoritarian regimes perceive and experience online political discussion beyond the dominant frame of censorship and surveillance. Based on the first nationally representative survey on internet use in China, this paper examines how citizens view the space for political discussion online and offline and how three types of concerns—repercussions, social desirability, and privacy—shape these perceptions. Results show that Chinese citizens tend to perceive online discussion as more diverse. Those concerned about political repercussions report higher perceived diversity in online discussions, while social desirability concerns correlate with greater perceived diversity in both online and offline settings. Only those concerned for exposure of personal information perceive online political discussion as more uniform. These findings advance understandings of citizen views on political discussion in authoritarian contexts and contribute to broader debates about the role of the internet in political engagement.",
