          "abstract": "New research argues that robust governance based on flexible adaptation and proactive innovation is needed in order to uphold core public functions, purposes, and values in times of societal turbulence. However, we have limited knowledge of the conditions for enhancing robust governance. To fill that knowledge gap, we ask: How can multi‐level governance, hybrid governance, and societal intelligence contribute to the development of robust responses to the proliferation of complex and turbulent problems? To answer this pertinent question, we draw on relevant literatures to conceptualize each of the three governance factors and develop a set of theoretically derived conjectures about their impact on robust governance. We also discuss the combined effects of the three governance factors as well as the limits to robust governance. Finally, we draw some lessons for practitioners and sketch out an agenda for further research.",

          "authors": "Johan Christensen, Petra van den Bekerom",
          "abstract": "Public policy often builds on a large body of policy advice—produced by bureaucrats, advisory bodies, scientists, and consultants—that has accumulated over time about a specific policy problem and appropriate policy responses. Yet, how this body of policy advice develops and which pieces of advice influence subsequent policy recommendations is poorly understood. We seek to fill this gap by proposing a novel conceptualization and methodological approach for unpacking the influence of policy advice on other policy advice. First, we distinguish four conceptual dimensions along which the influence of policy advice varies: lasting influence, broad influence, influential followers, and influence as broker. Second, we propose citation network analysis as a methodological tool for measuring these multiple dimensions of influence. We present a set of citation network measures of influence and illustrate their usefulness by analyzing influence patterns within a large network of Norwegian advisory reports.",

          "authors": "Nhung Nguyen, Luu Trong Tuan, Dinh Cong Khai",
          "abstract": "Illegitimate tasks are duties that violate established role expectations, such as assigning urban planning officers to manage traffic hotlines. In the public sector, bureaucratic structures, resource constraints, and leadership limitations often contribute to the proliferation of such tasks, yet their impact on public servants' behaviors remains unclear. This study examines how and when illegitimate tasks inhibit public servants' innovative work behavior through the mediating role of cognitive flexibility and the moderating roles of different forms of trust in leaders. Hierarchical model analyses using multi‐wave data from public servants and their managers in Vietnam reveal that illegitimate tasks indirectly reduce innovative work behavior via cognitive flexibility. Additionally, relationship‐based trust amplifies the negative effect of illegitimate tasks on cognitive flexibility, whereas character‐based trust does not. These findings highlight the need to minimize illegitimate task assignments and reveal the potential drawbacks of relationship‐based trust in such adverse work conditions.",

          "authors": "Wenting Yang",
          "abstract": "Public agencies face diverse expectations from external actors regarding their responsiveness. However, systemic research explaining how institutional pressures arising from these expectations, particularly formal rules and informal norms, motivate public agencies to respond remains limited. By conducting a national‐scale field experiment among 949 provincial‐level agencies in China, this study tests the effect of regulative pressure from formal rules and normative pressure from informal norms on their responses to freedom of information requests. The results show that legal regulative pressure and social normative pressure make agencies more likely to respond within the legal timeframe and provide the requested information. Legal regulative pressure and professional normative pressure increase the likelihood of agencies providing additional information beyond the requested information. The findings suggest the critical roles that institutional pressures play in enhancing various degrees and aspects of bureaucratic responsiveness, with pressure from formal rules being more effective in enhancing responsiveness than informal norms.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how citizens perceive and evaluate the digitalization of education. Drawing on original survey data from six OECD countries (Germany, Japan, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the US), the study addresses the overarching question: Does public opinion support or inhibit the digital transformation of education? The analysis focuses on three core aspects in this regard—perceptions of state performance, demand for digital device use in schools, and concerns about data governance. Findings reveal cautious but conditional public support: while many endorse digitalization, significant concerns persist about data privacy, especially regarding private tech companies. Support varies systematically by socio‐economic status, age, household composition as well as in line with general dispositions and attitudes towards global technology companies. The paper also identifies a significant degree of cross‐country variation, which, however, does not neatly map onto existing welfare state regimes.",

          "authors": "Giuliano Bonoli, Patrick Emmenegger, Alina Felder‐Stindt",
          "abstract": "European economies face the task of providing the necessary skills for the “twin transition” in a period of skill shortage. As a result, we may expect countries to reorient their labor market policy towards re‐skilling. We look for evidence of a reorientation in two relevant policy fields: active labor market policy (ALMP) and adult education (AE). We explore general trends in both fields based on quantitative indicators and compare recent policy developments in four countries with strong ALMP and AE sectors: Denmark, France, Germany, and Sweden. We do not observe clear evidence of a general movement away from activation and towards re‐skilling in ALMP. However, in AE, we identify several re‐skilling initiatives that address skill shortages. Relying on insights from queuing theories of hiring and training, we argue that due to changes in the population targeted by ALMP, the locus of re‐skilling policy is increasingly moving towards AE.",
