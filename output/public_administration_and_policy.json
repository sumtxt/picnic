          "title": "Glass Ceiling or Merit? Gender, Promotion, and Judicial Careers in a Civil Law System",
          "authors": "Joan‐Josep Vallbé, Carmen Ramírez‐Folch, Mario Lozano‐Martín",
          "abstract": "This paper examines how institutional mechanisms shape gender disparities in judicial promotion within a career‐based civil‐law system, where judges advance through merit‐based hierarchies punctuated by discretionary appointments to higher courts. By design, civil‐law judiciaries are typically governed by bureaucratic, merit‐based promotion procedures. Yet even in such systems, women remain underrepresented in senior judicial positions. We develop a model to distinguish between two mechanisms— promotion aversion and sex discrimination—and derive empirically testable implications. Drawing on a unique longitudinal dataset covering the full careers of nearly 7000 Spanish judges from 2005 to 2023, we combine survival models, matched mixed‐effects regressions, and data on voluntary specialization exams to analyze career advancement. Our results show that promotion aversion and sex discrimination operate at different stages of judicial careers: women who apply for promotion are highly qualified and successful in early‐career moves, but face structural barriers in later discretionary appointments. These findings challenge assumptions about the neutrality of bureaucratic promotion systems and underscore the role of institutional discretion in reproducing inequality. The paper contributes to comparative studies of career public servants and the governance of judicial hierarchies.",

          "title": "New Leader, New Policy? Bureaucratic Turnover and Policy Stability in China",
          "authors": "Zhiwei Liu",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between bureaucratic turnover and policy stability in China, arguing that the effect of promotion competition on policy choice is not static but has undergone a fundamental inversion. While the existing literature suggests competition incentivized policy innovation in the pre‐2012 era, we theorize that the logic has been inverted. Drawing on a dataset of 267 prefecture‐level cities from 2005 to 2015, we first confirm that leadership turnover significantly reduces policy stability. More importantly, our structural break analysis reveals that in the post‐2012 era of heightened political discipline, intense competition now compels officials towards policy stability as a risk‐averse strategy for career advancement. This study provides direct evidence of a temporal shift in bureaucratic incentives, refining our understanding of governance in non‐Western centralized states.",

          "authors": "Vicente Ferraro, Gabriela Lotta, Mykhailo Honchar",
          "abstract": "The actions of street-level bureaucrats (SLBs)—such as teachers, healthcare workers, and police officers—during crises and emergencies have received growing attention in Public Administration scholarship. Yet, a critical and underexplored dimension remains: the role of SLBs in context of war and armed conflict, where threats to personal safety, political coercion, and institutional collapse converge. This article investigates how war—and military occupation in particular—reshapes the everyday work, moral dilemmas, and response strategies of SLBs operating under extreme conditions. We focus on the war in Ukraine—the most intense armed conflict on European soil since World War II. Within this context, we examine education professionals, as schools and universities have become strategic targets of Russian occupation forces: cultural frontlines central to the legitimization of territorial control and forced assimilation. Complex dilemmas emerge: should SLBs continue providing services to the population—thus risking complicity with the occupiers and being branded as “traitors”—or should they refrain from any contact with them, at the risk of facing violent punishment? Our analysis draws on qualitative data collected through fieldwork in six Ukrainian regions; semi-structured and in-depth interviews (both online and face-to-face) with education professionals who experienced the Russian occupation; and qualitative document analysis of media coverage and human rights reports. Following an abductive research design, we identify four structural features that distinguish war from other crises: forced interaction with enemy state actors, institutional weaponization, loyalty dilemmas, and bureaucratic rupture under contested sovereignties. Building on these findings, we propose a fourfold typology of SLB response strategies—exit, accommodation, local defiance, and remote adaptation—each grounded in distinct moral decisions. By bringing SLBs into the analysis of wartime governance, this article contributes to an emerging research agenda on frontline bureaucracy under conditions of armed conflict—contexts that, alarmingly, are no longer exceptional.",

          "authors": "Zhengyan Li, Yuhao Ba",
          "abstract": "We study how regulatory competition and learning shape bureaucratic behaviors under regulatory federalism in the US, focusing on Clean Air Act enforcement within intra‐firm networks. Using facility‐level panel data on inspections from 2005 to 2017, we examine how sibling facility violations influence state regulators' scrutiny of focal facilities. These mechanisms predict opposite effects: learning increases scrutiny, while competition decreases it. Our findings provide evidence for both mechanisms, with their relative strength varying under different conditions. Regulators increase scrutiny following violations by same‐state sibling facilities, highlighting strong learning effects when information is accessible and accountability pressures are high. Conversely, scrutiny decreases after violations by same‐industry siblings in competitor states, demonstrating competitive incentives when business opportunities are relevant. These results clarify the interplay between competition and learning in regulatory federalism and offer practical insights for mitigating adverse competition dynamics and strengthening learning to enhance decentralized regulatory systems.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the strategic communication of the European Commission about developing a regulatory approach and financial instruments to foster the greening of the European economy over a period of 14 years (2009–2023). We investigate in‐depth the strategic communication of three European Commission Colleges led by Barroso, Juncker, and von der Leyen, respectively. We analyze an original dataset of 57 Commission Communications using qualitative content analysis. The paper demonstrates that, over the past 14 years, the EU's strategic agenda‐setting has moved away from a predominantly neoliberal approach of limited state involvement in the economy to one foreseeing more active state intervention, especially in the provision of financial resources and the design of integrated policies to guide the green transition. The findings highlight the crucial role of the Commission in steering the EU's climate action policies, as shown by the adoption of the European Green Deal in 2019.",

          "abstract": "Lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), while offering strategic advantages in warfare, pose significant ethical, legal, and security risks, especially for countries in the Global South. This article examines how a philosophical perspective, rooted in African ethical and political thought, can enrich regional and global debates on regulating LAWS, which remain dominated by Eurocentric assumptions. The findings of this study, which draw from secondary data, suggest that existing international and regional safeguards are insufficient to address the risks posed by LAWS. It proposes a dual‐theoretical approach informed by technological determinism and grounded in ubuntu . This approach centres on collective human accountability and reinforces the imperative of meaningful human control in the design, deployment, and governance of LAWS to safeguard the security and sovereignty of affected states and communities. This article lays the groundwork for African‐led regulatory mechanisms for emerging military technologies and offers an Afrocentric perspective on rethinking the global governance of LAWS.",

          "authors": "Jake Phillips",
          "abstract": "This article examines how probation inspectors in England and Wales construct their self‐legitimacy; the internal belief in their moral and professional right to inspect. Drawing on qualitative interviews and Bottoms and Tankebe's dialogic model of legitimacy, it shows how inspectors justify their authority through legal mandates, professional expertise, methodological rigor, and a commitment to public service. In the absence of coercive powers, inspectors rely on what this article conceptualizes as regulatory soft power, influence grounded in credibility, fairness, and moral purpose. Inspection emerges as a relational practice, shaped by how inspectors perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others. This study extends the concept of self‐legitimacy from criminology into the regulatory domain, offering new insight into how regulators navigate authority in contexts marked by political sensitivity and limited enforcement tools. It argues that self‐legitimacy is an overlooked dimension of responsive regulation and a key factor in regulatory effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "To address the shortcomings associated with state ownership, countries have implemented various legal strategies to curb political influence in state‐owned enterprises. This research studies whether these strategies constrain the government's ability to use their appointment powers for political considerations. Using logit models, I analyze whether the probability of chief executive officer (CEO) turnover increases once a new government comes into power and whether some state‐owned enterprise governance structures (board of directors' independence, ownership models and legal status) can moderate the CEO turnover sensitivity to political change. This study is based on an original dataset of state‐owned enterprises' governance characteristics and turnover events in Chile from 2006 to 2023. I find that, while CEOs are more likely to be replaced following a change in government, the turnover sensitivity to political change is heterogeneous among companies with different governance structures. These findings provide insights into what governance mechanisms are the most effective in preventing political interference.",
