          "title": "United in Diversity? EU Core‐Periphery Divides at the Time of the Green Transition",
          "authors": "Dario Guarascio, Jelena Reljic, Annamaria Simonazzi",
          "abstract": "This work analyses the structural implications of the green transition and of the ‘new industrial policy’ aimed at achieving its main goals. Focusing on the European case, a thorough mapping of the structural factors–i.e., share of energy intensive industries, green technological capabilities, green state aid–potentially shaping the distribution of costs and benefits among countries is provided. Building on this mapping, the EU's green industrial policy is thoroughly analyzed, assessing whether it is going to exacerbate internal divides, further weakening the EU in the new global context; or to revitalize convergence, with the periphery catching up in terms of productive and technological capabilities. We show that, although broad and well‐articulated, the EU's green industrial policy strategy does not seem apt to the task of pursuing the twofold goal of accelerating the green transition and fostering internal convergence.",

          "title": "There Is No Rose Without a Thorn: Examining the Contribution of Collaborative Platforms to Sustaining Collaborative Governance",
          "authors": "Dominik Beckers, Luca Mora, Federico Platania, Paolo Gerli",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the extent to which collaborative platforms contribute to strengthening the collaborative governance capacity of municipal governments, focusing on smart city development as an empirical context. Drawing on survey data from 289 municipal government officials and using a multinomial logit model, we test eight hypotheses linking collaborative platforms to key dimensions of collaborative governance: knowledge sharing, innovation culture, competences, strategic orientation, monitoring, vertical and internal coordination, and decision‐making power. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that such platforms are uniformly beneficial. While their presence might support some collaborative governance dimensions, their contribution is less certain in others. Moreover, in some cases, our data shows that municipalities managing collaborative governance initiatives by means of a collaborative platform might perform just as well or even worse than those without one. These results suggest that expectations about collaborative platforms should be more carefully calibrated. By critically examining the contribution of collaborative platforms across key dimensions of collaborative governance, this study advances theoretical understanding and offers actionable insights for municipal platform managers and policymakers.",

          "title": "State Capacity, Social Fragmentation, and Public Goods Provision: A Cross‐National Comparative Analysis",
          "authors": "Jiali Shen",
          "abstract": "This study investigates why state capacity does not always translate into improved public goods provision. I argue that the effect of state capacity depends critically on state–society interactions, which are shaped by regime type and, more decisively, by social fragmentation. While existing research often assumes a uniformly positive impact of capacity, this study shows otherwise. In democracies, institutionalized responsiveness ensures that higher capacity consistently enhances provision, regardless of fragmentation. In authoritarian states, however, outcomes hinge on the degree of social fragmentation: where fragmentation is high, strong states provide more goods to mitigate conflict and maintain legitimacy; where society is cohesive, high capacity may instead be diverted to elite projects, exclusionary distribution, or control. Using panel data on 177 countries (1960–2015), I demonstrate that state capacity's effect is conditional, not absolute. These findings highlight how social fragmentation, interacting with political regime, fundamentally shapes the governance returns of state capacity.",

          "authors": "Andrew J. Taylor",
          "abstract": "Individuals who particularly like or dislike a president or presidential candidate may, through a process of motivated reasoning, personally support or oppose the politician’s policy positions as a consequence. I examine the extent to which attitudes toward Donald Trump shaped public opinion on immigration policy, a case that appears to invite motivated reasoning. I estimate the influence of attitudes about Trump by comparing them directly to views of Barack Obama and trade policy using large reputable national surveys. I find a material, if limited, Trump effect. Trump polarized Americans on immigration considerably. However, the polarization was not along racial or ethnic lines. Moreover, any Trump effect on immigration appears not to have been as large as that he brought to bear on trade. Contrary to some recent work, such an effect also appears to have elevated immigration only marginally in the list of those deemed important.",

          "title": "Community‐Oriented or Self‐Interested? Citizen Motivations for Engaging in Digital Coproduction",
          "authors": "Vishal Trehan, Gregory Porumbescu, Suzanne Piotrowski",
          "abstract": "Public organizations increasingly use digitally enabled platforms such as 311 (a nonemergency service in the United States) to facilitate coproduction and improve service delivery. While prior research has examined coproducers' motivations, we know little about motivations for digital coproduction. This study examines whether residents who engage in digital coproduction are motivated by self‐interest or community orientation, and whether motivations vary by neighborhood‐level income. Using supervised machine learning and spatial regression on a dataset of digital 311 requests from Newark, New Jersey, we find that most resident requests reflect community‐oriented motivations, and these are more prevalent in lower‐income neighborhoods. These findings shed light on the motivations driving digital coproduction and highlight the potential of 311‐like systems to foster a sense of community, especially in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. By understanding these motivations, public organizations can better harness digital platforms to strengthen civic engagement, bridging social divides and empowering residents to shape their communities more actively.",

          "title": "Team Gender Composition Correlates With Ratings of Women and Men Leaders: On the Role of Group Prototypicality",
          "authors": "Matthias Döring, Alexander Kroll",
          "abstract": "Leadership research has emphasized the crucial role of gender and documented how women leaders are rated more negatively regarding essential behaviors and competencies. Drawing on social identity theory, studies show, however, that perceptions of women leaders are more positive if evaluated by female employees. This article contributes to this body of research, arguing that it is not necessarily the dyadic gender match between supervisor and employee that matters. Instead, gender‐based group identities deserve more attention, since teams, and the social peer interactions they facilitate, can shape how individual employees, independent of their own gender, experience women and men leaders. Based on Danish local government data from 3400+ employees, we find that employees working in teams whose composition is more female (more male) provide more favorable ratings of women (men) leaders, while controlling for dyadic gender matches. The findings point to the importance of team design, evaluation protocols, and training for debiasing leadership assessments.",

          "authors": "Wiebke Marie Junk, Ellis Aizenberg",
          "abstract": "The literature on lobbying coalitions has explored the choice of interest organizations to cooperate with others in a series of correlational studies. Yet, considerable diversity in cooperation activities, as well as path dependencies between organizations complicate these analyses. For this reason, we still have limited knowledge about different types of asymmetries between coalition partners that inform organizational cooperation. Experimental studies can add to these findings by assessing differences between the strategic choices made by organizations in more controlled, though hypothetical, settings. In this article, we present the results of a preregistered survey experiment, conducted in eight European polities (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Ireland, The Netherlands, Italy, and the European Union) to understand the willingness of organizations to cooperate with “strangers,” as well as members of their network in the agenda‐setting phase of policymaking. We also test the willingness to cooperate with different types of groups (NGOs and business organizations), and gauge how treatment effects vary for different types of respondents. Our results help understand the importance of previous connections, homophily and reputational considerations in coalition formation in the policy process. Moreover, our study uncovers differences in the willingness to engage in different types of cooperation and indicates that inequalities exist between interest organizations when it comes to partner choice that we so far know little about.",

          "title": "The Construction of Compliance with the European Union Deforestation Regulation in Global Coffee Value Chains",
          "authors": "Janina Grabs",
          "abstract": "The European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) obliges the importers and users of seven agricultural commodities to achieve supply chain traceability and prevent deforestation‐linked products from entering the EU market. This paper investigates how companies and producing countries in the coffee sector prepared for EUDR compliance by analyzing 61 semi‐structured expert interviews and 25 sectoral meetings. It draws on socio‐legal theorization on compliance construction and Global Value Chain scholarship to show that under regulatory uncertainty, compliance preparations are shaped significantly by pre‐existing value chain characteristics and power relations. Upstream, midstream, and downstream actors pursued different compliance approaches to reduce costs and improve their competitive position. While producing countries aimed to establish country‐level producer databases for EUDR compliance, trading companies drew on existing capacities to build out their traceable, sustainable coffee offers. Downstream coffee sector actors, in turn, constructed a “territorial” approach to EUDR compliance that eschewed strict traceability, but were ultimately unsuccessful in lobbying for its acceptance by EU authorities. The results highlight the importance of considering value chain dynamics when designing and implementing public policy, and paying greater analytical attention to the phase of compliance preparation within the policy cycle.",
