          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is frequently associated with metastatic relapse, even at an early stage 1 . Here we assessed an individualized neoantigen mRNA vaccine in 14 patients with TNBC following surgery and after neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. In peripheral blood of nearly all patients, high-magnitude, vaccine-induced, mostly de novo T cell responses to multiple neoantigens were detected that remained functional for several years. Characterization of individual patients revealed that a large proportion of these T cells developed into two subsets: a late-differentiated phenotype with markers indicative of ‘ready-to-act’ cytotoxic effector T cells, and T cells with a stem cell-like memory phenotype. Eleven patients remained relapse-free for up to six years post-vaccination. Recurrence occurred in three patients: the individual with the weakest vaccine-induced T cell response relapsed, but achieved complete remission on subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy; another patient had a tumour with low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression with MHC class I-deficient cells growing out under vaccination; and the third patient was BRCA-positive and had a recurrence from a genetically distinct primary tumour. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of individualized RNA vaccines in TNBC, document persistence of vaccine-induced, functional neoantigen-specific T cells and provide insights into possible immune escape mechanisms that will guide future approaches.",

          "abstract": "Centromeres ensure accurate chromosome segregation, yet their DNA evolves rapidly across eukaryotes leaving the origins of new centromere architectures unclear 1–4 . The brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exemplifies this long-standing puzzle. Its centromeres shifted ancestrally from large, repeat-rich, epigenetically specified forms to the compact, genetically defined ‘point’ centromeres 1,5 . How this transition occurred has remained unresolved 6 . Here we identify evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres that provide a resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres. Proto-point centromeres contain a single centromeric nucleosome positioned over an AT-rich core, accompanied by relaxed organization and sequence variability of flanking cis -elements. In two species, these proto-point centromeres lie within retrotransposon-derived repeat clusters, linking ancestral repeat-rich centromeres to genetically encoded ones. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate that proto-point and point centromeres evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres. These results identify long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons, specifically Ty5 sequences, as the genetic substrate for point-centromere evolution and provide a mechanistic route by which an epigenetic centromere can become genetically specified. More broadly, they show how selfish elements can be co-opted to perform essential chromosomal functions.",

          "abstract": "The severity of malaria varies substantially between individuals, but the mechanisms that underlie these differences remain unclear. Because erythrocytes have a key role in malaria biology, genetic variants associated with the development of these cells could inform the mechanisms that determine disease severity. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis of the association of the variant rs112233623-T with erythrocyte properties, and examine its role in modulating malaria severity. This variant is associated with increased levels of haemoglobin A2, increased erythrocyte size and reduced erythrocyte number 1,2 . It is found in an erythroid enhancer of CCND3 , which encodes cyclin D3—a cell-division activator that enhances the pentose phosphate pathway and thereby helps to counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3 . We show that rs112233623-T disrupts a binding site for the transcription factor SMAD3, weakens enhancer activity and, in erythrocyte precursors (erythroblasts), is associated with reduced CCND3 expression and inhibition of the G1–S cell-cycle transition, concomitant with a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and an increase in their size. Using population genetic methods, we observe signatures of positive selection for rs112233623-T in the genetic history of Sardinia, a region in which malaria was once prevalent. Furthermore, we show that parasite growth is impaired in cultured Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes from rs112233623-T carriers, and that this impairment correlates with ROS levels. This mirrors our observations in erythrocytes from individuals who are deficient in the pentose-phosphate-pathway enzyme G6PD—a trait associated with protection against malaria in some settings—and highlights a common ROS-based mechanism of malaria resistance. Our results suggest that a reduction in CCND3 in erythroblasts constitutes a mechanism of resistance to malaria, and could enable therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Telecommunication systems are evolving towards ultrawide bandwidth and low latency, supporting wired and wireless links and their non-blocking interconnection 1 . However, a long-standing bandwidth mismatch between fibre communication and its wireless counterpart arises from fundamental disparities in signal architectures and hardware constraints 2,3 , which prevent high-speed and compatible transmission across the two domains. This challenge further complicates unified system design and hinders the realization of high-throughput-density, congestion-free fibre–wireless links under wideband-access scenarios 4 . Here we present an ultra-wideband (UWB) integrated photonics scheme that facilitates fibre–wireless communication over a shared-bandwidth infrastructure. Built on electro–optic (EO) and optic–electro (OE) conversions featuring 3-dB operational bandwidths exceeding 250 GHz and cross-architecture adaptability, our system demonstrates unprecedented data transmission capabilities in both wired and wireless links. Using the same set of devices and powered by the proposed complex bidirectional gated recurrent unit (complex-biGRU) algorithm, ultrahigh single-lane data rates of 512 Gbps for short-reach fibre and, for the first time to the authors’ knowledge, 400-Gbps high-speed wireless transmission have been achieved. Furthermore, high-density access is enabled by an all-optically assisted ultra-broadband wireless scheme. Real-time multichannel 8K video transmission is successfully demonstrated across 86 channels, seamlessly using a spectral range from 138 to 223 GHz. These findings in unified telecommunication development show the potential for the development of high-speed, densified and low-latency communication networks.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) pollution is a cause of eutrophication globally 1 . However, recent datasets indicate that some ecosystems may be experiencing widespread oligotrophication—declining N availability—which is suggested to be a response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) 2 . Plant N isotope (δ 15 N) chronologies have served as primary evidence for oligotrophication, but there is wide disagreement whether rising CO 2 or temporal changes in N deposition explain these patterns 3–6 . Here we construct δ 15 N tree-ring chronologies using archived samples from Sweden’s 23.5-million-hectare forest area from 1961 to 2018. The study area spans a 1,500-km latitudinal distance where N deposition varies fourfold, but where rising CO 2 is spatially uniform. Our data show declining δ 15 N chronologies throughout Sweden, including forests in the far north where atmospheric N deposition rates are very low. Linear mixed-effects models showed that rising CO 2 is the strongest predictor of δ 15 N values, whereas N deposition variables, temperature and forest basal area had lower explanatory power. Our findings suggest that elevated atmospheric CO 2 is causing oligotrophication in boreal forests, which has implications for predicting their future role as sinks in the global carbon cycle 7–9 .",

          "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of healthcare- and antibiotic-associated infection and has a 30% recurrence rate 1–5 . Previous vaccine strategies against CDI failed to reduce pathogen burden, a prerequisite for preventing C. difficile transmission and recurrence 6–11 . These vaccines were administered parenterally, which induced a systemic immune response, rather than a mucosal response in the colon, the site of infection. Here we compare protection and colonization burden between mucosal (rectal) and parenteral (intraperitoneal) administration routes of a multivalent, adjuvanted vaccine combining inactivated C. difficile toxins and novel surface antigens. We found that mucosal immunization, but not parenteral, clears C. difficile from the host. Unique correlates of decolonization included faecal IgG responses to vegetative surface antigens and a colonic, T helper type 17 (T H 17)-skewed tissue-resident memory T cell response against spore antigen. Importantly, mucosal vaccination protected against morbidity, mortality, tissue damage and recurrence. Our results demarcate notable differences in correlates of protection and pathogen clearance between vaccine administration routes and highlight a mucosal immunization regimen that elicits sterilizing immunity against CDI.",

          "abstract": "Acral melanoma, which is not ultraviolet-associated, is the type of melanoma reported most commonly in several non-European-descent populations 1–3 , including in Mexican people 4 . Latin American samples are substantially under-represented in global cancer genomics studies 5 , which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures 6–8 . To address this, we characterized the genome and transcriptome of 123 acral melanoma tumours from 92 Mexican patients—a population notable because of its genetic admixture 9 . Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF , NRAS or NF1 . Although most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations. The tumours with activating BRAF mutations had a transcriptional profile more similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, indicating that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared with other tumours arising in these locations. Transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with recurrence-free and overall survival. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.",

          "abstract": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) promotes encapsulation of viral genomic RNA into mature viral cores, and this function is a target for ongoing antiretroviral drug development efforts 1–3 . Here we determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a primate lentiviral IN in a complex with RNA, revealing a linear filament made of IN octamer repeat units, each comprising a pair of asymmetric homotetramers. The assembly is stabilized through IN–RNA interactions involving mainly the IN C-terminal domains and RNA backbone. The spacing and orientation of the IN filament repeat units closely matched those of consecutive capsid (CA) hexamers within the mature CA lattice. Using cryo-EM images of native purified HIV-1 cores, we refined the structure of the IN filament as it propagates along the luminal side of the CA lattice. Each IN tetramer within the filament nestled in a CA hexamer, engaging closely with the major homology regions. Substitutions of residues involved in IN–CA contacts yielded eccentric virions with RNA nucleoids located outside of the cores. Collectively, our results establish the structural basis for the HIV-1 IN–RNA interaction and reveal that IN forms an RNA-binding module on the luminal side of the mature CA lattice.",

          "abstract": "Cytopathology, often abbreviated as cytology, has a central role in the early detection of cancer, such as cervical, lung and bladder cancers, owing to its speed, simplicity and minimally invasive nature 1–9 . However, its effectiveness is limited by variability in diagnostic accuracy stemming from subjective visual interpretation 10–21 . Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems have been proposed to improve consistency 22–26 , none have achieved fully autonomous, clinical-grade performance. Existing approaches serve as assistive tools and still rely on human oversight for interpretation and decision-making 22–26 . Here we present a clinical-grade autonomous cytopathology pipeline that combines high-resolution, real-time optical whole-slide tomography with edge computing to deliver end-to-end automation. The system achieves practical performance in imaging speed, quality and data volume, with localized data compression enabling streamlined storage and accelerated AI-driven analysis. In addition to supporting cell-level classification, the platform enables flow cytometry-like, population-wide morphological profiling for comprehensive interpretation of cellular distributions and patterns. A vision transformer achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.99 at the single-cell level for detecting low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and adenocarcinoma. In a multicentre evaluation of 1,124 cervical liquid-based cytology samples across four centres, the AI model achieved slide-level AUC values of 0.86–0.91 for LSIL + and 0.89–0.97 for HSIL + , with LSIL counts correlating strongly with human papillomavirus positivity and HSIL counts scaling with diagnostic severity. The system enables autonomous triage cytology, offering a foundation for routine, scalable and objective diagnostics.",

Among these, alternative splicing has been shown to drive cell-type specificity and, when disrupted, is strongly linked to neurological disorders 12–17 . However, genome-wide measurements of mRNA translation with isoform sensitivity at single-cell resolution have not been achieved. To address this, we deployed Surveying Ribosomal Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling (Ribo-STAMP) coupled with short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing in the brain 18 . We generated the first isoform-sensitive single-cell translatomes of the mouse hippocampus at postnatal day 25, discovering cell-type-specific translation of 3,857 alternative transcripts across 1,641 genes and identifying isoforms of the same genes undergoing differential translation within and across 8 different cell types. We defined high and low translational states in CA1 and CA3 neurons, with synaptic and metabolic genes enriched in high states. We found that CA3 exhibited higher basal translation compared with CA1, as confirmed by metabolic labelling of newly synthesized proteins and immunohistochemistry of translational machinery components. This accessible platform will expand our understanding of how cell-type-specific and isoform-specific translation drives brain physiology and disease.",

          "abstract": "Human sex ratios at birth (SRBs) shape population composition and are closely linked to maternal health and gender discrimination. In the context of environmental change, SRBs may theoretically be skewed by physiological or behavioral responses to exposure to extreme heat. However, evidence for this is limited. In this study, we estimate the effect of prenatal exposure to temperature on birth sex by linking survey data on 5 million live births in 33 sub-Saharan African countries and India with high-resolution temperature data. To distinguish between spontaneous and induced abortions, we exploit sociodemographic differentials, exposure timing, and regional differences in son preference. We find that days with a maximum temperature above 20 °C are negatively associated with male births in both regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, we observe fewer male births after high first-trimester temperature exposure, consistent with increased spontaneous abortions from maternal heat stress. This is particularly true for births by mothers in rural areas, with little formal education, and for higher birth orders. By contrast, in India, we find that second-trimester temperature exposure is associated with fewer male births, consistent with reductions in induced sex-selective abortions. As expected, these reductions are concentrated in high birth orders and older mothers. We also find large reductions in male births by sonless mothers in northern Indian states, where son preference is greater. These findings demonstrate that heat exposure harms maternal health, increases prenatal mortality, and influences family planning behavior, leading to a complex effect on SRBs.",

          "abstract": "The presence of high levels of PM 2.5 pollution is a major health threat in India. We evaluate the benefits of reducing ambient PM 2.5 and household air pollution from a 2019 baseline, when over 70% of the population of India was exposed to annual average PM 2.5 of more than 40 μg/m 3 and 56% of households burned solid fuels for cooking. We estimate the health benefits from reduced mortality that arise when lowering ambient PM 2.5 to the India standard (40 μg/m 3 ) and to two World Health Organization (WHO) interim standards (25 μg/m 3 and 15 μg/m 3 ). The benefits of the ambient standards are moderated by the high levels of household air pollution to which people are exposed due to the concavity of the exposure–response function. We therefore examine the benefits of achieving each standard paired with a 50% reduction in the percentage of households burning solid fuels. Annual mortality reductions from the combined policies exceed 300,000 lives saved for the India standard, 500,000 lives saved for the WHO 25 μg/m 3 interim standard, and 675,000 lives saved for the WHO 15 μg/m 3 interim standard. The economic benefits of each of these joint policies equal 2.2%, 3.6%, and 4.9% of Indian gross domestic product (GDP), using a Value per Statistical Life of 100 times per capita GDP. Results underscore the importance of considering household air pollution when evaluating ambient standards and the synergistic benefits of combined policies when the exposure–response function is concave.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy promotes important psychological outcomes. Although cooperation and competition are the building blocks of social interactions, little is known about how they shape feelings of autonomy in dyads, teams, and work organizations. We hypothesize that cooperation liberates relative to competition and situations that are neither cooperative nor competitive. We theorize that this effect emerges because cooperation facilitates social support and psychological safety, whereas competition promotes social threat and stress. We found support for this hypothesis in nine studies ( N total = 16,669) that used survey, archival, and experimental methods, diverse samples, and different operationalizations of cooperative and competitive environments, as well as two kinds of environments that are neither cooperative nor competitive (i.e., independence and unknown interdependence). Studies 1 to 3 found that perceived situational cooperation correlated positively with feelings of autonomy among varsity athletes and employees. Study 3 also provided initial evidence for the proposed mechanisms. To provide causal evidence, Study 4 used an incentivized decision-making task in which we experimentally created cooperative, competitive, and independent situations. Participants felt greater autonomy under cooperative vs. competitive and independent incentive structures. Study 5 found evidence for our hypothesized mechanisms in an experiment conducted in the context of negotiation. Four supplemental studies replicated our experimental findings, extended them to another incentivized decision-making task, and established the causal effect of social threat and stress on autonomy. Overall, our findings underscore the liberating effects of cooperative situations relative to competitive situations and situations that are neither cooperative nor competitive, with consequences for people’s feelings, motivation, and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Negative social ties, or “hasslers,” are pervasive yet understudied components of social networks that may accelerate biological aging and morbidity. Using ego-centric network data and DNA methylation-based biological aging clocks (i.e., DunedinPACE and age-accelerated GrimAge2) from saliva from a state representative probability sample in Indiana, we examine how negative social ties are associated with accelerated biological aging and a broad range of health outcomes, including inflammation and multimorbidity. Negative relationships are not rare within close relationships, as nearly 30% of individuals report having at least one hassler in their network. These hasslers tend to occupy peripheral network positions and are more likely to be connected through weak, uniplex ties. Importantly, exposure to negative social ties follows patterns of social and health vulnerability, with women, daily smokers, people in poorer health, and those with adverse childhood experiences more likely to report having hasslers in their networks. Having more hasslers is associated with accelerated biological aging in both rate and cumulative burden: Each additional hassler corresponds to approximately 1.5% faster pace of aging and roughly 9 mo older biological age. Moreover, not all hasslers exert the same influence; kin and nonkin hasslers show detrimental associations, whereas spouse hasslers do not. Finally, a greater number of hasslers is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes beyond epigenetic aging. These findings together highlight the critical role of negative social ties in biological aging as chronic stressors and the need for interventions that reduce harmful social exposures to promote healthier aging trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Pluralistic ignorance—the systematic misperception of others’ attitudes—can entrench suboptimal norms, yet its dynamics remain poorly understood. We develop a mathematical model of the coevolution of actions, private attitudes, and beliefs about others, with societal tightness as a central parameter. Our framework integrates theories of spirals of silence, preference falsification, and cultural mismatch into a single dynamic system capturing the effects of material payoffs, cognitive forces, and social influence. The model shows that pluralistic ignorance can arise from lags between attitude change and belief updating, even without silence or deception. Dynamics unfold faster in loose cultures and slower in tight ones: loose societies display sharp but transient peaks of pluralistic ignorance, while tight societies sustain slower, persistent mismatches. Both can experience cultural evolutionary mismatch but through distinct pathways—internalized norm adherence in loose cultures vs. conformity pressure in tight ones. These mechanisms may help explain global patterns where private support exceeds perceived support, such as climate action, women’s rights, and abortion attitudes. Interventions must therefore be culturally tailored: accelerating attitude change through highlighting benefits is effective in loose cultures, whereas lowering expression costs (via anonymity or legal protections) empowers norm entrepreneurs in tight cultures. Our framework identifies policy levers and clarifies when apparent opinion stability conceals underlying shifts, offering insights for democratic societies navigating rapid social change.",

In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells migrate through regions of tissue confinement during metastasis, causing nuclear envelope (NE) rupture, which generates heritable DNA damage and disease aggression. We sought to determine if NE rupture was intrinsic to malignant transformation and seek a mechanistic cause. We found that metastatic cells from multiple cancer subtypes have increased NE fragility in confinement compared to their benign counterparts. Meta-analysis of transcriptomic data from clinical samples of melanoma progression together with an siRNA-based live-cell confinement screen revealed that lamin B receptor (LBR) transcriptional upregulation correlates with melanoma progression and NE fragility. LBR is an inner nuclear membrane protein (INM) that scaffolds lamins and chromatin and has sterol reductase activity in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Applying superresolution and atomic force microscopies to characterize the cellular and biophysical events leading to NE rupture revealed that upregulated LBR increased nuclear deformability and can generate local ruptures of the INM, promoting blebs in the nuclear membrane that burst to release nuclear contents into the cytoplasm. Structure–function analysis showed that LBR’s sterol reductase activity is required for its promotion of NE fragility in cells confined in vitro. Use of tumor organoids and an in vivo melanoma model revealed that upregulation of LBR was associated with increased NE fragility, metastatic invasion, and decreased patient survival. Thus, upregulation of LBR in melanoma promotes nuclear deformability, while LBR’s sterol reductase activity causes fragility and instability of the nuclear membrane, and these changes in the nucleus provide a possible mechanism for increased genetic heterogeneity in melanomas.",

          "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] regulates indispensable processes such as exocytosis, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in eukaryotic cells. Since phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] has long been regarded as the primary precursor of PI(4,5)P 2 , perturbing PM PI(4)P is expected to impact the dynamics of PM PI(4,5)P 2 . Yet, recent evidence suggests that PM PI(4)P has a limited role in the synthesis and function of PI(4,5)P 2 . In this paper, we address this puzzling discrepancy by studying the collective dynamics of PM PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 . Leveraging live-cell imaging, we observed periodic traveling waves of PI(4)P on the PM of mast cells, challenging the notion that this precursor lipid is spatially homogeneous at the PM. We then found that a reduction in PM PI(4)P synthesis rate attenuated PI(4,5)P 2 oscillation amplitude while conserving the total PM density of PI(4,5)P 2 . We assessed the functional consequences of PI(4,5)P 2 oscillation amplitude by examining its interplay with Rho GTPase Cdc42, which cooperatively regulates the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton with PI(4,5)P 2 . We showed that both PM PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 oscillations are coupled to oscillations of membrane-bound active Cdc42. Finally, we demonstrated that lowering PM PI(4)P synthesis rate alone was sufficient to reversibly quench Cdc42 oscillations and to suppress F-actin oscillations. These results suggest that, beyond the steady-state regime, oscillations of PI(4,5)P 2 and its effector proteins require a critical threshold of PI(4)P flux.",

          "abstract": "The Hippo pathway, which is highly conserved from Drosophila to mammals, plays a crucial role in regulating organ size and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to various diseases, including tumors. The pathway controls the subcellular localization of the transcription coactivator Yki through core kinases Hpo and Wts, ultimately influencing the expression of target genes. Extensive studies have shown that most components in this pathway undergo posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Nevertheless, the role of acetylation in Hippo signaling is still not fully understood. In this study, we find that Hpo is subject to reversible acetylation by Nej and Hdac3, thereby regulating its stability. Loss of Hdac3 leads to an increase in the expression of Hippo target genes, which is completely rescued by overexpressing Wts, positioning Hdac3 upstream of Wts. Although Hdac3 localizes in both the cell cytoplasm and nucleus, only the cytoplasmic Hdac3 is involved in regulating the Hippo pathway, where it interacts with Hpo to deacetylate and stabilize it. Additionally, knockdown of the acetyltransferase Nej decreases the expression of Hippo target genes, a phenotype that can be reversed by simultaneously silencing Hdac3. Taken together, these findings shed light on the role of reversible acetylation in controlling the Hippo pathway and provide insights into growth regulation and potential therapeutic approaches for related diseases.",

          "abstract": "The transport of deformable self-propelling objects like bacteria, worms, snakes, and robots through heterogeneous environments is poorly understood. Here we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like robot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile of the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional potential for quantum waves introduced by Aubry and André (AA), who found that wave function localization occurs when this potential is sufficiently aperiodic. This behavior is related to the phenomenon of Anderson localization, where waves localize in the presence of a sufficiently random potential. When the boulder landscape is periodic, the robot passes through the array. But if the landscape is sufficiently aperiodic, the robot becomes trapped. The metrics we use to quantify this transition—including exponential distributions of robot position when localized—agree well with earlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that occurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical treatment of the robot’s motion using resistive force theory modified to include spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe. Further, our results indicate that the transition is generated by large fluctuations in the driving torques required for self-propulsion. These results point to an unexpected connection between the Hamiltonian mechanics of quantum and classical wave systems and the highly dissipative, continuously driven, and far-from-equilibrium dynamics of active embodied waves in nonperiodic landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Lateralization of neuronal functions plays a critical role in regulating behavioral flexibility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are challenging to establish at a single-neuron level. We previously showed that attraction of Caenorhabditis elegans to a medium-chain alcohol switches to avoidance in a uniform background of a second attractive odorant. This context-dependent behavioral plasticity is mediated by symmetric inversion of the odor-evoked response sign in the bilateral AWC olfactory neurons. Here, we show that this symmetric response plasticity is driven by asymmetric molecular mechanisms in the AWC neuron pair. Mutations in the gcy-12 receptor guanylyl cyclase abolish odor response plasticity only in AWC OFF ; the opposite odor-evoked response signs in AWC OFF and AWC ON in gcy-12 mutants result in these animals being behaviorally indifferent to this chemical. We find that gcy-12 is expressed, and required, in both AWC neurons to regulate odor response plasticity only in AWC OFF . We further show that disruption of AWC fate lateralization results in loss of asymmetry in the response plasticity in gcy-12 mutants. Our results indicate that symmetric neuronal response plasticity can arise from asymmetric underlying molecular mechanisms and suggest that lateralization of signaling pathways in defined conditions may enhance neuronal and behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, we find that their energy landscape is better represented by a connected network of inherent structures than a collection of isolated TLS. Each connection is a single energy barrier between two minima, and a network is connected if all states (minima) can be reached from any given state. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.",

          "abstract": "Cardenolides, widely distributed across multiple plant families, have long been utilized in traditional and modern medicine for treating heart failure and various cancers. Despite progress in understanding the initial steps of cardenolide biosynthesis, the evolutionary mechanisms behind the production of structurally diverse cardenolides across plant families remain poorly understood. Here, we report the genome sequence of Periploca sepium Bunge, a member of the Apocynaceae family, and identify two closely linked genes— PsCYP87 and Ps14βPH —governing sterol side-chain cleavage and C14β-hydroxylation, respectively. Although CYP87A enzymes are known to initiate cardenolide biosynthesis in other species, PsCYP87, now classified in the CYP87N subfamily, appears to have evolved independently within the Apocynaceae. Moreover, Ps14βPH contains an unusual plastid-targeting transit peptide and is specific to the family. Notably, 14β-hydroxy pregnenolone, the product of Ps14βPH, was not previously considered as a biosynthetic precursor for cardenolides. However, through gene silencing and isotope labeling experiments, we show that it functions as a precursor in P. sepium . Our findings uncover diverse evolutionary mechanisms—such as the co-opted enzyme pair, atypical subcellular localization, and enzyme convergence at the subfamily level—that underscore the remarkable ability of plants to independently evolve complex metabolic pathways for specialized metabolism. These findings also identify enzyme classes that catalyze a rare stereo-inverted hydroxylation reaction unique to cardenolide biosynthesis.",

          "abstract": "The skin epidermis is a multilayered lipid rich organ completely reliant on exogenous delivery and uptake of the essential fatty linoleate for the synthesis of acylceramides required for barrier function. Disruption of the epidermal skin barrier is a common clinical feature for prevalent diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The granulosum layer of the epidermis contains specialized secretory keratinocytes that synthesize and secrete lamellar bodies (LB), making it likely that this epidermal layer has a high demand for phosphatidylcholine. While the pathway for acylceramide biosynthesis and roles in barrier formation has been largely elucidated, the mechanisms by which keratinocytes acquire phospholipid for the demands of lipid barrier maintenance and repair are not entirely understood. Here, we demonstrate that Mfsd2a, a lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) transporter, is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes and mediates the uptake of a plasma-derived LPC fluorescent probe. Epidermal-specific deficiency of Mfsd2a in mice resulted in dermatitis and defective desquamation of the epidermis, and inducible deletion of Mfsd2a in primary mouse keratinocytes in vitro prevented their epidermal stratification. Untargeted lipidomic analysis indicated that Mfsd2a deficiency resulted in a significantly altered phospholipidome, with specific reductions in linoleic acid in phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides in the epidermis. Functional studies using primary human keratinocytes demonstrated that LPC-oleate and LPC-linoleate promoted keratinocyte differentiation in a Mfsd2a-dependent manner. Our findings identify a pathway by which keratinocytes acquire plasma-derived LPC via Mfsd2a transport for the maintenance of normal keratinocyte phosphatidylcholine pools and for optimal keratinocyte differentiation.",

          "abstract": "Hallucinated facts in large language models have recently been shown to obey a statistical lower bound determined by the monofact rate (related to the classical Good-Turing missing mass estimator) minus model miscalibration [A. T. Kalai, S. S. Vempala, “Calibrated language models must hallucinate” in Proceedings of the 56th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) (New York, NY, USA, 2024), pp. 160–171]. We present empirical investigation of this three-way relationship in classical n -gram models and fine-tuned transformer models. By generating training data from Pareto distributions with varying shape parameters, we systematically control the monofact rate and establish its positive relationship with hallucination. To bridge theory and practice, we derive an empirical analog of the hallucination bound by replacing the population miscalibration term (Section 1.1) with an empirical bin-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and confirm its practical viability. We then introduce selective upweighting—a simple yet effective technique that strategically repeats as little as 5% of training examples—to deliberately inject miscalibration into the model. This intervention reduces hallucination by up to 40%, challenging universal deduplication policies. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: selective upweighting maintains preinjection levels of accuracy while substantially reducing hallucination, whereas standard training gradually improves accuracy but fails to address persistently high hallucination, indicating an inherent tension in optimization objectives.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved a remarkable strategy to thrive in hostile environments by creating well-organized microcommunities known as biofilms. Biofilms pose a serious global health challenge due to their contribution to antibiotic resistance and suppression of the effectiveness of immune responses, thereby exacerbating pathogenic conditions. Biofilm-dwelling bacteria are difficult to eliminate since the cells are embedded within a self-produced, intricate 3D extracellular matrix composed of protein polymers (amyloids), polysaccharides, and extracellular nucleic acids. The robustness of the matrix poses a significant challenge to curb biofilm infections. Moreover, there is a lacuna in understanding how biofilm may be controlled under physiological conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the role of host proteins in keeping a check on biofilm formation. In the present study, we have established β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m), a human protein integral to innate immunity, as a potent inhibitor of biofilm formation in Escherichia coli . Our comprehensive biophysical, biochemical, computational, microscopic, and in vivo analyses revealed that β 2 m effectively prevents E. coli biofilm formation by specifically inhibiting amyloid curli, a major matrix component of E. coli biofilm. In a rat skin wound infection model, β 2 m significantly accelerated wound healing, underscoring its therapeutic potential against biofilm infections. Our results illustrate a crucial function of β 2 m as an endogenous antibiofilm and anticurli protein, provides a host-derived strategy to combat biofilm infections, and presents a method to augment existing antimicrobial therapies.",

          "abstract": "Amorphous materials driven away from equilibrium display a diverse repertoire of complex, history-dependent behaviors. One striking feature is a failure to return to equilibrium after an abrupt change in otherwise static external conditions. Instead, amorphous materials often exhibit physical aging: an ever-slowing, nonexponential relaxation that can span a huge range of timescales. Here, we examine the aging behavior of three different amorphous materials subjected to slow periodic driving. The results reveal a generic aging phenomenon characterized by a logarithmic decay of dissipation per cycle. This observation is evaluated against several mesoscopic models of amorphous matter that successfully capture aging under static conditions: i) a collection of noninteracting relaxation processes ii) a noisy hysteron model with random pairwise interactions, and iii) a structural model consisting of a random network of bistable elastic bonds. We find that only the latter model reproduces all experimental findings and relates its success to its persistent, slow exploration of a complex energy landscape with clear signatures of replica symmetry breaking. Thus, cyclic driving emerges as a simple yet powerful protocol to characterize amorphous materials, probe their complex energy landscapes, and distinguish between different models.",

However, clinical translation is limited by poor cell survival and engraftment in a hostile injury microenvironment, where detachment-induced anoikis and insufficient extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion compromise their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we engineered MSCs with surface-anchored von Willebrand factor A3 domain (vWF A3), a natural collagen-binding domain with exceptional affinity for type I and III collagen, to simultaneously confer collagen-targeting and prosurvival functionalities. The vWF A3-modified MSCs (vWF A3-MSCs) exhibited enhanced collagen-binding capacity, improving retention in myocardial infarction (MI) and osteoarthritis (OA) lesions. Beyond adhesion, vWF A3-MSCs demonstrated improved reparative capacity and anoikis resistance, driven by the activation of ECM–receptor interaction and integrin β3 signaling. These modifications promoted proangiogenic effects via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation while enhancing cell survival through Hippo pathway suppression. In vivo studies confirmed the superior therapeutic efficacy of vWF A3-MSCs in both MI and OA models, highlighting how the artificially constructed collagen-targeting receptors on cell and ECM-adhesion-targeted strategy reprogram cellular fate and enhance therapeutic efficacy in stem cell–based regenerative medicine.",

Here, we identify cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), a protein associated with a severe neurodevelopmental condition known as CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), as a critical regulator of structural plasticity at excitatory synapses. We show that CDKL5 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and in cultured neurons, forming cocondensates with PSD95. This LLPS-driven process spatially organizes synaptic components, specifically enabling the synaptic recruitment of Kalirin7 to promote dendritic spine enlargement. Pathogenic mutations disrupt condensate formation by impairing the LLPS capacity of CDKL5, directly linking phase separation defects to the pathogenesis of CDD. Our findings reveal a crucial role for CDKL5 in synaptic plasticity and establish LLPS as a fundamental mechanism by which CDKL5 coordinates molecular events to reorganize PSD architecture during synaptic remodeling.",

Shifts in plant–microbial interactions can lead to significant changes in ecosystem-level functioning. In one of the world’s longest climate change experiments, we studied the effects of 29 y of warming on a native subalpine grassland in the Rocky Mountains of North America. Warming caused a transition from herbaceous to woody-dominated vegetation, with shrubs increasing by 150% in warmed plots and a concurrent ~28% decrease in both forbs and grasses. This shift was accompanied by functional traits changing by 20% toward more conservative values relative to acquisitive ones. Consequently, plant–symbiont associations decreased with root-associated fungi—arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal and septate root colonization—both declining by 17 to 20% under warming. In turn, soil saprotrophic fungi increased by 10% with warming. Strikingly, warming decoupled above- and belowground communities and their functions. This decoupling was evident as plant–available phosphorus increased and both individual plants and plant communities reduced their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi, while plant connectedness to decomposer fungi tightened. Our results suggest that, as the planet warms, subalpine grasslands will become more conservative and desert shrubland-like in both above- and belowground properties.",

In this study, we delineate the consequences of a mutation located at a site distal to the functional region in a promiscuous acyl-CoA binding domain. A W86A mutation at a distal C-terminal segment induces two-stage noncooperative unfolding in an otherwise cooperatively unfolding protein, with the mutant exhibiting properties of a molten-globule with large equilibrium fluctuations at 310 K. Under the same conditions, NMR reveals a fourfold increase of a slow-exchanging alternate conformation in the W86A mutant, relative to the wild-type. These manifest as altered dynamic and thermodynamic coupling patterns promoting significant conformational excursions of helix 1, thus stabilizing an intermediate involving unfolded or undocked helix 1. The nonnative interactions mediated by helix 1, in turn, partially occlude the ligand-binding pocket influencing function in a chain-length-dependent manner. Further, the two-stage unfolding switches to a single transition in the W86A mutant in the presence of the ligand while simultaneously suppressing the population of the alternate conformation. Our results provide insights into how mutations could trigger long-range effects through modulation of the native ensemble properties, and the uniquely interconnected nature of the underlying molecular mechanisms.",

A computational approach reveals the collective behavior. Above a critical noise level, large jams do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the swarm’s goal attainment rate, which allows us to solve for the agent density and noise level that maximize the goals reached. Robotic experiments corroborate the behaviors observed in our simulated and theoretical results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally efficient than a planner, motivating further research into robust, decentralized navigation methods for crowded environments.

Although chronic liver inflammation and metabolic dysfunction are established contributors to tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanisms that link microenvironmental stress to malignant transformation remain poorly understood. MYCN, a proto-oncogenic transcription factor, has emerged as a potential biomarker of cancer stemness. However, its role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we elucidated the oncogenic role of MYCN and its dynamic transcriptional regulation during liver tumorigenesis. Using a hydrodynamic tail vein injection-based transposon system in mice, we demonstrated that MYCN overexpression synergizes with AKT activation to promote liver tumorigenesis. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that MYCN-driven tumors exhibited features of human HCC subtypes enriched in stress-adaptive transcriptional programs. Time-resolved spatial transcriptomics further uncovered a MYCN-enriched niche characterized by epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which expanded during tumor progression and was spatially proximate to transformed malignant cells. To translate these findings to human HCC, we developed a machine learning-based MYCN niche score and validated its clinical relevance across multiple human HCC cohorts. This score reliably predicted recurrence risk and identified EMT-prone microenvironments, with stronger predictive performance in nontumor tissues, suggesting its potential in detecting precancerous niches predisposed to de novo tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings establish MYCN as a functional driver and spatial marker of tumor-promoting microenvironments in liver tumorigenesis; additionally, we propose a clinically actionable strategy to identify high-risk patients through transcriptomic profiling of nontumor liver tissue.",

Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans .",

          "abstract": "Pathological progression in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD) initiates with an early rise in soluble amyloid-β (Aβ), preceding plaque formation and neurodegeneration. However, the molecular event triggering this initial accumulation remains unknown. We report that phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a consistent biomarker of prodromal sAD, drives Aβ production through a previously unrecognized RNA-binding function. Specifically, PHGDH binds the 3′UTR of EIF2AK1 mRNA, enabling the physical interaction between PHGDH and the EIF2AK1 protein. By facilitating the recruitment of EIF2AK1 to its substrate EIF2α, this complex drives EIF2α phosphorylation, thereby selectively promoting the translation of BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme for Aβ generation. We demonstrate that PHGDH overexpression elevates BACE1 protein and intracellular Aβ in neurons and astrocytes across mouse models and human brain organoids, independent of its canonical enzymatic or transcriptional roles. Mechanistically, this process requires a specific RNA-binding surface within PHGDH and the EIF2AK1 3′UTR. These findings define a PHGDH–EIF2AK1–EIF2α–BACE1 axis as a key driver of the earliest amyloid pathology in sAD.",

          "abstract": "The spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) change in the tropical Pacific plays a central role in shaping global climate through its influence on atmospheric circulation, rainfall, and extreme weather. Accurately simulating this pattern is critical for reliable near-term climate projections, yet persistent discrepancies between models and observations remain. While global warming is unequivocal, satellite-era observations reveal pronounced cooling in the southeastern tropical Pacific and Southern Ocean, contrary to the warming simulated by most CMIP models. These discrepancies raise concerns about the reliability of current models in projecting near-term regional climate change. Here, we present the historical simulation with the ICON coupled model at a 5 km ocean and 10 km atmosphere grid-spacing. ICON successfully reproduces the observed SST trends, including cooling in both the Southern Ocean and the southeastern tropical Pacific. Its fidelity is enabled by the direct representation of eddy heat transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar fronts and realistic stratocumulus cloud feedbacks in the subtropical southeast Pacific. These findings highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution in capturing the mechanisms of heat uptake in the eddy-rich Southern Ocean. Our results suggest a pathway for resolving long-standing biases in historical simulations and improving confidence in near-term climate projections.",

The two leading hypotheses are organic radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins and crystals of inorganic magnetic minerals such as magnetite. Here, we propose a magnetoreception mechanism that combines radical pair chemistry with magnetite nanoparticles. Instead of directly detecting the tiny dependence of a radical pair reaction on the direction of the Earth’s (~50 μT) magnetic field, this hybrid sensor uses a magnetic particle to amplify the Earth’s field. Directional information is thereby encoded in the response of nearby radical pairs to the intensity of a much stronger (~5 mT) magnetic field. The result is a magnetoreceptor with potentially 10 to 100-fold greater sensitivity than afforded by radical pairs alone.",

          "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. One common physical feature of FXS is macrocephaly, a condition typically associated with brain overgrowth and dysfunction; however, the mechanisms underlying its occurrence are unclear. Here, we uncover a role for the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) in regulating tissue growth through the Minibrain (Mnb) kinase, also known as DYRK1A, a gene up-regulated in Down syndrome and mutated in a specific form of autism. Using fly models of FXS, we find that Drosophila FMRP (dFmrp) suppresses the translation of Mnb. Loss of dFmrp leads to the up-regulation of Mnb in the developing brain, resulting in macrocephaly and brain enlargement. We find that brain overgrowth begins early in development and can be suppressed with DYRK1A inhibitors. At the cellular level, the Mnb/DYRK1A signaling pathway drives brain enlargement by inducing both neuronal hypertrophy and excessive proliferation of neural progenitors. We further demonstrate that Mnb up-regulates protein synthesis, and reducing Mnb activity or disrupting essential translational machinery restores brain size and improves locomotor coordination in the Drosophila FXS model. These data suggest that dysregulation of the Mnb/DYRK1A signaling pathway contributes to brain overgrowth and aberrant protein synthesis in FXS. More broadly, our findings highlight that neurodevelopmental disorders such as FXS, Down syndrome, and autism share disruptions in common molecular pathways.",

Given the role of spike (S) glycoprotein in mediating SL-CoV cell entry and cross-species transmission, there remains urgent need of structural information on SL-CoV S to guide therapeutic countermeasure development. Among SL-CoVs, bat-derived WIV1 is capable of using as receptor the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from a variety of mammals, thereby representing a prototype model for studying SL-CoV precursors to future pandemics. We present a WIV1 S cryo-EM structure in prefusion state which reveals molecular signatures reminiscent of the tightly-packed locked-1 conformation described for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. To decipher the molecular basis for bat SL-CoV WIV1 host range tropism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of WIV1 S-ACE2 interaction across reservoir bat, potentially intermediate hosts civet, raccoon dog and pangolin, and accidental human hosts. We found that, in all interactions, upon complex formation with ACE2, the linoleic acid responsible for locking the S receptor binding domain (RBD) dynamically persists in its binding pocket, however repositioning to potentially unlock the system. Complex formation between WIV1 S-RBD and ACE2 from different hosts was characterized in vitro by mass photometry and microscale thermophoresis, revealing that interaction is stronger with ACE2 from bat and human than other hosts, within the latter stronger for the Thr92Ile polymorphism correlated to higher SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. These findings provide critical insights with crucial implications for pandemic preparedness.",

The nematode Steinernema carpocapsae , long regarded as an ambusher, paradoxically infects the cryptic red palm weevil ( Rhynchophorus ferrugineus ), which resides deep in plant tissue. Here, we show that this contradiction stems from a context-dependent modulation of foraging-related behaviors, triggered by butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)—a host-derived volatile emitted by R. ferrugineus larvae. BHT functions as a potent behaviorally active volatile, increasing locomotion, jumping, host attraction, and infection success in S. carpocapsae . Mechanistically, BHT engages a lysosome-associated signaling pathway involving mfsd8 , SLC17A5 , and ptr . Knockdown of these genes disrupted BHT-induced behavioral changes, supporting their functional involvement.

This pipeline called Pichia–Codon language model (Pichia-CLM) was applied to the industrial host organism, Komagataella phaffii. With this approach, production of heterologous proteins was enhanced up to threefold compared to their native sequences. Furthermore, Pichia-CLM consistently yielded constructs with enhanced productivity for proteins of varied complexity, compared to commercially available tools. Finally, we showed that Pichia-CLM generates sequences resembling the properties of codon usage found in the host’s intrinsic host cell proteins and learned features such as avoiding negative cis-regulatory and repeat elements based on patterns in the genome data. These results show the potential of language models to unbiasedly learn patterns and design robust sequences for improved protein production.",

          "abstract": "Insect sociality is a major evolutionary transition based on the suppression of worker reproduction in favor of a queen’s reproductive monopoly. Although sophisticated insect societies have arisen independently on multiple occasions in the Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps), how worker sterility evolved through natural selection is not fully understood. In honey bees ( Apis mellifera ), dietary cues (royal or worker jelly) and social chemical signals (e.g., queen pheromones) promote caste differentiation by modulating the levels of juvenile hormone (JH), the key physiological orchestrator of caste determination in larvae and the maintenance of caste identity in adults. However, the precise molecular effects of JH on the ovaries of larvae and adult bees remain open questions. Here, we describe lncov1 , a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), whose expression correlates with sterility in the ovaries of larvae and adult honey bees. Mechanistically, the low JH levels in worker larvae promote high lncov1 expression in their ovaries, which subsequently show extensive programmed cell death. Moreover, lncov1 expression is tightly connected to a reduction in the reproductive capacity of adult queens and workers, as this lncRNA responds to key environmental cues that regulate fertility, including royal jelly and queen pheromone. The sequence conservation of the lncov1 gene across eusocial bees, especially the genus Apis , suggests the evolutionary stability of the JH/ lncov1 pathway. Therefore, by revealing how nutritional and social cues acting through JH and lncov1 shape queen and worker fertility in honey bees, these findings position lncRNAs as key components in the evolution of social complexity in insects.",

Given its physiological importance, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms of γ1 action. However, structural and functional studies have yielded conflicting conclusions regarding the modulation of BK channels by γ1. Here, using macroscopic, single-channel, and gating-current measurements, we demonstrate that at zero mV, γ1 increases 106-fold the equilibrium constant for the closed–open transition by destabilizing the channel’s closed state and enhancing coupling between the voltage sensor and the pore domain, without affecting voltage-sensor activation.

Because these ecosystems can be both sinks and sources of carbon to the atmosphere as environmental conditions and human influence change, the net climate mitigation potential of wetlands at regional to global scales remains uncertain. We used a data-driven approach to measure ground-based and airborne fluxes to upscale carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes using satellite-based surface reflectances at 500-m resolution across a gradient of saline to freshwater wetlands in Southern Florida, USA. Daily time series of CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from 2000 to 2024 integrated surface properties related to vegetation productivity, flooding, and disturbance, and captured 80% and 91% of the variability in annual fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 , respectively. Long-term (23-y) patterns in the fluxes of CH 4 , CO 2 , and their CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 eq) are represented as Global Warming Potential 100 (GWP100) and were shown to vary spatially with wetland management, revealing higher carbon uptake in mangroves susceptible to hurricane damage and coastal hydrology, and greater carbon emissions in freshwater sawgrass marshes where freshwater hydrology is managed for restoration. Regional net annual CO 2 eq uptake in coastal and freshwater wetlands increased by 18% from −7.0 ± 3.3 MMT CO 2 eq y −1 in ~2003 to −8.4 ± 3.8 MMT CO 2 eq y −1 in ~2020 at an uptake rate of −0.06 ± 0.01 MMT CO 2 eq y −2 .

Archaeology can benefit from multitemporal and multisensor satellite data even when direct archaeological site and feature detection is not possible by using these data to examine relationships between archaeological, ecological, and climactic variables across vast geographies. With this, archaeologists can ask questions about diverse landscape matrices and how these shaped the flow of past cultural processes. We demonstrate the value of thermal sensor data—common in satellite arrays—by developing an automated routine for analyzing Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor time series data. We fit a harmonic regression to extract amplitude and phase shift values for thousands of inland lakes in Michigan’s lower peninsula and computed perimeter-to-area ratios. Treating these thermal data not as absolute equivalents to past conditions but as relative indices, we compared lakes with and without Late Precontact (ca. 1200–1600 CE) burial mounds. Results show lakes with mounds warmed later in the spring, cooled later in the fall, and were more regularly shaped, suggesting Late Precontact communities placed mounds on lakes with specific resource benefits, including extended growing seasons. Considering our findings alongside emerging evidence for widespread precontact Indigenous agriculture in the Great Lakes region, it is important to reconsider maize’s subsistence and ceremonial significance. The analytic workflow—leveraging free, global Landsat data in Google Earth Engine—offers a replicable framework for archaeologists worldwide to integrate relative thermal patterns into cultural landscape studies.",

In neurons, GSK-3β coordinates the cytoskeleton by phosphorylating microtubule-binding proteins. In this study, we found that tight regulation of GSK-3β kinase activity is required for the maintenance of parallel microtubule bundles in Drosophila and rat axons. Up- or downregulation of GSK-3β led to axons forming pathological swellings in which microtubule bundles disintegrated into disorganized, curled microtubules. We identified the microtubule bundling proteins Shot and Tau as key GSK-3β targets and found that GSK-3β exerted its regulatory effect on microtubule bundling through them. GSK-3β regulates the ability of Shot and Tau to attach to microtubules and/or Eb1. Misregulation of GSK-3β leads to the loss of Eb1–Shot-mediated guidance of polymerizing microtubules into parallel bundles, thus causing disorganization. We propose that microtubule disorganization during both active and inactive states of GSK-3β links its hyperactivity to neurodegeneration and may explain why global GSK-3β inhibition has failed in clinical trials.",

Using a folded-plane model by applying isometry, we introduce a quantitative descriptor (angle θ ) to probe symmetry breaking in racemic compounds, directly derived from crystal symmetry and unit cell parameters. We further develop a big-data analysis tool based on coset decomposition (a method of group theory) to comprehensively examine structural data from Cambridge Structural Database.

          "abstract": "Human-induced climate change has increased wildfire risks, associated air pollution, and health damages in North America. Despite its large potential for damage, climate-induced wildfire smoke is rarely incorporated in estimates of the societal costs of climate change. We develop an integrated framework to estimate air pollution from climate-induced wildfire smoke (fine particulate matter, PM 2.5 ) and the associated mortality damage in the United States across different trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions and global mean surface temperature. Our framework accounts for fire–vegetation feedbacks by empirically estimating the effects of past fires on future burn probability. Under 3 °C of global warming (relative to 1850–1900), we estimate that smoke exposure will lead to 64,000 deaths annually in the United States (95% CI: 33,500 to 112,300; calculated using historical population), a 60% increase above estimated annual smoke deaths during 2011-2020. Limiting global warming to 2 °C reduces smoke-related mortality by 14% (8,900 deaths per year) relative to our estimate for 3 °C. For every additional tonne of CO 2 emissions in 2025, we calculate a net present value of monetized damage (i.e., a partial social cost of carbon) of $11.2 (95%CI: − $1.1 to $41.6; 2020USD) due to climate-induced wildfire smoke mortality in the United States. Incorporating wildfire smoke damages into existing nonwildfire damage estimates increases the US domestic social cost of carbon by 74%, substantially increasing the expected benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation within the United States.",

This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here, we develop an axiomatization of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimization, including brute force computer search, to optimize quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.",

          "authors": "Stephen Chrisomalis",
          "abstract": "More than 100 historically, archaeologically and ethnographically attested numerical notations have been used over the past 5,000 y; however, because most of those systems are no longer used, experimental investigation is challenging. Prior research often assumes, rather than demonstrates, the inferiority of notations like Roman numerals. Gradience is a principle whereby the length of numeral phrases correlates with the magnitude of the numbers being represented. In general, but inconsistently, larger numbers require more signs, just as larger sets of abstract dot patterns occupy more space. This study compares the gradience of 13 numerical notations varying in phylogenetic family, linguistic family, and structural properties, using two indices, inversion (how often N + 1 requires fewer signs than N) and jitter (the mean length difference between successive numbers). Place value systems are highly gradient; i.e., their length indexes numerical magnitude more accurately than other systems. The relationship between the structural properties of notations and the two indices of jitter and inversion is complex. Next, a cultural-evolutionary analysis compares the older additive Roman numerals to the eventually predominant subtractive variant (e.g., XIX = 19). Subtractive Roman numerals are more concise and have a lower jitter than additive ones, but at the cost of a significantly higher inversion ratio. This analysis permits the evaluation of cultural-evolutionary hypotheses grounded in the representational properties of attested notations, even when cognitive tests are not feasible. Several avenues for future experimental investigation using attested or constructed notations of varying properties are proposed.",

The insular cortex, a multifunctional hub buried within the Sylvian fissure, has been implicated in motor control through clinical observations and neuroimaging. Yet its precise relation to primary sensorimotor processing remains one of the least understood aspects of motor neurophysiology. To address this gap, we quantified electrophysiological changes from implanted depth electrodes in patients performing simple movement tasks combined with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) to map effective connectivity. The movement data reveal somatotopically specific representation bilaterally, as well as intereffector regions that are active for different movement types. Hand representation is centered along the contralateral ventral aspect of the middle and posterior short gyri bilaterally, while tongue/mouth tuned sites cluster in the dorsal posterior short gyrus and the dorsal long gyri. Insular activity temporally follows the primary motor cortex (M1) and precedes movement onset. SPES revealed somatotopically specific connectivity between corresponding sites in M1 and insula (hand-to-hand, tongue-to-tongue) and between bilateral insulae. These observations establish that somatotopy is a conserved property of distributed motor control incorporating the insular representations and connectivity.",

          "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) plays a crucial role in cognition via bidirectional modulation of the two major forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression (LTD). Specifically, inhibition of the ISR blocks metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD (mGluR-LTD), whereas its activation facilitates this form of synaptic depression. However, the contribution of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the best studied downstream effector of the ISR, to mGluR-LTD remains unknown. Here, we show that pharmacological activation of group I mGluRs in mouse hippocampal slices increases ATF4 protein levels without altering its transcription and concurrently downregulates the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins. Selective deletion of ATF4 in excitatory neurons impairs mGluR-LTD and prevents the downregulation of OXPHOS proteins. Notably, administration of a small molecule inhibitor of OXPHOS rescues the impaired mGluR-LTD in ATF4-depleted hippocampal slices, indicating that ATF4 regulates this type of synaptic plasticity by modulating mitochondrial function. Moreover, ATF4 deletion in excitatory neurons disrupts object-place learning, an mGluR-LTD-dependent behavior paradigm. Together, these findings reveal a role of ATF4 as a key mediator of protein synthesis-regulated synaptic depression and related behaviors.",

Using a minimal model combining counterion-only Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatics, van der Waals attraction, and Helfrich undulation, we show that ordering is governed by a self-screened electrostatic length scale, d EDL , set by particle-released counterions. When d EDL scale becomes comparable to the interlayer spacing, spacing fluctuations are suppressed and long-range orientational order is enhanced.

          "abstract": "Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked hypomyelinating disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the proteolipid protein ( PLP1 ) gene. We report a spontaneous canine dysmyelinating leukodystrophy in English Cocker Spaniel puppies. The most severely affected male pup displayed pronounced generalized tremors, progressive motor dysfunction, and markedly impaired growth. Histopathology at 5 wk of age revealed profound central nervous system (CNS) dysmyelination with no evidence of peripheral nerve involvement. Western blotting confirmed markedly reduced expression of CNS myelin-associated proteins. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated a near absence of compact myelin, rare myelinated axons, and significant oligodendrocyte abnormalities, the majority of which had an immature cellular morphology. More mature, yet infrequent oligodendrocytes had distended rough endoplasmic reticula. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a hemizygous c.92T&gt;A missense variant in the PLP1 gene predicted to cause a leucine-to-glutamine substitution in the first transmembrane domain, p.(L31Q). This variant was absent in over 1,600 public canine genomes and was predicted to be deleterious by multiple bioinformatic tools. Heterozygous females exhibited variable, transient clinical signs. We compared this canine leukodystrophy with the previously reported shaking pup and found that it represents a more severe phenotype recapitulating key clinical, pathological, and molecular features of severe connatal PMD in humans, including extreme CNS dysmyelination and associated neurological deficits. Interestingly, this genetic variant seems to cause a defect at the oligodendrocyte progenitor stage limiting subsequent oligodendrocyte maturation and preventing myelination. The identification of this naturally occurring model provides a potential resource for investigating the mechanisms and therapeutic targets for specific PLP1 genetic variants.",

          "abstract": "Ecologists use multiple approaches to decipher factors mediating the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Using closely related species, we retrospectively investigated divergence in diet and defense among seed bugs that co-occur at small spatial scales. The small milkweed bug ( Lygaeus kalmii ) primarily feeds on milkweeds (Apocynaceae) and sequesters toxic cardenolides as an antipredator defense, both traits representing the ancestral condition of Lygaeinae. Little was previously known about the false milkweed bug ( L. turcicus ); we report that the primary host of L. turcicus is false sunflower, Heliopsis helianthoides (Asteraceae), and that its seeds produce cardenolides, the second report of these toxins in Asteraceae. The dominant cardenolide was novel, which we resolved and named heliopside. We found divergent trends in performance and defense of the two bugs. L . kalmii had &gt;40% higher survival and growth on milkweeds compared to H. helianthoides , an effect that was primarily explained by H. helianthoides’ thick seed shell. Nonetheless, L. kalmii sequestered toxins equivalently from the two seed species. Conversely, L. turcicus had equally high survival and growth on the two seeds, but sequestered toxins more effectively from H. helianthoides than milkweed, potentially due to specialized detoxification of H. helianthoides’ cardenolides. Thus, adaptation to host-plant traits in these two seed bugs is asymmetric for diet and defense, and distinct constraints are likely to limit the bugs’ host ranges and contribute to coexistence. Shared seed chemistry apparently facilitated host shifts in the Lygaeinae from Apocynaceae to Asteraceae, with divergent adaptation to their food niches likely facilitating coexistence.",

          "abstract": "Scaling up solar photovoltaics (PV) is essential for global decarbonization, particularly in China—the world’s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter. Despite leading in PV installations, China has yet to widely adopt the more efficient tracking technologies for capturing solar radiation (12% adoption rate), in stark contrast to the United States (90%). To examine the rationale behind this divergence and its consequences, we develop a spatially explicit, integrated model to evaluate and compare tracking and fixed-tilt systems in China—comparing power generation, land use, cost, sustainability, and policy resilience. We find that although single-axis tracking provides electricity gains and appears technically more cost-effective, rising land prices in China could offset its benefits. Land costs increase the levelized cost of electricity by 20% for tracking systems, compared to 8% for fixed-tilt, making the latter cheaper in real-world conditions. Consequently, land-efficient fixed-tilt systems are favored, despite requiring 18 to 26% more panels for the same output—intensifying material demands. Under a 6 PWh target in 2060, current land policies would drive 59% of electricity toward fixed-tilt. Reducing soft land costs could increase the adoption of tracking systems to 63% and reduce installed capacity by up to 8% (219 GW) under the same electricity output, compared with an increasing costs scenario, but would expand land use by 35% or 12.9 thousand km 2 . Our findings underscore how land economics and policy shape renewable technology deployment. They highlight critical trade-offs between energy yield, land use, and material demand, offering insights for designing more balanced and resilient decarbonization strategies.",

The immunoregulatory mechanisms that temper this process remain poorly understood. Multipronged data on a complementary pair of murine MASH models and published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from MASH patients revealed a critical protective role for Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) in MASH. Tregs progressively accumulated in diseased livers, adopting an activated, nonlymphoid-tissue phenotype marked by expression of the transcription factor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) as well as a reparative transcriptional program. Punctual ablation of Tregs during established MASH unleashed a catastrophic inflammatory cascade, including exaggerated T-helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 responses, expansion of a pathogenic CD8 + T cell population, and hepatocellular injury. Concomitantly, Treg deficiency disrupted key metabolic pathways in the liver, accelerating disease progression. These findings establish Tregs as nonredundant custodians of both immunologic and metabolic homeostasis in the liver, highlighting their promise as targets for temporally tuned immunoregulatory therapies in metabolic liver disease.",

Yet, few studies have examined the processes shaping the evolution of the LES within species, in part, because most species occupy only a small portion of the LES. To address this gap, we took advantage of the distinct leaf economics strategies present in different ecotypes of the phenotypically diverse perennial grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) to generate a genetic mapping population, which we planted in common gardens at three sites spanning 12 degrees of latitude in the central United States. With this genetic mapping population, we evaluated two potentially interacting causes of LES evolution: 1) genetic architecture, where multiple traits are influenced by either the same gene (pleiotropy) or by genes in close physical proximity (genetic linkage), and 2) correlational selection, where selection acts on traits in combination rather than in isolation. We found that shared genetic architecture influenced covariation between photosynthetic rate ( A MASS ) and leaf nitrogen ( N MASS ) and between A MASS and leaf mass per area (LMA). We also found that correlational selection favored the trait combinations predicted by the LES (e.g., high LMA with low N MASS or low LMA with high N MASS ) and disfavored other, mismatched trait combinations at two of the three sites. Together, these results demonstrate how the evolution of an integrated LES within species can arise from multiple evolutionary causes.",

To identify mechanisms that pattern cones in the foveola, we examined human fetal retinas and differentiated retinal organoids. During development, sparse S-opsin-expressing cones are initially observed in the foveola. Later in fetal development, the foveola contains a mix of cones that either coexpress S- and M/L-opsins or exclusively express M/L-opsin. In adults, only M/L cones are present. Two signaling pathway regulators are highly and continuously expressed in the central retina: Cytochrome P450 26 subfamily A member 1 (CYP26A1), which degrades retinoic acid (RA) and Deiodinase 2 (DIO2), which promotes thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. Both CYP26A1 mutant organoids and high RA conditions increased the number of S cones and reduced the number of M/L cones in retinal organoids. In contrast, sustained TH signaling promoted the generation of M/L-opsin-expressing cones and induced M/L-opsin expression in S-opsin-expressing cones, showing that cone fate is plastic. Our data suggest that CYP26A1 degrades RA to specify M/L cones and limit S cones and that continuous DIO2 expression sustains high levels of TH to transition S-opsin-expressing cones into M/L cone fate, resulting in the foveola containing only M/L cones. Given the vulnerability of the foveola in macular degeneration and other retinal disorders, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for engineering organoids for therapeutic applications.",

          "abstract": "Enhanced plant productivity under climate warming may partially offset soil carbon losses in cold ecosystems, but this compensation depends on whether soil nitrogen (N) supply can keep pace with the increased N demand associated with accelerated plant growth. However, it remains unclear whether existing soil N supply processes are sufficient to support this rising plant N demand. Based on a unique whole-ecosystem warming experiment in the permafrost region on the Tibetan Plateau, we assess 43 variables encompassing plant N demand and soil N supply. After 2 y of warming, plant N demand significantly increases, while leaf N resorption remains unchanged, indicating a heightened reliance on external soil N inputs. Among all quantified N-supply processes, moss-associated biological N fixation is the only process that responds positively to warming, providing partial compensation for the elevated plant N demand over the two experimental years. This enhancement is associated with warming-driven changes in moss functional traits that likely expand colonization niches and increase carbon availability for diazotrophs, coupled with a warming-induced increase in the breadth and intensity of taxon-level 15 N incorporation into the DNA of N-fixing bacteria. These findings highlight that moss-associated N fixation may act as an early contributor in helping satisfy the elevated plant N demand under warming, offering insights into understanding the dynamics of vegetation productivity and permafrost carbon-climate feedback through the lens of moss–soil–microbial interactions.",

Proteomic analysis revealed that many proteins that are downstream targets of ERK signaling were upregulated by T-cadherin knockdown in myocytes. T-cadherin knockdown in myocytes or knockout in heart or skeletal muscles altered the levels of membrane proteins that are involved in signal transduction, including IGF1R and EGFR. Ablation of T-cadherin in mice was accompanied by increased ERK signaling, leading to increased cardiac hypertrophy and decreased appropriate muscle atrophy during starvation. Thus, T-cadherin, whose protein expression is maintained by adiponectin, modulates intracellular signaling and regulates cardiac and skeletal muscle homeostasis in addition to promoting exosome production by adiponectin.",

Similar isomorphic mapping of the environment is absent in most higher association areas such as the hippocampus; however, some studies have suggested that in hippocampal regions spatially tuned cells may be organized in small anatomical clusters with similar firing field locations. Here, we take advantage of the high spatial resolution provided by two-photon calcium imaging to probe the extent of local functional clustering of hippocampal place cells in freely moving mice. Almost one thousand highly packed CA1 neurons were recorded simultaneously per mouse while they foraged freely in open arenas. Among pairs of place cells, there was no relation between preferred firing position and anatomical proximity. Firing fields were no more similar for nearest neighbors than distant cell pairs. When place cells remapped between different arenas, there was no tendency for correlations in one environment to be transferred to the other. A similar lack of relationship between function and anatomical position was expressed in CA1 cells with firing fields tuned to local objects in the environment. The findings suggest that the encoding of location in CA1 place cells is likely fully nontopographical.",

          "abstract": "Straw return reshapes the biogeochemical processes in paddy soils by driving microbial transformation of key elements. Despite growing awareness of these individual processes, the integration of these processes under millimeter-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains unclear. Combining high-resolution geochemical profiling with multiomics, we revealed that straw addition altered the depth-dependent dynamics of arsenic, carbon, and nitrogen, establishing a sophisticated three-layer microbial stratification. We identified 1) an 18 mm organic matter (OM)-rich layer extending from the straw layer, which serves as a methanogenic epicenter co-occurring with active nitrogen fixation microbes; 2) an overlying layer dominated by aerobic methane oxidation and denitrification microbes; and 3) a deeper substraw layer dominated by anaerobic arsenite oxidation and denitrification microbes. Significantly positively correlated abundances of transcribed mcrA with nifH genes and pmoA or aioA / arxA with denitrification genes were identified. Corroboratively, intensified co-occurrence patterns of mcrA with nifH , pmoA with denitrification, and aioA / arxA with denitrification genes were observed in the OM-rich, upper, and lower layers, respectively. Moreover, the co-occurred mcrA - nifH and aioA - nirS / arxA - narG genes in different metagenome-assembled genomes presented 80.6 to 260.8- and 1.55 to 6.85-fold greater transcriptional activity in the OM-rich and lower layers than in the other layers, respectively. Our results demonstrated that straw incorporation established a dynamic soil redox zone, restructuring millimeter-scale microbial networks and promoting potentially coupled denitrification with arsenite or methane oxidation, as well as methanogenesis with nitrogen fixation. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for optimizing subsurface straw placement and nitrate application to enhance nutrient cycling and mitigate environmental risks.",

To investigate its role, we generated a ∆3’UTR mouse line by deleting the Grin2b 3’UTR while preserving the coding sequence. Despite unchanged Grin2b mRNA levels in ∆3’UTR mice, GluN2B protein was reduced 50%. In wildtype (WT) mice, Grin2b mRNA was enriched in synaptosomes, but this enrichment was impaired in ∆3’UTR mice along with reduced GluN2B phosphorylation. Notably, ∆3’UTR mice had no long-term potentiation (LTP) and exhibited hippocampal-dependent spatial learning impairments. Together, these findings demonstrate that the 3’UTR is critical for Grin2b mRNA function, ultimately influencing synaptic composition and plasticity.",

Previous observational searches for the formation boundary were hampered by the lack of large unified samples of wide-orbit giant planets and substellar companions. A combined analysis of radial velocity and astrometry mitigates this problem and has significantly enlarged the sample. Here, we present a rigorous statistical analysis of the sample of 55 giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions orbiting FGK stars. We quantitatively analyze the occurrence rates of brown dwarfs and identify a distinct brown dwarf desert at approximately 30 M J , with no evidence of disappearance up to 20 au. Unlike previous studies that predicted a declining planet occurrence rate beyond the water-ice line, we identify a population of giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs in this region. The metallicity and eccentricity trends in our sample suggest that these are the consequences of two different formation scenarios. Our combined population synthesis model successfully accounts for the observed brown dwarf desert, supporting the dual formation hypothesis.",

Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method for obtaining this critical information. However, cryo-ET studies are challenging and often limited to a small number of cell types per study. Here, we collate cryo-ET data from hundreds of cells and tissues across the biosphere to i) identify emerging methodological trends, ii) pinpoint strategies to reduce imaging time and costs, iii) quantitatively compare methods for cell freezing and sectioning, and iv) census cryo-ET species coverage across all domains of life. Comparing the fraction of cellular material within a single lamella across all domains of life reveals an order of magnitude difference between eukaryotes (1%) compared to bacteria (9%) and archaea (14%). We calculate the fraction of cellular material which can be imaged using distinct sectioning methods on multicellular communities and tissues—identifying serial lift-out as a powerful approach for obtaining more complete cellular depictions. Finally, we show that the biodiversity of current cryo-ET studies is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than in sequence libraries and 4 to 5 lower than the total predicted on Earth. Our analyses reveal major evolutionary lineages which remain critically understudied and highlight where future cryo-ET research would be most impactful.",

While some genetic mechanisms underlying such traits have been identified, the role of physical properties of cellular and extracellular components remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the evolution and development of the bulbus arteriosus (BA)—a teleost-specific, smooth muscle-rich heart outflow tract—is regulated by the mechanical properties of its extracellular environment. Specifically, we demonstrate that the teleost-specific extracellular matrix gene elastin b confers the uniquely low stiffness of the BA. In contrast to the BA, the homologous organ in nonteleost actinopterygians, the conus arteriosus (CA), and the ventricle are predominantly composed of cardiomyocytes and exhibit higher extracellular stiffness. Loss of elastin b function by knockdown or knockout leads to ectopic cardiomyocyte formation in the BA, accompanied by increased extracellular stiffness comparable to that of the ventricle. Furthermore, artificial stiffening of the BA extracellular environment is sufficient to induce ectopic cardiomyocyte differentiation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that extracellular stiffness governs cell fate determination and highlight its role in the emergence of evolutionary novelties in the teleost heart.",

          "abstract": "Erythroid progenitors undergo dynamic morphological changes and robust heme biosynthesis during differentiation. Zinc is essential for erythropoiesis, yet the mechanisms linking zinc availability to heme biosynthesis and anemia risk remain unclear. This study aimed to define zinc-responsive pathways in differentiating erythroid progenitors and to evaluate the translational relevance of SLC39A10 ( ZIP10 ) genetic variants to hematological health. To elucidate the molecular basis of zinc’s role in erythropoiesis, we performed transcriptomic profiling of zinc-restricted G1E-ER4 cells during differentiation and compared it to iron chelation and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase inhibition. Zinc deficiency uniquely enriched genes involved in not only heme biosynthesis but cellular maintenance functions. Zinc restriction caused a marked suppression of Alad transcript abundance, impairing the first enzymatic step of cytosolic heme biosynthesis. Notably, Slc39a10 ( Zip10 ) was the only zinc transporter strongly induced by zinc deficiency, independent of iron status. Loss of ZIP10 exacerbated zinc depletion, further reduced Alad expression, and diminished heme output, highlighting its role as a compensatory importer during zinc scarcity. GWAS database analyses revealed that SLC39A10 variants are significantly associated with hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and iron deficiency anemia risk. Together, ZIP10 safeguards erythroid zinc homeostasis and heme synthesis under limiting zinc conditions. Genetic variation in SLC39A10 may heighten sensitivity to zinc deficiency, providing a potential nutrigenetic marker for anemia risk. These findings establish a mechanistic and translational basis for genotype-guided precision nutrition strategies to improve hematological health.",

Eutectic gallium–indium, a type of liquid metal, serves as both the deformable electrode for capacitive sensors and a low-resistance conductor for inductors. It is integrated into a thin-film, battery-free, inductive-capacitive wireless sensing platform. Scalable wireless sensor arrays are created through microfabrication for large-area pressure mapping. The wireless pressure sensor is also integrated with soft ferromagnetic and self-healing layers in cuff-type sensors to allow for autonomous folding in response to external magnets, eliminating the need for suturing. In addition, a miniaturized wearable readout system integrated into medical gloves enables wireless and real-time pressure monitoring. The presented wireless soft pressure-sensing method with large-area mapping and secure implantation capabilities offers alternatives to conventional medical tools for intraoperative monitoring and examinations.",

Currently, many computational efforts seek to elucidate the conformational ensembles of these disordered proteins, yet most methods still struggle to fully capture their structural diversity. Here, we integrate structural libraries of various IDRs—derived from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning models—with experimental chemical shifts obtained from NMR spectroscopy. Through a maximum entropy reweighting approach, we obtain reliable ensembles that more accurately reflect observed chemical shifts and reveal transient states. Our results highlight the importance of comprehensive sampling strategies for capturing diverse conformational states. Furthermore, we show that these weighted ensembles faithfully track conformational rearrangements under various conditions such as temperature, mutational effects, and environment, which are not fully captured by experiments alone. This approach provides a dataset encompassing each IDR’s specific structures along with their weights, offering a foundation for systematically exploring IDR structural landscapes, refining our understanding of their functional roles, and shedding light on processes related to misfolding and aggregation.",

          "abstract": "Mycolic acids (MAs) are the major component of the mycobacterial outer membrane, a key contributor to the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to external insults including multiple antibiotics. After being synthesized in the cytoplasm and before reaching the outer membrane, MAs are transported across the inner membrane in the form of an acylated sugar, generally believed to be trehalose monomycolates (TMMs). Whether trehalose is the only mycolate carrier during transport is under debate, and why this highly abundant disaccharide is essential for mycobacterial growth is unclear. To address these questions, we leveraged a trehalose auxotrophic Mycobacterium smegmatis strain to investigate the biosynthetic steps affording TMMs. We show that in addition to TMMs, mature MAs are also not produced in the absence of intracellular trehalose. This is likely due to a product inhibition mechanism where unreduced MA precursors accumulate on Pks13, the protein catalyzing the ligation of mycolic acids and the sugar head group. We establish that the unreduced mycolates could only be released by trehalose, revealing exquisite Pks13 specificity, and subsequently reduced by CmrA in vitro. Furthermore, only trehalose and its analogs can reactivate MA biosynthesis in cells. Finally, by replacing trehalose with a 6-deoxy analog in cells, we demonstrate that the cord factor trehalose dimycolate is dispensable for M. smegmatis growth in vitro. Our work gives a clear depiction of how TMMs are formed and provides a compelling reason for the essentiality of trehalose, shedding light on the development of future antimycobacterial strategies.",

However, differences in the cycling rates of carbon and other nutrients may impact the long-term response to ocean fertilization. In this study, we use a steady-state global biogeochemical inverse model, optimized to match hydrographic observations, to examine how differential production, remineralization, and circulation-driven re-exposure timescales of organic carbon and phosphorus affect long-term carbon sequestration. We partition global organic matter production based on the time required for regenerated carbon and phosphorus to return to the ocean surface. We find that less than 15% of total organic carbon and 31% of total organic phosphorus production remains sequestered in the ocean interior for ≥ 1 y, with only 3.3% (1.8 Pg C y −1 ) and 8.3% (0.046 Pg P y −1 ), respectively, remaining for a century or longer. The C:P ratio of the sequestration flux declines with increasing residence time, from 255:1 for total production to 98:1 for material sequestered for 100+ years, indicating that carbon is recycled to the surface more rapidly than phosphorus. This decoupling between carbon and phosphorus sequestration timescales could result in a “productivity hangover,” where the slow recovery of surface phosphate leads to a long-term suppression of global productivity, reducing the net removal of atmospheric CO 2 .",

This study demonstrated both the stability of epigenetic inheritance across generations and demonstrated a generational increase incidence of disease pathology. Building on this research, the present study follows the same lineage of rats with ancestral vinclozolin exposure through twenty generations. The findings offer important insights into long-term mammalian models of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance. Observations demonstrate an increase in differential DNA methylated regions across multiple generations. This indicates a persistent and stable transmission of epigenetic alterations. Additionally, deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) transferase-mediated nick end labeling apoptosis assays revealed elevated levels of germline apoptosis in the male rats of the maternal and paternal lineages. This suggests a potential consequence of epigenetic dysregulation in spermatogenesis. Ancestrally exposed rats to vinclozolin showed significant parturition abnormalities in both the maternal and paternal lineages after 16 generations. This included maternal deaths during labor and stillbirths. Pathological assessments revealed abnormalities across multiple tissue types and an increased incidence of disease. This suggests the physiological consequences of the generational stability of epigenetic inheritance. Observations establish the generational stability of epigenetic inheritance over twenty generations in a mammalian model system; however, new pathology in later generations involving parturition abnormalities was also observed. The generational stability of transgenerational effects observed in this study has implications for human health, particularly regarding environmental toxicant exposures, reproductive health disorders, and disease susceptibility.",

          "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is one of the most immediate and substantial threats to biodiversity, generating isolated populations with reduced genetic diversity. Genetic monitoring has become essential for detecting fragmentation and tracking its progress. However, the coherent interpretation of genetic monitoring data and understanding the genetic consequences of fragmentation require frameworks that accurately represent real-world complexity. Existing theoretical frameworks typically rely on simplified spatial structures and do not adequately capture the heterogeneous migration patterns of natural populations. Here, we integrate network theory and mathematical population genetics to develop a framework for studying the genetic consequences of fragmentation processes, explicitly accounting for heterogeneous connectivity and temporal dynamics. We apply this framework to examine how different fragmentation processes affect genetic measures commonly used in genetic monitoring. Through analysis of simulated and empirical networks, we find that different fragmentation scenarios produce substantially distinct trajectories in key genetic measures, sometimes exhibiting rapid transitional dynamics. Furthermore, fragmentation can cause deviations from classical theoretical expectations, such as the expected correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation-by-distance) or between genetic diversity and connectivity. Finally, we propose and demonstrate detectable early warning signals in genetic monitoring data that precede rapid transitional phases. Our framework thus provides a practical interpretation of genetic monitoring data, and a proof-of-concept that bridges the gap between idealized theoretical models and real-world connectivity dynamics.",

First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and outnumbered parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with findings on potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large-amplitude NS cell class in layer 4b was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms suggestive of a stellate morphology, a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons projecting from V1 to MT. Third, another NS cell class in layer 4b showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis revealed distinct feedforward interactions between cell classes in layer 4 and layer 5/6 and those in layer 2/3. These results demonstrate how high-resolution electrophysiology can reveal links between laminar organization and in vivo function of neurons. Our findings offer key insights for biologically realistic microcircuit models of primate V1 and may generalize to other regions.",

          "abstract": "In prokaryotes, CorA is the primary influx pathway for magnesium, a critical divalent cation in cellular physiology and biochemistry. Mechanistic studies show that homopentameric CorA is regulated through an intracellular [Mg 2+ ]-dependent negative feedback loop, involving the asymmetric participation of individual subunits. To understand the connection between asymmetry and activation, we used single-particle cryo-EM to solve sixteen structures of nanodisc-reconstituted CorA. We utilized conformation-specific synthetic antibodies to stabilize subtle but significant conformational differences in the cryo-EM structures. Our results demonstrate that CorA exists as a set of conformational ensembles, where population size inversely correlates with intracellular Mg 2+ concentration. These ensembles include channels with a variety of pore conformations, both constricted and dilated, suggesting a spectrum of active CorA functional states. The ensembles connect asymmetric structural transitions in the cytoplasmic domain with conformational changes in the permeation pathway via an electrostatic network, ultimately controlling channel-gating events. We believe that these results establish a framework for understanding magnesium homeostasis in prokaryotic systems.",

As in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in quantum chemistry, correlated materials, atomic physics, molecular dynamics, and quantum sensing.",

In this work, we present a multiscale theoretical framework that integrates density functional theory (DFT), machine-learning-accelerated cluster expansions, and kinetic and Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations to predict the structural evolution and ORR activity of octahedral Pt–Cu nanoparticles under acidic conditions. Our model captures the configurational complexity of experimentally relevant (4 to 10 nm) particles and reveals that disordered Pt 0.85 Cu 0.15 nanoparticles exhibit optimal mass activity near 5 nm and a saturated specific activity plateau at ~6 nm, driven by the high density of catalytically active Pt(111) terrace sites. We further identify a size-dependent crossover in catalytic performance between ordered and disordered Pt–Cu particles, governed by subsurface atomic ordering and the distribution of *OH binding energies. These findings provide mechanistic insights and design strategies for tailoring surface and subsurface structure to enhance the catalytic efficiency of alloy nanocatalysts.",

Here, we demonstrate that the stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) deploys effector Hasp170 (one haustorial secreted protein) to subvert wheat immunity by directly disrupting host LLPS. Hasp170 targets the intrinsically disordered region (IDR1) of the wheat nuclear protein TaPSTE (phase separation protein targeted by effector), which forms LLPS-dependent biomolecular condensates. Within these condensates, TaPSTE recruits the transcription factor TaNF-YC, thereby activating the expression of genes driving reactive oxygen species burst and Ca 2+ influx, key components for disease resistance. By binding TaPSTE’s IDR1, Hasp170 impairs condensate formation and prevents TaNF-YC recruitment, consequently suppressing host immunity and facilitating fungal parasitism. This reveals a virulence strategy where pathogens directly manipulate host biomolecular condensates to evade immune responses.",

While the results were highly promising, a subset of patients omitting initial cystectomy developed recurrence highlighting the need for biomarkers to refine selection of patients for this approach. We here report long-term follow-up of these patients and investigate whether tumor DNA in the plasma (ctDNA) or urine (utDNA) could inform prognosis and the need for cystectomy. Three-year bladder-intact survival among patients with a complete clinical response following four rounds of systemic therapy was 69%. Metastatic risk was significantly higher for patients with detectable versus undetectable ctDNA presystemic therapy (HR 4.68; 95% CI 1.10-43.35; log-rank P = 0.036). Only 4.5% (1 of 22) of patients with undetectable baseline ctDNA developed metastatic disease. Undetectable ctDNA before or after systemic therapy was associated with extremely low metastatic risk. Urine utDNA was more sensitive than plasma ctDNA at detecting residual disease within the bladder, and detectable urine utDNA in patients with a complete clinical response was associated with shorter bladder-intact survival (HR 6.47, 95% CI 1.34-31.31; log-rank P = 0.008).

Wolves from more urbanized areas showed reduced fear at first exposure to an object but heightened caution when the object changed, indicating increased attention to environmental changes, rather than uniform fear reduction. By contrast, playbacks of human voices elicited strong fear responses (&gt;80%), regardless of urbanization. However, individuals habituated to both stimuli quickly and at a similar pace, highlighting their rapid learning abilities. Sociality buffered fear, with wolves in groups reacting less fearfully than wolves alone.

Consequently, understanding the genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his lineage has long been of both academic and public interest, especially concerning the hypothesized association of his Y-chromosome with haplogroup C3*. Here, we present ancient DNA data from four archaeological individuals—three males and one female—from medieval elite mausoleums of the Golden Horde in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. Our genomic analyses reveal that the three male individuals are paternally related and share the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, confirming the association between the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3* and the Mongol Empire, supporting the long-standing hypothesis about the genetic legacy of Mongols. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the Golden Horde elites primarily derive their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA), with an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population, e.g., the Kipchaks. Archaeological evidence, in turn, sheds light on a medieval population undergoing religious and cultural transition, offering insights into the societal changes experienced by Mongolian conquerors. Furthermore, through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network, we successfully identify medieval relatives of these individuals on the Mongolian Plateau, linking genetic data to broader population dynamics. In essence, this study provides ancient DNA evidence that advances our understanding of the genetic background of the Mongolian elites and the population dynamics in Central Eurasia.",

A single intravenous injection of this LNP system efficiently and transiently engineers T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells across the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood, yielding a synergistic, multilineage antitumor response. Using human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a CAR target, we demonstrate that repeated administration of LNP formulated with HER2-CAR mRNA (LNP-panCAR HER2 ) effectively inhibits tumor growth and prolongs overall survival in three murine syngeneic xenograft tumor models, without causing obvious side effects. Immune profiling of treated tumors reveals a remodeled TME with a shift toward an immunostimulatory phenotype, characterized by reduced M2-like macrophages and an increased presence of effector T cell subsets.

We determine the global ISAR for native (Nat Rich ) and for single-island endemic richness (SIE Rich ) of vascular plants, employing data for 1,262 islands, spanning 60.7S to 80.7 N and ten orders of magnitude in area. Using logged species number and area, we compared the power model and four different breakpoint models. For Nat Rich , a simple power model (slope, z = 0.32, R 2 = 66%) was best supported. For SIE Rich , a flat-steep breakpoint model outperforms the power model, with the latter producing a steeper slope ( z = 0.48, R 2 = 0.47) than for Nat Rich . Rerunning the Nat Rich power model for subsets of islands of increasing endemism generates increased ISAR slope and improved prediction of continental richness values. Controlling for island area, Nat Rich declines with isolation, while endemism increases. Semilog analyses show that old, tropical, mountainous continental fragments and landbridge islands, rich in SIE, drive an accelerated increase in Nat Rich for islands &gt;10,000 km 2 in size. The global Nat Rich archipelago species–area relationship was best described by a power model ( z = 0.41, R 2 = 0.54), and there is also evidence of declining richness but higher endemism with increased archipelago isolation. Our findings provide no support for the existence of an upper asymptote in the global plants ISAR, while supporting the application of the power model at a global scale, and highlighting roles for island type, endemism, and isolation as influences on ISAR form.",

These mechanisms are fundamental to plant sexual reproduction and offer valuable insight into the molecular basis of cell–cell communication and self-recognition more broadly. Here, we leverage an independent evolution of SI in the lineage containing Phlox (Polemoniaceae) to identify the gene causing self-pollen recognition which we name Phlox drummondii Pistil Identity Receptor Kinase ( PdPIRK ). Recognition of self-pollen associates with a single genomic region containing the Phlox S -locus. We generate predictions regarding how S -loci must function and evolve to identify a single candidate gene within this S -associated region. This gene, PdPIRK , is highly and specifically expressed in the pistil and has exceptionally high polymorphism maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, two hallmarks of self-pollen recognition genes. Functional validation with gene silencing confirms that PdPIRK is necessary for self-incompatibility, and we further demonstrate allele-specific activity, confirming its role in self-pollen recognition per se. PdPIRK encodes a G-type lectin receptor-like kinase, which is a member of the same gene family as SRK , the gene controlling self-pollen recognition in the distantly related Brassicaceae.

          "abstract": "The Quaternary Period (the last 2.58 Ma) was characterized by the waxing and waning of large ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Using sediment sequences from the Iberian Margin, we demonstrate that expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets around 2.7 Ma was accompanied by the emergence of millennial climate variability (MCV) during glacial periods. The onset of MCV at ~2.7 Ma was heralded by isolated precursor events, followed by multiple millennial climate oscillations at ~2.5 Ma. These events coincided with deposition of ice-rafted detritus in the North Atlantic, suggesting a role for marine-terminating ice sheets. Once established, MCV became an intrinsic feature of glacial climates of the Quaternary. Our findings underscore the profound impact Northern Hemisphere glaciation had on climate variability across multiple time scales.",

This is in stark contrast to 5 years earlier when the US still topped the ranking—but China’s surge was becoming apparent. The rapid change indicates that a remodeling of the US science ecosystem is warranted, including the creation of new paths to earning PhDs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, if the United States is to cultivate a much needed, highly skilled scientific workforce.",

In addition, the vaccine protected mice from other viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS, SCH014 coronavirus), bacteria ( Acinetobacter baumannii ), and allergens. Protection was mediated by persistent ovalbumin-specific CD4 + and CD8 + memory T cells that imprinted alveolar macrophages (AMs), enhancing antigen presentation and antiviral immunity. Following infection, vaccinated mice mounted rapid pathogen-specific T cell and antibody responses and formed ectopic lymphoid structures in the lung. These results reveal a class of “universal vaccines” against diverse respiratory threats.",

To explore the origin of this association, and whether it is unique to humans, we tested the bouba-kiki effect in baby domestic chickens ( Gallus gallus ). As a precocial species, chicks can be tested shortly after hatching, allowing us to control their pretest experiences. Similar to humans, both 3-day-old [Experiment 1 (Exp. 1)] and 1-day-old (Exp. 2) chicks spontaneously choose a spiky shape when hearing the “kiki” sound and a round shape when hearing the “bouba” sound. Results from naïve young animals suggest a predisposed mechanism for matching the dimensions of shape and sound, which may be widespread across species.",

Proofreading is typically assumed to evolve when selection for fidelity outweighs costs in energy and the speed of replication. We show that when stalling after misincorporations is accounted for, proofreading can instead speed up replication. Consistent with data on polymerase mutagenesis, our results suggest that proofreading can evolve under selection for speed alone. We generalize to multicomponent self-assembly and show that analogous error-correcting processes, such as dynamic instability, can likewise emerge purely from selection for rapid assembly. Thus, nonequilibrium error correction can evolve from selection for speed, even without direct fidelity advantages. We discuss implications for mutation-rate evolution, molecular assembly processes, and models of early life.",

In this work, we show that the filamentous hemagglutinin FhaB adhesin of Bordetella carries a C-terminal microtubule-binding domain (FhaB-CT), which is translocated into host cells to promote colonization. FhaB-CT delivery is required to occupy a niche at the base of cilia in airway epithelia, and mutant bacteria lacking this domain are defective for nasal colonization. These observations suggest that FhaB-CT is transferred into motile respiratory cilia to interact with core axonemal microtubules. We propose that Bordetella adheres initially to the tips of cilia and then deploys multiple FhaB adhesins to migrate to the base of the cilia forest, where the bacteria resist removal by the mucociliary “escalator” that normally clears the respiratory tract of microbes.",

Like 1952, the 2025 event nucleated at the northeastern end of the rupture, preceded by intense foreshock activity. Joint inversion of teleseismic and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for the space-time slip distribution, with validation by means of forward modeling of deep-water tsunami recordings, revealed a southwestward elongated large-slip patch on the curved plate boundary. A slip of up to 14 meters was located offshore southern Kamchatka and Paramushir Island. The 1952 earthquake generated stronger tsunami signals in Hawaii, indicating a different slip distribution. Peak slip in 2025 exceeded the maximum slip deficit accumulated since 1952. Observations of volcanic eruptions after multiple great earthquakes in Kamchatka provide compelling evidence of earthquake-volcano interactions.",

We implanted tissue-like, stretchable electronics during organogenesis of human pancreatic organoids, enabling months-long, single cell–resolved electrophysiology. Longitudinal single-cell tracking suggested that improved hormone responsiveness reflects increasing activity of SC-α and -β cells with low and high basal firing, linked to induction of energy and hormone metabolism genes. Daily metabolic entrainment showed that circadian hormone secretion rhythms reflect daily oscillation of SC-α and -β electrical characteristics, tied to induction of cell-cell communication and exocytic gene networks, revealing circadian coordination of cell-level, stimulus-coupled responses. Lastly, we showed that electrical stimulation, via implanted actuators, enhances SC-α and -β glucose responsiveness.

However, upstream circuit mechanisms modulating these oscillations and the extent of the oscillations’ role in empathy-related behaviors remain elusive. We found that in mice, ACC theta oscillations are involved in empathy-driven prosocial allogrooming. Moreover, orexinergic neurons are selectively activated in the ACC during observational fear and prosocial allogrooming, but only when the animals had prior fear experience. Real-time, gaze-dependent optogenetic inhibition of lateral hypothalamic orexinergic inputs to ACC suppressed theta power and reduced both behaviors. These findings show that hypothalamic orexinergic inputs drive ACC theta oscillations to modulate observational fear and prosocial behaviors, providing circuit-level insight into how affective empathy translates into prosocial action.",

Building on advances in feature learning, we developed an approach for extracting linear representations of semantic notions or concepts in AI models. We showed how these representations enabled model steering, through which we exposed vulnerabilities and improved model capabilities. We demonstrated that concept representations were transferable across languages and enabled multiconcept steering. Across hundreds of concepts, we found that larger models were more steerable and that steering improved model capabilities beyond prompting. We showed that concept representations were more effective for monitoring misaligned content than for using judge models.

We found that in some mammalian cells, including neurons, stress also resulted in the formation of inactive ribosome-ribosome clusters (disomes). We used cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize ribosomes in situ and observed that this ribosome dimerization was mediated by a homotypic interaction of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expansion segment ES31Lb. ES31Lb interactions were both necessary and sufficient for disome formation and conferred a growth advantage and stress resistance to brain cells. ES31Lb is predicted to homodimerize in ~20% of chordates, including variants in both chicken and human. Cryo-ET analysis of chicken tetrasomes revealed an interaction between ES31Lb and ES9La.

          "abstract": "People are influenced by the choices of others, a phenomenon observed across contexts in the social and behavioral sciences. Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet, several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock in. Here, we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the “marginal majority effect”: a discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of a marginal majority effect in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.",

Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010, Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED), healthful Plant-based Diet Index (hPDI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DRRD) were associated with lower all-cause mortality and longer life expectancy, with DRRD showing slightly stronger associations than hPDI. Compared with the bottom quintile, achieving the top quintile of dietary scores was associated with 1.9 to 3.0 years of life gained at 45 years in men and 1.5 to 2.3 years in women. The life gained was longest in DRRD for males and AMED for females. The significant associations remained when accounting for genetic susceptibility. Our findings underscore the advantages of healthy dietary patterns in prolonging life expectancy, regardless of longevity genes.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic strength and plasticity are fine-tuned by neuromodulation and use-dependent second-messenger signaling. Presynaptic diacylglycerol (DAG), Ca 2+ , and Ca 2+ -calmodulin signaling converge on the essential synaptic vesicle (SV) priming protein Munc13-1 via its regulatory C 1 , C 2 B, and CaM-binding domains. Using brainstem-specific heterozygous mice expressing a DAG-binding-deficient Munc13-1 variant (Munc13-1 H567K ), we compared synaptic transmission in situ at glutamatergic calyx of Held synapses carrying either a single Munc13-1 H567K or a single Munc13-1 wt allele. Munc13-1 H567K/− synapses show enhanced initial strength but impaired steady-state release and slower recovery from depression. These deficits result from an increased initial abundance of fully primed SVs and a loss of activity-dependent acceleration of SV priming. Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is strongly reduced in Munc13-1 H567K/− synapses and either increased or attenuated by C 2 B mutations that enhance or weaken Ca 2+ -phospholipid binding. Our data identify Munc13-1 as a target of presynaptic TrkB–phospholipase C–γ signaling and demonstrate that C 1 and C 2 B domain-dependent regulation of Munc13-1 determines synaptic strength and shapes short-term plasticity and PTP.",

How these shifts combine to alter higher-level ecological processes within food webs can have important implications for entire ecosystems. However, the strength and direction of these shifts will depend on combinations of ways that species and trait compositions change through time. We combine long-term data from ~15,000 freshwater and marine fish communities (1949–2019) with information about their size, diets, and trophic status to evaluate how food webs change through time at local spatial scale. We found that selective species turnover driven by body size reductions is associated with widespread alteration to fish food web topology and function, including increased connectance and generalism, leading to higher predation pressure and increased prey vulnerability. Food webs were also less modular. These changes extend across food web trophic structures, causing a cascading shift in the proportion of species across trophic levels. Our study highlights complex biodiversity responses to confluent changes across multiple facets.",

Here, we identify elongation of very-long-chain fatty acid protein 6 (Elovl6) as a critical regulator in CRC progression. Clinical data reveal significant down-regulation of Elovl6 in colon cancer tissues, with low expression levels correlating with unfavorable patient prognosis. We demonstrate that Elovl6 exerts potent tumor-suppressive effects, significantly inhibiting cellular proliferation in vitro and attenuating tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, it maintains intestinal microbial homeostasis by preventing the expansion of opportunistic pathogens while simultaneously orchestrating metabolic reprogramming through modulation of phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. Notably, we find that stearic acid, a key Elovl6-derived metabolite, promotes mitochondrial fusion by stabilizing mitofusin 1 protein. These findings not only position Elovl6 as a promising therapeutic target but also suggest that dietary supplementation with stearic acid could represent a viable strategy for CRC prevention and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Microglia critically shape neuronal circuit development and function, yet their region-specific properties and roles in distinct circuits of the human brain remain poorly understood. In this study, we generated region-specific brain organoids (cortical, striatal, and midbrain), each integrated with human microglia, to fill this critical gap. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABA B receptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism. Using chemogenetics to activate this midbrain-striatal circuit, we observed increased calcium signaling in microglia involving GABA B receptors. Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring an SCN2A nonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Microglia displayed heightened calcium responses to SCN2A mutation–mediated neuronal hyperactivity and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed not only by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABA B receptors but also by knockout of the GABBR1 gene in microglia. Collectively, our findings establish an advanced platform that can be used to dissect human neuroimmune interactions in subcortical regions and to evaluate previously undiscovered therapies, highlighting the important role of microglia in shaping critical circuitry related to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Unfortunately, two-dimensional (2D) histopathology—the gold standard for pathological understanding of many liver diseases—can misrepresent or leave gaps in our understanding of complex 3D structural features. Here, we used immunostaining, tissue clearing, microscopy, and computational software to create 3D multilobular reconstructions of both nonfibrotic and cirrhotic human liver tissue. We found that spatial architecture in human cirrhotic liver samples with varying etiologies had sinusoid zonal dysregulation, reduction in glutamine synthetase–expressing pericentral hepatocytes, regression of central vein networks, disruption of hepatic arterial networks, and fragmentation of biliary networks, which together suggest a pro-portalization/decentralization phenotype in cirrhotic tissue. Further implementation of 3D pathological analyses may provide a deeper understanding of cirrhotic pathobiology and inspire treatments for liver disease.",

In Arabidopsis , one of them, F-BOX-LIKE17 (FBL17), stands out for playing a key role in DNA replication, DNA damage, and, more recently, for the control of cell size. FBL17 null mutants exhibit severe cellular defects leading to lethality. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FBL17 operate remain poorly understood. Here, we show that FBL17 interacts with different components of the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED1/E2F module and is involved in the protein turnover of E2Fa and E2Fb. However, mutations in E2Fa or E2Fb do not alleviate the severe fbl17 phenotype but worsen it. By contrast, it is the accumulation of the transcriptional repressor E2Fc that causes fbl17 mutant lethality. Our results highlight a key role for FBL17 in modulating the transcriptional control of E2F target genes ensuring precise control of cell cycle progression and avoiding uncontrolled DNA damage response.",

Here, we demonstrate the first measurement of GHz flexural vibrations in graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) resonators at room temperature, achieving multimode resonances ( f m , n ) up to ~1.09 GHz and quality factors ( Q m , n ) up to ~5400 in multilayer MoS 2 resonators, and f m , n up to ~1.03 GHz with high Q m , n  ~4500 in few-layer graphene resonators. Both f s and Q s are the highest among reported atomic layer nanomechanical resonators at room temperature, yielding f m , n  ×  Q m , n  ~ 5 × 10 12 Hz. We also reveal a Q scaling law with higher modes, which favors detecting GHz resonances.

However, existing techniques are often limited by insufficient spatial resolution. Here, we showcase the direct and noncontact temperature measurement with a nanometer spatial resolution using transmission electron microscopy. The experimental probe is the combination of a scanning nanobeam with precession electron diffraction, which offers the collection of kinematic diffraction intensity from a local area at the nanometer scale. With a precalculated, sample- and geometry-specific structure factor–based correction, the linear fitting of diffraction intensities allows the determination of the Debye-Waller factor and, thus, temperature with a precision of 10 −4 square angstrom per °C. Using graphene as a model material, this work reveals the influence of sample tilt, lattice thermal expansion, and sample thickness on Debye-Waller factor and offers a route to improving the measurement precision along with spatial resolution. The approach establishes a broadly applicable strategy for nanoscale thermometry in low-dimensional and heterogeneous materials.",

In particular, the as-prepared asymmetric membrane achieved a H 2 permeance of 212 ± 45 Gas Permeation Unit (GPU) and H 2 /N 2 selectivity of 19 ± 2 at 35°C. Remarkably, at 300°C, the H 2 permeance rose to 775 ± 139 GPU while maintaining a H 2 /N 2 selectivity of 13 ± 1, outperforming polymer-based membranes. A techno-economic analysis of an NH 3 cracking process demonstrated that this high permeance reduces membrane area requirements by 68.2% and lowers H 2 separation costs by 35.1% compared with operation at 35°C, leading to a 9.8% reduction in the levelized cost of hydrogen.",

Here, a comprehensive dataset of Chinese Y-chromosome variations, including 1507 high-coverage sequences from ethnolinguistically diverse groups, was analyzed alongside 780 ancient genomes from eastern Eurasia and 1748 low-coverage sequences from Southeast Asia. We reconstructed a high-resolution, time-calibrated Y-chromosome phylogeny, revealing multiple male-biased expansions associated with Neolithic cultural innovations in South China. These expansions markedly shaped the paternal ancestry of both South China and mainland Southeast Asia. Founding lineages linked to Hmong-Mien and Tai-Kadai speakers were traced, revealing notable growth during the Middle Neolithic. Phylogeographic structure, network analyses, and haplogroup distributions indicate complex demographic interactions that established the genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers in Southeast Asia. These findings highlight recurrent southward migrations of Chinese farmer-related groups and their enduring influence on the paternal genetic landscape of ancient and present-day Southeast Asians.",

Herein, we extracted allomelanin from black knot fungus, chaga mushroom, and black oat using an acid-base extraction protocol, comparing them against a library of synthetic analogs derived from a range of putative, natural precursors. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that simple homopolymerization of 1,8-DHN does not adequately represent natural allomelanin structures. Instead, heterogeneous copolymerization of 1,8-DHN with catechol or tannic acid yields materials with physicochemical properties more consistent with natural extracts. This is also supported by their enhanced antioxidant and dye/metal adsorption properties. Like their synthetic counterparts, extracted natural allomelanins exhibit intrinsic porosity, reaching a Brunauer-Emmet-Teller area of 155 square meters per gram, potentially facilitating nutrient transport and toxin adsorption, although further studies will be required to probe this.",

Radial growth, reflected by an increase in fiber cross-sectional area, is mediated through a rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway, whereas longitudinal growth, marked by the in-series addition of sarcomeres, is mediated through a rapamycin-insensitive signaling pathway. To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of preexisting sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1 but also lay the framework for a revised understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.",

The age results push the Yunxian crania back to 1.77 ± 0.08 million years ago (±1σ internal error), representing the oldest H. erectus fossils discovered in situ in eastern Asia. A much older age assignment to Yunxian supports the model of rapid dispersal and widespread distribution of early H. erectus and contributes to narrowing the chronological gap between the earliest archaeology and hominin paleontology in eastern Asia.",

By modulating the VCM output, the robot achieves jumping, full-stroke vibration for terrestrial locomotion and small-stroke vibration for aquatic propulsion. Terrestrial tests demonstrate rapid motion on granular media, continuous jumping, and load carrying. The robot also uses passive tilted fins that convert reciprocating motion into steerable aquatic thrust, realizing an inertia-driven multidirectional propulsion mechanism. Thrust generation and frequency-dependent propulsion were analyzed through aquatic experiments, high-speed particle image velocimetry, and simulations.

We found that genes within the IIS pathway evolved opposite roles in organ growth across wing-dimorphic insects, playing opposite roles in regulating the developmental switch between short and long wings. In the firebug, the InR-Chico-PI3K-PDK1-Tsc1/2-TORC1 cascade redirects the switch from short to long wings by inactivating IIS, whereas in the planthopper, the InR-Chico-PI3K-Akt-FoxO cascade redirects this same switch by activating IIS. Activation or inactivation of IIS results in low ecdysteroid titers in both species by regulating different genes within the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway, which in turn induces long wing development. Our findings reveal a negative relationship between IIS and organ growth and a mechanism for how a hormone pathway can translate opposing IIS activities into the same developmental switch across species.",

We find climatologically elevated intraregional SFW in boreal regions, as well as interregional synchronicity among northern temperate and boreal regions. Significant increases in SFW occurred during 1979 to 2024, with more than a twofold increase observed in most regions. We estimate that over half of the observed increase is attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Internal modes of climate variability strongly influence SFW in several regions, including Equatorial Asia, which experiences 43 additional intraregional SFW days during El Niño years. Furthermore, SFW is strongly correlated with regional fire-sourced PM 2.5 in multiple regions globally.

Unlike conventional in-plane solid-liquid-solid growth using a uniform amorphous silicon precursor, sc-HPS uses a spatially confined amorphous germanium (a-Ge) layer defined by oblique patterning of a SiO 2 /a-Ge stack. This restricts Ge supply to a narrow strip along the step edge, enabling nucleation and tunable QD diameters of ~25 to 150 nm, sandwiched between two epitaxially connected SiNWs. The SiNW/Ge-QD/SiNW heterostructure forms a Si/Ge interface that provides three-dimensional hole confinement. Single-hole transistors fabricated from these structures exhibit clear Coulomb oscillations and well-defined Coulomb diamonds up to 50 K, demonstrating single-hole charging behavior.

Here, we reveal chaotic MJO propagation arising from cross-scale nonlinear interactions, based on 4000-member ensemble simulations of two MJO events with a global cloud-system–resolving model. Against conventional linear thinking, multiple regimes with distinct timings of MJO propagation emerge under a single atmosphere-ocean background. The emergence of regime bifurcation depends critically on the equatorial asymmetry of climatological sea surface temperature. Selection of the bifurcated regimes is probabilistic, influenced by whether tropical-extratropical interplay promotes moistening associated with westward-propagating tropical waves over the western Pacific. These results contribute to a more complete MJO conceptual model and help foresee when coherent MJO propagation emerges.",

Cell type–specific adaptation of the properties is induced within hours in response to stress or changes in cell wall metabolism.

CBX7 is an allergen-inducible gene. Genetic and pharmacologic interventions established an essential role for CBX7 for the production of cytokines by mouse and asthmatic patient lymphoid cells, and for the induction of allergic asthma in multiple mouse models. RNA sequencing demonstrated a large-scale loss and gain in gene transcription in Cbx7 −/− T cells. The top down-regulated pathways included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, asthma, and T helper cell differentiation. CBX7 induction of the transcriptional activation complex and methylation of the ERK1/2 signalosome was specific for lymphoid cells as they were absent in epithelial cells.

Modifying the postbuckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of postbuckling behavior: Under compression, slit-beams first buckle and then snap, leading to tristability within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit-induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multislit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multistep snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left- and right-buckled states.

          "abstract": "Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), as an electric field–driven nonvolatile memory, offer extremely low power consumption and high speed. Despite efforts, FeFETs have not been successfully scaled down to sub–5-nanometer-node technology, with their operational voltage exceeding 1.5 V, making them unable to match monolithic logic cores. Our study used metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes as gate electrodes to shrink the gate length of molybdenum disulfide FeFET to 1 nanometer. This nanogate approach leads to an electric field concentration and enhanced ferroelectric–to–metal-oxide semiconductor capacitance coupling, resulting in a reduced operating voltage of 0.6 V, below the conventional ferroelectric coercive voltage. The nanogate molybdenum disulfide FeFETs exhibit superior memory performance, with a substantial current on/off ratio of 2 × 10 6 and a rapid programming speed of 1.6 nanoseconds. This study demonstrates the immunity of nanogate FeFETs to short-channel effects, highlighting the notable potential of ferroelectric electronics for enabling superior scaling, performance, and energy efficiency in sub–1-nanometer-node chips.",

In walled organisms like plants, division plane orientation irreversibly defines tissue topology and is tightly regulated. While divisions often follow the shortest path enclosing cell volume, certain cells deviate, dividing perpendicular to the growth axis. Tissue-scale mechanical stress has been proposed to guide such orientation, but how these cues are integrated remains unclear. Here, we reexamine the role of the actin cytoskeleton in orienting cell division in Arabidopsis root epidermis. Combining cell biology, genetics, pharmacological treatments, 3D segmentation, and modeling, we show that actin is a central molecular actor required to establish cell division orientation against the geometrical rules, highlighting its role in integrating spatial information.",

Despite its central role, basal complex biogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we use expansion microscopy and DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography to investigate three transmembrane basal complex proteins in Plasmodium falciparum —basal complex transmembrane protein 1 (BTP1), BTP2, and basolateral expansion boundary (BLEB). Parasites lacking BTP2 are still enveloped by membranes but fail to separate from each other, resulting in multiorganellar mutants. We isolate the defect to a specific step during basal complex development and demonstrate that the contractile ability remains intact. By revisiting BLEB, we identify a distinct plasma membrane region that is excluded from daughter cells and associated with the basal complex. Integrating these findings, we propose a three-step model for basal complex biogenesis that highlights the specific role of BTP2 and suggests a role for the BLEB-associated membrane.

While synthetic DNA networks have been engineered primarily using sequence programmability, exclusive reliance on this dimension constrains signaling range and integrated regulation. Here, we report an allosteric DNA computing framework enabling the simultaneous integration of sequence programmability with conformational dynamics for integrated multilevel signal processing. By encoding conformational signals within polythymidine loops (0 to 40 nucleotides), this system executes loop-dependent logic operations with expanded signaling ranges. Moreover, catalytic allosteric hairpin assemblies achieve ~30-fold signal amplification with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Concurrently, allosteric DNA neural networks discriminate conformational signals based on loop lengths (7 to 15 nucleotides) at two-nucleotide resolution. Crucially, microRNA-responsive versions of this framework regulate gene expression, thereby bridging conformational signaling with genetic control regulations in vivo.

Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the non-equilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting non-equilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the nonlocal redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation—an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons.",

Using diverse observations and aerosol-climate models, we evaluate the utility of different proxies with two independent approaches. Both approaches reveal that surface CCN exhibits the smallest bias in predicting RF aci (+5%), followed by aerosol index, surface sulfate and column CCN with similar biases of +25%, while aerosol optical depth and column sulfate show the largest biases (−60% and +92%). Constraining RF aci with the optimal proxy reduces uncertainty from 66 to 43%, yielding a less negative RF aci (−1.0 W m −2 ) than the unconstrained case (−1.2 W m −2 ).

Through subnanometer-resolved photon imaging of linear molecular chains, coherent purely excitonic (0–0) emission patterns reveal the wave function’s relative phases, while incoherent vibronic (0–1) emission maps the squared wave function amplitudes. This near-field technique enables the reconstruction of wave functions for both bright superradiant states and optically dark subradiant states inaccessible by conventional far-field optics. Furthermore, the submolecular resolution of the vibronic maps allows for the contributions of different vibrational symmetries, namely, Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller modes, to be distinguished. Our findings establish a unique approach for the excitonic wave function reconstruction and open a route for exploring exciton dynamics and interactions in molecular systems.",

Subsequent automated synthesis and validation found a high-performance catalyst, TiFeNiZn-CoOOH, which exhibited an exceptional OER overpotential of 263 millivolts at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter. Feature importance and statistical analysis of more than 5 million structures confirmed that Zn consistently shows the highest active site occupation probability, and the [CoNiZn] coordination yields the lowest overpotential. Electronic structure analysis revealed that Zn activates gap states, critically lowering the OER energy barrier.

Here, we identify an exonuclease REXO4, which collaborates with RNaseH1 endonuclease to degrade R-loops in an “endo/exo-cleavage coupling” manner. Specifically, REXO4 directly degrades the RNA strand in R-loops from the end or internal nick through its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and stimulates RNaseH1 endonuclease activity. The genome-wide R-loop regions regulated by REXO4 highly overlap with those regulated by RNaseH1, and REXO4 overexpression counteracts genome-wide R-loop accumulation caused by RNaseH1 deficiency. Furthermore, REXO4-deficient tumors display elevated R-loop mutation burden, and tumor patient-derived mutations in REXO4 enzymatic region all impair R-loop cleavage activity. Besides, we identify a compound 17 (named REXO4-IN-17) capable of inhibiting REXO4 nuclease activity. Interfering with REXO4 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating and G4 stabilizing chemotherapeutic drugs and activates cGAS-mediated antitumor immunity. Therefore, our study proposes an endo/exo-cleavage coupling the R-loop processing model, which provides additional insights into the link between R-loop–associated genome instability, antitumor immunity, and tumors.",

Paradoxically, artificially induced aneuploidy in normal cells elicits cellular stresses and decreases cell fitness. How aneuploidy initially emerges during tumorigenesis is thus unclear. Using human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a model, we show that aneuploid ESCs form immature teratomas with an enrichment of mesenchymal tissues. Specifically, chromosome 8 (chr8) gain, a prevalent form of aneuploidy in human cancers, promotes the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in teratomas and MSC proliferation in vitro. We further show that human embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, tumors of mesenchymal origin, lack dominant driver mutations but frequently harbor chr8 gain. Our study suggests a plausible mechanism for aneuploidy emergence during tumorigenesis, links specific aneuploidy to the mesenchymal lineage, and paves the way for identifying vulnerabilities of aneuploid MSCs, which may have important roles in tumorigenesis.",

          "authors": "Jérémy C. Santamaria, Magali Irla",
          "abstract": "The gradual decline in thymic function with age, known as age-related thymic involution, leads to reduced T cell production, thereby increasing the risk of infections and cancer susceptibility and leading to poor vaccine responses. Moreover, T cell defects were recently involved in the age-related loss of tissue integrity and function. Mechanistically, thymic involution is driven by several factors, including hormonal modifications and chronic inflammation, leading to functional changes in the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. These progressive changes alter the cross-talk between developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells, which is pivotal for thymic function. Promising strategies to counteract thymic involution and rejuvenate immune T cell function have been recently identified. This review summarizes key insights into the underlying mechanisms of thymic involution and discusses current and emerging rejuvenation strategies to restore thymic function. These interventions show promise in regenerative medicine to promote healthy aging by alleviating age-associated immune decline.",

          "abstract": "Glycine receptors (GlyRs), pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), mediate sensory and motor functions. GlyR functional states are well characterized; however, structural details of transitions between states remain undefined. Here, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of GlyRα1β (with gephyrin E-domain) at varying concentrations of ivermectin, a transmembrane domain (TMD) allosteric agonist, and at saturating concentrations of strychnine, a competitive antagonist at the extracellular domain (ECD). Electrophysiology shows that ivermectin activates GlyR even with strychnine present. Structures with both ligands reveal intermediate states featuring a desensitized TMD and an ECD between closed and desensitized conformations, providing insights into domain cooperativity and ligand efficacy. Molecular dynamics simulations show how ivermectin affects strychnine dynamics. These data support a model where ivermectin activates GlyRs through a concerted and near-symmetric TMD mechanism, whereas allosteric ECD motions are graded and spatially heterogeneous. These findings reveal unanticipated features of GlyR gating and establish principles of allosteric modulation applicable to pLGICs.",

Microtubule cytoskeletal fibers offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties. This nuclear spin-driven effect is enhanced under an applied weak 3-millitesla magnetic field. Our theoretical radical pair model achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results support a connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing further insights into how weak magnetic fields may influence biomolecular functions.",

          "abstract": "The propagation of light in nanophotonic structures is governed by the refractive index and optical dispersion of constituent materials. However, the choice of dielectrics is often restricted within the transparency window. We introduce object-driven engineering of the process of silicon-based dielectric materials for metasurfaces: visibly transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with a high refractive index of 3.48 and oxygen-doped a-Si:H (a-SiO x :H) exhibiting strong dispersion (Abbe number &lt; 10). Both films are fabricated via chemical vapor deposition with precise control over atomic bonding and dopants, revealing the link between optical properties and the amorphous silicon network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a-Si:H in metalenses with conversion efficiencies of 66.3, 92.0, and 97.0% at 450, 532, and 635 nanometers, respectively. In addition, a wavelength-decoupled a-SiO x :H beam-splitter achieves a 3.67-fold steering intensity contrast between 450 and 635 nanometers. These materials broaden the dielectric design space and enhance the performance of nanophotonic devices across the visible spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is a hereditary optic neuropathy caused by OPA1 variants, leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and vision loss. The mechanisms behind RGC vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. We developed a patient-specific Opa1 V291D/+ knock-in mouse model to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal metabolism in ADOA. We observed that Opa1 V291D/+ mice exhibited anatomical and functional RGC abnormalities recapitulating the ADOA phenotypes. Reduced optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein levels were noted in Opa1 V291D/+ mice, accompanied by decreased protein stability. Moreover, mitochondrial function was compromised, as indicated by reduced Complex I activity, increased oxidative stress, and diminished adenosine triphosphate production in the retinas of Opa1 V291D/+ mice. Spatial metabolomics revealed energy deficits in the inner retina and heightened glycolysis in the outer retina. Immunostaining showed decreased expression of glycolytic proteins in the ganglion cell layer. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing disclosed significant down-regulation of energy-production genes in RGCs, while other retinal cell types remained unaffected. These findings emphasize the specific vulnerability of RGCs to bioenergetic crises, connecting disrupted energy homeostasis to their degeneration. By increasing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )/reduced form of NAD + (NADH) redox ratio through the overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted Lactobacillus brevis NADH oxidase ( MitoLbNOX ) in RGCs, we demonstrated improved RGC function and survival through enhanced energy metabolism and reduced oxidative stress. These findings confirm that disrupted energy metabolism leads to RGC degeneration and emphasize the enhancement of the NAD + /NADH redox ratio as a promising treatment strategy to protect RGCs from degeneration in ADOA.",

          "abstract": "Assessing seismic hazards in regions with hidden or poorly expressed faults is one of the major challenges in paleoseismology today. Here, we used computed tomography imaging to quantify the dimensions and distribution of liquefaction structures in ≤17.5–thousand-year-old tephra layers in 18 lakes scattered across the poorly expressed Hamilton Basin fault system in northern New Zealand. These “tephra seismites,” embedded in unconsolidated, organic-bearing lake sediment, increase in occurrence and dimensions toward known faults and indicate the occurrence of a local hidden fault segment. Through incorporating peak ground acceleration modeling, we found that the spatial distribution of tephra seismites directly relates to the ground shaking induced by near-field fault ruptures. We used the variability in tephra seismites within the stratigraphic record and tephrochronology to better constrain the recurrence intervals and magnitudes of paleoearthquakes from both the Hamilton Basin and adjacent Hauraki Basin fault systems. Our methodology is globally applicable in volcanic and tectonic regions where liquefaction structures are preserved among (hidden) faults.",

Here, we demonstrate the first in-human, at-home classification of a specific movement state—walking—using a fully implantable, bidirectional neurostimulator. In four individuals with Parkinson’s disease, we recorded chronic motor cortex and globus pallidus activity synchronized with wearable kinematic data across over 80 hours of unsupervised daily activity. We identified highly predictive personalized spectral biomarkers of gait and validated their performance. Critically, we showed that these biomarkers could drive real-time movement state classification using the neurostimulator’s embedded linear discriminant classifier, satisfying device-level constraints for closed-loop stimulation. Our results establish a previously unidentified pipeline for real-world neural decoding and scalable framework for personalized adaptive neuromodulation, expanding the translational reach of implantable brain-computer interfaces.",

Rather than a uniform or convergent process, financial globalization emerges as an uneven and differentiated field structured by distinct professional communities, institutions, and socio-political legacies. In this article, I examine how financial practices and products circulate within the global offshore finance system through variations in professional characteristics. Using novel empirical evidence and an innovative combination of geographic and geometric data analysis, I map 17.622 offshore finance professionals and identify patterns in practices and geographies. I identify sites of distinct offshore practices and thereby provide evidence for how financial globalization in the offshore space develops in differentiated hubs and circuits through professional mediation and innovation. The broader implication here is that professional specialization produces institutional variation in the aggregate.",

          "authors": "Florian Fastenrath, Paul Marx",
          "abstract": "This article explores why left-wing parties tend to avoid advocating higher taxes for the rich—and why they sometimes do put them on the agenda. The ‘tax taboo’ is driven by electoral calculations. Public opinion on taxing the rich is ambivalent. Narratives of taxes harming the economy are nurtured by right-wing parties and business lobbies. This discourages the left from mobilizing on the issue. However, recent campaigns by the German Social Democrats (2021) and Labour in Britain (2017) overcame this taboo with distinct pro-tax programs. Our comparative analysis traces common factors and strategic considerations of party actors. It highlights the role of policy entrepreneurs, who act as catalysts through their exceptional motivation and competence. Additionally, our case studies point to party competition as an important factor. Right-wing parties face a trilemma between the goals of balanced budgets, low taxes, and investment, making them less compelling critics of left-wing tax plans.",
