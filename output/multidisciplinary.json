          "abstract": "Multifold topological semimetals host fermions with opposite chiralities at topological band crossings 1–3 . Chiral fermionic transport in topological systems often relies on high magnetic fields or magnetic dopants to suppress trivial transport and create an imbalance in occupancy of opposite Chern-number states 4,5 . Here we use the quantum geometry 6,7 of topological bands to filter fermions by chirality into distinct Chern-number-polarized states. This allows for the real-space separation of currents with opposite fermionic chiralities, which we have demonstrated by observing their quantum interference in the absence of any magnetic field. Devices fabricated from single-crystal PdGa in a three-arm geometry exhibit quantum-geometry-induced anomalous velocities 8,9 of chiral fermions, thereby exhibiting a nonlinear Hall effect. The resultant transverse chiral currents with opposite anomalous velocities are thereby spatially separated into the outer arms of the device. These chiral currents in opposing Chern number states also carry orbital magnetizations with opposite signs. The mesoscopic phase coherence of these chiral currents facilitated their quantum interference 10 in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Our findings establish a chiral fermionic valve that exhibits three key properties: spatially separates chiral fermions into Chern-number polarized states by using their quantum geometry, enables tuneable current-induced magnetization and provides a platform for controllable quantum interference of chiral quasiparticles using an electric current and magnetic field.",

          "abstract": "Wild foods are critical to the food security of billions of people worldwide, yet the ecological mechanisms that promote wild food system stability remain poorly understood. Within complex food webs, ecological theory predicts that nonhuman consumers can maintain more stable consumption rates by foraging on multiple resources that vary asynchronously in their availability across space and time. These so-called portfolio effects may also sustain more stable harvest rates by humans in wild food systems. We analyzed wild food harvest patterns for 46 isolated rural communities in southern coastal Alaska that harvest a diversity of wild foods (96 taxa) across terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal, and marine habitats. We show that access to diverse wild foods across this heterogeneous landscape dampened variability in harvest through time and increased robustness to species declines by allowing communities to harness seasonal and interannual asynchronies in wild food availability. These results demonstrate how ecological mechanisms that stabilize ecosystems may also underpin the stability of human wild food systems. Managing landscapes to maintain access to diverse wild foods and adopting flexible governance that allows communities to adjust harvest as patterns of wild food availability shift through time are crucial to sustaining resilient wild food systems in a changing world.",

          "abstract": "The decline of polygyny and the rise of monogamy among complex, stratified societies characterized by high wealth inequality present a long-standing puzzle in anthropology. Competing explanations suggest that monogamy either i) reduces reproductive inequality, fosters cooperation, and enhances success in intergroup competition, or ii) mitigates conflict over heritable wealth—especially land—under conditions of high social stratification and ecological constraints. Both frameworks are influenced by the history of Indo-European societies, where monogamy has long been normative and closely associated with land inheritance and state formation. However, normative monogamy is also found in many societies beyond this historical context. To evaluate these competing hypotheses, we formalized their causal structure and applied Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models to a global sample of 186 societies. Our results show that monogamy is strongly associated with land privatization and, in some regions, with ecological or demographic proxies for land scarcity—supporting the view that competition over heritable wealth promotes monogamy globally. In contrast, support for the intergroup competition model is inconsistent: While it may explain monogamy in some language families, these dynamics do not extend to most societies in our sample. Our findings suggest that monogamy arose repeatedly under similar socioecological conditions and cannot be fully explained by theories based primarily on Indo-European history.",

          "abstract": "Desertification threatens 24% of the world’s land area across 126 countries and affects 35% of the global population. However, mainstream global efforts to combat desertification prioritize short-term vegetation greening over addressing resource constraints and local livelihoods, posing hidden challenges to long-term Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) attainment. Here, we evaluated the socioeconomic trade-offs of China’s long-standing desertification reversal strategies and explored the potential benefits of innovative agricultural practices using high-resolution suitability models for major crops and cultivated pasture. Compared with a no-intervention baseline, continuing the Grain-for-Green Program and grazing exclusion under projected 2023–2050 warming and wetting trends would lead to reductions of up to 54 to 55% in grain output, 81% in livestock production, and 61% in agricultural income. Conversely, strategies emphasizing pasture cultivation and crop switching could substantially lower national expenditures on combating desertification while restoring ecosystems, enhancing agricultural productivity and incomes, and conserving water resources. These benefits would contribute 0.7%, 9.8%, and 3.8% toward global progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), respectively, while exhibiting trade-offs across multiple SDGs. This study provides a reimagined strategy framework for combating global desertification and promoting sustainable development in vulnerable arid regions worldwide.",

However, insights into country-specific progress covering pre- and post-SDG and the prospects remain limited. Here, we compare the progress of 117 SDG indicators for 167 countries and project the achievements by 2030. Our results reveal the progress of the SDGs across the world varies depending on the initial SDG scores of the indicators in 2015. For indicators with low scores (0 to 50%), the proportion of countries showing advancement is greater than that demonstrating regression (25 vs. 16%). Countries that foster scientific research and promote manufacturing industry (SDG9) have the best performances. For indicators with high scores (70 to 90%), the proportion showing regression is greater than that with advancement (16 vs.10%). The increased coverage of immunization vaccines and prevention of infectious diseases (SDG3) have the worst performances. For indicators with moderate scores (50 to 70%), the proportion showing regression is slightly greater than that showing advancement (11 vs. 9%). When the score was low and high, the impact of the pandemic was significantly greater than that for moderate scores. By 2030, the global SDG score will reach approximately 63%, with a SD of 8%. Overall, 78 countries will reach the moderate score (60 to 70%), and 12 countries will remain with a low score (40 to 50%). Countries need to achieve an annual growth rate of 4% to meet the overall SDGs by 2030.

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with incidence peaking in later life. It is commonly treated with surgery followed by administration of ionizing radiation and the DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Even though this regimen confers some progression-free survival, there is essentially no cure with the median survival with the standard of care being about 12 mo. Currently, several alternative approaches are being developed to improve upon this outcome. We have already shown EdU alone effectively treats GBM, and we now study the efficacy of TMZ+EdU combination therapy. TMZ+EdU significantly improves antitumor efficacy compared to either single-agent therapy against GBM cell lines in vitro, against three different orthotopic GBM xenograft models, and against passage-zero GBM patient tumor tissues engrafted within an organotypic brain slice culture-based platform. Together, our results suggest that EdU could be effective alongside standard-of-care TMZ in patients with GBM.",

However, the molecular trigger of these structural rearrangements for splicing catalysis remains unclear at the atomic level. Here, by analyzing a consistent dataset of multicomponent spliceosome structures, we identified a minimal set of positively charged residues whose dynamic action remodels the spliceosome active site during the first step of splicing. Through equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of multiple splicing intermediates (&gt;2M atoms), we uncover how these residues dynamically operate in coordination with the transient, temporally ordered binding of key spliceosomal proteins (Prp11, Prp8, and Yju2) at the spliceosome core. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism that ensures precise and timely spliceosome activation, opening promising directions to probe splicing regulation and potentially target its dysfunction in diseases, with broad implications for drug discovery and medicine.",

          "abstract": "After consumption by herbivores, plant antimicrobial defense compounds may enhance herbivore immunity to pathogenic microbes. In conifer-bark beetle interactions, beetles ingest large quantities of phloem tissue containing high concentrations of antimicrobial phenolic glucosides, such as stilbenes and flavonoids. It is not known, however, if these compounds increase bark beetle resistance to pathogens. We showed that Eurasian spruce bark beetles ( Ips typographus ) attacking Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) hydrolyze phenolic glucosides to their corresponding aglucones increasing their antifungal activity. However, the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana , a natural fungal parasite of these beetles, detoxifies stilbene and flavonoid aglucones by forming methylglucoside derivatives. A two-step pathway involving a UDP-glycosyltransferase and an O -methyltransferase produces phenolic O -methylglucosides that are no longer toxic to B. bassiana and are stable to β-glucosidase action. Compared to wild-type strains of B. bassiana , mutant strains knocked out in the genes of this pathway exhibited decreased methylglucoside formation, slower growth on medium containing phenolic compounds, and reduced virulence toward bark beetles. Hence, methylglucosylation of plant-derived phenolics is a detoxification process that significantly increases the ability of B. bassiana to parasitize host insects consuming plant tissue high in phenolics, such as conifer phloem. This is one of the few examples of an entomopathogen that is able to resist the plant-derived defenses of an insect host.",

          "abstract": "Microtubules have been extensively studied for their interactions at the outer surface and ends, yet the regulatory mechanisms within the microtubule lumen, particularly in singlet microtubules, remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a proximity-labeling strategy to distinguish intraluminal from external proteins, enabling the systematic identification of key regulators residing within the singlet microtubule lumen. Among these, we focused on Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2), a conserved microtubule-binding protein. JPT2 binds directly to microtubules and localizes to the lumen in a C-terminal-dependent manner. Within this compartment, it modulates the distribution of the α-tubulin acetyltransferase MEC17 and contributes to luminal homeostasis. Notably, the luminal accessibility of JPT2 is highly sensitive to microtubule structural states and is markedly reduced by Paclitaxel treatment, suggesting that drug-induced conformational changes or steric hindrance can restrict luminal entry. Together, our findings identify JPT2 as a key organizer of the singlet microtubule lumen and provide a framework for the spatial and functional analysis of microtubule inner proteins. Beyond exogenous perturbations, our observations suggest that luminal protein distribution may also be modulated by steric competition or selective entry among intraluminal components, indicating a more intricate regulatory landscape within the microtubule interior.",

While two-thirds of RGC types were evenly distributed, others showed strong biases toward ventral or dorso-temporal regions associated with sky vision and the area retinae temporalis (ART), the predicted homolog of the area centralis. Additionally, we observed unexpected spatial variation in gene expression within several types along the dorso–ventral axis or within vs. outside the ART, independent of RGC density profiles.

However, the viral determinants and mechanisms underlying enhanced virulence remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified E2-N262 glycosylation in GETV as an evolutionary adaptation that promotes receptor binding, innate immune evasion, and virulence. Using reverse genetics technology, we generated recombinant GETV strains―rSD2206 WT and the N262D substitution. In vitro, rSD2206 WT formed larger plaques and replicated more efficiently across multiple cell lines. Despite exhibiting enhanced pathogenicity, higher replication efficiency, and a weaker induction of host antiviral responses compared to the N262D virus in both mouse and suckling pig models, the rSD2206 WT virus retained immunogenicity. Mechanistically, we found that rSD2206 WT increased virion attachment and entry into host cells by enhancing binding affinity to both HS (a GETV attachment factor) and LDLR (a GETV receptor). In addition, the rSD2206 WT strain can evade the host’s antiviral response by interrupting the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3. Structural analysis revealed a significant reduction in binding free energy for rSD2206 WT. This reduction resulted in conformational changes within the E2 protein, which in turn enhanced its stability and subsequently strengthening its receptor-binding capacity. Ultimately, compared to N262D, rSD2206 WT exhibited increased replication in cells overexpressing LDLR, but significantly reduced replication in LDLR −/− mice. These results highlight the critical importance of proactive surveillance of GETV molecular evolution to prevent future outbreaks, which could provide the foundation for the development of attenuated vaccines.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the factors that drive individuals in a population to conform to the same behavior or to exhibit behavioral diversity is crucial for understanding collective decision-making, information transmission, and culture, yet remains challenging. Here, we propose and test a conceptual model predicting a population’s position along a conformity–diversity (CD) spectrum based on two key axes shaping the CD landscape: an ecological axis, representing competition over depleted resources, which favors diversity over conformity (since resources are depleted sooner if all individuals conform to the same resource type), and a cognitive axis reflecting the relative ease of learning a behavior socially versus individually. Our experiments show that manipulating these two primary factors is sufficient to produce the full CD spectrum within a single species. Specifically, studying socially foraging house sparrows, we manipulated competition using depleted or nondepleted feeding wells and manipulated the relative ease of learning a task individually by manipulating levels of experience and task difficulty. As predicted by the model, sparrows exhibited strong conformity under the combination of “no food depletion” and “difficult individual learning” conditions, strong diversity under the combination of “food depletion” and “easy individual learning” conditions, and intermediate levels of conformity under mixed conditions. The results show that a population’s position along the CD spectrum is highly flexible and sensitive to ecological and task-related conditions. Accordingly, the demonstrated CD surface may be viewed as an evolving reaction norm, and hence as a baseline over which additional factors shaping social conformity and differentiation can be tested.",

While some inflammatory responses may originate from mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), nonimmune cells vastly outnumber MNPs and may be an important source of inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that highly virulent EBOV induced a high and sustained pro-inflammatory response compared to less virulent ebolaviruses in non-MNPs through TLR4-independent NF-κB activation. We identified the EBOV matrix protein VP40 as a potent activator of NF-κB in non-MNPs, whose intrinsic inflammatory activation ability is higher than VP40 proteins from less virulent ebolaviruses. This suggests that VP40 is a virulence determinant inducing distinct degrees of pro-inflammatory responses among ebolaviruses. Mechanistically, VP40 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, primarily via TNFR1 using a ligand-independent mechanism. These findings reveal mechanisms that may drive systemic inflammation and promote EBOV pathogenesis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate immune dysregulation in severe EBOV infections.",

Environmental changes associated with alternating wet/dry cycles during this critical interval in hominin evolution are recorded in isotopic profiles from lake sediments from Olduvai Gorge. The Olduvai Gorge Coring Project targeted the depocenter of Paleolake Olduvai, recovering a stratigraphic succession between the Bed I Basalt (~1.90 Ma) and Tuff IF (~1.80 Ma) datums that span hominin fossil horizons in nearby outcrops. Lacustrine claystones from the lower part of this interval are characterized by high C org (avg. 2.5 %). They display variations in δ 13 C org reflecting temporal changes in organic matter (OM) sources. Stratigraphic profiles for n -alkane δ 13 C values derived from plant waxes are consistent throughout wet/dry cycles indicating stability in savanna vegetation, refuting evidence for increased C 4 grasses during drier intervals. δ 13 C values for n -alkanes derived from aquatic macrophytes and for algal biomarkers increase during drier episodes, reflecting use of bicarbonate as a carbon source triggered by enhanced lake alkalinity. δ 13 C org profiles reflect variations in inputs of terrestrial vs. aquatic OM during wet/dry cycles, which are mirrored by δ 13 C values for hop-17(21)-ene derived from heterotrophic bacteria utilizing sedimentary OM. The δ 13 C records from Paleolake Olduvai sediments show temporal changes in OM sources rather than shifts in the proportion of C 3 and C 4 vegetation, indicating that precession-driven climate cycles primarily affected lake environments and associated aquatic resources. Thus, intervals of high climate variability did not necessarily cause changes in savanna vegetation affecting hominin habitats.",

          "abstract": "The timing of metamorphosis in insects determines adult body size and influences aspects of fitness including flight performance and fecundity. The regulation of metamorphosis has been well studied in model insects but determining the cue that initiates the physiological shift toward metamorphosis in other insects has been challenging. In most insects, the critical weight is a cue to initiate metamorphosis. Our goal was to determine the cue for metamorphosis in the solitary bee Megachile rotundata and to characterize the physiological mechanisms initiated by this cue. Larval bees were fed ad libitum (also termed “fed”) or had all food removed (also termed “starved”). We measured the time to initiate metamorphosis, juvenile hormone (JH) titers, and the abundance of transcripts involved in the endocrine response to metamorphosis. We experimentally manipulated JH by topically applying precocene, which interrupts JH production. We found that M. rotundata does not have a critical weight and that starvation through the removal of food triggered the initiation of metamorphosis. Food removal was associated with low JH titers, and the application of precocene mimicked the response to food absence. Food removal decreased transcripts associated with JH production, and increased transcripts involved in ecdysone synthesis and insulin/TOR signaling. Food absence is an ecologically relevant cue for a M. rotundata larva, which is provisioned a finite amount of food and is unable to forage for additional food. Despite having food removal as a cue for metamorphosis, the physiological mechanisms associated with metamorphosis are similar to those found in other insects.",

We propose a genomics-informed update to an existing framework enabling a more precise assessment of outbreeding depression risk and genetic rescue feasibility. We apply this approach to a butterfly species—the marsh fritillary ( Euphydryas aurinia )—which has faced severe range contractions and near-extinction in Denmark. We identify substantial inbreeding in the investigated populations (F ROH approaching 40%), historical gene flow, recent divergence times between populations, and low likelihood of local adaptation. Together, these results provide an example where genetic rescue could be undertaken successfully by transplanting individuals across populations with minimal outbreeding depression risks. Despite working with a scaffold-level assembly and moderate sample sizes, our analyses provide robust insights into population dynamics, demography, and local adaptation, demonstrating that even imperfect genomic data can inform conservation strategies. By refining an existing framework, we illustrate how genomics can enhance genetic rescue efforts and guide decision-making for threatened species. Our approach provides a scalable model for integrating genomic data into conservation management, advancing the use of evolutionary and conservation genetics principles in mitigating biodiversity loss.",

          "abstract": "Herbivory is destructive for crop production in many regions worldwide. The induced plant response to herbivores promotes resistance; therefore, characterizing the mechanisms underlying natural host resistance is highly important. However, the genetic components of resistance to herbivores in the staple food crop soybean remain elusive. Here, a key defense gene, GmMYC3 , was identified via joint linkage and association mapping in soybean. GmMYC3 encodes an MYC2 transcription factor that is rapidly activated after jasmonic acid treatment or herbivore attack and confers resistance to a major pest, the common cutworm (CCW), in soybean. GmMYC3 positively regulates multiple biotic stress-related genes, among which GmMYC3 triggers high expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors alongside its homolog GmMYC1 and downstream GmWRKY56 . GmMYC3 overexpression results in massive accumulation of trypsin inhibitors in soybean leaves, interferes with the protein digestion and absorption function in larvae that are fed these leaves, and retards larval and pupal development of the CCW. The results of the field tests of the transgenic plants corroborate the defense role of GmMYC3 . Evolutionary and population genetic analyses suggest that the elite haplotype of GmMYC3 contributes to resistance against the CCW without significant reduction in seed yield and quality. Notably, this haplotype appears at a low frequency in domesticated germplasms. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying plant resistance to the CCW and provides potentially valuable resources for breeding soybean plants with elevated resistance against this pest.",

          "abstract": "Cholesterol homeostasis in mammalian cells relies on the interaction between two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sterol-sensing membrane proteins, Scap and Insig. Their interaction regulates activation of transcription factors called sterol regulatory element–binding proteins (SREBPs) that control genes for cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Previous studies suggested a model where cholesterol sensing by Scap involves communication across the ER membrane between two functional domains, a cholesterol-binding domain on the luminal side and a COPII-binding domain on the cytosolic side. When ER cholesterol is low, Scap binds COPII adapter proteins to facilitate ER-to-Golgi transport and proteolytic activation of SREBPs. When ER cholesterol is above a threshold concentration, this transport is blocked, a process that requires Insigs. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol and Insigs control the conformations of Scap remain unknown. Here, we elucidate the 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of a Scap/Insig complex in the presence of saturating amounts of cholesterol. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the Scap/Insig interface indicates that Scap’s transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) plays a critical role in transducing conformational changes between the luminal and cytosolic sides of the ER membrane to control Scap/SREBP transport from ER to Golgi. An intramembrane cholesterol bound at the Scap/Insig interface competes with the intramolecular interaction of Scap’s TM7 at this interface to modulate cholesterol sensing. These results further advance our understanding of how Scap senses cholesterol and provides additional targets for controlling cholesterol and lipid synthesis in the context of metabolic diseases and even some cancers.",

          "abstract": "The Niemann-Pick type 1 and 2 proteins (NPC1 and NPC2) coordinate cholesterol egress from late endosomes-lysosomes (LE/LY). Proper folding, trafficking, and localization of both NPC proteins are essential for normal LE/LY cholesterol handling. Accordingly, mutations in NPC genes cause Niemann–Pick type C (NPC) disease, a progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder. The routes by which NPC1 reaches the LE/LY compartment in mammalian cells are not fully elucidated. Therefore, to interrogate NPC1 trafficking, we developed genome-engineered HeLa cells expressing endogenous NPC1 mNeon . We demonstrate that endogenous NPC1 localizes to the LE/LY compartment and by using protein proximity-based approaches that NPC1 resides in the same membranes as Vacuolar Protein Sorting-associated protein 41 (VPS41), one of the two unique subunits of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex. Loss of VPS41 increases NPC1 and Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) abundance. Paradoxically, this results in marked accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol and induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein signaling. Mechanistically, using immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging in combination with a VPS41-dependent ectopic recruitment assay, we demonstrate that this is due to a shift in the localization of NPC1 and LAMP1 from LE/LY to biosynthetic vesicles called LAMP carriers. These vesicles have been recently described to transport lysosomal-destined cargo directly from the trans- Golgi (TGN) network to LE/LY. In conclusion, we identify NPC1 as a cargo for VPS41-dependent LAMP carriers that are instrumental for the delivery of NPC1 to LE/LY and maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have identified diverse hollow biomolecular condensates, characterized by biomolecule-depleted interiors surrounded by biomolecule-rich shells. Although several formation mechanisms have been proposed, a general thermodynamic driving force remains elusive. Here, we investigate a well-defined system in which the human transcription factor p53 and nonspecific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) form biomolecule-rich condensates. Introduction of dsDNA containing p53-binding motifs induces a morphological transition to hollow structures, accompanied by a material state transition from liquid-like to gel-like. In vitro assays indicate that the formation of hollow condensates is driven by p21 DNA–induced localized gelation at the condensate periphery. Guided by these findings, we developed a three-component phase-field model that quantitatively recapitulates the formation of hollow condensates. Simulations show that peripheral gelation leads to gradual depletion of protein and Random DNA from the condensate core, triggering spinodal decomposition and lumen formation inside condensates. Together, these results offer mechanistic insights into multicomponent hollow condensates.",

The specific factors that govern cellular heterogeneity in IFN induction potential during infection are not understood. To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within preinfection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, postinfection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection. Altogether, our findings reveal an important role for intrinsic expression of ISGs in promoting IFN induction and provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell heterogeneity in innate immune activation.",

The members of the vasohibin family, VASH1 and VASH2, were previously identified as the first class of enzymes involved in catalyzing this modification. Here, we report the development of a covalent VASH inhibitor, which is characterized by high specificity and low toxicity. By combining the use of a new compound with molecular approaches in lung cancer cell lines, we find that tubulin detyrosination plays an important role in the maintenance of mesenchymal properties. We show that in the absence of VASH activity, collective cell migration and 3D spheroid formation are severely compromised. Moreover, we demonstrate that the observed phenotypes are caused by the accumulation of the important epithelial marker E-cadherin with simultaneous reduction in mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. Taken together, our study establishes tubulin detyrosination as a promising target for the future development of anticancer treatment.",

While circular RNAs (circRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulatory molecules, their roles in AR signaling during PCa progression remain poorly understood. This study identified circUTRN , an AR-inhibited circRNA that is upregulated following neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and downregulated in PCa tissues. circUTRN inhibits proliferation in both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa. Mechanistically, circUTRN binds to acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and impairs the activity through both phosphorylation-dependent and independent pathways, thereby disturbing de novo fatty acid synthesis. The dynamic relation between circUTRN and ACC1 expression during PCa progression from treatment-naïve to therapeutic-resistant states highlights the metabolic vulnerability of fatty acid synthesis. Notably, we developed nanoparticles to deliver circUTRN in combination with AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs). This approach effectively suppressed CRPC xenograft tumor growth, even in models resistant to next-generation ARSIs. This study reveals an AR-regulated circRNA involved in PCa progression and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment-resistant PCa.",

In the case of PdCrO 2 , this arises in a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet, creating a unique opportunity to study frustrated magnetism in a very clean metal. Here, we combine a chemical vapor transport crystal growth approach with magnetic, thermodynamic, magnetotransport, and neutron scattering measurements to elucidate the striking anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic PdCrO 2 . The unconventional AHE (with anomalous Hall conductivity ~10 5 Ω −1 cm −1 ) and a large positive magnetoresistance effect (&gt;1,000%) are shown to exhibit complex temperature dependencies, persisting to almost seven times the Néel temperature (~250 K). These effects are directly compared to elastic neutron scattering, inelastic neutron scattering, and neutron magnetic pair distribution function data, establishing unambiguous links between anomalous magnetotransport properties and directly probed short-range spin fluctuations. The latter occur over a notably broad temperature range due to geometrical magnetic frustration. Connecting to recent experimental and theoretical developments, these findings are discussed in terms of a temperature-dependent interplay between chiral spin order and chiral spin fluctuations, significantly elucidating the high-temperature anomalous magnetotransport in such compounds.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 1 (NFE2L1/Nrf1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated transcription factor, is responsible for the coordinated expression of proteasome subunit genes upon proteasomal dysfunction. N -glycosylated proteins undergo protein sequence editing by peptide: N -glycanase (NGLY1)-mediated conversion of N -glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartic acid. Nrf proteins are the only transcription factors that undergo sequence editing for transcriptional activation. However, the mechanism via which sequence editing regulates the transcriptional activity of Nrf1 has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrated that sequence editing of the ninth N -glycosylation site (Asn574) in human Nrf1 is required for proteasome gene expression in HeLa cells. Editing of Asn574 is essential for interaction with host cell factor C1 and O -GlcNAc transferase, which is required for Nrf1 chromatin binding and sufficient proteasome expression. Furthermore, sequence editing of N -glycosylation sites other than Asn574 is required for the interaction with the coactivator CREBBP/EP300, thereby enhancing Nrf1’s transcriptional activity. Unexpectedly, the expression of Nrf1 mutants that mimic proteolytic processing by DNA-damage-inducible 1 homolog 2 and sequence editing by NGLY1 markedly diminished the growth rate in HeLa cells, suggesting that the constitutive activation of Nrf1 exhibits cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study explains the strategy of on-demand Nrf1 activation for survival benefits. Nrf1 is synthesized as a proteasome-targeting protein and is highly glycosylated in the ER. Nrf1 is activated via sequence editing-dependent coactivator complex formation only when the proteasome needs to be compensated for.",

          "abstract": "Nucleic acid base pair open states that are actively driven to expose normally hidden sequences and host reactions with processing proteins have been highly studied. However, the spontaneous natural base pair opening behavior of native duplexes is still not understood. Hydrogen exchange (HX) experiments can measure the kinetic and equilibrium parameters of base pair opening reactions, but different approaches have led to discrepant datasets and opposing views of nucleic acid structural dynamics. Here, I reexamine the data and resolve these long-standing contradictory views. The conclusion is that the seemingly contradictory datasets characterize two different modes of base pair opening reactions that, for identifiable reasons, are selectively accessed by the different methods and molecular models used. H-T exchange of DNA, duplex RNA, and long synthetic duplexes is dominated by large multi-base-pair openings with reclosing times of milliseconds (kcl ~20/sec) and surprisingly high population (Kop ~10 −2 ). H-H exchange measured by NMR relaxation is limited to the study of small rapidly tumbling oligonucleotides. Their HX is dominated by single base pair openings with reclosing times of microseconds and extremely low population (Kop ~10 −6 ). The different openings are seen selectively by the different methods because small oligonucleotides cannot host the extensive openings, while in large polynucleotides, the minimal population of single base pair openings makes no perceptible contribution to measured HX. The unexpected kinetics, equilibrium occupation, and size of DNA base pair openings are suggestive of rapidly migrating traveling loop wave packets known as solitons that dynamically scan and expose candidate recognition sites.",

Due to evolved resistance, last-resort antibiotics such as the lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-targeting colistin are increasingly used to treat multidrug-resistant isolates. To track the evolution of colistin resistance within a host, we performed sequential oropharyngeal infections in immunocompetent or immune-depleted mice in the presence of inhaled colistin. Both resistant and heteroresistant A. baumannii strains emerged with pmrB mutations that efficiently competed with the susceptible parent in the presence of colistin. These pmrB mutants had a fitness cost in the absence of colistin treatment but retained their ability to colonize the host. In contrast, LOS-deficient A. baumannii mutants removed the target of colistin, but such mutants were unable to colonize the lung. The two pathogenic pmrB mutants showed clear evidence of LOS modification, which was linked to increased transcription of LOS modification enzymes, including the product of the cryptic eptA gene. Spontaneous insertion mutations that caused hyperexpression of eptA allowed the heteroresistant mutant to develop clinically significant colistin resistance. Insertion mutations upstream of the eptA gene or those disrupting hns , which encodes a small histone-like protein, resulted in increased eptA transcript, linking expression of this protein to clinically significant resistance. A resistant variant derived from the heteroresistant parent was stable in the absence of drug, but continued passaging selected for colistin-resensitized pseudorevertants that were largely due to disruption of the LOS modification enzymes. Therefore, colistin heteroresistance is an early stage in the stepwise acquisition of stable colistin resistance in A. baumannii .",

Small molecules that kinetically stabilize the native tetramer effectively inhibit this aggregation. Although over 300 X-ray crystal structures of TTR have been determined, these data refer to a static structure and do not capture the conformational effects of mutations and ligand binding. Here, we demonstrate that hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) and fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) offer critical insights into the conformational dynamics associated with TTR amyloidogenic mutations and the binding of kinetic stabilizers. The results indicate that the design of TTR binders should consider the specific conformational traits of each TTR pathogenic variant.

          "abstract": "Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is critical for advancing our understanding of gene regulation. While single-cell CRISPR perturbation assays such as Perturb-seq provide direct measurements of gene function, the scale of these experiments is limited by cost and feasibility. This motivates the development of computational approaches that can accurately infer responses to unmeasured perturbations from related experimental data. We introduce dbDiffusion, a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder. Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that approximate data distributions by reversing a Markovian diffusion process, progressively denoising Gaussian noise into structured outputs. By exploiting biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations, dbDiffusion enables the conditional generation of gene expressions for previously unobserved perturbations. In contrast to competing approaches, dbDiffusion does not rely on Large Language Model or foundation models, which have been found to yield unsatisfactory results. Rather, it leverages embeddings derived from measured perturbations to generalize to unseen perturbations, effectively transferring information across related experimental conditions. In benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods on Perturb-seq datasets, dbDiffusion demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting perturbation responses. A methodological innovation of dbDiffusion is the integration of prediction-powered inference, which corrects for biases inherent in generative models and enables statistically rigorous downstream tasks, including the identification of differentially expressed genes. By combining deep generative modeling with principled inference, dbDiffusion establishes a scalable computational framework for predicting and analyzing transcriptomic perturbation responses, significantly extending the utility of Perturb-seq experiments.",

Most of the heart’s ATP is produced at the cristae, specialized subcompartments where oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) takes place. In this study, we used multiple-scale electron microscopy approaches to evaluate age-related mitochondrial and ultrastructural alterations of cristae in human and mouse hearts. We found that aged patients’ hearts displayed reduced cristae density as seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), even before any significant decline in the expression of cristae-shaping proteins. Similarly, a multiscale approach that included TEM and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) showed that in aged mice’s hearts, cristae undergo ultrastructural remodeling processes, resulting in a decrease in cristae density and width. Electron tomography suggests an apparent decline in cristae connectivity and an increase in fenestration size. These changes were linked to Opa1 downregulation, accompanied by reduced maximal OXPHOS respiration, but unrelated to alterations in the abundance of OXPHOS core subunits and ATP synthase assembly. Altogether, this indicates that alterations in cristae structure alone are sufficient to impair oxidative metabolism, which highlights its potential as an early signal of cardiac aging, even before noticeable changes in mitochondrial morphology occur.",

Here, we characterize Ceg10, a T4SS-translocated effector, as a nucleus-targeting acetyltransferase that interferes with host ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression. Structural analysis reveals that Ceg10 harbors a conserved Cys-His-Asp (CHD) catalytic triad required for its acetyltransferase activity. Upon nuclear import mediated by the host transport adaptor HEATR3, Ceg10 selectively acetylates the ribosomal protein RPS20 at Thr64, Thr65, and Arg66, which have not been annotated as posttranslational modification sites. This acetylation impairs RPS20’s interaction with RPS29 and 18S rRNA, two components critical for 40S ribosomal subunit assembly, leading to translation inhibition and G1/S cell cycle arrest. These host perturbations are essential for efficient early-stage intracellular replication of L. pneumophila . Our findings identify a distinct mechanism by which a bacterial effector co-opts nuclear import machinery and directly modifies ribosomal proteins to subvert host biosynthesis and cell cycle control, highlighting ribosomal protein acetylation as a hitherto unrecognized role in host–pathogen interactions.",

Barcoding introduces trackable diversity to otherwise isogenic bacterial populations. Comparing the barcodes within an inoculum to those within the host quantifies the “founding population,” which reveals the magnitude of population collapse caused by host bottlenecks. Furthermore, comparisons of the founders between tissues can reveal the patterns of pathogen dissemination. On longer timescales, the emergence of dominant barcoded lineages can also be used to detect within-host evolution. Collectively, barcoding studies quantify the hidden parameters that underlie bacterial colonization and create a quantitative framework for modeling and preventing infectious disease.",

However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges understanding of the mechanisms determining properties such as mobility. Here, we investigate interlayer exciton diffusion in WSe 2 /WS 2 heterobilayers at ultra-low exciton density and low temperatures to examine how charges affect exciton mobility. Remarkably, near the electronic Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant thousand-fold enhancement of exciton diffusion relative to charge neutrality. We attribute this to mobile valence holes, which experience a suppressed moiré potential due to charge order and recombine non-monogamously with conduction electrons. Our results show exciton diffusion as a probe of correlated electron states and Bose–Fermi interplay.",

          "abstract": "Understanding nonadiabatic carrier-lattice interactions at the atomic scale remains a fundamental challenge, yet these processes govern energy transfer in materials and ultimately set limits in microelectronics. We combined attosecond core-level transient absorption spectroscopy with many-body theory to uncover how nonadiabatic electron-phonon coupling drives ultrafast relaxations in a titanium-carbide MXene. Phonon-driven changes in carrier localization modulated local field effects (LFEs), yielding carrier-, site-, and orbital-specific absorption signatures. LFEs served as sensitive fingerprints of electron-phonon coupling strength across the phonon spectrum and revealed a breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation: Electrons lagged lattice oscillations by 32 ± 8 femtoseconds, whereas holes responded almost instantaneously (7 ± 7 femtoseconds). Our results establish a framework for probing and controlling nonadiabatic carrier-phonon interactions with orbital and site specificity.",

Orange usurper and blue mate-guarder morphs are associated with two divergent haplotypes in the regulatory region of the sepiapterin reductase gene, but yellow sneaker morphs appear to arise through phenotypic plasticity from the same genetic background as blue morphs. Our simulations show that rock-paper-scissors dynamics can better maintain a polymorphism with a genetic system of two alleles plus plasticity than with a three-allele system. This form of balancing selection that combines genetic determination with phenotypic plasticity expands the possibilities for how stable polymorphisms arise in nature.",

However, the challenging reduction of benchmark iron salts to active species hinders their application in reductive transformations. In this work, we report a photochemical strategy that exploits the innate reactivity of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states of iron oxalate complexes to harness oxalate salts as latent terminal two-electron reductants in iron catalysis. The investigation of this activation mode has led to the development of a versatile catalytic platform enabling transformations hitherto inaccessible to previous iron catalyst systems. The synthetic value of this tactic is demonstrated on diverse reductive transformations using readily available building blocks with high chemoselectivity, opening new synthetic opportunities.",

The event was caused by an object with 0.219 − 0.046 + 0.075 Jupiter masses that is either gravitationally unbound or on a very wide orbit. Through comparison with the statistical properties of other observed microlensing events and predictions from simulations, we infer that this object likely formed in a protoplanetary disk (like a planet), not in isolation (like a brown dwarf).

Also, some common PA molecules weakly bonded to ITO can desorb and react with perovskites. We synthesized a bis(diarylamino)biphenyl-based PA that binds more strongly to ITO and show that its use in PSCs led to an operational lifetime of nearly 3000 hours with 10% efficiency loss (T 90 ) at 85°C under a metal halide lamp (including ultraviolet light) with maximum power point tracking.

Population variation in the growth rate and potential of mutant clones suggests that genetic factors may confer resilience against CH. Here, we identified a noncoding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by selectively down-regulating the RNA-binding protein MSI2 in HSCs. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncovered an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk. Variant rs17834140-T was associated with slower CH expansion, and stem cell MSI2 levels modified ASXL1 -mutant HSC clonal dominance. These findings leverage natural resilience to illuminate posttranscriptional regulation in human HSCs, suggesting that inhibition of MSI2 or its targets could be rational strategies for blood cancer prevention.",

SWIFT is necessary and sufficient for direct engagement with the transactivation domain of PU.1. A single amino acid mutation disrupts PU.1-mSWI/SNF binding, impairs complex targeting, and attenuates oncogenic transcription and proliferation in PU.1-dependent cancer cells. Dominant expression of the SWIFT domain in isolation sequesters TFs from mSWI/SNF and poisons TF-addicted cancer cells. Finally, TFs across diverse families interact with SMARCD paralog-specific SWIFT domains. These results define a major mechanism of cell type- and disease-specific mSWI/SNF chromatin targeting and inform approaches toward therapeutic modulation.",

Our analyses demonstrate that free-living and domestic pigs in Wallacea and Oceania have diverse ancestries resulting from the introduction of multiple sequential pig populations followed by gene flow. Despite the variability in their genomic ancestry, these pigs all have a distinct tooth morphology as well as a genetic link to the Chinese domestic pig populations that accompanied the dispersal of Austronesian language speakers ~4000 to 3000 years ago via Taiwan and the Philippines.",

Polymorphism can be maintained by social selection if competitive interactions allow each morph to increase in frequency when rare.

We show that the origin and adaptive spread of a sexually selected syndrome in common wall lizards ( Podarcis muralis ) selectively eliminates alleles coding for alternative color morphs that have been maintained for millions of years. The results demonstrate how the arrival of a novel phenotype can disrupt balancing selection, providing a link between rapid phenotypic evolution and the loss of color polymorphisms.",

We designed protein homotrimers regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drug amantadine and further designed amantadine-responsive heterodimers and heterotrimers. Biophysical characterization confirmed their amantadine-dependent assembly, and their crystal structures closely matched the design models.

Detecting this bias is challenging because the research process is not normally part of an observed experimental setting. Our study exploits an opportunity to observe 158 researchers working independently in 71 teams during an experiment. After being asked their position on immigration policy, they used the same data to answer the same empirical question: Does immigration affect public support for social welfare programs? The researchers estimated 1253 alternative regression models, and the estimated impacts ranged from strongly negative to strongly positive. We find that teams composed of pro-immigration researchers estimated more positive impacts of immigration on public support for social programs, while anti-immigration teams estimated more negative impacts. The differences arise because different teams adopted different model specifications. The underlying research design decisions are the mechanism through which ideology enters the process of producing parameter estimates.",

These introgressions altered root exudate chemistry, resulting in distinct microbial assemblies and enhanced nitrogen retention. We identified candidate loci and exudate metabolites responsible for suppressive activity and demonstrated their functional effects in vitro.

The strength of normalization is highly heterogeneous across neurons, and this heterogeneity correlates with attention-mediated modulations in neural responses. However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneous normalization strength is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. Our model reveals that the heterogeneity of normalization strength is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. The correlation between inhibition and other synaptic inputs explains the experimentally observed dependence of spike count correlations on normalization strength. Further, we find that neurons with stronger normalization encode information more efficiently, and that networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode visual stimuli with higher information and capacity. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex and sheds light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Autoimmune uveitis (AU) is a category of sight-threatening diseases with different pathological causes. Transcriptomic analysis of patients with AU revealed a highly oxidative stress profile as well as an up-regulated apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) expression in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, single-cell RNA sequencing of retinal microglia also identified an up-regulated expression of APOE in a murine model of experimental AU (EAU). Our results and others previously suggested that microglia are tightly associated with the development of AU. Meanwhile, although APOE has been reported to play a myriad of functions ranging from lipid metabolism to neural regeneration, little is known about its detailed mechanism in the development of AU. In this study, a murine EAU model was used to investigate the association between APOE , microglia, and EAU, and it is found that APOE is indispensable for EAU induction as APOE −/− mice failed to develop EAU. In vitro studies using microglial cells further demonstrated that APOE is positively corelated with microglial inflammation, which could be reversed by knocking down APOE using short hairpin RNA. Proteomic analysis indicated that APOE -mediated microglial activation relies on reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway, through peptidyl prolyl isomerase F ( PPIF ), which was further verified in PBMCs derived from patients with AU. Supplementation of PPIF reverses APOE deficiency–caused ROS activation in vitro. In addition, Adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of PPIF exacerbated EAU phenotype, suggesting its important role in driving uveitis initiation. These results provide an understanding of APOE and PPIF in the pathogenesis of uveitis.",

          "abstract": "The Younger Dryas (YD) cold event is widely attributed to a disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), driven by the catastrophic Lake Agassiz flood. While recent studies have pinpointed the source and timing of this meltwater pulse, it remains controversial whether this freshwater event alone could have caused a millennial-scale cold period. Biomarker reconstructions from the Labrador Sea/Baffin Bay reveal an abrupt sea ice decline during the mid-YD, parallel with partial AMOC recovery and enhanced Irminger Current inflow. This warm water incursion may have initiated Heinrich Event 0, likely causing surface freshening in subpolar North Atlantic and subsequently triggering a second AMOC decline during the late YD. Model simulations further support a two-phase AMOC weakening associated with surface freshening during the YD. Our biphasic freshwater injection hypothesis provides fresh insights into the mechanisms driving the YD and underscores the critical role of surface freshening in the subpolar North Atlantic in shaping deglacial abrupt climate changes.",

Traditional Bayesian DA methods enforce these nonlinear, flow-dependent physical constraints through empirical and tunable covariance structures, but with limited accuracy and robustness. Here, we introduce latent DA (LDA), a framework that performs Bayesian DA in a latent space learned from multivariate global atmospheric data via an autoencoder. We demonstrate that the autoencoder can largely capture nonlinear physical relationships, enabling LDA to produce balanced analyses without explicitly modeling physical constraints. Assimilation in latent space also improves both analysis quality and forecast skill compared to traditional model-space DA, under both idealized and real observational settings. Furthermore, LDA exhibits strong robustness across latent dimensions and remains effective even when the autoencoder is trained on inaccurate but physically realistic forecasts, highlighting its flexibility for real-world applications.",

Here, we show that episodes of extreme moist heat and severe convection frequently co-occur across midlatitude land regions and develop a theoretical framework that links their maximum intensities to preexisting low-level energy inversions in the atmosphere. By accounting for the stored-energy nature of midlatitude severe convection, where near-surface moist heat and atmospheric instability accumulate before convection initiates, our work advances the understanding of convective constraints on extreme heat events. The theory identifies low-level inversions as a critical factor shaping compound extreme heat and convective weather risks and offers a pathway for improving the modeling and future projection of these events and their co-occurrence.",

This architecture simultaneously enhances the elastic rebound stiffness of the composite and suppresses interfacial slippage, leading to a notable reduction in system-level hysteresis. A strain rate–dependent evaluation framework is proposed to systematically quantify dynamic hysteresis variability. The resulting sensor exhibits outstanding performance under extreme mechanical conditions, including 100% peak strain and strain rates up to 50% per second, maintaining a failure range below 1%. Moreover, the sensor demonstrates high linearity [coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) = 0.9998], an extended sensing range exceeding 200%, and superior mechanical durability.

We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system’s short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semimetal and a SU(3)-antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality.

To establish contact, cells generate pushing forces through branched actin polymerization mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, followed by the reinforcement of mechanosensitive AJs in response to actomyosin contractility. To investigate how AJ proteins coordinate these events, we combined kinetic assays of actin polymerization, single actin filament observation in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro reconstitution of AJ mechanosensitivity. Our findings show that actomyosin contractility alone is sufficient to trigger the hierarchical assembly of the AJ mechanosensitive proteins α-catenin, vinculin, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Once assembled, these proteins act synergistically to promote actin filament nucleation, elongation, and bundling. The α-catenin-vinculin-VASP machinery inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin branching and instead promotes the myosin-dependent assembly of actin bundles. Together, these results reveal how AJs integrate actin assembly, actomyosin contractility, and mechanosensitivity in a feedback loop.",

Daily vaginal cytology, hormone measurements, and histological analysis demonstrated that the encapsulated xenografts integrated into the murine hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis and responded to circulating gonadotropins. Without exogenous stimulation, regular estrous cyclicity resumed 12 weeks postimplantation, and mice experienced three to eight estrous cycles in 20 weeks. Large antral follicles, ~3 millimeters in diameter, were present in the grafts, consistent with regular cyclicity and increasing levels of estradiol that reached 50 picograms per milliliter, demonstrating integration with the host physiology and restoration of ovarian endocrine function, similar to the nonencapsulated controls.",

Present work proposes and verifies a strategy of multidentate carbodithioate-lead chelation (MCLC), which is able to form a robust one-dimensional structure at the GBs, not only reducing interfacial defects and residual stress but also enhancing interfacial carrier transport in perovskite while substantially improving the photothermal and operational stabilities of PSCs. It was further demonstrated that bifacial modification at both top and buried interfaces of perovskite using MCLC strategy achieved PSCs with a high power conversion efficiency up to 26.15% (certified value of 25.75%) and 24.89% for 1-cm 2 -area device. The device retains 90.1% of its initial efficiency after 1700 hours of maximum power point tracking under illumination.",

However, immune responses vary even among genetically similar or related individuals, shaped by inherited and noninherited factors. Using Caenorhabditis elegans , we found that pathogen susceptibility can be predicted by preinfection biomarkers. Individuals with high-basal expression of irg-5 , an infection response gene regulated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (PMK-1) pathway, were more susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. A genome-wide screen identified the myeloid ecotropic viral integration site-1 (MEIS) homeobox protein UNC-62 as a regulator of irg-5 expression, acting through PMK-1 and GATA binding erythroid-like transcription factor (ELT-2). Further analysis revealed that maternal circadian timing shaped offspring immune heterogeneity and inhibition of clock genes eliminated the effects induced by maternal timing.

Heterogeneity in red blood cell (RBC) properties within and across individuals has hindered our ability to establish the multiscale mechanisms driving pathological flow dynamics in such diseases. To address this, we develop microfluidic platforms to measure RBC properties and flow dynamics in the same blood samples from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We find that effective blood viscosity across individuals is explained by the proportion of stiff RBCs, exhibiting qualitative similarities to rigid-particle suspensions, despite considerable mechanical heterogeneity. By combining simulations with spatially resolved measurements of cell dynamics, we show how features of emergent rheology are governed by spatiotemporal cell organization, via margination at intermediate oxygen tensions, and localized jamming caused by spatial hematocrit variations under hypoxia. Our work defines the suspension physics underlying pathological blood flow in SCD and, more broadly, emergent rheology in heterogeneous particle suspensions.",

High EMT gradients characterize functional MSC subsets that functions as niche supporting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), while attenuation of the EMT program impairs HSC support and reproduced in degenerative hematological disorders. Notably, enhancing the EMT program in MSCs (aEMT-MSCs) markedly augments their capacity to promote HSC regeneration and restores defective niches in patients with aplastic anemia. Furthermore, the regenerative effects of aEMT-MSCs extend beyond hematopoiesis to neuronal and cardiovascular tissues, suggesting a conserved niche-supporting program across multiple tissue systems.

ABCA1 activity increases anticancer functions of macrophages: enhancing tumor infiltration, decreasing angiogenic potential, reducing efferocytosis, and improving support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K-dependent and PI3K-independent mechanisms. Highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings are correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential, VEGFA , and CD8 T cell abundance and activity. The culmination of these activities was demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice lacking MC-expressed ABCA1.

However, how LPS binding drives caspase-4/11 activation remains unclear. Here, we show that caspase-4/11 CARDs are intrinsically unstructured in their resting state and adopt an α-helical conformation upon LPS engagement. This structural rearrangement promotes CARD oligomerization, with electron-capture charge reduction–coupled native mass spectrometry and other techniques illustrating that hexa-acylated LPS induces the formation of large oligomers composed of eight or more protomers, whereas underacylated lipids trigger smaller assemblies. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we identified a hydrophobic cleft critical for LPS binding and potential intersubunit interfaces that facilitate oligomerization.

Cryo–electron microscopy reveals that FcRL5 optimally engages two Fcγ molecules positioned at a 60° angle, with its D1-D2 domains binding to the first Fcγ molecule, while its D3 domain arches over the second Fcγ. This distinctive binding capability enables FcRL5 to specifically recognize IgG immune complexes (ICs), with the binding strength correlating with IgG concentration in the ICs. In addition, we demonstrate that FcRL5 can internalize the IgG polymer and IC. These results shed light on FcRL5 function and reveal a unique Fcγ-FcγR binding mode governed by avidity.",

These mice, termed SuSe (suicidal senescence), were crossed with the mouse mammary tumor virus–polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) model of breast cancer. Functional characterization in SuSe/PyMT mice confirmed that depletion of senescent cells (senolysis) in early and late lesions accelerated and decelerated tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. Tumor acceleration was attributed to expansion of immunosuppressive, protumorigenic macrophages. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 was identified as an autocrine chemokine essential for their recruitment and maintenance. Depletion of these macrophages reversed the effects of senescent cell clearance, rendering senolysis antitumorigenic even at early stages.

This protective effect was mediated in part by the up-regulation of PD-L1 on dendritic cells, which in turn dampened the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17A by T helper 17 cells post-HCT. L. johnsonii also reduced Tgfb1 expression in lung macrophages. These anti-fibrotic effects of heat-killed L. johnsonii were absent in PD-1–deficient mice, highlighting the role of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. Further analysis showed that dendritic cells uniquely recognized L. johnsonii and increased PD-L1 expression via TLR1/2- and TLR9-MyD88 pathways.

Precise phase modulation of incident waves enables efficient particle conveyance through continuous displacement of standing-wave pressure nodes or antinodes, leveraging the radiation forces from topologically protected standing waves in scattering systems.

Sequencing of 16 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons showed enrichment in sequences affiliated with copiotrophs, specialized hydrocarbon degraders, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts. Symbiodiniaceae sequence reads consistently peaked at midday. Cell counts by flow cytometry revealed that reef water contained 20 to 60% fewer bacteria and up to 75% fewer microalgae than adjacent open seawaters. In winter, cell drawdown was often more pronounced at dusk, while summer cell density showed no consistent diel pattern. Heterotrophic protist densities increased up to 80% in reef water at night, suggesting predation as a regulatory force on microbial populations. Our findings show that the reef not only reshapes microbial communities but also imposes a pronounced diel structure on planktonic life.",

The mechanical consequences of these events and resulting local dynamics at the replication fork are not well understood. To address these issues, we developed a transverse DNA flow-stretching approach to spatially resolve the parental, leading, and lagging strands in real time. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, this approach revealed bursts of high-speed replisome rotation that support continuous DNA synthesis. Unexpectedly, excessive rotation does not reduce replisome speed, but increases pausing, reduces processivity, and increases the number of polymerases. Together, our observations reveal intrinsic pathways to overcome challenges posed by unfavorable DNA topologies during DNA replication.",

Relative to SPEAR, Hybrid CPL systematically reduces seasonal forecast errors in the Arctic and considerably reduces Antarctic errors for target months May to December, with &gt;2× error reduction in 4- to 6-month lead forecasts of Antarctic winter sea ice extent. Meanwhile, Hybrid IO suffers from out-of-sample behavior that can trigger a chain of Southern Ocean feedbacks, leading to ice-free Antarctic summers.

As a proof of concept, we used the Ra1 aptamer targeting Ras and the DNA ligand specific for p65 or E2F1 to construct anchoring aptamers. Simultaneous binding of the anchoring aptamers to Ras and either p65 or E2F1 effectively induces cytoplasmic relocalization and functional inactivation of p65 or E2F1.

Loss of LRP function leads to increased 5′-3′ gene looping, reduced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy at the FLC locus, thereby increasing FLC transcription and delaying flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana . Furthermore, site-specific phosphorylation of LRP at serine 17, mediated by the kinase PRP4KA, is essential for LRP protein stability and its function in preventing FLC chromatin looping and Pol II recruitment. Our findings reveal that site-specific phosphorylation of LRP by PRP4KA precludes FLC gene loop formation, constituting a key mechanism for FLC transcriptional repression to ensure timely flowering.",

          "abstract": "(Macro)autophagy is a conserved cellular degradation pathway that delivers substrates to lysosomes via autophagosomes. Among various physiological stimuli, nutrient starvation is the most potent inducer of autophagy. In response to starvation, transcription factor EB (TFEB) is activated and up-regulates a broad set of autophagy-related genes. However, the mechanisms by which TFEB promotes autophagosome biogenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that TFEB-mediated transcriptional induction of sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; p62) triggers the formation of SQSTM1-positive bodies that recruit essential autophagy factors, thereby initiating autophagosome biogenesis. Genetic disruption of TFEB-dependent SQSTM1 regulation markedly impairs starvation-induced autophagy, underscoring the critical role of the TFEB-SQSTM1 axis in the autophagic response to nutrient stress. Furthermore, we show that these SQSTM1 bodies contain ubiquitinated ribosomal proteins and that TFEB promotes ribosomal protein ubiquitination by inducing the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNF598. Collectively, our findings uncover a transcriptionally coordinated mechanism that regulates both autophagosome biogenesis and substrate ubiquitination, facilitating efficient cargo clearance during starvation-induced autophagy.",

Magnetic soft continuum robots (mSCRs) offer promising solutions to these key questions.

This is performed with electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH)–assisted ohmic start-up and sufficiently high initial neutral density.

Lake Bonneville was the largest Pleistocene lake in western North America, with a maximum surface area of ~52,000 km 2 , before shrinking markedly to become the modern Great Salt Lake. After more than a century of study, the balance between enhanced precipitation and reduced evaporation as drivers of lake growth continues to be debated. Multiple studies identify precipitation as the main factor associated with the highest lake levels, but most proxies provide an estimate of net evaporation and cannot independently resolve precipitation from evaporation. Therefore, factors associated with lake size, growth, and retreat remain uncertain. This study uses the thermodynamically based carbonate clumped isotope geothermometer to estimate temperature, evaporation, and precipitation at Lake Bonneville from 23 to 16 thousand years ago (ka). Clumped isotope derived constraints on hydroclimate are also applied to assess the accuracy of regional climate model outputs. During transgressive and open phases of the lake, we find that regional and large-scale precipitation delivery were the driving factors of lake expansion. In contrast, at its maximum extent (~17.5 ka), Lake Bonneville was maintained via suppressed evaporation rates at 50% relative to modern while precipitation rates were similar to modern levels.",

Transcriptomic and protein analyses revealed that vacuolinC is specifically induced in response to EsxA-mediated damage. Vacuolins initially associate with the MCV in a patchy distribution, coinciding with sterol-rich microdomain formation before entirely coating the MCV. Functional assays demonstrate that membrane microdomains potentiate l -leucyl– l -leucine methyl ester and EsxA-mediated membrane damage. Knockout of vacuolins and sterol depletion drastically reduce EsxA partitioning into membranes in vitro and decrease MCV damage and Mm escape to the cytosol, thereby substantially impairing Mm intracellular growth and phenocopying in Dd and microglial cells the attenuation of the Mm ΔRD1 mutant lacking ESX-1.

The theoretical model predicts that the choice of a new direction is determined by the competition between the cellular protrusions in the form of seesaw oscillations. We found that macrophages and endothelial cells display different regimes moving on hexagonal networks, despite sharing a mesenchymal (i.e., adhesion-dependent) migratory strategy. The model describes the motility of both cell types and reveals a trade-off between branching and speed: Having many protrusions allows local microenvironmental exploration for directional cues, but long-range migration efficiency improves with fewer protrusions.

          "abstract": "Galectin-3, a β-galactoside–binding lectin, has been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, the significance of circulating Galectin-3 in type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unclear. Here, we report that compared to healthy controls, patients with T1D and their first-degree relatives (FDRs) exhibited significantly increased serum Galectin-3 levels primarily produced and secreted by monocytes/macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition (TD139) as well as knockout of Galectin-3 gene both attenuated Galectin-3–mediated suppression of regulatory T cells (T reg cells) and protected from insulitis and diabetes onset in NOD mice. Mechanistically, Galectin-3 bound to and activated lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), a receptor expressed on activated T cells, subsequently suppressing the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and thereby hindering T reg cell differentiation and function. In summary, our study identifies Galectin-3 as a potential biomarker for T1D and suggests that TD139 holds promise as a therapeutic candidate for patients with T1D and high serum Galectin-3 levels.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocyte polyploidization promotes liver homeostasis by enhancing resistance to cellular stress. Caspase-2, a proapoptotic protease, restricts polyploidization by deleting polyploid and aneuploid cells. While caspase-2 protects against diet-induced hepatic injury, it also acts as a tumor suppressor by controlling genomic instability and oxidative stress. To investigate these roles, we assessed hepatic ploidy dynamics, liver damage, and age-associated tumorigenesis in caspase-2–deficient and catalytically inactive mutant mice. We found that caspase-2 loss promotes early-onset hepatocyte hyperpolyploidy, accompanied by progressive liver inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative liver damage, ferroptosis, and higher incidence of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma in aged animals. Proteomic profiling revealed a pathogenic polyploidy–associated signature associated with caspase-2 deficiency and increased predisposition to liver disease and malignancy. These findings establish caspase-2 enzymatic activity as a critical regulator of hepatic genome stability and preventing age-related liver cancer that strongly argue against therapeutic caspase-2 inhibition as a strategy for managing liver injury or cancer risk.",

          "authors": "Karl Palmås, Nicholas Surber",
          "abstract": "This article studies how professionals managing chemicals orient themselves in relation to uncertain regulatory futures. Specifically, it interrogates how these professionals strategically use and evaluate a particular device: A list of substances that are deemed likely to become restricted through the European Union REACH legislation. Adopting Jens Beckert’s program of fictional expectations to describe this phenomenon, the article seeks to extend this program by introducing the term “regulatory fictions.” As a second contribution, the article also interrogates how such fictions about imagined regulatory futures are made credible. Further, as a third contribution, the article places the fictional expectations program in relation to ongoing debates about soft regulation. In so doing, it connects Beckert’s micro-level account of strategic economic action with wider politico-economic concerns about the dynamism and regulation of markets.",

          "authors": "Leila Davis, Charalampos Konstantinidis",
          "abstract": "In this article, we analyze the intersection of asset market participation and inter-class wealth inequality in the United States by showing that working-class households earn lower rates of return on their assets than non-working-class households. We, first, operationalize an empirical definition of working-class status using the Survey of Consumer Finances for 1989–2022. Using this classification, we, second, document that inter-class income and wealth inequality have risen since 1989. Third, we show that, with the exception of business assets, working-class households hold similar asset classes as non-working-class households and receive financial income. However, working-class households receive a 2.5 percentage point lower average rate of return than non-working-class households, conditional on observable demographic and economic differences across classes. This gap reflects differential returns on businesses and real estate. These results suggest that expanded asset market access in the US has conferred unequal benefits by class status and widened inequalities along class lines.",

          "title": "From compression to dispersion: how union transformation reconfigures wage inequality in the knowledge economy",
          "authors": "Young-hwan Byun, Tomas Korpi",
          "abstract": "How do unions mediate wage inequality in knowledge economies marked by rising educational stratification? This article investigates how shifts in the educational composition of union membership shape union bargaining outcomes—particularly, the education premium, a key driver of contemporary wage dispersion. While union bargaining is often associated with wage compression, we argue that this association is contingent on intra-union membership dynamics. Drawing on original panel data for thirty-three advanced economies from 2002 to 2020, we find that unionization of tertiary-educated workers initially reduces the education premium. However, once the median union member is college-educated, union bargaining begins to increase the education premium. These findings suggest that unions, as evolving organizational actors, may shift from redistributive to stratifying institutions depending on membership composition. Cross-national variation—notably in Scandinavia and Japan—underscores how union capacity to integrate highly educated workers without losing traditional constituencies is central to wage inequality in post-industrial economies.",
