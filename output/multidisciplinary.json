          "abstract": "A key challenge for ecological science is to understand how biodiversity loss is changing ecosystem structure and function at scales that are relevant for policy 1 . Almost all biodiversity metrics are challenging to disaggregate into animal-mediated ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersal, and predation. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics approach 2 as a physically meaningful method of translating animal species composition into a suite of ecosystem functions. Drawing on new datasets that estimate biodiversity intactness and species population densities 3–5 , we quantify historical changes to energy flows through mammal- and bird-mediated ecosystem functions across sub-Saharan Africa. In total, trophic energy flows have decreased by more than one-third. The pattern of decreasing function varies by historical biome, driven by arboreal birds and primates in forests, terrestrial herbivores in grassy systems, and burrowing mammals in arid systems. Functions performed by megafauna in particular have collapsed outside protected areas. Compared with other biodiversity metrics, an energetics approach highlights the ecological importance of smaller animals and keystone species. The results can help practitioners conserve and restore functionally diverse, energetically intact ecosystems across land uses and biomes. By relating biodiversity intactness to energy and material flows, ecosystem energetics can also advance efforts to integrate animal-driven functions into biosphere and earth system models, helping us to understand possible regional or planetary boundaries 6 for biodiversity.",

Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature’, here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. In a new adult motor cortex neuronal in vitro screen 2 , thiorphan increased neurite outgrowth 1.8-fold ( P &lt; 0.001). We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function ( P &lt; 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration ( P &lt; 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human. These findings represent a new path for drug discovery, starting from in silico screens to proof-of-concept in adult human brain cultures.",

          "abstract": "Muscular systems 1 , the fundamental components of mobility in animals, have sparked innovations across technological and medical fields 2,3 . Yet artificial muscles suffer from dynamic programmability, scalability and responsiveness owing to complex actuation mechanisms and demanding material requirements. Here we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing more than 10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of approximately 3,000 microbubbles per mm 2 , a low weight of 0.047 mg mm −2 , a substantial force intensity of approximately 7.6 μN mm −2 and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micrometre to centimetre scale), exceptional compliance and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attaching to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments. The customizable artificial muscles could offer both immediate and long-term impact on soft robotics, wearable technologies, haptics and biomedical instrumentation.",

          "abstract": "Somatic chromosome instability results in widespread structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) during cancer evolution 1–3 . Although CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypia 4–7 , the underlying processes and rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells are underexplored. Here we introduce machine-learning-assisted genomics and imaging convergence (MAGIC)—an autonomously operated platform that integrates live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning on-the-fly and single-cell genomics to systematically investigate CA formation. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track de novo CAs over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as initiating events. We determine the baseline CA mutation rate, which approximately doubles in TP53 -deficient cells, and observe that chromosome losses arise more frequently than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosome arms triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, coordinated segregation and amplification of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, as well as complex CA outcomes, influenced by the chromosomal break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The experimentation enabled by MAGIC advances the dissection of DNA rearrangement processes, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability.",

          "abstract": "When electrons in metals act collectively, they enable emergent phenomena and electronic functionalities that transcend the behaviour of individual particles 1 . Coherent collective charge motion has so far been observed primarily in superconductors, in which it arises with the formation of Cooper pairs 2,3 . Here we report experimental evidence for coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 , indicative of a distinct collective electronic state. The signature is a set of magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic crystalline pillars under in-plane magnetic fields, with a periodicity determined by the number of magnetic flux quanta h / e threading between adjacent kagome layers—effectively forming an interlayer Aharonov–Bohm interferometer. The cooperative nature of this phenomenon is evidenced by a non-analytic angular dependence characterized by abrupt transitions between discrete oscillation frequencies and its persistence over length scales that exceed the single-particle mean free path. Notably, the oscillation amplitude matches other anomalous electronic responses reported in CsV 3 Sb 5 , pointing to an underlying mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. These findings shed new light on the debated nature of correlated order in kagome metals and establish CsV 3 Sb 5 as a platform for realizing long-range coherent charge transport in the absence of superconductivity—opening new directions for coherence in correlated electron systems beyond conventional models.",

          "abstract": "Oat grain is a traditional human food that is rich in dietary fibre and contributes to improved human health 1,2 . Interest in the crop has surged in recent years owing to its use as the basis for plant-based milk analogues 3 . Oat is an allohexaploid with a large, repeat-rich genome that was shaped by subgenome exchanges over evolutionary timescales 4 . In contrast to many other cereal species, genomic research in oat is still at an early stage, and surveys of structural genome diversity and gene expression variability are scarce. Here we present annotated chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of 33 wild and domesticated oat lines, along with an atlas of gene expression across 6 tissues of different developmental stages in 23 of these lines. We construct an atlas of gene-expression diversity across subgenomes, accessions and tissues. Gene loss in the hexaploid is accompanied by compensatory upregulation of the remaining homeologues, but this process is constrained by subgenome divergence. Chromosomal rearrangements have substantially affected recent oat breeding. A large pericentric inversion associated with early flowering explains distorted segregation on chromosome 7D and a homeologous sequence exchange between chromosomes 2A and 2C in a semi-dwarf mutant has risen to prominence in Australian elite varieties. The oat pangenome will promote the adoption of genomic approaches to understanding the evolution and adaptation of domesticated oats and will accelerate their improvement.",

          "abstract": "Each year, snakebite envenoming claims thousands of lives and causes severe injury to victims across sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom depend on antivenoms derived from animal plasma as their sole treatment option 1 . Traditional antivenoms are expensive, can cause adverse immunological reactions, offer limited efficacy against local tissue damage and are often ineffective against all medically relevant snake species 2 . There is thus an urgent unmet medical need for innovation in snakebite envenoming therapy. However, developing broad-spectrum treatments is highly challenging owing to the vast diversity of venomous snakes and the complex and variable composition of their venoms 3 . Here we addressed this challenge by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and a rinkhals, constructing phage display libraries, and identifying high-affinity broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We combined eight of these nanobodies into a defined oligoclonal mixture, resulting in an experimental polyvalent recombinant antivenom that was capable of neutralizing seven toxin families or subfamilies. This antivenom effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species and markedly reduced venom-induced dermonecrosis for all tested cytotoxic venoms. The recombinant antivenom performed better than a currently used plasma-derived antivenom and therefore shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids.",

          "abstract": "The iron and steel sector is central to national net-zero efforts but remains hard to abate 1,2 . Existing decarbonization roadmaps fail to guide technology choices for individual plants, given their heterogeneity and economic constraints 3–5 . Here, by integrating two global plant-level datasets and forecasted technology costs, we develop a model to identify the least-cost technology pathway for each plant worldwide in alignment with national carbon-neutrality targets. In the short term (pre-2030), energy efficiency improvements and scrap reuse are the cheapest decarbonization strategies, reducing cumulative global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by 7.8 Gt and 7.2 Gt at average costs of –US$8.5 tCO 2 −1 and US$0.3 tCO 2 −1 , respectively. In the long term (after 2030), smelt reduction with carbon capture is expected to become technically mature and economically viable, achieving approximately 6.0 Gt of CO 2 reductions at costs of US$7–15 tCO 2 −1 in Chinese plants and US$26–75 tCO 2 −1 in plants across Japan, Korea and Europe. After 2040, green-hydrogen-based steelmaking is estimated to contribute an additional 0.3 Gt of CO 2 abatement in European plants at costs of US$27–44 tCO 2 −1 . This study tailors plant-specific least-cost technology pathways that reconcile stakeholders’ economic interests with climate objectives, enabling actionable decarbonization strategies and supporting global net-zero targets.",

          "abstract": "Close-in transiting sub-Neptunes are abundant in our Galaxy 1 . Planetary interior models based on their observed radius–mass relationship suggest that sub-Neptunes contain a discernible amount of either hydrogen (dry planets) or water (wet planets) blanketing a core composed of rocks and metal 2 . Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits 3 . Here we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm, dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that release silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing an appreciable amount of water up to a few tens of weight per cent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation 4,5 . Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.",

          "abstract": "In artificial neural networks, acquiring new knowledge often interferes with existing knowledge. Here, although it is commonly claimed that humans overcome this challenge, we find surprisingly similar patterns of interference across both types of learner. When learning sequential rule-based tasks (A–B–A), both learners benefit more from prior knowledge when the tasks are similar—but as a result, they also exhibit greater interference when retested on task A. In networks, this arises from reusing previously learned representations, which accelerates new learning at the cost of overwriting prior knowledge. In humans, we also observe individual differences: one group (‘lumpers’) shows more interference alongside better transfer, while another (‘splitters’) avoids interference at the cost of worse transfer. These behavioural profiles are mirrored in neural networks trained in the rich (lumper) or lazy (splitter) regimes, encouraging overlapping or distinct representations respectively. Together, these findings reveal shared computational trade-offs between transferring knowledge and avoiding interference in humans and artificial neural networks.",

          "abstract": "China’s emergence as one of the world’s top producers of high-quality science raises critical questions about its trajectory toward achieving scientific leadership. Traditional methods for evaluating the power of national scientific ecosystems, however, often overlook the nuances of a country’s global influence. In this perspective, we introduce a framework that highlights shifting power dynamics in international scientific collaborations, focusing on whether leadership positions in international scientific teams are moving from one country to another. Using rich sociological data from nearly 6 million scientific publications, we document a marked shift in team leadership from Western countries to China. In particular, the share of team leaders involved in U.S-China scientific collaborations that were affiliated with Chinese institutions grew from 30% of the total in 2010 to 45% in 2023. We further explore the implications of China’s rise by forecasting when Chinese scientists are projected to achieve parity in leadership vis-à-vis the United States, including in 11 critical technology areas that are focal points of technological development, and by analyzing how a potential decoupling of U.S.-Chinese science might affect Chinese scientific leadership. We conclude by considering the impacts of China’s growing investments in the training of young scientists in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.",

          "abstract": "The movement patterns of animals while searching for food have been studied extensively in recent decades. However, although human search behavior has existed since the beginning of civilization, not much is known about human search patterns, particularly regarding strategies that yield higher efficiency. Although most humans no longer need to gather and hunt in the wild, human searching remains prevalent in modern times. A common example of human searching is performed by taxi drivers looking for passengers in a city. Here, we analyze GPS data of taxi drivers in three major cities over different time periods and find that when drivers search for passengers, the higher is their efficiency, the slower is their searching, and they tend to make more short-distance turns during the search. Our study further indicates that individuals are characterized by a specific level of efficiency, and thus, efficient drivers are consistently efficient across different days as they follow their own search strategies. Interestingly, only about 10% of drivers adopt the most efficient strategy, earning nearly 20% more than the average driver. Our findings shed light on human search behavior, a fundamental aspect of human decision-making in competitive and fast-paced environments.",

          "abstract": "Cigarette butts are widely discarded in urban green spaces, yet their microbial health risks remain poorly understood. In a nationwide survey across China, we investigated the presence, sources, health risks, and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potential pathogens in discarded cigarette butts. Shotgun metagenomic and full-length 16S ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that cigarette butts harbored significantly higher abundances of ARGs and bacterial pathogens than plant litter or soil. Health risk assessment further showed that cigarette butts carried ARGs with greater mobility, clinical relevance, and pathogenic potential. Genomic analyses highlighted enrichment of ARG-carrying pathogens, particularly Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas , with mobile genetic elements and oxidative stress responses as key contributors. Functional assays, including plasmid transfer, transcriptomic profiling, and single-cell Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that cigarette butts promoted horizontal gene transfer and upregulated key ARGs (e.g., mexE , mexF , cfrC ) under stress conditions. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed biofilm formation on cigarette fibers, supporting enhanced bacterial persistence. Source-tracking analyses identified both human oral and environmental sources of the enriched ARGs and pathogens in cigarette butts. Finally, socioeconomic factors such as lower gross domestic product (GDP), reduced education, and poor sanitation were strongly associated with elevated ARG and pathogen risks. Collectively, our findings identify cigarette butts as overlooked yet potent vectors of ARG and pathogen dissemination in urban green spaces, underscoring the need for targeted interventions within a One Health framework.",

          "authors": "Mohsen Mosleh, Jennifer Allen, David G. Rand",
          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically X/Twitter, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here, we shed light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: X/Twitter, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sample, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right-wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative news posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: Across all platforms examined, a given user’s lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement, even though higher-quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds when accounting for poster-level variation and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting that user preferences—not algorithmic bias—may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

          "abstract": "Complex systems such as the conscious brain and financial markets often operate near criticality, a regime that supports flexible and efficient function. When perturbed, however, rapid deviations from, and prolonged recovery to, criticality can severely disrupt these systems. The nature of such transitions depends on a system’s intrinsic phase transition type. Most systems in nature undergo continuous (second-order) transitions, but some approach a discontinuous, first-order transition known as explosive synchronization (ES). Systems nearer to first-order transitions are more unstable, losing criticality more rapidly and recovering more slowly. However, no existing method can directly determine from empirical data how close a system is to a first-order regime, limiting our ability to predict criticality transition patterns. Here, we introduce a physics-based framework that estimates a network’s ES proximity at the critical point. Using modified Stuart–Landau oscillator networks, we show that distinct critical dynamics emerge depending on the proximity to ES and that this measure predicts the temporal patterns of collapse and recovery under perturbations. We validated the generality of our computational findings with empirical data on network collapse and recovery, using human electroencephalogram recordings during general anesthesia and global stock market indices from 39 countries during the 2008 economic crisis. We demonstrated that rapid collapses and prolonged recoveries in both brain and stock market networks can be systematically predicted for neuronal and economic crises. These results provide crucial insights for designing resilient networks capable of withstanding perturbations and recovering quickly.",

          "abstract": "Intercellular mitochondrial transfer, the spontaneous exchange of mitochondria between cells, is a recently described phenomenon crucial for cellular repair, regeneration, and disease management. Enhancing this natural process holds promise for developing novel therapies targeting diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we introduce a nanomaterial-based approach employing molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanoflowers with atomic-scale vacancies to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in cells to make them mitochondrial biofactories. Upon cellular uptake, these nanoflowers result in a two-fold increase in mitochondrial mass and enhancing mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells by several-fold. This enhanced efficiency of transfer significantly improves mitochondrial respiratory capacity and adenosine triphosphate production in recipient cells under physiological conditions. In cellular models of mitochondrial and cellular damage, MoS 2 enhanced mitochondrial transfer achieved remarkable restoration of cell function. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that nanomaterial-boosted intercellular mitochondrial transfer can enhance cell survivability and function under diseased conditions, offering a promising strategy for treating mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases.",

          "authors": "Jueng Soo You, Steve Pierce, Gangning Liang, Peter A. Jones",
          "abstract": "The origins of CpG islands (CGIs) are not known. They are relatively short GC-rich regions of DNA with a higher-than-expected occurrence of CpG dinucleotides compared to most of the genome. They constitute less than 1% of the human genome but harbor approximately 40% of all transcription start sites (TSSs). CGIs are usually modulated by histone modifications in somatic cells or, in a minority of cases, permanently silenced by CpG methylation. Those that do not have TSSs are called “orphan CGIs”. Here, we show that CGIs containing TSSs almost never contain any of three major classes of transposable elements (TEs) and orphan CGIs rarely do. We hypothesize that CGIs persist across evolutionary time due to counterselection against TE insertion in the germ line. The 99% of the vertebrate genome, which is not CG rich, contains 60% of TSSs and putative enhancers. We postulate that conversion of an ancestral CpG-rich genome into the current CpG-depleted version present in vertebrates may also have allowed reversible DNA methylation to function in complex and dynamic gene control circuits. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary model in which vertebrate TEs are indirectly responsible for the existence of CGIs, and the formation of regulatory elements such as TSSs and enhancers that can potentially utilize dynamic DNA methylation for gene control.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages are recruited to sites of infection contributing to the killing of bacteria, but also to malignant tumors, where they promote angiogenesis and suppress antitumor immune responses. The metabolic microenvironment in tumors is frequently depleted of important nutrients such as glucose. Here, we investigated metabolic adaptation strategies of macrophages to glucose deprivation using stable isotopic tracing. Lactate production was decreased, potentially indicating a reduction of glycolysis. In contrast, the contribution of glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid cycle via α-ketoglutarate and reductive carboxylation were increased. Moreover, gluconeogenesis, the reverse pathway of glycolysis, was activated in glucose-deprived macrophages, proceeding partially to the generation of glycolytic intermediates and glycerol-3-phosphate. The partial gluconeogenesis pathway was abrogated in human and murine macrophages lacking the initial gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2, mitochondrial isoform). Partial gluconeogenesis was higher in anti-inflammatory, interleukin-4-stimulated compared to proinflammatory, interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Single-cell analysis and immunostaining revealed expression of PCK2 in macrophages from both lung cancer and normal lung. Low glucose conditions only partially modulated macrophage phenotypes, leading to reduced CD80 surface marker levels in proinflammatory, and enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor expression in anti-inflammatory macrophages. Our study reveals partial gluconeogenesis in glucose-deprived macrophages and shows that this versatile type of immune cells exhibits remarkable metabolic flexibility.",

SARS-CoV-2, despite binding CL-11 to activate complement, was resistant to lysis. Remarkably, opsonization by CL-11 enhanced virus production by infected respiratory epithelial cells independently of complement. Furthermore, infected cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displayed enhanced vulnerability to CL-11 binding and membrane attack by complement. The mechanism of enhanced infectivity was ablated in the presence of L-fucose, which occupied the extended carbohydrate-binding cleft of CL-11 in a crystallographic analysis of complexes between L-fucose and CL-11.

By consuming sea urchins, otters released kelp from herbivory, kelp beds flourished, and kelps sheltered a diversity of fishes, and invertebrates. When otters were extirpated by paleohumans, modern humans, or killer whales, urchins proliferated, reduced kelp forests to “urchin barrens,” and species-rich assemblages of fishes and invertebrates were lost. These losses affected seals, eagles, sea gulls, fishes, and sea stars that depended on these prey as well as adjacent habitats that had been nourished by exported kelp production. Jim’s research became the poster child for keystone species, trophic cascades, and the critical role of predators in structuring ecosystems.

          "abstract": "Animals in the wild must balance multiple, potentially mutually exclusive goals simultaneously in order to survive. Yet laboratory tests of decision-making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multiobjective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically inspired decision-making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and nonfood reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short “travel time” penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and nonfood rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. Satiety manipulations demonstrated that patch residence time decisions were under goal-directed control and responsive to current needs and recent consumption.",

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that asymmetric segregation of preexisting and newly synthesized canonical histone 3.1 (H3.1), but not variant histone 3.3A (H3.3A), plays an important role in the asymmetric outcome of Drosophila germline stem cell (GSC) and intestinal stem cell (ISC) divisions. However, this finding relied on the Gal4/UAS system and Flp-out technology to swap expression of exogenous fluorescent proteins—an approach that decouples H3.1 expression from the cell cycle and may be prone to artifacts. Here, by photoswitching photoconvertible H3-Dendra2 proteins expressed under their native controls in living flies, we find that preexisting and newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3A are symmetrically segregated in dividing ISCs and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in male testes. While H3.3A was found to be symmetrically segregated during GSC divisions, analysis of the H3.1 segregation in GSCs was complicated by our unexpected finding that H3.1-Dendra2 expressed under its normal control within the context of a histone transgene is not detectable in GSCs, owing to regulatory elements in the 3’UTR that mediate translational repression by the RNA-binding proteins Nanos and Pumilio. Nevertheless, when this repression is obviated by using a 3’UTR devoid of such elements, H3.1-Dendra2 is expressed in GSCs and symmetrically segregated without affecting lineage outcomes. We obtained similar results when the coding sequence of H3.3A was edited to encode H3.1 in the context of an H3.3A-Dendra2 knock-in allele. Our findings thus challenge the prevailing model of asymmetric histone segregation and reveal an unexpected molecular mechanism of posttranscriptional repression of H3.1 in GSCs.",

Prior to macroscopic degeneration, microstructural changes occur such as demyelination, iron deposition, or subtle atrophy, which can be characterized in vivo using MRI. We topographically mapped measures of microstructure and macrostructure across the unfolded surface of the hippocampus in 224 healthy older adults at risk for AD (aged 57 to 87) and 37 younger adults (aged 18 to 37). We describe three spatial regions of unique structural covariance between four parameters sensitive to microstructural tissue properties (R1, MTsat, R2*, PD) and macrostructure (surface thickness), with high convergence with previous spatial segmentations. We demonstrate both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of microstructure with healthy aging across the lifespan, AD pathological hallmarks, genetic risk, and cognition. These associations had subtle variations across different spatial areas of the hippocampus. We report associations between age and qMRI measures sensitive to macromolecular concentration (R1, MTsat) and paramagnetic susceptibility (R2*), consistent with mechanisms of demyelination and increased iron deposition as key hallmarks of the aging hippocampus and in presymptomatic stages of AD. qMRI measures did not explain more variance in delayed recall than global PET measures, suggesting variation in cognitive performance in aging and incipient AD is influenced by factors beyond hippocampal microstructure. We demonstrate the utility of quantitative MRI to provide greater insight into hippocampal health compared to typical macrostructural measures through “in vivo histology,” opening a window to understanding neuropathological mechanisms in the earliest stages of age- and disease-related neurodegeneration.",

The neurotransmission deficits we observed parallel the symptomatic heterogeneity of the patients, with some variants displaying a disproportionate augmentation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. When we examined the spatial organization of this excessive spontaneous release at nanoscale, we found that SNARE complexes composed of these variants formed exclusively outside of RIM scaffolding, revealing a preserved exclusion zone sparing evoked release from pathophysiology. Taken together with the phenotypes of previously reported disease-causing SNARE variants, these findings reveal shared patterns of aberrant neurotransmission across different SNAREs, highlighting the necessity for a functional classification of SNAREopathies to develop therapeutic interventions. The use of clinically relevant genetic manipulations to challenge the synapse provides mechanistic insight into rare diseases while simultaneously revealing fundamental aspects of synaptic physiology.",

          "abstract": "The soft corals (Cnidaria, Octocorallia), a diverse group of colonial marine invertebrates, can reversibly tune their body stiffness in response to external stimuli. This capability is attributed to their dynamic skeletal systems, which consist of thousands of mineralized skeletal elements, called sclerites, embedded within a gel-like matrix that swells/deswells and unjams/jams the sclerites, thus modulating skeletal stiffness. While sclerite morphology is widely used for species identification, its role in the mechanical performance of a soft coral’s skeletal system is largely unknown. Here, we investigated structure-jamming relationships in sclerite-based skeletal architectures using the red gorgonian octocoral Leptogorgia chilensis as a model system. The sclerites of L. chilensis exhibit a shaft-like geometry with two axial branches and two sets of triradiate side branches, which are aligned with the crystallographic symmetry of the constituent magnesium-containing calcite. By combining multiscale three-dimensional (3D) structural characterization, parametric geometrical modeling, 3D printing, mechanical testing, and discrete element simulations, we demonstrate how sclerite geometry achieves a balanced jamming performance in terms of stiffness, weight, strength, and fracture resistance in comparison to alternative geometries parametrically modified from the native sclerites (e.g., changes in the length and number of side branches). We also found that these performance metrics are achieved through the effective interlocking among side and axial branches, which is further enhanced by the fractal-like microscopic spikes on the branch tips. The findings in this natural jamming system offer insights for designing synthetic mechanotunable material architectures for a wide range of applications, from soft robotics to mechanical dampeners.",

          "abstract": "HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is transforming global HIV prevention, but its implementation coincides with observations of rising bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates among men who have sex with men, raising questions about whether PrEP is preventing one epidemic while facilitating others. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we developed a minimal dynamical model of the simultaneous transmission of HIV and chlamydia (as an example of a curable STI). The model integrates three key mechanisms: 1) risk-mediated self-protective behavior, 2) reduction in condom use among PrEP users, and 3) PrEP-related asymptomatic STI screening. We show that these mechanisms can generate a “testing paradox:” True STI prevalence may decline while observed trends rise. This paradox emerges because increased PrEP uptake amplifies screening intensity, which can lower transmission but simultaneously inflate detection. By systematically mapping the parameter space of PrEP uptake, screening frequency, and risk perception, we identify broad and plausible conditions under which the paradox arises. Our findings reconcile conflicting epidemiological evidence and remark that the net effect of PrEP on STI dynamics depends critically on asymptomatic screening strategies. These results highlight the potential dual role of PrEP programs in reducing both HIV and bacterial STI incidence, while emphasizing the need to align screening and treatment policies to maximize benefits and minimize risks, e.g., antimicrobial resistance.",

The molecular processes driving aggregation in disease are still being uncovered, highlighting the need for innovative tools to study aggregation reactions. Here, we introduce FibrilPaint1 as a tool to measure the size of Tau amyloid fibrils in fluids, from early aggregation stages to mature fibrils. FibrilPaint1 is a 22mer peptide with exciting properties: i) FibrilPaint1 binds fibrils with nanomolar affinity; ii) it also binds to precursors, down to a size of only 4 layers; iii) it does not bind to monomers; iv) it is fluorescently labeled, which allows monitoring and localizing interactions; v) FibrilPaint1 recognizes various Tau fibrils, including patient-derived fibrils from AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD); vi) it also binds to fibrils from amyloids derived from Amyloid-β, α-synuclein, and huntingtin vii) FibrilPaint1 is selective for the amyloid state and does not have background binding to amorphous aggregates, blood serum, or cell lysate. In combination with flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA), a microfluidics technology, we determined the molecular size of amyloid fibrils with submicroliter sample volumes. This setup acts as a molecular ruler at layer resolution—we determined Tau fibril length from 4 to 1100 layers in solution.

          "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by abnormal protein modifications. These include citrullination of arginine residues by the calcium-activated enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). However, calcium in body fluids may not fully activate PAD4, suggesting the potential involvement of other activators. In this study, we investigated the ability of glycosaminoglycans (a class of negatively charged polysaccharides) to modulate PAD4 activity. We found that model glycosaminoglycans bind to the enzyme with a nanomolar affinity, increase its calcium sensitivity, and require enzyme dimerization for activation. These effects depend on the size and negative charge of the glycosaminoglycan, and its various natural forms activate PAD4. Thus, our findings elucidate a mechanism by which common physiological compounds modulate PAD4 activity, potentially contributing to disease etiology.",

          "abstract": "Background: In early atherosclerosis, circulating Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) crosses the endothelium by transcytosis. This involves caveolar uptake of LDL by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and requires the protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). We identified mediators of LDL transcytosis by isolating membrane microdomains enriched in caveolin-1 from human coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) treated with LDL and performing mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified was myosin-9 (MYH9). Methods: Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was conducted to measure LDL transcytosis by HCAECs. We measured LDL transcytosis in vivo in mice lacking endothelial MYH9 (EC- Myh9 −/− ). Atherosclerosis studies were also performed in EC- Myh9 −/− deleted of hepatic LDLR via (adeno-associated virus, AAV)-CRISPR. Additionally, we performed analysis of human transcriptomic data. Results: Gene ontology analysis in human aortic endothelial cells suggested a role for MYH9 in exocytosis. Both knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of MYH9 inhibited LDL transcytosis. MYH9 depletion caused an accumulation of LDL-containing vesicles at the base of the cell; overexpression caused an increase in LDL exocytosis. EC- Myh9 −/− mice accumulated less LDL in the aortic arch after acute injection with LDL. To investigate the role of MYH9 in atherosclerosis, we deleted hepatic LDL in EC- Myh9 −/− mice using AAV-CRISPR and fed them a high-fat diet. The aortic arch and root of AAV-CRISPR; EC- Myh9 −/− mice exhibited smaller plaques. Human transcriptomic data showed greater messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of aortic MYH9 in atherosclerotic aortas compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: Lipid raft proteomics identified MYH9 as a regulator of LDL transcytosis. MYH9 is required for endothelial LDL exocytosis and contributes to early atherosclerosis.",

          "abstract": "Jupiter’s poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time, a motion governed by β -drift (vortex motion caused by the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis force). This study investigates how β -drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter’s polar regions, we constrain the cyclones’ deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter’s north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter’s enigmatic polar cyclones.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions have significantly increased in recent decades due to enhanced agricultural activities, contributing to global air pollution. While the effects of NH 3 on surface air quality are well documented, its influence on particle dynamics in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) and related aerosol impacts remain unquantified. NH 3 reaches the UTLS through convective transport and can enhance new particle formation (NPF). This modeling study evaluates the global impact of anthropogenic NH 3 on UTLS particle formation and quantifies its effects on aerosol loading and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) abundance. We use the EMAC Earth system model, incorporating multicomponent NPF parameterizations from the CERN CLOUD experiment. Our simulations reveal that convective transport increases NH 3 -driven NPF in the UTLS by one to three orders of magnitude compared to a baseline scenario without anthropogenic NH 3 , causing a doubling of aerosol numbers over high-emission regions. These aerosol changes induce a 2.5-fold increase in upper tropospheric CCN concentrations. Anthropogenic NH 3 emissions increase the relative contribution of water-soluble inorganic ions to the UTLS aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 20% and increase total column AOD by up to 80%. In simulations without anthropogenic NH 3 , UTLS aerosol composition is dominated by sulfate and organic species, with a marked reduction in ammonium nitrate and aerosol water content. This results in a decline of aerosol mass concentration by up to 50%. These findings underscore the profound global influence of anthropogenic NH 3 emissions on UTLS particle formation, AOD, and CCN production, with important implications for cloud formation and climate.",

There are a growing number of powerful forecasting methods that fall into two broad categories-empirical models that extrapolate from historical data, and mechanistic models based on fixed epidemiological assumptions. However, these methods often underperform precisely when reliable predictions are most urgently needed-during periods of rapid epidemic escalation. Here, we introduce epimodulation, a hybrid approach that integrates fundamental epidemiological principles into existing predictive models to enhance forecasting accuracy, especially around epidemic peaks. When applied to empirical and machine learning forecasting methods (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Holt-Winters, gradient-boosting machines, Prophet, and spline models), epimodulation improved overall prediction accuracy by an average of 12.3% (range: 8.5 to 18.7%) for COVID-19 hospital admissions and by 32.9% (range: 24.2 to 43.7%) for influenza hospital admissions; accuracy during epidemic peaks improved even further, by an average of 27.9% and 43.8%, respectively. Epimodulation also substantially enhanced the performance of complex forecasting methods, including the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model, demonstrating its broad utility in improving forecast reliability at critical moments in disease outbreaks.",

Although theories of automaticity propose that learning should result in faster processing, studies have universally found that learning reduces the amplitude of neural activity, not that it speeds neural activity. Here, we show that with intracranial activity recorded from the hippocampus of twenty-two humans, we could decode the target the participant was about to report faster across learning. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus afforded faster decoding of the to-be-reported target as learning progressed, unlike in prefrontal and temporal regions of the cortex. Furthermore, hippocampal ripples (70 to 180 Hz bursts) appear to support memory retrieval after learning established automaticity. Our findings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a key role in speeding memory retrieval of previous learning episodes as humans gain expertise, supporting a critical but untested prediction of learning theories.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases, which come from the shortcuts our brains use to make decisions, often lead people to misjudge sizes, amounts, or other magnitudes. However, it is still unclear how these biases evolved. Nonhuman animals like primates and corvids share with humans a nonsymbolic number sense. Whether biases in magnitude estimation are evolutionarily widespread in animals remains an open question. We investigated numerical estimation in macaque monkeys and carrion crows—two distantly related but numerically proficient vertebrates—using a delayed match-to-numerosity task with dot arrays. Both species exhibited key biases commonly observed in humans during numerical estimation tasks: scalar variability (increasing response variability with numerosity), regression to the mean (overestimation of small and underestimation of large numerosities), and a sequential effect (estimates biased toward previous trial numerosities). Traditionally, these biases have been attributed either to static influences of overall task history or to dynamic effects from recent trials. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian model incorporating dynamic priors based on multiple previously encountered numerosities can account for all observed behavioral patterns. Our findings suggest that numerical judgments in both species are shaped by uncertainty and the integration of recent experience, revealing shared Bayesian-like mechanisms for cognitive biases across distantly related animals.",

          "abstract": "Soil salinization has emerged as a significant challenge for crop production worldwide. Xylem adjustments through plastic development and sodium unloading from root xylem, as mediated by sodium transporter HKT1, both play crucial roles in controlling sodium transport and salt tolerance in plants. Here, we report that XYLEM NAC DOMAIN 1 (XND1) of Arabidopsis contributes to the coordination of these two processes during salt stress responses. XND1 is predominantly accumulated in roots under salt exposure and confers plant salt tolerance, as demonstrated by analysis of overexpression and loss-of-function mutant lines. XND1 mediates discontinuous root protoxylem differentiation under salt stress, potentially limiting sodium transport. In addition, XND1 directly targets and activates the expression of HKT1 , thereby facilitating the removal of sodium from root xylem. We also show that MYBS2, a MYB transcription factor, interacts with XND1 to antagonistically regulate HKT1 , whereas VND-INTERACTING 2 (VNI2), a NAC transcription factor, activates XND1 in response to salt stress. Characterization of the XND1 ortholog of rice suggests a conserved regulatory role under salt stress. Collectively, our findings unveil an XND1-centered regulatory network that modulates salt stress response, through the integration of root xylem developmental plasticity and sodium unloading.",

Moving beyond traditional distinctions between single- and multishot devices, our approach provides rigorous criteria for determining when measurements can truly resolve individual laser shots rather than statistical averages. By contextualizing single measurements, this framework shows that single-shot capability is not an intrinsic device property but emerges from the relationship between measurement precision and predictability. Implementing this approach with a custom measurement device at the ATLAS-3000 petawatt laser, we provide quantitative uncertainty bounds on pulse front tilt and curvature. Notably, we observe that our Bayesian method reduces uncertainty by up to 60% compared to traditional approaches. Through this analysis, we reveal how the interplay between measurement precision and intrinsic system variability defines achievable resolution-insights that have direct implications for applications where precise control of laser–matter interaction is critical.",

          "abstract": "The Permian–Triassic (P-Tr) transition (~252 Ma) witnessed Earth’s most severe biocrisis, which has long been linked to Siberian Traps volcanism and associated environmental upheaval. Major perturbation of the global carbon (C) and sulfur (S) cycles is mainly inferred from marine δ 13 C and δ 34 S records, whereas few existing terrestrial records link δ 34 S fluctuations to widespread dispersal and fallout of volcanogenic sulfate aerosols. Mounting evidence, however, reveals that the collapse of P-Tr terrestrial ecosystems was diachronous, questioning a hypothesized globally synchronous common forcing. Here, we present records of pyritic multiple-S isotopes (δ 34 S py and Δ 33 S) and bulk organic δ 13 C for a paleotropical peatland drill core (HK-1) from Southwest China. The δ 34 S py variations define three distinct phases with a notable decline in δ 34 S py across the P-Tr transition, suggesting substantially elevated terrestrial sulfate influx coincident with major carbon cycle perturbation. Notably, overall small positive Δ 33 S values (+0.01 to +0.12‰) rule out a dominant role for stratospheric sulfates. Collectively, the observed changes in δ 13 C org , δ 34 S py , and Δ 33 S support catastrophic collapse of the Cathaysian Flora leading to intensified weathering and sulfate release. This inferred event, slightly after the P-Tr marine extinction, postdates by several 100-ky terrestrial floral collapse and perturbation of the C–S cycles documented in the high-latitude Sydney Basin. Cross-latitudinal diachroneity of terrestrial ecosystem collapse and consequent C–S perturbation challenges the hypothesis of a single, global volcanic driver. Rather, regional deforestation and its cascading effects overprinted on the global perturbations of biogeochemical cycles emerge here as critical factors shaping Earth’s largest recorded crisis.",

          "abstract": "Malaria parasites infect red blood cells where they digest host hemoglobin and release free heme inside a lysosome-like organelle called the food vacuole. To detoxify excess heme, parasites form hemozoin crystals that rapidly tumble inside this compartment. Hemozoin formation is critical for parasite survival and central to antimalarial drug activity. Although the static structural properties of hemozoin have been extensively investigated, crystal motion and its underlying mechanism have remained puzzling. We used quantitative image analysis to determine the timescale of motion, which requires the intact vacuole but does not require the parasite itself. Using single particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulations with experimentally derived interaction potentials, we found that hemozoin motion exhibits unexpectedly tight confinement but is much faster than thermal diffusion. Hydrogen peroxide, which is generated at high levels in the food vacuole, has been shown to stimulate the motion of synthetic metallic nanoparticles via surface-catalyzed peroxide decomposition that generates propulsive kinetic energy. We observed that peroxide stimulated the motion of isolated crystals in solution and that conditions that suppress peroxide formation slowed hemozoin motion inside parasites. These data suggest that surface-exposed metals on hemozoin catalyze peroxide decomposition to drive crystal motion. This work reveals hemozoin motion in malaria parasites as a biological example of an endogenous self-propelled nanoparticle. This mechanism of propulsion likely serves a physiological role to reduce oxidative stress to parasites from hydrogen peroxide produced by large-scale hemoglobin digestion during blood-stage infection.",

Using a combination of microscopy, amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, and 15 N-urea feeding experiments on four species in the group, we show that its adult-specific pouch-associated microbiota, primarily Tokpelaia , recycle nitrogen from urea and convert it into amino acids which are provisioned to adult workers and developing larvae. Disruption of this nitrogen-recycling symbiosis severely impairs larval growth and overall colony fitness. Our results show how caste-restricted microbial organs can centralize metabolic functions at the colony level, challenging individual-centric paradigms of host–microbe mutualism and providing insights into the pivotal role of microbial symbionts in superorganismal adaptation to nutritional constraints.",

Periodontitis is a prevalent, male-biased disease characterized by inflammation-driven bone loss, yet the mechanism(s) of this sex bias is unknown. This study explored whether enhanced inflammasome represents a causal mechanism for this bias. Analyses of three separate human studies (&gt;6,200 samples) show that males have significantly higher IL-1β in the gingival crevicular fluid than females during health and periodontitis. This pattern is experimentally reproduced with different versions of the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model where males show greater IL-1β secretion than females. The inflammasome drives bone resorption in males but not females as revealed by analyses of inflammasome gene-deletion mice. Pharmacologic treatment with a caspase-1/4 inhibitor reduces inflammatory cell infiltration, dampens osteoclastogenesis signaling (via the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway), and prevents bone resorption in males but not females during experimental periodontitis. While ovariectomized females show no change in their nonresponsiveness to caspase-1/4 inhibition, orchiectomized males no longer respond to the inhibition, suggesting the importance of an intact male reproductive system in the mediation of this inhibition. Thus, our study identifies inflammasome activation as causal for male-biased experimental periodontitis and supports sex-stratified studies to foster future advancement of inflammasome therapeutics in periodontics.",

          "abstract": "Enhancers regulate gene expression by physically contacting their target promoters, yet these contacts often span large genomic distances. Phase-separated condensates (droplet-like clusters) of transcription factors (TFs) are thought to facilitate such long-range enhancer–promoter (E-P) communication, but the quantitative principles underlying this mechanism remain unclear. Here, we use polymer-based chromatin simulations to systematically vary the strength of TF clustering and the E-P genomic distance, examining their combined effects on E-P contact formation. We find that E-P contact frequency shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the degree of TF clustering: Contact frequency peaks at an intermediate TF abundance and TF–TF affinity, leading to a “golden mean” optimum. Two distinct regimes emerge: Under weak TF–TF attraction, contact probability increases with condensate size, whereas strong TF attraction produces a peaked response that declines at high condensation levels. These results indicate that TF condensate acts as a tunable “rheostat,” buffering E-P interactions against increasing genomic distances. However, excessive TF clustering leads to molecular crowding and competition that ultimately impair E-P communication. Our study, consistent with recent experiments, establishes a mechanistic framework at the molecular level, where balanced TF condensation enables robust long-range E-P communication, reconciling the stochastic nature of chromatin dynamics with the fidelity of gene regulation.",

By introducing an electrochemically active species, hexacyanoferrate(II/III) into the vaccine solution, we observe discrete current drops when particles irreversibly collide with a microelectrode. Such events can be correlated directly with particle size. As a proof of concept, we use this technique to analyze the interactions of streptavidin-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) beads with biotinylated bovine serum albumin at vaccine-level concentrations and apply what we learned to the components of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine. We then present a time-trial comparison of data from current commercial SHINGRIX™ vaccines using dynamic light scattering and stochastic electrochemistry, analyzing the AS01 B adjuvant alone and the AS01 B adjuvant combined with the glycoprotein E (gE protein). While our method elucidates important properties at the single adjuvant level, our results paint a quantitative kinetic picture of coformulation stability that is currently not achievable by dynamic light scattering.",

          "abstract": "Fungi are essential members across ecosystems, yet phytopathogenic fungi pose an increasing risk to crop yields. Despite their ecologic importance, cell–cell communication in fungi is underexplored, partly due to the lack of high-throughput techniques. Here, we developed a Yeast Mating Platform (YeMaP) to investigate the interaction between fungal G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and pheromone peptides. We used YeMaP for high-throughput screening of 8,000 pheromone sequences and identified peptides with improved agonism or antagonism action. We found that these peptides can be applied in a native fungal system such as the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum , to control hyphal chemotropism and reduce plant root penetration. Additionally, we utilized YeMaP in a one-pot assay to investigate how abiotic factors influence the communication of multiple pheromone–GPCR combinations and found that the cell–cell communication mediated by the GPCR Ste2 from F. oxysporum signaled robustly across different abiotic factors, while other fungal GPCR–pheromone interactions were more sensitive to changes. Taken together, YeMaP accelerates the identification of fungal GPCR–peptide interactions by enabling one-pot assays, and serves as a model system for studying fungal cell–cell communication.",

          "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinase pathway rewiring represents a fundamental mechanism underlying acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While posttranslational modifications facilitate aberrant activation of bypass signaling networks, the specific contribution of ZDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase-mediated palmitoylation remains poorly characterized. Here, ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation contributes to osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Patient samples, along with in vitro and in vivo functional studies, indicated that ZDHHC11 upregulation reduces the sensitivity of tumor cells to osimertinib by promoting malignant phenotype. Mechanistically, we establish AXL receptor tyrosine kinase as the critical substrate. ZDHHC11 catalyzes AXL palmitoylation at Cys869, inducing plasma membrane retention and constitutive activation. This triggers downstream PI3K–AKT signaling, with AXL knockout alleviating the effect of ZDHHC11-driven resistance. Crucially, pharmacological inhibition ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation with the broad-spectrum palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate effectively augmented the antitumor effects of osimertinib. Collectively, ZDHHC11 regulates osimertinib resistance in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. Targeting the ZDHHC11–AXL axis may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with high ZDHHC11 expression.",

We previously reported that HLA-E surface expression is low and transient due to its cytoplasmic tail and dominant VL9 peptide, making it a dynamic indicator of cellular status for NK cell surveillance. Here, we identify a sequence motif in the HLA-E cytoplasmic tail that enables rapid internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) through interaction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. Following internalization, HLA-E is routed to endosomes, where the same cytoplasmic motif and peptide loading together facilitate its reappearance on the cell surface—a process influenced by valosin-containing protein (VCP). Our findings reveal previously unrecognized endosomal trafficking pathways and regulatory mechanisms that distinguish HLA-E from classical HLA class I molecules, with broad implications for understanding the immunoregulatory roles of HLA-E.",

However, the effects of prenatal maternal inflammation (PNMI) on offspring hippocampal microstructure in humans remain unclear. Here, we examined the relationship between exposure to PNMI and neurite density in the hippocampus and its subfields among offspring during late middle age. Participants included 72 mother–offspring dyads from the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) cohort. Data for four inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA], and soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor-II) were available from first- and second-trimester maternal sera. Neurite density in the offspring hippocampus and its subfields was estimated using microstructural modeling of offspring’s diffusion-weighted MRI data (mean age of offspring at imaging = 59 y; 51% male). We estimated the relationship between each biomarker and region-of-interest’s neurite density. Higher first-trimester maternal IL-1RA and IL-6 levels were associated with lower offspring hippocampal neurite density. These relationships were specific to the Cornu Ammonis 3, Cornu Ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, and subiculum subfields. In addition, higher second-trimester IL-6 was associated with lower subiculum neurite density. Our findings reveal that exposure to heightened prenatal levels of maternal inflammation is linked to altered offspring hippocampal microstructure in late middle age, which could have implications for memory decreases during this period and may be relevant for understanding the risk of aging-related cognitive changes.",

In this work, we address those challenges for a scanning lens-less imaging method called ptychography. Instead of precisely controlling the sample position during raster scan in a focused, confined X-ray beam, we are scanning that beam across the sample. This overcomes the constraints on scanning procedure imposed by sample size/weight and delivers unmatched scanning speed while maintaining high precision of beam position during the scan.

However, neutron crystallography of glycoside ligand-bound states has not been performed. In this study, we investigated β-glucosidase Td2F2 from GH family 1 as a model enzyme for anomer-retaining GHs. We determined joint X-ray/neutron structures of Td2F2 in ligand-free form, covalent intermediate with a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro glucoside (2F-Glc) inhibitor, and glucose product complex using hydrogen/deuterium-exchanged crystals at room temperature, with neutron diffraction resolutions of 1.80–1.70 Å. Extensive hydrogen bonds recognizing the hydroxy groups of 2F-Glc were identified, along with the positions of deuterium atoms. The acid/base catalyst residue Glu166 was anchored by a hydrogen bond network pivoted by Asn293. Tyr295 forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic nucleophile residue Glu352 in the ligand-free and glucose complex forms, while the active center undergoes significant reorganization, including side chain displacements of Glu352 and Tyr295, as well as the incorporation of a water molecule. An alternative conformation of Tyr295 was observed in the 2F-Glc structure at room temperature, suggesting its role in positioning the nucleophilic water during the deglycosylation step. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of Y295F mutant supported the functional involvement of Tyr295 in both glycosylation and deglycosylation steps. The tyrosine hydrogen bonded to the nucleophile is also conserved in many other anomer-retaining GH families, underscoring its importance in catalysis. Based on the deuterium/hydrogen positions determined from neutron structures, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for Td2F2.",

One expression of these is a provariance bias (PVB), i.e., risk-seeking manifests as a preference for choosing options with higher variances/uncertainty. Using a magnitude learning task, we show that individual differences in PVB are explained by a model that includes asymmetric learning rates, allowing differential learning from positive prediction errors (PPEs) and negative prediction errors (NPEs). Using high-resolution 7T functional MRI (fMRI), we identify distinct neural responses to PPEs and NPEs in value-sensitive regions, including habenula (Hb), ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in humans. Notably, prediction error signals in NAcc and vmPFC were boosted for high variance options. NPEs responses in NAcc were associated with a negative bias in learning rates that was linked to the strength of Hb-VTA negative functional coupling during NPE encoding, with a mediation analysis revealing this coupling influenced NAcc responses to NPEs via an impact on learning rate bias. Our findings implicate Hb-VTA functional coupling in the emergence of risk preferences during learning, with implications for psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Self-organization underpins the emergence of complex structure in living systems but remains a major challenge for engineering synthetic multicellular materials. Here, we present intrinsically disordered protein display platform (iDP 2 ), a generalizable platform for high-density display of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) on the surface of Escherichia coli . iDP 2 uses CsgF as a surface-tethered scaffold, enabling efficient fusion and presentation of protein domains that lack stable tertiary structure. Successful display selectively favors disordered sequences, which, when endowed with phase separation propensity, drive the formation of dynamic cellular condensates. Programming cells with orthogonal IDPs enables sequence-specific segregation of mixed populations, allowing the design of spatially organized living assemblies. The aggregation state of these condensates is dynamically tunable by environmental cues such as ionic strength, and temperature, with responses predictable from the known phase behavior of the displayed IDPs. Extrusion processing of condensates generates macroscale filaments that maintain structural integrity and population segregation. By linking protein sequence to emergent collective behaviors, iDP 2 offers a programmable framework for rational control of cell–cell interactions. This approach establishes a foundation for engineering living materials with customizable viscoelastic properties, environmental responsiveness, and multicellular organization. More broadly, our work highlights the potential of disordered protein motifs as versatile tools for the design of adaptive, self-organizing biological systems.",

Among the orthoflaviviruses, tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEV) are an antigenic group that causes severe neurological disease in humans. However, the entry receptors for TBEV, which contribute to cell and tissue tropism, remain largely unknown. Because recent studies identified members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family as possible receptors for some orthoflaviviruses and distantly related alphaviruses, we performed a targeted screen in transgenic cells expressing different LDLR members and identified LRP8 (also called ApoER2) as a candidate receptor for TBEV strains from the five different subtypes. Genetic ablation of LRP8 impaired TBEV reporter virus particle or authentic virus infection in neuronal cells. Reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP8 increased TBEV infection. LRP8 was used as a receptor by multiple strains of TBEV and several closely related tick-borne viruses but not by the mosquito-transmitted orthoflaviviruses we tested. LRP8 bound directly to TBEV envelope proteins and promoted virus attachment to and internalization in cells through LDLR type A (LA) binding domain, which we narrowed down to LA domains 1 and 2 through functional experiments. Soluble LRP8-Fc decoy receptors neutralized TBEV in cell culture, and reduced viral infection was observed in Lrp8 −/− neuronal cells obtained from knockout mice. Our studies establish a role for LRP8 in TBEV entry and infection, which has implications for the development of soluble receptor, antibody-based, and vaccine countermeasures.",

It affects the reproductive transition in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the significant vectors of numerous devastating human diseases. Here, we show that E93 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis during the reproductive cycle of mosquitoes. E93 deficiency led to insufficient production of insulin-like peptide 3 (ILP3) from insulin-producing cells in the brain, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), a key regulator in the insulin signaling pathway. This reduction facilitated the nuclear translocation of FoxO and enhanced the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which in turn respectively activated the transcription of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) during gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen synthesis. Further insulin rescue and the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that E93 directly inhibited PEPCK transcription. Ultimately, E93 -depleted mosquitoes exhibited systemic metabolic reprogramming, characterized by the dysregulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Our findings establish that E93 orchestrates metabolic homeostasis by coordinating the insulin signaling cascade and directly regulating PEPCK expression, thus providing an intrinsic connection between endocrine signaling and E93-mediated reproduction in mosquitoes.",

A frontier of this field is designing cell-permeable multifunctional ligands that contain fluorophores in combination with affinity tags or pharmacological agents.

To address this problem, we examined the chemical properties of rhodamine-based self-labeling tag ligands through the lens of medicinal chemistry. We found that the lactone–zwitterion equilibrium constant ( K L–Z ) of rhodamines inversely correlates with their distribution coefficients (log D 7.4 ), suggesting that ligands based on dyes exhibiting low K L–Z and high log D 7.4 values, such as Si-rhodamines, would efficiently enter cells. We designed cell-permeable multifunctional HaloTag ligands with a biotin moiety to purify mitochondria or a JQ1 appendage to translocate BRD4 within the nucleus. We found that translocation of BRD4 to constitutive heterochromatin in cells leads to apparent increases in transcriptional activity. These fluorescent reagents enable affinity capture and translocation of intracellular proteins in living cells, and our general design concepts will facilitate the design of multifunctional chemical tools for biology.",

          "abstract": "Triple oxygen isotope values of xylem water were measured along the length of smooth horsetail stems ( Equisetum laevigatum ). Extreme isotope enrichment is observed moving from base to stem tip. δ 18 O values range from −8.3‰ at the base to 82.6‰ at the tip. Δ′ 17 O values range from 0 to −1,797 per meg. The δ 18 O and Δ′ 17 O values are the most extreme measured for any terrestrial material and expand the known range of Δ′ 17 O values by fivefold for mass-dependent fractionation on Earth. The extreme isotope enrichments are explained using a hybrid evaporation/chain-of-lakes model, allowing us to refine the leaf respiration coefficient to θ k = 0.511 ± 0.001. This new value is required to explain the low Δ′ 17 O values previously measured in desert plants and animals and is critical when using fossil samples for paleoclimate reconstruction. Coexisting phytoliths and stem water were also measured. The 1000 ln 18 α silica-water value at the plant base (35.89‰) appears to be in isotopic equilibrium, with far smaller fractionations of 10.3‰ near the tip. The smaller fractionations at higher levels are explained by continual silica deposition as the plant elongates and the δ 18 O values of each segment become higher. The overall integrated phytolith value is a combination of early and late silica growth. The Δ′ 17 O silica − Δ′ 17 O water values are not in equilibrium, explained by a kinetic isotope effect, with a λ value of 0.5205 vs. 0.5244 for equilibrium.

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women under 50. The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor α-positive (ER+) and are commonly treated with hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen that inhibit ER activity. The TP53 tumor suppressor gene, encoding the p53 protein, is the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, and TP53 mutations are associated with diminished tamoxifen response and worse prognosis for breast cancer patients. Here, we report that in breast cancer cells p53 and ER cooperate to regulate the transcription of a set of genes encoding chromatin modifiers. The net result is a global increase in H3K4me3 and decrease in H3K9me3 chromatin marks. The resultant “open” chromatin is associated with increased transcription of luminal cell identity genes and enhanced tamoxifen sensitivity. Conversely, diminished p53 control of these chromatin modulators is associated with the evolution of tamoxifen resistance and cancer stem cell properties.",

          "abstract": "Exosomes are signaling messengers facilitating intercellular communication by delivering molecular cargo. Here, we observed increased levels of exosomal periostin (POSTN) in the blood plasma of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Monocytes contributed to elevated levels of exosomal POSTN, and deletion of Postn in myeloid cells reduced retinal neovascularization (RNV). Monocytes isolated from the blood of PDR patients or under high glucose conditions exhibited heightened glycolytic activity and elevated histone lactylation levels, particularly H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la). Knockout of hexokinase 2 ( Hk2 ) in myeloid cells led to reduced H4K8la and POSTN levels and inhibited RNV. Exogenous exosomal POSTN partially reversed the angiogenic defects caused by Postn or Hk2 deletion in myeloid cells. Mechanistically, exosomal POSTN stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha and upregulated the expression of angiogenic genes. Notably, treatment with metformin reduced RNV by decreasing monocyte glycolysis and lowering exosomal POSTN levels. In summary, these findings underscore the critical role of circulating exosomal POSTN in RNV and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for angiogenic retinopathies.",

          "abstract": "Physical inhomogeneities—spanning atomic-scale crystal defects and quantum dots to macroscopic features like bone cavities and geological faults—are fundamental to both engineered and natural systems. The study of how these inclusions influence material fields has driven critical advances across multiple disciplines, from composite materials and solid-state physics to biomechanics and geophysics. Eshelby revolutionized this field with the equivalent inclusion method (EIM), transforming inhomogeneous problems into homogeneous ones by introducing an equivalent eigen-strain. However, determining Eshelby’s equivalent eigen-strain for arbitrary inclusions has remained a long-standing challenge. Here, we resolve this challenge and applied the EIM to multiphysics problems, deriving three-dimensional universal exact solutions in Fourier space for the generalized equivalent eigenfield, encompassing eigen-strain, eigen-electric, and eigen-magnetic fields. These solutions apply to both single and multiple inclusions of arbitrary shape, inhomogeneity, and anisotropy. Our results yield exact expressions for the effective properties of magnetoelectroelastic composites. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility through complex multiphase applications, including a general expression for stress intensity factors of arbitrarily shaped cracks, a criterion for designing auxetic materials via engineered elastic inhomogeneities and an optimized pathway to enhance magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a universal approach to multiphysics inhomogeneous inclusion problems, rooted in multiple disciplines and spanning multiple length scales. It offers both profound fundamental insights and practical utility, paving the way for advancements in diverse fields.",

          "abstract": "Speciation often results from the accumulation of reproductive isolation associated with lineage divergence, but secondary contact between diverged lineages can reshape the trajectory of speciation and reveal its underlying processes. The Indonesian island of Sulawesi is a tectonically complex island formed by the fusion of many paleo-islands, resulting in replicated cases of secondary contact among once-isolated lineages. Unlike secondary contact on continents where hybridization often results from unpredictable range shifts, Sulawesi’s fauna presents a replicated set of geologically constrained natural experiments to test how the magnitude of evolutionary divergence predicts outcomes of secondary contact and hybridization. Using thousands of genome-wide loci from Eutropis sun skinks spanning Wallace’s Line on Sulawesi and Borneo, we reconstructed a reticulate evolutionary history shaped by overwater dispersal, isolation, island fusion, hybridization, and character displacement. We delimited five distinct species (three undescribed) and uncovered multiple ancient hybridization events following island fusion leading to distinct outcomes. These outcomes—speciation reversal, parapatry, and sympatry putatively through reproductive character displacement—were associated with increasing levels of prior divergence consistent with evolutionary theory. Sympatry, specifically, was preceded by substantial introgressive hybridization and body size divergence that likely confers reproductive incompatibility. Together, these results provide empirical support for divergence-dependent tipping points along the speciation continuum. The sun skink radiation also includes a rare instance of reverse colonization of Borneo across Wallace’s Line that established a narrowly divergent species with a uniquely intermediate body size absent from Sulawesi.",

Yet, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the sensory and emotional aspects of chronic pain remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of FKBP51, a regulator of the stress response, in mediating both sensory and emotional symptoms of chronic pain. Inhibition of FKBP51, via genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade, in persistent joint pain reduced fast-onset sensory, functional and activity-related symptoms, as well as late anxio-depressive comorbidities. FKBP51 inhibition after the establishment of the hypersensitive state provided only temporary symptoms relief, while acute inhibition at disease onset protected from the full development of sensory and anxio-depressive symptoms for up to 6 mo. Our results also indicated that early pain symptoms could predict the late sensory and emotional outcomes of chronic pain. RNA sequencing of spinal cord tissue revealed that late FKBP51 inhibition transiently altered nociceptive genes associated with mechanical hypersensitivity. In contrast, early inhibition persistently downregulated the Naaa gene, a key regulator of the transition to chronic pain, and reorganized spinal cilia. Our results indicate that early FKBP51 inhibition after injury can persistently reduce chronic pain and prevent the onset of associated emotional comorbidities by modulating critical spinal neurobiological pathways that play pivotal roles in the transition to chronic pain.",

This method leverages synergetic electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding, and hydrophobic association where negatively charged microscale pliable pollen lamella and positively charged macromolecular CS sequentially assemble within pulp fibers to form dense, water-resistant networks. Relying solely on the spontaneous organization of the three components, the resulting fiber/pollen-CS (FP-CS) biocomposites exhibit superior mechanical strength (~80 MPa) and maintain water stability for up to 100 d. Remarkably, they also enable seamless water-resistant sealing through simple CS application, facilitating ecofriendly production of straws, packaging, and water-resistant patches. This green, scalable, and energy-efficient process uses only biomass feedstocks to produce high-performance biocomposites, offering a promising sustainable alternative to conventional plastics.",

Upon signaling cues, this asymmetry can be dissipated by various phospholipid scramblases, allowing cells to respond to stimuli and adapt to different physiological contexts. The prevailing view in the field is that phospholipid scramblases on the plasma membrane act without headgroup preference. Here, we report contrary experimental evidence based on a phospholipid scrambling assay that quantifies the fluorescence polarization (FP) of nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled phospholipids for kinetic monitoring of phospholipid scrambling on the plasma membrane of living cells.

Thus, there is enormous interest in elucidating the biosynthetic pathways that are responsible for the production of these compounds. Identification of the genes that comprise these biosynthetic pathways has been enabled by gene-to-metabolite networks that are generated from transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. Recent advances in both single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell mass spectrometry metabolomics (scMS) have enabled the measurement of either gene expression or metabolite levels in individual cells. However, these datasets can only be used to indirectly correlate gene expression levels with metabolite concentrations at the single-cell level. In this proof-of-concept study, performed on cells derived from the leaves of the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus , we demonstrate that both scRNA-seq and scMS can be applied to the same plant cell, thereby enabling direct comparisons between gene expression and metabolite levels. Protoplasts are sorted into 96-well plates using a microfluidics-based robot and then lysed under conditions that are suitable for both scMS and SMART-seq single-cell protocols. This multiplexing approach reveals both qualitative and quantitative correlations between metabolite levels and biosynthetic gene expression in individual cells.

The region has been considered a potential refugium for Neanderthals before their replacement by Homo sapiens . However, no genetic data have been obtained from any of these late Neanderthals, some being inaccessible or badly preserved. Starosele is a notable site which has undergone excavations in recent years. We used collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry, ZooMS), to screen for potential human remains among thousands of fragmented bones from the site. Of the 150 bone fragments we analyzed, 97.3% had sufficient collagen preservation for taxonomic identification. Our results suggest Paleolithic humans primarily hunted horses. One ~5 cm bone fragment yielded peptide mass fingerprints matching Hominidae . Radiocarbon dating revealed an age range of 46 to 45,000 y old, close to the transition from the disappearance of Neanderthals to the dispersal of H. sapiens in western Europe. We sequenced a twofold coverage mitochondrial genome from this bone, indicating the individual belongs to the Neanderthal lineage. The mitogenome clusters with other Neanderthal mitogenomes previously generated from the Russian Altai region. Alongside this, an analysis of the lithic corpus from both regions suggests that a wider Neanderthal dispersal, linked to the Micoquian stone tool industry, occurred after ~60,000 y ago. We assessed the paleoclimate connection (temperature and precipitation) between these locations and identified a high habitat suitability corridor along 55°N, suggesting that the long-distance movement of Neanderthals would have been facilitated by periods of favorable climate.",

Intriguingly, a divergent PBP paralog (PBP4) in noctuid moths has been identified exhibiting predominant expression in the male reproductive system, though its functional significance remained elusive. In this study with Spodoptera exigua , we demonstrated that PBP4 is specifically expressed in male accessory glands (MAGs) and transferred to females during copulation. CRISPR-mediated PBP4 knockout (PBP4 −/− ) significantly reduced male reproductive success via impaired sperm competition, evidenced by diminished offspring sired. Transcriptomic and qPCR analyses revealed expressional correlation between PBP4 and the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco), and similar sperm competition deficits were observed in Orco −/− males. Furthermore, both mutants exhibited compromised sperm motility and reduced sperm transfer from spermatophores to spermathecae. In vitro sperm motility assays showed that a specific agonist of Orco, VUAA1, robustly enhanced sperm motility in an Orco-dependent manner. Analyses of four additional moth species, including noctuids and non-noctuids, revealed a similar specific expression in the male reproductive tracts in all of them. Our findings unveil a noncanonical role for PBP4 in reproductive fitness and evolutionary conservation of the PBP-OR signaling pathway.",

We hypothesize that cognitive processes involved in understanding people and places are implemented by distinct neural systems with parallel anatomical organization. We test this hypothesis using precision neuroimaging of individual human brains on diverse tasks involving perception and cognition in the domains of familiar people, places, and objects. We find that thinking about people and places elicits responses in distinct areas of high-level association cortex within the default mode network, spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Person- and place-preferring brain regions are systematically spatially adjacent across cortical zones. These areas have strongly domain-specific response profiles across visual, semantic, and episodic tasks and are specifically functionally connected to other parts of association cortex with like domain preference. Social and spatial networks remain anatomically separated at the apex of a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient across cortex and include regions with anatomical connections to the hippocampal formation.

          "abstract": "Serial order memory, a key type of episodic representation, requires the encoding of map–like context information (interitem relationships) to facilitate recall. In rodent models, both spatial and nonspatial order memory depend heavily on the hippocampus. However, in humans, lesional and neurophysiological data also implicate extrahippocampal areas, especially the orbital frontal cortex and medial parietal regions, in these mnemonic abilities. To investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms of order information in human memory, we used direct brain recordings from hippocampal–cortical circuits as neurosurgical patients performed a serial recall task. Our unique dataset included simultaneous acquisition of data from the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate regions. Focusing on ripple events, we demonstrate distinct interregional dynamics during successful order memory encoding using temporally precise, simultaneous recordings across these circuits. The relative timing of co-rippling events implicates theta oscillations in cross-regional integration, particularly between the hippocampus and PCC, and we show that ripple rate, but not ripple duration, is correlated with the quantity of encoded order information. Notably, we find evidence for theta phase coding of serial position for early list items. We link our findings with computational and anatomical models of episodic memory processing as well as general theories of temporal binding facilitated by co-rippling events. These results point toward complementary mechanisms for order representation across hippocampal circuits and suggest the potential of anatomically specific approaches for neuromodulation that alter mnemonic neurophysiology.",

          "abstract": "Precise and accurate geochronology is essential for reconstructing Earth’s history and coeval life evolution. The Early Triassic was a critical time interval following the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction, recording remarkable biotic changes and a series of environmental and climatic upheavals. Its geochronology remains, however, rather poorly constrained and highly debated. Here, we present high-precision zircon U-Pb dates for four ash beds from the Induan in South China, along with carbon isotope data. We use coupled Bayesian eruption age and Bayesian age–depth models to estimate the ages of our ash beds and to reinterpret the published ages of 25 ash beds from other four sections in South China, as well as to construct new age–depth models for each section. Our new age–depth models, integrated with biostratigraphic data, yield new age estimates for the following boundaries: Permian–Triassic (~251.867 Ma), Griesbachian–Dienerian (~251.562 Ma), Induan–Olenekian (~250.626 Ma), Smithian–Spathian (~249.236 Ma), and Olenekian–Anisian (~246.979 Ma). Calibration of the Early Triassic carbon isotopic record using the new age model reveals highly variable rates of individual carbon isotope excursions. For instance, the negative excursion across the Permian–Triassic boundary exhibits a rate of approximately −11.7‰ per 100 kyr—nearly seven times faster than the early Smithian negative excursion rate of approximately −1.7‰ per 100 kyr. This refined age model also provides a robust temporal framework to evaluate the tempo of biotic evolution in the aftermath of the Permian–Triassic mass extinction.",

          "abstract": "Pregnancy requires a supportive uterine environment facilitated by steroid hormone–regulated differentiation of endometrial stromal fibroblasts into decidual cells and tight control of inflammation. Serum response factor (SRF) is a widely expressed transcription factor essential for mesenchymal cell growth and differentiation with noted roles in hormonal regulation of muscle tissues but little characterization in reproductive organs. Here, we reveal that endometrial SRF is dysregulated in human endometriosis and is critical for female reproductive success in mice through regulation of endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis identified decreased endometrial SRF expression in infertile endometriosis patient tissues. RNAi-based SRF knockdown in human endometrial stromal cells resulted in disrupted cytoskeletal structure, viability, and decidual response. Conditional Srf knockout mice (Srf d/d ) generated using the Pgr Cre were infertile with implantation failure, lack of decidual response, and development of severe endometrial fibrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified dramatic changes in Srf d/d endometrial cell populations including large-scale myeloid immune cell infiltration. Srf d/d stromal fibroblasts displayed aberrant cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix gene expression and downregulation of genes important for decidual growth response. Srf -deficient epithelial cells displayed the most prominent dysregulation, strongly overexpressing estrogenic innate inflammatory genes including C3 and Lcn2 and fibrogenic genes Mmp7 and Fbln1 , all of which paralleled patterns in human endometriosis patient data that we identified through comparative analysis using a published single-cell atlas. These results demonstrate the profound impact of SRF on endometrial homeostasis with relevance to human endometriosis–related infertility.",

While AlphaFold3 represents a significant advancement, enhancing its accuracy for specific binding sites remains a challenge. We present SiteAF3, a method for accurate site-specific folding via conditional diffusion, built upon the AlphaFold3 framework. SiteAF3 refines the diffusion process by fixing the receptor structure and optionally incorporating binding pocket and hotspot residue information. Comprehensive evaluations on protein–small molecule, protein–peptide, and protein–nucleic acid datasets demonstrate that SiteAF3 consistently outperforms AlphaFold3, achieving higher accuracy in complex structure prediction especially for orphan proteins and allosteric ligands, with reduced computational cost. SiteAF3 offers a user-friendly plug-in compatible with AlphaFold3, providing a valuable tool for more accurate modeling of biomolecular interactions.",

          "abstract": "l -Fucose, a 6-deoxy-monosaccharide, is often incorporated into O-antigens in Rhizobia where it serves as an important marker for host recognition. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize WrtF, an O-antigen polysaccharide l -fucosyltransferase from the plant endosymbiont Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899. We show that WrtF transfers l -fucose from its donor, guanosine 5′-diphospho-β- l -fucose (GDP-Fuc), to a nonreducing end glucose, creating an α-(1→4) linkage. We determined structures of WrtF at resolutions between 1.45 and 2.3 Å in the apo state, and in complex with GDP, GDP-Fuc, nonacetylated and acetylated trisaccharide acceptors, and with a tetrasaccharide product. WrtF has an N-terminal glycosyltransferase A (GT-A) fold and a unique C-terminal α-helical bundle domain. The structures, combined with activity assays, and sequence analysis show that WrtF is unusual in using neither divalent cations nor basic residues to coordinate and stabilize the donor pyrophosphate. In contrast to almost all previously characterized GT-A glycosyltransferases that use α-linked donors that present the donor monosaccharide axially, GDP-Fuc presents its monosaccharide equatorially. GDP-Fuc binds in a compact conformation with the l -fucose endocyclic oxygen and C6 methyl packed against ribose C5 and C4, respectively. This binding mode paradoxically shields the anomeric carbon from attack; superposition of the donor and acceptor complexes suggests that these substrates would sterically hinder one another and do not appropriately orient to form a Michaelis complex. We therefore propose that the donor l -fucose must reorient in the active site prior to turnover. The preferred occluded donor binding mode may serve to “prescreen” GDP-Fuc from structurally similar candidate donors, while also minimizing counterproductive donor hydrolysis.",

However, the extent to which these findings can be generalized to humans remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a fully data-driven approach to examine the wiring diagram of each voxel in the human SC in a cohort of 200 participants. Using diffusion MRI to infer probabilistic tractography, we identified three subregions within the human SC with distinct topography and unique brain-wide connectivity patterns. A superficial division is primarily linked with visual cortical areas, the amygdala, and the posterior thalamus. An intermediate-lateral division is connected predominantly with the auditory and somatosensory cortices and with sectors of the posterior parietal cortex. A deep subregion exhibits preferential connectivity with the brainstem and cerebellum. These in vivo features highlight the heterogeneity in the extrinsic connectivity of the human SC. Probabilistic coupling partly reflects conserved SC interaction motifs reported in other mammals with direct tracing methods, while also showing potential adaptations of cortical–midbrain interactions compatible with human neocortical expansion.",

To this end, we combine data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) with Norwegian register data to estimate the interaction between measures of children’s predisposition to education and school quality. We use MoBa’s genetic data to compute polygenic indices for educational attainment ( PGI EA ). Importantly, MoBa includes genetic data on mother-father-child trios, allowing us to identify causal genetic effects using within-family variation. We calculate school value-added measures from Norwegian register data, allowing us to causally estimate school quality effects. Leveraging the advantages of both data sources, we provide a causally identified study of gene–environment interactions in the school context. We find evidence for substitutability of PGI EA and school quality in reading but not numeracy: A 1 SD increase of school quality decreases the impact of a 1 SD increase of PGI EA on reading test scores by 6%. The substitutability arises through gains of students at the lower end of the PGI EA distribution. This suggests that investments in school quality may help reduce educational inequalities arising from genetic differences between students.",

Despite being commonly accepted that the mechanism of action of AMPs is associated with the permeabilization of the cell membrane, the structural and dynamical means by which this occurs are still heavily debated. In this work, we employ experimental time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering to follow in real time the AMP-induced ion transport in lipid vesicles, while simultaneously resolving the membrane structure and peptide partitioning. For several natural AMPs, we show that they can effectively permeabilize the lipid membrane despite only binding peripherally to the outer membrane leaflet. Our experiments reveal rapid ion transport associated with AMP binding, yielding salt equilibration in a few tens of milliseconds, while not detecting evidence of transversal and structurally stable peptide pores. On the contrary, new analysis of previously reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations shows that lipid flip-flop, accelerated by the peripherally bound peptides, leads to the formation of transient, ion-conducting water channels. A corresponding diffusional model indicates that such short-lived, transient pores explain the observed ion transport better than stable pores.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial cells are inherently contractile and in homeostasis, tissue integrity is maintained by balancing the uneven contractile forces in neighboring cells at the cell–cell interface. By contrast, epithelial cells can utilize an imbalance in contractile force to communicate various information to induce tissue-wide response as in wound healing. Contractility is generated and processed at the apical junctional complex (AJC) by the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Calcium signaling can pattern cellular responses based on its reach and amplitude and the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its wide ranging effects on actin regulators. Calcium transients regulate various cell behaviors associated with actin remodeling, such as in damage response and developmental morphogenesis. Here, we report that calcium maintains an adaptive pool of AJC-associated actin that is sensitive to tension and encoded by calcium dynamics. For this, the recently identified epithelial polarity module Homer-MUPP1/PatJ is required. Homer regulates calcium signaling in various tissue contexts through interaction with numerous components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) calcium signal toolkit. Knockout of either Homer or MUPP1/PatJ attenuated tension-induced calcium response and severely disrupted wound healing migration, which is dependent on guidance input through AJC tension. We also show that Homer is integral to early embryonic neurodevelopment as its suppression causes failure of neural tube closure. Our findings highlight the critical role of localized calcium dynamics on AJC actin remodeling and cellular behavior, elucidating the means of tissue coordination through intercellular tension.",

However, neither the magnitude nor the distribution of CaCO 3 dissolution in the modern oceans is well constrained. Here we diagnose CaCO 3 dissolution rates in major oceanic regions and reconstruct CaCO 3 settling flux using a data-constrained ocean circulation model and observational climatologies of global seawater alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Our approach distinguishes the effects of ocean circulation and CaCO 3 dissolution on seawater alkalinity and dissolved oxygen, and involves only one free parameter, a restoring timescale, which is constrained by compiling carbonate export rates estimated in the literature. We find that CaCO 3 dissolution in shallow waters (above the saturation horizon of aragonite) is much smaller than some recent estimates. Excluding the upper 114 m of the euphotic zone, the fraction of CaCO 3 dissolution within aragonite saturated waters is only about 16.5 ± 5.5%. About 39.8 ± 4.5% of CaCO 3 dissolution occurs below the aragonite saturation horizon but above the saturation horizon of calcite. The remaining 43.7 ± 3.8% dissolves in the deep ocean in undersaturated seawater. These results suggest that the seawater CaCO 3 saturation state is the primary control on CaCO 3 dissolution in the ocean.",

Elucidating the organization of these clock networks is critical to understanding how circadian clocks achieve robust timing. Clock neurons have been best characterized in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster . At the early stages of development, Drosophila has a clock network consisting of only nine neurons per hemisphere. This set of clock neurons consists of lateral and dorsal neurons and persists in the adult fly, in which the clock network is greatly expanded to a total of ~240 neurons. The function of the early-born lateral clock neurons is well established in the adult fly. They control morning and evening activity and are responsible for circadian rhythmicity under constant conditions. Only recent studies have begun to dissect the function of the dorsal clock neurons. Using clock rescue experiments, we show here that a functional clock in only four of them, the DN 1a , is sufficient to restore a bimodal locomotor activity pattern and rhythmic activity under constant conditions in the adult fly. This is achieved by CCHamide-1 signaling most likely to the lateral morning neurons, which are considered the main pacemakers of the clock, and by glutamate signaling to the lateral evening neurons. Interestingly, all the neurons involved are part of the early-born clock network, strongly suggesting that a core clock is already formed during early development. This set of clock neurons appears sufficient in the adult fly to drive the basal circadian activity pattern.",

          "abstract": "Soybean serves as a critical source of plant-based protein for both livestock and human nutrition, making seed protein content a key agronomic trait. However, modern soybean cultivars exhibit reduced seed protein content compared to their wild relatives, as a consequence of domestication and historical selection that favored yield over nutritional quality. Thus, genetic improvement of seed protein is highly desired in soybean breeding, while numerous genetic loci associated with this trait remain uncharacterized. Here, we report Protein Contributor 08 ( PC08 ), identified through a genome-wide association study, as a key regulator of seed storage protein accumulation. PC08 encodes a homolog of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 5 enzyme, a rate-limiting enzyme in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and is highly expressed during seed development. A nucleic acid T and A (TA)-rich insertion within the PC08 promoter region (designated as PC08 Ins ) enhances transcriptional activity, leading to elevated PC08 expression. Transgenic evidence confirmed its positive regulatory role in seed protein accumulation, mechanistically linked to increased ABA biosynthesis in developing seeds. ABA upregulation activates downstream pathways that promote storage protein synthesis. Population genetic analyses revealed that the PC08 Ins , which confers high protein content, exclusively exists in wild soybean populations and was entirely absent after domestication. Introgression of PC08 Ins into the elite cultivar Hei Nong 35 significantly increased seed protein content. These findings highlight a domestication-eroded allele with untapped potential for modern breeding, offering a valuable genetic target to enhance soybean nutritional quality.",

          "abstract": "While practicing a new motor skill, resting for a few seconds can improve performance immediately after the rest. This improvement, referred to as “micro-offline gains” (MOGs), has been interpreted as rapid offline learning and is thought to be supported by neural replay of the trained movement sequence during rest. Here, we provide evidence that MOGs reflect only transient performance benefits, partially mediated by motor planning, and not offline learning. In five experiments, participants trained to produce a sequence of finger movements as many times as possible. When participants trained during 10-s practice periods, interleaved with 10-s rest periods, they produced more correct keypresses during training than participants who trained continuously without taking breaks. However, this benefit vanished within seconds after training, when both groups performed under comparable conditions, revealing similar levels of skill acquisition. This challenges the idea that MOGs reflect offline learning, which, if present, should result in sustained performance benefits, compared to training without breaks. Furthermore, we observed persistent MOGs even when participants produced random, nonrepeating sequences, indicating that MOGs do not relate to the offline consolidation of a sequence-specific memory. Rather, sequence-specific learning was only evident online, during practice. Finally, MOGs were diminished when participants could not preplan the first few movements of an upcoming practice period. Our results suggest that MOG are simply an effect of slowing during practice, combined with the possibility of preplanning the initial movements after rest, and therefore do not serve as a reliable metric for offline learning or skill-related consolidation.",

The Aβ-degrading enzymes (ADEs) are a collective group of proteases that normally promote clearance to counteract Aβ-induced neurodegeneration. We previously discovered that the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 is an atypical ADE that produces the nontoxic fragment Aβ34 by recognizing 40- or 42-residue-long Aβ peptides as substrates in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined other known ADEs for their potential roles in degrading Aβ34, Aβ40, and Aβ42. By genetic, cellular, and pharmacological approaches, we identified and characterized endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) in a human neuroblastoma cell line, human brain vascular pericytes, and primary rat cortical cultures as a major enzyme degrading Aβ34 but not Aβ40 or Aβ42. Notably, we found that ECE1 cleaves Aβ34, an indicator of amyloid clearance, to a unique and unusually stable Aβ20-34 fragment that has the potential to serve as a measurable biomarker. Biocomputational analyses from non-AD controls and individuals with AD pathology showed that the highest messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of ECE1 expression were found in pericytes (i.e., cells within the brain microvasculature that are known to produce Aβ34) compared to other cell types. Given Aβ34 is an indicator for prodromal AD, we postulate that our collective findings (i.e., generation of Aβ34 and Aβ20-34 intermediates within the “amyloidolytic” degradation pathway) will generate a set of biomarkers to detect amyloid clearance activity in vivo.",

Recent theorizing has found that, despite promoting the counterintuitive behavior of longer deliberation, which is less rewarding in the short term, it is nevertheless normative to account for the value of learning when determining control allocation. Here, we sought to test this proposal by examining whether people were willing to allocate greater control and thereby expend greater effort (e.g., deliberate for longer) when they perceived a task to be learnable compared to when they did not. We found that participants’ proficiency and learning rate in the first block of a simple perceptual dot-motion task were able to predict their willingness to deliberate in a second block. These findings support the hypothesis that agents consider learnability when allocating cognitive control, and comply with a formal model of control allocation that considers the future discounted value of learning on reward.",

          "abstract": "Surface interactions play a crucial role in shaping the motility patterns and ecological adaptations of swimming bacteria. Previous studies have primarily focused on peritrichous bacteria like Escherichia coli , whose multiple flagella form a bundle during swimming, allowing them to remain trapped at surfaces for extended periods. However, this surface entrapment phenomenon varies significantly among different bacterial species, despite all fitting into the simplified theoretical models of pusher-type bacteria, suggesting that key factors remain unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that flagellar location is a critical determinant of surface entrapment stability in pusher-type bacteria. Using fluorescently labeled Pseudomonas aeruginosa , we show that cells with a single lateral flagellum exhibit substantially longer surface residence times compared to those with a single polar flagellum, despite similar cell morphology and swimming speeds. Through direct visualization of bacterial orientation angles relative to surfaces, we reveal that this difference results from the distinct bending directions of the flagellar hook—the flexible joint connecting the rigid filament to the cell body. The hook-generated torque resists reorientation differently depending on flagellar location, facilitating surface escape for polar-flagellated bacteria while enhancing entrapment for lateral-flagellated bacteria. Our findings highlight the previously overlooked importance of flagellar placement in bacterial surface interactions, providing insights for understanding microbial ecology and designing biomimetic microswimmers.",

An often overlooked part of the nation’s science ecosystem, however, are the small, independent marine laboratories that are also bearing the brunt of funding cuts and other constraints imposed by the Trump administration. These institutions have long nurtured generations of scientists—from high school students to Nobel laureates—and precipitated discoveries that have advanced modern science. Yet they now face an uncertain future, and losing them would eliminate not only a powerful convergence of research and education but also a wellspring of scientific advancement.",

          "abstract": "The 28 March 2025 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.7 earthquake in Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar), ruptured 475 kilometers of the Sagaing Fault, which was more than twice the length predicted by magnitude scaling relationships. Kinematic slip models and observation of a Rayleigh Mach wave that passed through parts of Thailand confirmed that rupture occurred at supershear velocities of greater than 5 kilometers per second. The anomalous length exposed a vast population to violent near-fault shaking. The Mandalay earthquake is a modern analog for the M w 7.9 1906 San Francisco earthquake, another atypically long and fast rupture. Probabilistic seismic hazard analyses use scaling relations that do not account for such long ruptures at moderate magnitudes. This limitation, in conjunction with a likely increased population and infrastructure exposure for atypically long ruptures, contributes to a potential mischaracterization of seismic risk.",

We report that introducing trace amounts [parts per million (ppm) level] of halogen-containing compounds into the feed gas can suppress CO 2 formation using iron-based catalysts and boost olefin selectivity over paraffin and olefin productivity. Cofeeding 20 ppm bromomethane over an iron carbide catalyst decreased CO 2 selectivity to &lt;1% and increased olefin selectivity to ~85% among all carbon-containing products. Surface-bound halogens modulated the catalyst surface structure and selectively inhibited pathways responsible for CO 2 generation and olefin hydrogenation.

With holistic geodetic and seismic techniques, we resolved its rupture dynamics and fault zone structure. The rupture initiated as bilateral subshear and transitioned to supershear (~5.3 km/s) about 100 km south of the epicenter, sustaining this velocity for more than 200 km. The supershear segment aligns with a ~2-km–thick low-velocity fault zone exhibiting ~45% shear wave speed reduction. We suggest that the thick fault zone, aided by fault geometry and basin structure, enabled prolonged supershear propagation.

LEC GLU drives excitation in CA3 but also substantial feedforward inhibition that prevents somatic and dendritic spikes. Conversely, LEC GABA suppresses this local inhibition to disinhibit CA3 activity with compartment- and pathway-specificity by selectively boosting somatic output to integrated LEC GLU and CA3 recurrent inputs.

We captured multiple conformational states, revealing how TBCs orchestrate tubulin heterodimer biogenesis. TBCD stabilizes monomeric β-tubulin and scaffolds the other cofactors. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding to Arl2 induces conformational changes that toggle the complex between assembly and disassembly. TBCD and TBCE guide α- and β-tubulin into a partially assembled interface, and TBCC, acting as a molecular clamp, completes the heterodimer. TBCD also functions as a GTPase activating protein for β-tubulin. β-tubulin GTP hydrolysis is coupled to Arl2’s GTPase activity, establishing a checkpoint that ensures that only fully matured heterodimers proceed.

Guided by these predictions, we engineered separation-of-function telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mutants and found that the loss of RPA-mediated stimulation impairs telomere elongation, even when TPP1–POT1–mediated stimulation remains intact. Furthermore, short-telomere disease–associated TERT mutations reduce RPA-dependent telomerase stimulation, revealing a mechanistic link between impaired processivity and telomeropathies.

Chimpanzees responded to counterevidence in ways predicted by a formal model of rational belief revision: They remained committed to their initial belief when the evidence supporting the alternative belief was weaker, but they revised their initial belief when the supporting evidence was stronger. Results suggest that this pattern of belief revision was guided by the explicit representation and weighing of evidence.

Counterfactual analysis, using Bayesian structural time-series (BSTS) modeling, confirmed that infectious diseases that are directly transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols) experienced the greatest disruption to transmission. By contrast, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) experienced a smaller transient disruption, and increasing trends in incidence prepandemic appear to have been curtailed. Using epidemiological theory, we demonstrate that the observed magnitudes and durations of notifications deficits were determined by fundamental disease system properties, namely, the serial interval, basic reproductive number, and susceptible recruitment.",

          "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) deficiency upon Breast Cancer Gene 2 (BRCA2) loss arises from defects in the formation of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. We demonstrate that loss of the anti-recombinase Fidgetin Like 1 (FIGNL1) retains RAD51 loading at DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in BRCA2-deficient cells, leading to genome stability, HR proficiency, and viability of BRCA2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arise from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading. Furthermore, we identify that the MMS22L-TONSL complex interacts with FIGNL1 and is critical for HR in BRCA2/FIGNL1 double-deficient cells. These findings identify a pathway for tightly regulating RAD51 activity to promote efficient HR, offering insights into mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors.",

Current miniaturized imaging microscopes are typically limited to imaging a relatively small field of view (FOV), precluding the measurement of neural activities across multiple brain regions. Here, we present a miniaturized micro-camera array microscope (mini-MCAM) that consists of four fluorescence imaging micro-cameras, each capable of capturing neural activity across a 4.5 millimeter × 2.55 millimeter FOV. Cumulatively, the mini-MCAM images over a 30–square millimeter area of sparsely expressed GCaMP6s neurons that were distributed throughout the dorsal cortex, in regions including the primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, retrosplenial, and association cortices across both hemispheres. We demonstrate cortex-wide cellular resolution in vivo calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging using the mini-MCAM in both head-fixed and freely behaving mice.",

Microbial cell factories offer a promising solution, yet reconstituting plant cytochrome P450s, key enzymes in these pathways, remains a major hurdle. In this study, we investigated a plant membrane protein, AtMSBP1, for its ability to broadly enhance P450 functionality in engineered yeast. Unlike in plants, interactions with cytochrome P450s are not essential for AtMSBP1’s function in yeast. Specifically, AtMSBP1 orchestrates interorganelle communication, involving not only the endoplasmic reticulum but also mitochondria and vacuoles, supporting cytochrome P450s functionality in yeast. This study highlights the critical role of cross-organelle coordination in supporting cytochrome P450s functionality, emphasizing a shift from traditional ER-based approaches to engineering cross-organelle interactions and tailoring the cellular microenvironment to enhance plant cytochrome P450s functionality in yeast.",

We address this challenge by developing a biosensor-driven, growth-coupled selection strategy in Pseudomonas putida for isoprenol, a potential aviation fuel precursor. We found and characterized a noncanonical signaling pathway, revealing a functional and physical complex between a hybrid histidine kinase and an alcohol dehydrogenase, whose activity is tuned by heterodimerization. Leveraging this biosensor in a pooled CRISPRi library selection, we identified key host limitations. Iterative combinatorial strain engineering derived from these hits yielded a 36-fold titer increase to ~900 milligrams per liter. Integrated omics analysis revealed that metabolic rewiring toward amino acid catabolism was crucial for this improvement. This observation was found to be beneficial by technoeconomic analysis. Our modular workflow provides a powerful strategy for optimizing complex heterologous pathways and uncovering emergent host biology.",

Metasurface emerges as a transformative platform for compact polarization imaging systems, but prior strategies suffer from limited imaging field-of-view (FOV) and coarse-grained polarization pixels. Here, we demonstrate a meta-grating-lens (MGL)–based monolithic polarization camera achieving 14° FOV and real-time full-Stokes polarization imaging in the near-infrared region. The optimized MGL exhibits &gt;60% focusing efficiency with &lt;3% zeroth-order noise, enabling simultaneous polarization analysis, beam-splitting, and imaging functionalities in a fine-grained pixel level. This synergistic design enables both efficient light utilization and accurate polarization reconstruction. The proposed polarization camera has the potential to unlock wide range of applications including autonomous navigation, biomedical diagnostics, and even compact Muller matrix imaging systems.",

We analyzed genome-wide data from 7 ancient (~2300 to 100 years old) and 10 present-day individuals from the northern Indian Himalayas and one ~3370-year-old individual from the Central Himalayas in Nepal. Ancient and present-day individuals from the northern Himalayas predominantly have Tibetan-related genetic ancestry, likely the source of high-altitude adaptive variants in these individuals, with substantial Steppe-related genetic ancestry that is observed in all individuals dating between ~1300 years and present day.

          "abstract": "In the single-photon emission from a two-level system, multiphotons are generally regarded as accidental, undesired, and unrelated to the mechanism. In coherently driven systems, however, they form the cornerstone of single-photon emission, which arises from quantum interferences between virtual multiphoton fluctuations of the emitter and the Poissonian superposition of all number states induced by the driving. Here, we demonstrate how one can control the multiphoton dynamics by disrupting these quantum interferences through an external homodyne control of the emitter’s mean field. Experimentally, we observed a transition from single-photon to multiphoton emission, up to three-photon correlations. We show that, counterintuitively, quantum fluctuations always play a major qualitative role, even and, in fact, especially when their quantitative contribution is vanishing. Our findings provide distinct insights into the paradoxical character of quantum mechanics and open pathways for mean-field engineering as a tool for precision multiphoton control.",

IC7Fc was previously shown to slow the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and here, we demonstrate its effect on atherosclerotic development. In APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, an atherosclerosis-prone model with a humanized lipoprotein metabolism, IC7Fc markedly lowered plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. This was mechanistically explained by an inhibition of de novo lipogenesis in the liver, increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and down-regulated apolipoprotein B synthesis, which resulted in decreased cholesterol secretion in very low–density lipoprotein particles. As a consequence, IC7Fc treatment considerably reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation and vascular inflammation compared with current antihyperlipidemic therapy. In conclusion, IC7Fc is a promising pharmacological treatment for cardiometabolic diseases targeting hyperlipidemia and inflammation.",

To uncover the underlying chemistry behind this phenomenon, we combined structural sampling with quantum-chemical analysis of amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiN x ) based on DFT. Our analysis demonstrates that coordination defects act as charge traps, with a density on the order of 10 21 per cubic centimeter. These defects render singly occupied electronic states energetically less favorable than paired or fully emptied states, primarily due to electron donor-acceptor interactions. Furthermore, excess charge trapping occurs through chemical bond reorganization, which disrupts the balance of existing electron and hole traps. In addition, we found that in Si-rich a-SiN x , various Si─Si bonding networks exhibit power-law–like size distribution, where larger networks are associated with deeper trap levels. These findings explain why a-SiN x has been used as a charge storage layer in the charge trap flash memory.",

We conducted a multiproxy analysis of 16 ochre pieces from Middle Paleolithic Micoquian sites in Crimea [Zaskalnaya V (ZSKV), ZSKVI, and Prolom II] and mainland Ukraine (Mukhovets), spanning up to 70,000 years. Using portable x-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and technological analysis, we identified deliberate modifications including grinding, scoring, flaking, and scraping. Three pieces (ZSKV-05, ZSKV-06, and ZSKV-07) show features exceeding utilitarian use: One is shaped into a crayon-like tool with repeated resharpening, another appears to be a crayon fragment, and a third bears engraved, polished surfaces. These traits suggest the intentional production of marks and curated use. While practical applications (e.g., hide processing) remain plausible for other specimens, the evidence supports symbolic use among some Crimean Neanderthals. Our results highlight their cognitive complexity and underscore the importance of regional, multiproxy approaches in evaluating the emergence of symbolic material culture.",

To elucidate the developmental roles of IHCs and OHCs in the formation, differentiation, and assembly of the various SCs, we genetically switched HC identities at several developmental stages and also generated mice lacking IHCs. We find that IHCs promote or induce the (i) differentiation of one SC type (outer pillar) at the expense of another (Deiters’), so that each completely and exclusively populates separate rows; (ii) packing density, but not identity, of inner pillar cells; and (iii) embryonic formation and (iv) cytoplasmic attraction of adjacent inner phalangeal cells, which envelop IHCs.

To overcome this, we integrated a “crystallization-activated moisture barrier” into the perovskite film, which can exist in a liquid state/crystallization phase during the initial annealing to allow moisture to enter and promote crystallization, then migrate upward, and form a dense hydrophobic layer on the film surface to protect the perovskite from high humidity–caused damage. Such a “moisture barrier” enables the manufacturing of perovskite films to be insensitive to a wide range of relative humidity from 20% to over 90%. The barrier also regulates bulk crystallization and passivates surface defects. The crystallization-activated moisture barrier effectively reduces the sensitivity of perovskite films to humidity during annealing, which paves the way for high-tolerance manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaic devices.",

By tuning the bilayer’s fabrication parameters, on-demand wrinkle morphologies and color combinations are achieved. Spatially selective ultraviolet (UV) curing allows localized surface textures, while chemical patterning of the CLCE layer enables region-specific color responses, expanding the design space for multifunctional, spatially encoded optical materials. The CLCE-LCE bilayer enables dynamic thermal regulation by tuning light absorption through synergistically modulating surface morphology and color. Notably, this system achieves strain-dependent multistate encoding via multistep selective UV curing, revealing distinct visual content under different applied strains.

          "abstract": "Aging is characterized by disruptions in metabolic homeostasis, yet the mechanisms that regulate these metabolic changes remain poorly understood. We show that the serine/threonine–protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) regulatory subunit 3, SAPS3, is a critical regulator of metabolism during aging. SAPS3 deletion significantly extends lifespan in mice and counteracts age-related impairments in metabolic health. SAPS3 deficiency improves the effects of aging on the affective behaviors, cognition, and motor functions in aged mice. We find that SAPS3 expression is increased during aging to inhibit adenosine monophosphate–activated kinase (AMPK) activity. Deletion of SAPS3 leads to AMPK activation and reverses cellular senescence and aging-induced metabolic alterations. Using in vivo U- 13 C 6 -D-glucose tracing and metabolomic analysis, we find that SAPS3 deficiency restores metabolic homeostasis with increased glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and decreased fatty acid synthesis in aged mice. These findings highlight a critical role of the SAPS3/PP6 phosphatase complex in aging and suggest that strategies targeting SAPS3 may promote longevity and healthy aging.",

          "abstract": "Conventional solution-based passivation methods for perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) often introduce secondary defects. A molecularly tailored dual-interface passivation strategy is presented using a solvent-free rub-on transfer method, which enables uniform molecular deposition without inducing secondary defects. Specifically, 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MPy) is applied at the buried interface, and 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MPy) is applied on the perovskite surface. At the buried interface, 4-MPy stabilizes Ni 3+ states, reduces oxygen vacancies, and improves hole injection. In contrast, surface-deposited 2-MPy coordinates effectively with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions, forming wide-bandgap complexes that suppress trap states and enhance carrier confinement. As a result, the optimized PeLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.67% and a current efficiency of 95.01 candela per ampere, the highest values reported for solution-processed polycrystalline CsPbBr 3 –based PeLEDs. Furthermore, the operational half-life is substantially extended by nearly 10-fold at an initial luminance of 1000 candela per square meter.",

During BAT activation, macroautophagy is inhibited, while chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is induced, promoting thermogenic gene expression, adipokine release, oxidative activity, and lipolysis. Aging reduces BAT function and lowers levels of LAMP2A, the rate-limiting CMA component. Pharmacological CMA activation restores BAT activity in aged mice. To explore the CMA’s role in BAT, we generated LAMP2A-deficient brown adipocytes and found that CMA regulates proteins essential for thermogenesis and metabolism. Blocking CMA in BAT reduced energy expenditure, raised blood triglycerides, impaired secretion, and led to an increase of thermogenesis repressors. These findings show that CMA is essential for maintaining BAT function, especially during adaptive thermogenesis. By degrading repressors of thermogenesis, CMA supports BAT activity under cold or metabolic stress. This work highlights CMA as a key regulator of BAT plasticity and a promising therapeutic target for treating age-related metabolic disorders.",

Hence, we identify suitable areas for offshore wind and solar PV development on the basis of economic feasibility, technical constraints, and environmental considerations and quantify the national potential for electricity production and CO 2 reduction contributions. With a conservative assumption of using 1% of suitable areas, offshore wind and solar PV could generate ~6049 and 14,173 terawatt-hours of electricity annually. This would cover nearly 30% of the expected global electricity demand in 2050. The resulting reductions in carbon dioxide emissions could exceed 9 billion tonnes annually.

This study introduces Carba1, a bifunctional carbazole compound that protects against CIPN through two mechanisms. First, Carba1 interacts with tubulin, allowing for lower doses of taxanes, common chemotherapeutics known for causing CIPN, without reducing their anticancer effectiveness. Second, Carba1 activates nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), enhancing NAD biosynthesis and boosting the metabolic resilience of neurons and Schwann cells against chemotherapy-induced damage. Carba1 shows strong neuroprotective effects in vitro against paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bortezomib toxicity and in vivo in a rat model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Crucially, Carba1 does not interfere with paclitaxel’s tumor-fighting ability or promote tumor growth. Structure-activity analyses of Carba1 derivatives reveal the potential to develop compounds with dual or solely neuroprotective effects.

We apply microfluidics to enrich CTCs from 34 patients with DCIS and find a significantly higher concentration of CTCs compared to in healthy controls. We profile CTCs and matched DCIS tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing. We find that CTCs express higher clonal aberrations when compared to white blood cells from the same samples, and clonal comparisons between matched tissue and CTC samples provide evidence for an evolutionary bottleneck model. mRNA expression in CTC reveals EMT/MET and immunoregulatory pathway regulation with a suggestion of racial differences.

By integrating in situ heating with 4D-STEM, we captured a previously unobserved strain relaxation pathway involving the formation of periodic partial dislocations that stabilizes the strain-relieved equilibrium state. This study establishes a quantitative framework for equilibrium strain in fivefold-twinned nanostructures and offers strain engineering strategies for tailored properties.",

          "abstract": "The global burden of disease attributable to obesity continues to rise. The disease incidence is substantially higher in elderly populations, but how obesity affects disease risk across a lifetime is largely unknown. To quantify the long-term temporal impact of obesity, access to large-scale longitudinal cohorts spanning many decades would typically be required. However, these longitudinal studies are rare and may be heavily biased by the presence of unaccountable confounding. Here, we develop a method—time-resolved Mendelian randomization—to estimate the cumulative effect of body mass index on disease risk at different ages. Using the UK Biobank, we find strong age-varying patterns for type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation, as well as for osteoarthritis. We demonstrate that some of the most notable temporal characteristics are sex specific, while other features are shared between sexes. Analyses suggest that these features can be manifestations of primary prevention strategies.",

We created similarity networks for both class I and class II HLA alleles, illustrating how peptide cross-presentation contributes to HLA-TCR cross-reactivity. Our analysis revealed disease susceptibilities missed by single-HLA enrichment analyses, especially in the Black population.

Integration with Lamonte and tadpole-like traces reveals important behavioral innovations from simple horizontal locomotion to complex sediment penetration, thereby bridging ecological and behavioral transitions across the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. The advent of three-dimensional sediment exploration fundamentally altered benthic ecodynamics and disrupted microbial mat stability. This shift reflects a fundamental restructuring of infaunal habitats, which temporally coincided with the decline of matground-related Ediacaran macro-organisms. These innovations laid the foundation for Phanerozoic animal-sediment interactions, catalyzing a pivotal ecological transition predating yet enabling the Cambrian Explosion.",

Highlighting the significance of this pathway, several components are somatically mutated in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurological disorder characterized by intractable epilepsy. Supporting the functional impact of these variants, patient-derived SARM1 and RhoA mutations potentiate cilia loss, and a RhoA variant impairs cortical development. Conversely, SARM1 inhibition restores cilia in cells with FCD-associated alterations.

Recent results suggest that enhancing ISR kinase activity could ameliorate pathologies linked to numerous diseases, including many neurodegenerative disorders. However, few pharmacological strategies exist to selectively activate ISR kinases and downstream adaptive signaling. Here, we report that compound A8 can preferentially activate the ISR through the binding of the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, which subsequently activates the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) ISR kinase independent of an interferon response.

However, whether a shared mechanism drives Golgi fragmentation across different neurodegenerative conditions remains unclear. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (ITCH) as a key regulator of proteotoxicity through its role in inducing Golgi fragmentation. Disease-associated accumulation of ITCH promotes fragmentation of both the cis- and trans-Golgi networks, disrupting protein sorting and impairing lysosomal functions. The ITCH-dependent lysosomal dysfunction compromises the clearance of misfolded proteins associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of ITCH protects against proteotoxicity in both mammalian neurons and Drosophila models of neurodegeneration. The accumulation of ITCH in patients with ALS and AD is attributed to up-regulation of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP11, which deubiquitinates and stabilizes ITCH.

Over a long period of time, health status is also indicative of life span, with improved health correlating with a longer life. However, the relationship between longevity and behavior remains relatively unexplored. Here, we report that modification of a single longevity gene downstream of dietary restriction and hypoxia markedly alters behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans . We found that modified expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase ( fmo-2 ) leads to altered sensory perception and decision-making in a variety of behavioral paradigms. This cell nonautonomous signaling pathway is linked to changes in tryptophan metabolism, where loss of fmo-2 requires the tryptophan metabolite serotonin and overexpressed fmo-2 requires the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid to change behavior. These results suggest a unique mechanism for gut metabolism to communicate positive satiety signals and negative depressive signals to the organism by modifying an essential amino acid.

Here, we find that Caenorhabditis elegans adapt to repeated generational stresses. We show that, upon two repeated generational hypoxia exposures, the life-span extension is eliminated, and after four repeated generational hypoxia exposures, the reduced fertility is eliminated. Transgenerational adaptation also occurred in response to changes in glucose availability. Transgenerational hypoxia adaptation is dependent on the H3K27 trimethyltransferase PRC2 complex, and we identified transgenerationally adapted genes. Our findings reveal that transgenerational adaptation occurs and suggest that H3K27me3 is a critical modification for adapting to repeated generational stresses.",

Although several methods have been developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these approaches often introduce additional challenges. Here, we present an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered metasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles, enabling IR detection by silicon photodetectors. The disordered design consisting of hybrid Mie-plasmonic cavities can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band light absorption. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for 1550-nm laser is 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 17.6%.

We apply this approach to graphene coupled to cavity photons of different polarizations. Photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, solely due to the quantum nature of light, that lead to substantial renormalization of Dirac bands. The nonlocal interactions induced by anisotropic linearly polarized photons give rise to wedge-shaped bands and Dirac gap. When isotropic cavity photon modes are introduced, the Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the role of nonlocal interactions. This theoretical framework paves the way for revealing nonperturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of cavity-induced phenomena.",

This paper complements and extends the prevailing interpretation that attributes CISS primarily to the electric current in chiral molecules. We propose that molecular vibrations drive spin polarization in chiral molecules and play a critical role in CISS. Our results suggest that magnetic interactions between chiral molecules and ferromagnets, analogous to interlayer exchange coupling, provide a physically consistent mechanism for the observed selectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate that molecular vibrations facilitate the alignment of spin angular momentum dependent on chirality in the presence of an external magnetic field, which is a prerequisite for exchange coupling.

Here, we introduce bacteriophage-loaded microneedle patches that enable targeted phage delivery directly within food, eliminating internal pathogens in a minimally disruptive manner. The application of microneedles within food is first explored. The platform is then substantiated by comparing performance in raw beef and cooked chicken, where we achieved up to 3-log reduction in Escherichia coli , meeting regulatory limits. In contrast, conventional surface application of the same phage failed to provide statistically significant decontamination. To ensure broad applicability, phage cocktails were also loaded into microneedles to demonstrate polymicrobial decontamination.

A core feature of the model is that within each layer, the processing units are tuned to both movement direction and the direction of movement error. The model recapitulates a large range of contextual effects such as how prior learning, error uncertainty, or temporal delay affect the rate of adaptation. While these effects have traditionally been taken to indicate a form of meta-learning or context-dependent memory within the adaptation system, the current results show that they can emerge from the population activity of a cerebellar-like hierarchical network that does not represent context.",

Lichens, symbiotic fungi-algae partnerships, are crucial to nutrient cycling and carbon fixation today, yet their evolutionary history during the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear due to a scarce fossil record. We demonstrate that the enigmatic Devonian fossil Spongiophyton from Brazil captures one of the earliest and most widespread records of lichens. The presence of internal hyphae networks, algal cells, possible reproductive structures, calcium oxalate pseudomorphs, abundant nitrogenous compounds, and fossil lipid composition confirms that it was among the first widespread representatives of lichenized fungi in Earth’s history. Spongiophyton abundance and wide paleogeographic distribution in Devonian successions reveal an ecologically prominent presence of lichens during the late stages of terrestrial colonization, just before the evolution of complex forest ecosystems.",

Here, we present Pt sequencing (Pt-seq), an antibody-assisted, genome-wide method for mapping Pt-DNA adducts at single-base resolution. By using exo- and endonucleases to remove background, Pt-seq enables robust and sensitive profiling of binding sites for cisplatin, oxaliplatin, lobaplatin, and a Pt(IV) complex. Using Pt-seq, we identified tens to hundreds of binding clusters that are 10 to 20 kilobases in median length and highly consistent among different drugs, predominantly localizing to centromeric and ribosomal DNA regions. In cisplatin-resistant cells, we found significantly reduced binding within these regions. Moreover, we found that mutations in cancer cells can generate previously unidentified binding sites. On this basis, we demonstrated that ICR-191, an acridine orange compound capable of inducing G insertions, enhances cisplatin-DNA binding and sensitizes cells to cisplatin. Collectively, Pt-seq sensitively profiles Pt–DNA interactions and deepens our understanding of the genome-wide effect of chemotherapeutic drugs.",

          "abstract": "For preclinical studies, the standard practice for evaluating lung injury usually involves an assessment of pulmonary histopathology by a certified pathologist. This is typically accomplished by light microscopy using a semiquantitative four-point scale. In contrast, automated image analysis software allows a more quantitative assessment, though inherent limitations with such automated programs can produce misleading conclusions. For example, specific imaging features may be incorrectly scored or classified within the specimen because of the complex architecture and heterogeneous structures present in the lung. In addition, tissue processing and handling may further introduce artifacts and inconsistencies that affect automated analysis. To address these limitations, we developed a lung image analysis program, Wide-Angle Lung Experiment Segmentation (WALES), which uses Meta’s Segment Anything Model to provide semiautomated masking and relative density analysis to efficiently quantify lung injury. Density analysis using WALES effectively delineated varying severities of lung injury, not achieved using more standard methods. WALES is widely applicable for many preclinical lung injury models.",

Through implementing efficient infrastructure that rapidly screens and investigates thousands of knowledgebases, KYCG addresses the challenges of data sparsity in various methylation datasets, including low-pass or single-cell DNA methylomes, 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC) profiles, spatial DNA methylation maps, and array-based datasets for epigenome-wide association studies. Applying KYCG to these datasets provides valuable insights into cell differentiation, cancer origins, epigenome-trait associations, and technical issues such as array artifacts, single-cell batch effects, and Nanopore 5hmC detection accuracy.

We developed a method, faunal phylogenetic contribution, to quantify faunal relationships based on taxon distances in a supertree. Our results suggest Central Asia faunas exhibited two notable expansion phases: 19 to 16 million years (Ma) ago (pre-Tunggurian surge) and 11 to 9 Ma ago (Bahean surge). The latter phase was directly correlated with formation of the modern large-mammalian faunas, driven by the ecomorphological revolution of local mammalian communities following a regional mass extinction, “the Central Asian Tortonian Crisis.” We propose that the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau altered Central Asian hydrological system, promoting aridification and earlier development of open habitats, which in turn drove the adaptation of large mammals to prolonged environmental shifts.",

Through bioinformatic and functional analyses, we demonstrated that overexpression of AP4 in mice not only accelerated in vivo axon regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury but also promoted robust axon regeneration and neuronal survival after optic nerve injury by activating mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Neuronal-specific knockdown of AP4 abolished the regenerative phenotype induced by c-Myc overexpression and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion. AP4 overexpression rendered the intrinsic growth capacity of c-Myc silencing injured retinal ganglion cells unaffected.

          "abstract": "RAC1 A159V is a hotspot mutation associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. By gene editing, we generated endogenous homozygous and heterozygous RAC1 A159V mutations, which result in up-regulated RAC1 activity and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. RAC1 A159V tumors grow faster than RAC1 WT tumors in immune-proficient mice and are resistant to anti–programmed death protein 1 (PD1). Flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses reveal that RAC1 A159V cells form “cold” tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and reduced tumor-immune cell interactions. Mechanistically, RAC1 A159V up-regulates glycosphingolipid biosynthesis to activate mTORC1 signaling in tumor cells, which in turn increases glycolysis, impairs key chemokine production, and decreases IFNGR1 expression of the tumor cells. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin resensitizes the RAC1 A159V tumors to anti-PD1 treatment by reversing effects of RAC1 A159V mutation. These results demonstrate a mechanism of RAC1 A159V -driven immune evasion and suggest an approach of combining the targeting of RAC1-mTOR signaling with immune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of a type of immune-cold tumors.",

Here, we use a distinct dataset of ~8000 melanosomes from 60 species (11 mammalian orders) including a Jurassic species to ask more generally what color or environmental variables may explain melanosome geometry in mammals. We confirm support for limited melanosome variation in Jurassic mammals. Crown therian mammalian melanosome diversity as extreme as that in birds is recovered within placental lineages. More environmental variables substantially explain aspects of melanosome geometry than do color variables, but the explanatory power of both sets of variables is limited. Prediction of color from melanosomes in fossil mammals merits caution, given observed lineage-specific trends. Potentially comparatively weak selection on the melanosome geometry-color relationship in mammals or correlations with other life history variables may further explain the evolution of these geometries.",

However, controlled formation of these conduction channels remains challenging, limiting both hole transport and dopability under low thermal budgets. Here, we report a sulfur-mediated redox strategy that modulates the local bonding environment via TeO 2 dissociation and partial Te 4+ reduction, promoting formation of short-chain Te-Te networks.

To address their contribution to physiological health, we generated and analyzed mice individually lacking the histone variants macroH2A1.1, macroH2A1.2, or macroH2A2. We identified several histopathologic changes in the kidney as isoform-specific phenotype of complete macroH2A1.1 loss affecting male and female animals. Kidney alterations were barely associated with organ-intrinsic gene expression changes but strongly correlated with a systemic shift in nutrient metabolization and alterations in NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form) metabolism. Reduced lipid oxidation and increased glycolysis were found in male and female mice lacking macroH2A1.1 but not macroH2A1.2 or macroH2A2. Male macroH2A1.1-deficient mice also had better glucose tolerance and altered hepatic gene expression. Replacing chow by ketogenic diet overrode the macroH2A1.1-dependent metabolic phenotype and prevented kidney abnormalities. Together, our results indicate that macroH2A1.1 controls nutrient metabolization and links macroH2A1.1 levels to secondary changes in the kidney.",

We assembled a dataset of tooth morphology from 30 species and combined it with functional data such as diet, habitat, and body size. Simulated extinction scenarios, where species were sequentially removed from the highest to lowest threat level, revealed that the loss of threatened species would result in marked homogenization of morphology and ecology. Along this extinction trajectory, trait structures become increasingly depauperate, marked by contracting depth ranges and declining body-size diversity.

Experimental and computational analyses reveal a distinct luminescence mechanism dominated by intermolecular Cu(I)∙∙∙Cu(I) interactions. An unconventional halogen-free strategy substantially enhances the radioluminescence of a methyl-substituted copper(I) trinuclear complex, achieving an exceptional light yield of ~70,475 photons/MeV.

Moreover, real-time angiography simulations validated its capability for dynamic x-ray imaging. These findings position copper(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes as a promising candidate for next-generation scintillators with strong potential for real-world applications and offer valuable insights for halogen-free radioluminescent materials.",

In the symbiotic state, the host continuously fed on the endosymbionts without excreting nitrogenous waste into the medium, while the remaining endosymbionts continued to proliferate using heterotrophic metabolites from the host and light energy. Thus, the cyclical farming of endosymbionts by the host maintains a high concentration of nutrients within the closed system, providing a selective advantage in oligotrophic environments.",

          "abstract": "The development of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems has largely advanced RNA therapeutics, particularly mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. Conventional amine-LNPs, designed for hepatic RNA delivery, face challenges in targeting lymphoid organs effectively and maximize antigen presentation. In this study, we present the development of pH-responsive ionizable guanidine-LNPs (G-LNPs). Our cholesterol-free G-LNP system enables efficient delivery of mRNA to the spleen following intravenous administration. Notably, while both amine-LNPs and G-LNPs can deliver mRNA to the spleen, G-LNPs exhibit a unique ability to preferentially target antigen-presenting cells, leading to significantly enhanced antigen presentation and robust T cell activation. mRNA vaccines formulated with G-LNPs elicited strong and antigen-specific immune responses, providing complete protection against tumor progression. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of G-LNPs enabled selective mRNA expression in the pancreas, showcasing the versatility of this delivery platform. These findings underscore the potential of guanidine-LNPs as a highly promising platform for organ-targeted mRNA delivery and cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Chlorine radicals (Cl · ) profoundly affect atmospheric oxidation capacity. Chloramines, especially trichloramine, are emerging precursors of Cl · . However, their sources and roles in the atmosphere remain elusive. This study presents field evidence of primary emissions and explicit secondary production pathways of atmospheric trichloramine in Beijing, supplemented by observations from New Delhi and reanalysis of measurements in Toronto. We demonstrate that the sequential chlorination reactions initiated by molecular chlorine and ammonia in atmospheric aerosols are a major source of trichloramine. The trichloramine produced in aerosols is a source of gaseous trichloramine and serves as an intermediate during the conversion from molecular chlorine to Cl · , while direct trichloramine emissions constitute a previously overlooked source of Cl · . Overall, chloramine chemistry alters the Cl · production mechanism and represents a crucial missing pathway to Cl · worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Plants use two major defense strategies, resistance and tolerance, to counter herbivore attack; how these are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that damage by a specialist leafminer ( Phthorimaea operculella ) triggers tissue-specific responses in potato plants: compensatory growth in immature leaves, enabling tolerance, while resistance is induced in the mined leaf. The tissue-specific regulation of Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporter 11 (SWEET11) mediates both responses. In unattacked sink leaves, SWEET11 is up-regulated, enhancing sugar import, promoting compensatory growth and herbivore tolerance. In contrast, SWEET11 is rapidly down-regulated in mined source leaves, inhibiting sugar export and increasing cellular sugar levels. The resulting sugar accumulations suppress SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) and thereby enhance herbivore resistance. SWEET11-mediated sugar signaling enhances jasmonic acid (JA)–mediated resistance by degrading MCPI1a and MCPI1b (metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor 1), two JA-induced herbivory susceptibility factors. These findings reveal a dual role for sugar transport in regulating tissue-specific defense responses to herbivory.",

          "authors": "Eldad J Levy",
          "abstract": "In markets characterized by informality and weak institutional guarantees, cultural solutions play a crucial role in helping actors assess, manage, and foster trust. This ethnographic study examines how participants in Mexico City’s private security sector use symbolic signaling, stigma management, and relational work to evaluate and establish trust in high-risk exchanges. Based on 6 months of fieldwork and 42 interviews with stakeholders, the study introduces the concept of the trust triangle to explore trust as a networked negotiation between entrepreneurs, guards, and clients—rather than a simple dyadic relationship. The findings show that when markets lack formal assurances and institutional mechanisms for trust assessment fail, actors rely on embodied dispositions, heuristics, and stereotypes to navigate distrust, underscoring the role of habitus in both assessing and projecting trustworthiness. Despite widespread distrust, the study highlights how relational work reconfigures market relations by drawing on non-market ties. By centering on everyday cultural practices, the study demonstrates how trust is sustained in informal and precarious markets through culturally embedded forms of decision-making.",

          "abstract": "The growth of Defined Contribution (DC) pensions, in which retirement depends on individual savings and financial market investments, has been a key aspect of household financialization. This article examines the impact of the shift from Defined Benefit to DC pensions on workplace pension wealth inequality in Britain. We propose a conceptual framework to interpret the effect of this shift, highlighting four key channels through which DC pensions can aggravate pension wealth inequality: the greater inequality of pension contributions, lack of redistributive mechanisms within pension schemes, the compounding effects of (missed) contributions over time, and unequal capacity to take on risks. Using data from the UK Wealth and Assets Survey, along with quantile regression and decomposition analysis, we find corroborating evidence that reliance on DC pensions exacerbates workplace pension wealth inequality, supporting the plausibility of our proposed four channels.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the cost of job loss to household incomes, and the extent to which initial earnings losses are compensated through the labor market, within the household, and by the social security programs. Using survey and administrative data from Denmark, Finland, Germany, and the UK (1990–2018), we estimate short- and long-term effects of job loss with a dynamic difference-in-differences model. Job loss reduces household income by 17 per cent in the UK while only 5 to 6 percent in other countries during the first year. These losses gradually diminish and disappear over the long run. Across all countries, market (i.e. re-employment) is the main source of compensation, while the role of household and state compensations varies in line with the national compensation strategies. State compensation is crucial in mitigating immediate income losses, while market compensation becomes even more important over time. Household compensation mainly substitutes for weaker market and state protections.",
