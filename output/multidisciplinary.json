          "abstract": "The Tweety homologues (TTYHs) constitute a family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that, on the basis of structural features, were recently proposed to contribute to lipid transfer between soluble carriers and cellular membranes 1 . However, in the absence of supporting data, this function was hypothetical. Here through pull-down of endogenous proteins, we identify APOE as the interaction partner of human TTYH2. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry assays showed that both proteins colocalize in endosomal compartments. Characterization of the specific interaction between APOE and TTYH2 through binding assays and structural studies enabled us to identify an epitope in an extended domain of TTYH2 that faces the endosomal lumen. Structures of complexes with APOE-containing lipoprotein particles revealed a binding mode that places lipids in a suitable position to facilitate their diffusion into the membrane. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that lipid transfer is accelerated by TTYH2. Collectively, our findings indicate that TTYH2 has a role in the unloading of APOE-containing lipoproteins after they are endocytosed. These results define a new protein class that facilitates the extraction of lipids from and their insertion into cellular membranes. Although ubiquitous, this process could be of particular relevance in the brain, where APOE is involved in the transfer of lipids between astrocytes and neurons.",

          "abstract": "The brain represents sensory variables in the coordinated activity of neural populations, in which tuning curves of single neurons define the geometry of the population code 1,2 . Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations 3–8 . Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.",

          "abstract": "Lanthanides have shown magnetic memory at both the atomic 1,2 and molecular 3,4 level. The magnetic remanence temperatures of lanthanide single-molecule magnets can surpass d -transition metal examples 5,6 , and since 2017, energy barriers to magnetic reversal ( U eff ) from 1,237(28) cm –1 to 1,631(25) cm –1 and open magnetic hysteresis loops between 40 K and 80 K have typically been achieved with axial dysprosium(III) bis(cyclopentadienyl) complexes 7–17 . It has been predicted that linear dysprosium(III) compounds could deliver greater m J (the projection of the total angular momentum, J , on a quantization axis labelled z ) state splitting and therefore higher U eff and hysteresis temperatures 18–21 , but as lanthanide bonding is predominantly ionic 22,23 , so far dysprosium bis(amide) complexes have shown highly bent geometries that promote fast magnetic reversal 24,25 . Here we report a dysprosium bis(amide)–alkene complex, [Dy{N(Si i Pr 3 )[Si( i Pr) 2 C(CH 3 )=CHCH 3 ]}{N(Si i Pr 3 )(Si i Pr 2 Et)}][Al{OC(CF 3 ) 3 } 4 ] ( 1-Dy ), that shows U eff = 1,843(11) cm –1 and slow closing of soft magnetic hysteresis loops up to 100 K. Calculations show that the U eff value for 1-Dy arises from the charge-dense amide ligands, with a pendant alkene taking a structural role to enforce a large N–Dy–N angle while imposing only a weak equatorial interaction. This leads to molecular spin dynamics up to 100 times slower than the current best single-molecule magnets above 90 K.",

          "abstract": "Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies 1–7 . However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations 8–17 , generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10 −4 ), broadband (about 400–900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10 −3 ) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts 18,19 in the time domain.",

          "abstract": "A key virtue of spin qubits is their sub-micron footprint, enabling a single silicon chip to host the millions of qubits required to execute useful quantum algorithms with error correction 1–3 . However, with each physical qubit needing multiple control lines, a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware 4–6 . A promising solution is to co-locate the control system proximal to the qubit platform at milli-kelvin temperatures, wired up by miniaturized interconnects 7–10 . Even so, heat and crosstalk from closely integrated control have the potential to degrade qubit performance, particularly for two-qubit entangling gates based on exchange coupling that are sensitive to electrical noise 11,12 . Here we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up. Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates. Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a ‘chiplet-style’ control architecture.",

          "abstract": "Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics 1–4 . Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware 5–8 , but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modelled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities and may change their material properties with use 9–12 . Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot’s actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots’ materials, actuation or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.",

Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer’. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm.",

          "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders represent a major medical challenge, with few effective therapies available. These disorders often result from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide (NO)-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, which are essential for regulating gut motility. Loss or dysfunction of NO neurons is linked to severe conditions, including achalasia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic constipation 1,2 . Here we introduce a platform based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for therapeutic development targeting GI motility disorders. Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders. These studies provide a new framework for understanding and treating enteric neuropathies.",

          "abstract": "Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific concept 1 . In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter, such as deconfined quark–gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions 2 or expanding quantum degenerate gases 3,4 . Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges 5,6 , levitons 7 and anyon statistics 8 . Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity 9 as the number of interacting particles increases 10 remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analysing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit at which the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet scattering experiments illustrate how coordinated behaviour emerges through interactions of only a few elementary constituents. Studying similar signatures in other physical platforms such as cold-atom simulators 4,11 or collections of anyonic excitations 8,12 may help identify emergence of exotic phases and, more broadly, advance understanding of matter engineering.",

          "abstract": "Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. Although these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain unclear. Here we developed relational neural control and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses of areas across the visual cortex. Through relational neural control, we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large numbers of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied on the basis of cortical distance, categorical selectivity and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent participants. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have long been concerned about gender representation in scientific research but there has been little work on gender differences in participation and performance in climate science, a field that engages with both male-majority disciplines (e.g., geosciences, engineering) and female-majority disciplines (e.g., life sciences, medical science). This has implications for both gender equity and viewpoint representation. Sampling over 400,000 publications and a similar number of authors, we examine gender differences in several scholarly outcomes including publication count, career survival, coauthor gender, journal status, and mean citation count. We find men and women are similarly productive, successful, and connected, though women have shorter research careers and thus fewer papers. We also find gender homophily effects in collaboration, but no evidence of gender bias in peer review.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Y. Lee",
          "abstract": "In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization. These results suggest that efforts to bolster institutional trust should pay special attention to criticisms featuring integrity-based trust-undermining narratives.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.",

          "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a compelling explanation for stable cooperation in a large society: Those who cooperate appropriately earn a good standing, so that others are more likely to cooperate with them. However, this mechanism requires a population to agree on who has good standing and who has bad standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here, we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution for judging reputations: a tax collected from each member of the population. We analyze the possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how strong the incentives against corruption need to be. Our analysis has implications for establishing robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations—and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Cheung, Maximilian Maier, Falk Lieder",
          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more widely used, people increasingly rely on them to make or advise on moral decisions. Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is, therefore, important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated these questions by asking a range of LLMs to emulate or advise on people’s decisions in realistic moral dilemmas. In Study 1, we compared LLM responses to those of a representative U.S. sample ( N = 285) for 22 dilemmas, including both collective action problems that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost–benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In collective action problems, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: They usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 ( N = 474, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and documented an additional bias: Unlike humans, most LLMs were biased toward answering “no” in moral dilemmas, thus flipping their decision/advice depending on how the question is worded. In Study 3 ( N = 491, preregistered), we replicated these biases in LLMs using everyday moral dilemmas adapted from forum posts on Reddit. In Study 4, we investigated the sources of these biases by comparing models with and without fine-tuning, showing that they likely arise from fine-tuning models for chatbot applications. Our findings suggest that uncritical reliance on LLMs’ moral decisions and advice could amplify human biases and introduce potentially problematic biases.",

          "abstract": "AI is increasingly replacing human decision-makers across domains. AI-based tools have become particularly common in assessment decisions, such as when recruiting employees or admitting students. Calls for transparency and new legislation require organizations to disclose the use of AI assessment tools, thus making people under assessment aware of its use. We investigate whether this shift from human to AI assessment affects people’s behavior during the assessment. We propose that people emphasize their analytical characteristics and downplay their intuitive and emotional ones under AI (vs. human) assessment, a phenomenon we label “the AI assessment effect.” Twelve studies (eight in text and four in the Supporting Information; N = 13,342) document the AI assessment effect and its underlying mechanism: the lay belief that AI prioritizes analytical characteristics in its assessment. Whereas prior work has studied perceptions of AI assessment tools and their productivity gains, the current research demonstrates systematic behavioral changes because of AI assessment. The findings offer theoretical contributions to the psychology of AI and practical insights for organizations using AI assessment.",

          "abstract": "Determining how people behave in contexts governed by social norms can clarify both how norms influence human behavior and how norms evolve. We examined cooperative farming harvest division among the Derung, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking horticultural society in southwestern China. In the village of Dizhengdang, the norm dictates that cofarming harvests should be divided equally among participating households. This contrasts with an alternative norm followed in some other Derung villages that holds that harvests should be divided equally among participating laborers. Rational choice theory and evolutionary models of norm-based cooperation assume that individuals weigh the material and social payoffs of different actions and follow norms because doing so maximizes their payoff. However, the behavior of the Derung in Dizhengdang is not consistent with payoff maximization. Using interviews on co-farming behaviors and attitudes, along with an ultimatum game experiment framed as co-farming harvest division, we found that most respondents preferred divisions based on labor contribution. They also accurately guessed that others shared this preference and would approve of such divisions. Nonetheless, they still followed the prevailing norm of dividing by household. Their self-reported explanation for this behavior was that they desired to follow their traditional practices. Such a normative decision-making algorithm can allow individually consequential norms to persist without costly policing by other group members.",

          "abstract": "The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (~340 to 260 Ma) occurred under peak atmospheric O 2 (1.2 to 1.7 PIAL, pre-industrial atmospheric levels) for Earth history and CO 2 concentrations comparable to those of the preindustrial to that anticipated for our near future. The evolution of the marine redox landscape under these conditions remains largely unexplored, reflecting that oceanic anoxia has long been considered characteristic of carbon cycle perturbation during greenhouse times. Despite elevated O 2 , a 10 5 -y period of CO 2 -forced oceanic anoxia was recently identified, but whether this short-term interval of widespread oceanic anoxia was anomalous during this paleo-ice age is unexplored. Here, we investigate these issues by building a high-resolution record of carbonate uranium isotopes (δ 238 U carb ) from an open-marine succession in South China that permits us to reconstruct the global marine redox evolution through the deep glacial interval (310 to 290 Ma) of near peak O 2 . Our data reveal repeated, short-term decreases in δ 238 U carb coincident with negative C isotopic excursions and rises in paleo-CO 2 , all superimposed on a longer-term rise in δ 238 U carb . A carbon–phosphorus–uranium biogeochemical model coupled with Bayesian inversion is employed to quantitatively explore the interplay between marine anoxia, carbon cycling, and climate evolution during this paleo-glacial period. Although our results indicate that protracted, enhanced organic carbon burial can account for the long-term O 2 increase, seafloor oxygenation, and overall low CO 2 , episodic pulses of C emissions had the potential to drive recurring short-term periods of marine anoxia (with 4 to 12% of seafloor anoxia) despite up to 1.7 times higher atmospheric O 2 than present day.",

          "abstract": "The contact between two rough surfaces has been a topic of significant interest since early studies on Coulombic friction and remains crucial for numerous technological applications. However, theoretical progress has outpaced experiments due to the challenges in measuring contact areas across scales ranging from subnanometers to macroscopic dimensions. Here, we demonstrate the use of commonly available infrared-based (IR) spectroscopy in combination with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations to measure separation gaps and contact areas for glassy polymers ranging in roughness over two orders in magnitude. With the combined IR and FDTD simulations, we can overcome the optical diffraction limits and take advantage of the chemical specificity of IR spectroscopy to overcome limitations due to scattering. The scaling of the contact area ratio as a function of pressure illustrated the limitations of using pure elastic or plastic deformation in explaining the results. At both low and high pressures, the contact area ratios scale linearly with pressure as expected for purely elastic deformations at low pressures or plastic deformations at high pressures. However, if analyzed over a broad range of pressure, the power laws we observe are much larger than 1, exemplifying the need to consider elastoplastic models in explaining results for softer polymer contacts compared to other brittle, glassy materials. In comparison, the separation gaps scale exponentially with pressure, as expected. These results have important implications for the interpretation of properties such as friction, adhesion, and conductivity for softer, glassy contact interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of proteome homeostasis is crucial for the survival and adaptation to changing environments for all species. In eukaryotes, this process is finely tuned through regulation at the level of transcription, translation, protein modification, and protein degradation. The phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAA) is present in all eukaryotes and believed to be a key player in ubiquitin-dependent protein sorting and degradation via its interactions with ubiquitin and/or the AAA+ ATPase, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97). PLAA’s molecular targets and interaction network remain unclear. We used Caenorhabditis elegans and unbiased proteome-scale approaches to investigate neuronal specific interactors of the C. elegans PLAA ortholog UFD-3 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 3), its effect on ubiquitinated proteins, and global protein expression changes in an ufd-3 mutant. We found that PLAA may play a unique role in cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) processing bodies (P-bodies). Using biochemical analysis in vitro and fluorescence imaging in C. elegans , we show that UFD-3 directly interacts with the mRNA decapping complex regulatory subunit DCAP-1. UFD-3's intrinsic disordered region (IDR), which contains conserved amino acid motifs, is important for the recruitment of DCAP-1 to P-bodies. Finally, we show that loss of the IDR does not affect UFD-3's role in sorting ubiquitinated proteins through the multivesicular body pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that UFD-3's role in P-bodies is distinct from its role in the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway and the IDR is only critical for UFD-3-regulated P-bodies pathways. Thus, PLAA/UFD-3 might regulate the proteome via two distinct pathways: ubiquitinated protein turnover, as well as mRNA regulation through P-bodies.",

The amino acid was utilized to establish a degradable polymer backbone, along which many copies of riboflavin were incorporated to serve as the redox-active pendant groups that enabled energy storage. The overall synthesis involved the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of an l -glutamic acid-derived N- carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomer, followed by side chain activation with azides and, finally, click coupling to achieve installation of alkyne-functionalized riboflavin moieties. The steric bulkiness and rich chemical functionality of riboflavin resulted in synthetic complexities that required reaction optimization to achieve the desired polymer structure. Electrochemical characterization of the resultant riboflavin polypeptide, in organic electrolyte, showed quasireversible redox activity with a half-wave potential (E 1/2 ) of ca. −1.10 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc + ). Cell viability assays revealed biocompatibility, as indicated by negligible cytotoxicity for fibroblast cells. The polypeptide design, consisting of labile amide backbone linkages and side-chain ester functionalities that tethered the riboflavin units to the backbone, enabled hydrolytic degradation to recover building blocks for future upcycling or recycling. This bioinspired strategy advances the development of degradable redox-active polymers and promotes sustainable materials design for circular energy storage technologies.",

Studies of viral genome organization and replication mechanisms are fundamental to the understanding of virus pathogenicity. In this study, we identified an unique transcript from EIAV in vivo and in vitro by Sanger sequencing and Northern blotting. The transcript contains a complete open reading frame and has length 369 nt. We named the protein encoded by this transcript S4 and demonstrated its expression in EIAV-infected cells. An S4-deficient EIAV infectious clone displayed obviously impaired virion release and attenuated virus replication in vitro, demonstrating that S4 plays a role in the release step of EIAV. The host restriction factor tetherin has broad-spectrum antiviral activity and prevents the release of a wide range of enveloped viruses, including lentiviruses. Here, we demonstrated that S4 enhances the release of the EIAV-like particle by counteracting the equine tetherin (eqTHN). S4 interacts with the eqTHN and sequesters it within intracellular membrane compartments, attenuating eqTHN expression on the cell surface and thereby disrupting its antiviral activity. Further investigation revealed that S4 retains eqTHN in the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi network through impacting its anterograde transport to the cell surface and may interfere with the posttranslational modification of this membrane protein. Collectively, our findings uncover an accessory protein, S4, of EIAV and reveal its ability to promote virion release by antagonizing the antiviral activity of the host restriction factor tetherin.",

          "abstract": "Hydrocephalus, a neurological condition characterized by an excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, affects millions worldwide and leads to severe consequences. Current treatments, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunts, divert excess CSF from the brain but often face complications, mainly due to shunt obstructions caused by biological matter accumulation. While previous shunt designs aimed to improve fluid flow and reduce occlusion, they often lacked the precision needed for real-world applications due to simplified simulation models that did not fully capture the dynamics of the cerebral ventricular system. Here, we introduce BrainFlow, a computational model that integrates detailed anatomical and physiological features to simulate CSF dynamics in the presence of shunt implants. BrainFlow incorporates patient-specific medical imaging data, pulsatile flow to mimic cardiac cycles, adjustable parameters for various hydrocephalus conditions, and a biomolecule tracking feature to evaluate the long-term risk of shunt occlusion due to flow-mediated biomolecular transport. This model provides a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to shunt obstruction, offering insights into optimal shunt placement, design, and materials choice. Through validation against four-dimensional MRI flow data, BrainFlow demonstrates robust accuracy across multiple flow metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for the development of next-generation shunts tailored to individual patient anatomy and pathology, ultimately aiming to improve hydrocephalus treatment through informed, patient-specific design strategies.",

To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated testicular cell maturation at weeks 5 (W5), W6, W8, W15, and W19 postconception using a rhesus macaque model. Our data identify a major transcriptional change in the somatic cells of the testis (Sertoli cells, interstitial cells and fetal Leydig cells) between W8 and W15, and this is associated with the maturation of seminiferous cords and maturation of PGCs into fetal spermatogonia. Through this work, we identified cellular changes and differential protein expression between W5 and W19 that can be used to holistically define testis development across the time course of embryonic and fetal life.

We also show that imaging tumor lipid metabolism using [1- 11 C]acetate PET/CT and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy differentiates cribriform from noncribriform intermediate-risk prostate cancers in two prospective patient cohorts.

          "abstract": "The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) harbors extraordinarily high levels of biodiversity and endemism. The region is warming at a rate twice the global average, yet the evolutionary dynamics of its unique biota are poorly understood. Here, we used the endemic land plant genera of the QTP to investigate how its floristic endemism was shaped over time by Cenozoic geoclimatic changes. We first clarified that the QTP hosts 82 endemic land plant genera; we found that the origins of these endemic genera were most likely driven by ecological niche and elevation differentiation, caused by the uplift of the QTP and associated climate change. By sampling 37 land plant clades that together encompass 1,740 species, covering all 82 endemic genera, we show that QTP floristic endemism had emerged by the Early Eocene. Furthermore, the unique biodiversity of the QTP comprises a mix of indigenous elements and immigrants. Among the three subregions of the QTP (Plateau Platform, Himalaya, and the Hengduan Mountains), the processes associated with floristic endemism are asynchronous, reflecting different geoclimatic events with the Miocene as a particularly critical period. The relative contributions of in situ speciation and immigration to the unique biodiversity of the three subregions are also markedly different; in situ speciation dominated in the Hengduan Mountains, which hosts the oldest endemic components of the flora and has served as an important “pump” and “sink” of unique biodiversity. These findings provide insights into how past geoclimatic events may have shaped floristic endemism on the QTP and also have important conservation implications.",

          "abstract": "Freshwater resources are fundamental to supporting humanity, and measures of water scarcity have been critical for identifying where water requirements and water availability are imbalanced. Existing water scarcity metrics typically account for blue water withdrawals (i.e., from surface-/groundwater), while the contribution of green water (i.e., soil moisture) and water quality—dimensions with important implications for multiple societal sectors—to water scarcity remains unclear. Here, we introduce the concept of multidimensional water scarcity that explicitly assesses all three of these dimensions of water scarcity and evaluates their individual and combined effects. We find that 22 to 26% of the global land area and 58 to 64% of the global population are exposed to some form of water scarcity annually, with multidimensional (i.e., blue, green, and quality) water scarcity particularly high in India, China, and Pakistan. Examining seasonal water scarcity, we estimate that 5.9 billion people (or 80% of the world’s population in 2015) were exposed to at least one dimension of water scarcity for at least 1 mo per year and that 1-in-10 people (10%) were exposed to multidimensional water scarcity at least 1 mo per year. Our findings demonstrate that the challenges of water scarcity are far more widespread than previously understood. As such, our assessment provides a more holistic view of global water scarcity issues and points to overlooked scarcity where action needs to bring human pressure on freshwater resources into balance with water quantity and quality.",

In this study, we observed a continuous LLPT with an inversion of electronegativity in a K–Rb binary alloy. This uniquely exhibits a three-state system behavior. The transition, induced by pressure-driven reordering of electronic orbital energies, progresses through a sequence from s -metal to electride to d -metal, accompanied by a valence reversal: Potassium transitions from a negative to a positive valence, while rubidium undergoes the opposite shift. This process is marked by two successive anomalies in the alloy’s optical, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties over a broad pressure range. The observation of similar LLPT phenomena in other alkali and alkaline earth metal liquids suggests that this three-state system mechanism may provide broader insights into the nature of continuous phase transitions.",

This field is sufficiently strong to ionize water and produce the H 4 O 2 + cation, a hydroxyl radical adduct with a hydronium ion.

          "abstract": "Darwinian evolution results from an interplay between stochastic diversification of heritable phenotypes, impacting the chance of survival and reproduction, and fitness-based selection. The ability of populations to evolve and adapt to environmental changes depends on rates of mutational diversification and the distribution of fitness effects of random mutations. In turn, the distribution of fitness effects of stochastic mutations can be expected to depend on the adaptive state of a population. To systematically study the impact of the interplay between the adaptive state of a population on the ability of asexual populations to adapt, we used a spatial agent-based model of a neoplastic population adapting to a selection pressure of continuous exposure to targeted therapy. We found favorable mutations were overrepresented at the extinction bottleneck but depleted at the adaptive peak. The model-based predictions were tested using an experimental cancer model of an evolution of resistance to a targeted therapy. Consistent with the model’s prediction, we found that enhancement of the mutation rate was highly beneficial under therapy but moderately detrimental under the baseline conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering population fitness in evaluating the fitness distribution of random mutations and support the potential therapeutic utility of restricting mutational variability.",

          "abstract": "PIK3CA -related disorders are rare genetic disorders due to somatic gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CA during embryonic development, a pathway involved in cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Accumulating evidence from patients with PIK3CA -related disorders indicates that peripheral nerves are frequently affected, leading to severe neurological symptoms. However, the exact underlying mechanism of these disorders remains unclear. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a PIK3CA gain-of-function mutation specifically in Schwann cells, which successfully mirrored the clinical features observed in patients. In this model, we observed that PIK3CA -mutated cells communicate with neighboring healthy cells, such as adipocytes and hair follicles, through a unique crosstalk mechanism that triggers their growth, proliferation, and anagen phase expansion. Additionally, we demonstrated that PIK3CA mutation in peripheral nerves leads to a metabolic shift through glycolytic activation. We investigated the effects of alpelisib, an approved pharmacological inhibitor of PIK3CA, in the model. Early administration of alpelisib significantly improved the signs and symptoms in the mice. However, when treatment was delayed, its efficacy was diminished due to the drug’s inability to penetrate the myelin sheath effectively. In summary, our study offers a valuable mouse model for studying PIK3CA -related neuropathy, uncovers a unique communication between healthy and affected tissues, and highlights the potential benefits of early pharmacological intervention using alpelisib.",

Recently, to overcome the challenge that genetic information of nonparticipants is unavailable, it is shown that by comparing the IBD (identity by descent) shared and not-shared segments between participating relative pairs, one can estimate the genetic component underlying participation. That, however, does not directly address how to adjust estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for phenotypes correlated with participation. Here, we demonstrate a way to do so by adopting a statistical framework that separates the genetic and nongenetic correlations between participation and these phenotypes. Crucially, our method avoids making the assumption that the effect of the genetic component underlying participation is manifested entirely through these other phenotypes. Applying the method to 12 UK Biobank phenotypes, we found eight that have significant genetic correlations with participation, including body mass index, educational attainment, and smoking status. For most of these phenotypes, without adjustments, estimates of heritability and the absolute value of genetic correlation would have underestimation biases.",

Here, we extend and improve existing approaches and develop three novel landscape phylogeographic methods that can test the impact of continuous environmental factors on the diffusion velocity of viral lineages. In order to evaluate the different methods, we also implemented two simulation frameworks to test and compare their statistical performance. The results enable us to formulate clear guidelines for the use of three complementary landscape phylogeographic approaches that have sufficient statistical power and low rates of false positives.

To probe the interfacial hydrogen-bond network, atmospheric water capture is a powerful tool.

Our findings show that flies with depleted gut microbiota, either through axenic culture or antibiotic treatment, exhibited significant memory impairments. However, reintroducing the commensal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum alone was sufficient to restore memory, while coinoculation with Acetobacter pomorum further enhanced memory performance. Hemolymph metabolomic analyses revealed reduced amino acid levels in antibiotic-treated flies, which were linked to impaired Drosophila target of rapamycin (dTOR) signaling. Additionally, genetic manipulation of dTOR or dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids either mimicked or rescued the memory deficits caused by antibiotic treatments. These results suggest that the gut microbiome is essential for regulating memory function by maintaining amino acid homeostasis and proper dTOR signaling, with profound implications for advancing knowledge of cognitive regulation.",

In this work, we study the diffusion-limited settling of highly porous particles in a density-stratified fluid through a combination of experiment, analysis, and numerical simulation. By delineating and appealing to the diffusion-limited regime wherein buoyancy effects due to mass adaptation dominate hydrodynamic drag, we derive a simple expression for the steady settling velocity of a sphere as a function of the density, size, and diffusivity of the solid, as well as the density gradient of the background fluid. In this regime, smaller particles settle faster, in contrast with most conventional hydrodynamic drag mechanisms. Furthermore, we outline a general mathematical framework for computing the steady settling speed of a body of arbitrary shape in this regime and compute exact results for the case of general ellipsoids. Using hydrogels as a highly porous model system, we validate the predictions with laboratory experiments in linear stratification for a wide range of parameters. Last, we show how the predictions can be applied to arbitrary slowly varying background density profiles and demonstrate how a measured particle position over time can be used to reconstruct the background density profile.",

However, the poor oral bioavailability of BCA hinders its clinical application. Here, we employed a sophisticated computational approach to refine the structural design of 3βHSD1 inhibitors. AlphaFold2 was utilized to construct detailed models of 3βHSD1 binding to various substrates. These models, in conjunction with the elucidated enzymatic mechanism of 3βHSD1, guided the optimization of a series of BCA-related compounds. Our structure–activity relationship studies identified HEAL-116 as a potent 3βHSD1 inhibitor. HEAL-116 exhibited enhanced binding specificity to the substrate-binding pocket of 3βHSD1 and effectively neutralized the local charge environment. The incorporation of hydrophilic groups in its structure also markedly enhanced its oral bioavailability. HEAL-116 robustly inhibited 3βHSD1 activity and exerted pronounced antitumor effect in biochemical, cellular, and mouse models. Our findings lay the foundation for the clinical translation of 3βHSD1 inhibitors, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of prostate cancer and potentially other diseases.",

We also demonstrate that extracellular vesicles (TvEVs) produced by the parasite downregulate host cell IFNε, counteracting this symbiont-driven response and elevating infection. We further demonstrate that IFNε, a hormonally regulated cytokine produced in the human reproductive system, is protective against T. vaginalis cytoadherence and cytolysis of host cells.

          "abstract": "Drimenol synthase from Aquimarina spongiae (AsDMS) is a highly unusual chimera that integrates two distinct, sequential isoprenoid processing activities within a single polypeptide chain. AsDMS catalyzes the class II cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form drimenyl diphosphate, which then undergoes enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis to yield drimenol, a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol with antifungal and anticancer properties. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of AsDMS and its complex with a sesquiterpene thiol. The AsDMS structure exhibits a didomain architecture consisting of a terpene cyclase β domain and a haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatase domain, with two distinct active sites located on opposite sides of the protein. Mechanistic studies show that dephosphorylation of the drimenyl diphosphate intermediate proceeds through stepwise hydrolysis such that two equivalents of inorganic phosphate rather than inorganic pyrophosphate are coproducts of the reaction sequence. When the AsDMS reaction is performed in H 2 18 O, 18 O is not incorporated into drimenol, indicating that the hydroxyl oxygen of drimenol originates from the prenyl oxygen of FPP rather than a water molecule from bulk solution. These results correct a mechanistic proposal previously advanced by another group. Surprisingly, AsDMS exhibits substrate promiscuity, catalyzing the conversion of the slowly reactive substrate mimic farnesyl- S -thiolodiphosphate into cyclic and linear sesquiterpene products. Structural and mechanistic insights gained from AsDMS illustrate the functional diversity of terpene biosynthetic enzymes and provide a foundation for engineering “designer cyclase” assemblies capable of generating a wide variety of terpenoid products.",

The structural features that distinguish Cyclin F as a ligase adaptor and the mechanisms underlying its selective substrate recruitment over Cyclin A, which functions in complex with CDK2 at a similar time in the cell cycle, remain largely unexplored. We utilized single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to elucidate the structure of a Cyclin F–Skp1 complex bound to an E2F1 peptide. The structure and biochemical analysis reveal important differences in the substrate-binding site of Cyclin F compared to Cyclin A. Our findings expand on the canonical cyclin-binding motif (Cy or RxL) and highlight the importance of electrostatics at the E2F1 binding interface, which varies between Cyclin F and Cyclin A. These results advance our understanding of E2F1 regulation and may inform strategies for selectively targeting Cyclin F in cancer or neurodegeneration.",

In 2020, newly hatched Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) fry in California’s Central Valley (CCV) hatcheries swam in corkscrew patterns and died at unusually high rates due to a lack of this essential vitamin. We subsequently investigated the impacts and causes of thiamine deficiency in California’s anadromous salmonids. Our laboratory studies defined the relationship between thiamine concentrations in Chinook salmon eggs and early life-stage survival in offspring; we used these data to develop a model that estimated 26 to 48% thiamine-dependent fry mortality across consecutive years (2020–2021) for winter-run Chinook salmon. We established an egg surveillance effort that found widespread thiamine deficiency in CCV Chinook salmon in 2020 and 2021, and emerging thiamine deficiency in Klamath River and Trinity River coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) in 2021. We determined that thiamine injections into adults raised egg thiamine concentrations above levels found to impact early life-stage survival and swimming behavior. Ocean surveys, prey nutrition, salmon gut contents, and stable isotope data link thiamine deficiency to an ocean diet dominated by a booming population of northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ). This forage fish had low thiamine, high lipid, and high thiaminase activity levels consistent with both a thiaminase and oxidative stress hypothesis for causing thiamine deficiency in California salmon. Our research suggests California’s already stressed anadromous salmonids will continue to be impacted by thiamine deficiency as long as their ocean forage base and diet are dominated by northern anchovy.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic homeostasis is essential for survival; however, many studies have focused on the fluctuations of these factors. Furthermore, while metabolic homeostasis depends on the balance between the production and consumption of metabolites, there have been limited investigations into the mechanisms regulating their consumption. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism has diverse functions, including methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and transsulfuration, making its regulation and control crucial. Recent studies have revealed the feedback regulation of SAM production; however, the mechanisms governing its consumption are still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the stability of SAM levels in the fat body (FB) of Drosophila , which serves as a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver and adipose tissue, under conditions of SAM shortage, including nutrient deprivation. We found that glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt), a major SAM-consuming methyltransferase in the FB, decreased via the nuclear ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), along with the inhibition of SAM synthesis and starvation. The inhibition of Gnmt level reduction by suppression of the nuclear UPS causes starvation tolerance. Thus, the regulation of Gnmt levels through nuclear UPS-mediated reduction helps maintain SAM levels under SAM shortage conditions.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by diderm bacteria have important roles in cell envelope homeostasis, secretion, interbacterial communication, and pathogenesis. The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (STm) activates OMV biogenesis inside the acidic vacuoles of host cells by upregulating the expression of the OM protein PagC, one of the most robustly activated genes in a host environment. Here, we used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy (EM), with native bacterial OMVs, to demonstrate that three histidines, essential for the OMV biogenic function of PagC, constitute a key pH-sensing motif. The NMR spectra of PagC in OMVs show that they become protonated around pH 6, and His protonation is associated with specific perturbations of select regions of PagC. The use of bacterial OMVs is a key aspect of this work enabling NMR structural studies in the context of the physiological environment. PagC expression upregulates OMV production in Escherichia coli , replicating its function in STm. Moreover, the presence of PagC drives a striking aggregation of OMVs and increases bacterial cell pellicle formation at acidic pH, pointing to a potential role as an adhesin active in biofilm formation. The data provide experimental evidence for a pH-dependent mechanism of OMV biogenesis and aggregation driven by an OM protein.",

Here, we present a global kinetic model to describe lipid-induced amyloid aggregation of α -synuclein. Using this framework, we find that α -synuclein fibrils form via a two-step primary nucleation mechanism and that lipid molecules are directly involved in both the nucleation and fibril elongation steps, giving rise to lipid–protein coaggregates. To illustrate the applicability of this kinetic approach to drug discovery, we identify the mechanism of action of squalamine, a known inhibitor of lipid-induced α -synuclein aggregation, revealing that this small molecule reduces the rate of lipid-dependent primary nucleation.

          "abstract": "Insects frequently form associations with maternally transmitted symbiotic bacteria. This transmission mode ensures that symbiont-conferred effects, both beneficial and negative, are passed onto offspring. Here, we report an extreme example of symbiont-mediated temperature sensitivity imposed by a vertically transmitted, defensive symbiont. Pea aphids infected with the bacterial endosymbiont, Fukatsuia symbiotica, resist infection by fungal pathogens but produce few or no offspring when moved from cool (15 °C) to mildly warmer temperatures (20 °C). This temperature-dependent reduction in host fitness is associated with increased symbiont abundance, disordered symbiont localization, and high expression of a horizontally acquired nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) locus. This NRPS operon is syntenic with the locus responsible for the production of Herbicolin A, a known antifungal produced by some plant-associated Erwiniaceae . Activity of chemical extracts from infected aphids is predictive of in vivo protection against entomopathogenic fungi, indicating that an Herbicolin A–like molecule is the likely source of Fukatsuia’s protective effects against fungal pathogens. Injection of the same chemical extracts into naive aphids partially recapitulates developmental defects observed in natural infections at 20 °C, suggesting that increased levels of this compound contribute to disrupted embryonic development. Finally, the purification of the causal agent revealed Fukatsuia produces a compound similar but not identical to Herbicolin A, that exhibits both antifungal and hemolytic activity. These results suggest that F. symbiotica infection imposes a trade-off between antifungal defense and disrupted embryonic development, mediated by a single genetic locus.",

          "abstract": "There is overwhelming evidence that forest trees are locally adapted to climate. Thus, genecological models based on population phenotypes have been used to measure local adaptation, infer genetic maladaptation to climate, and guide assisted migration. However, instead of phenotypes, there is increasing interest in using genomic data for gene resource management. We used whole-genome resequencing and common-garden experiments to understand the genetic architecture of adaptive traits in black cottonwood. We studied the potential of using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction to detect causal loci, identify climate-adapted phenotypes, and inform gene resource management. We analyzed population structure by partitioning phenotypic and genomic (single-nucleotide polymorphism) variation among 840 genotypes collected from 91 stands along 16 rivers. Most phenotypic variation (60 to 81%) occurred among populations and was strongly associated with climate. Population phenotypes were predicted well using genomic data (e.g., predictive ability r &gt; 0.9) but almost as well using climate or geography ( r &gt; 0.8). In contrast, genomic prediction within populations was poor ( r &lt; 0.2). We identified many GWAS associations among populations, but most appeared to be spurious based on pooled within-population analyses. Hierarchical partitioning of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype sharing suggested that within-population genomic prediction and GWAS were poor because allele frequencies of causal loci and linked markers differed among populations. Given the urgent need to conserve natural populations and ecosystems, our results suggest that climate variables alone can be used to predict population phenotypes, delineate seed zones and deployment zones, and guide assisted migration.",

          "abstract": "Despite over a century of studies, fundamental questions remain about the processes governing crystal nucleation from melts or solutions. Research over the past three decades has presented mounting evidence for kinetic pathways of crystal nucleation that are more complex than envisioned by the simplest forms of classical theory. Such observations have been presented for colloidal and elemental systems with covalent and metallic bonding. Despite the technological and geochemical importance of molten salts, similar studies for these ionically bonded systems are currently lacking. Here we develop a machine learning interatomic potential for a model ionic system: LiF. The potential features quantum-level accuracy for both liquid and multiple solid polymorphs over wide temperature and pressure ranges and accurately reproduces experimentally measured properties. Thanks to the efficiency of the potential, which enables microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, induction times for nucleation of LiF solids from their melts are computed over a range of undercoolings. With the aid of a set of robust local order parameters established here, the simulations reveal that homogeneous crystal nucleation in undercooled melts preferentially initiates from liquid regions showing slow dynamics and high bond orientational order simultaneously, and the second-shell order of both precritical nuclei and the surface of postcritical nuclei is dominated by hexagonal close packing and body-centered cubic local structure, even though the nucleus core is dominated by face-centered cubic structure corresponding to the stable rocksalt crystal structure. Finally, we establish a connection between the crystallization pathway and the equilibrium crystal–melt interface structure.",

While being more susceptible to extinction and as such potentially targeted for conservation interventions such as genetic rescue, small-island populations can experience relatively less anthropogenic habitat degradation than those on larger islands. Here, we determine the consequences and conservation implications of long-term isolation and recent human activities on genetic diversity of island populations of two forest-dependent mammals endemic to the Wallacea archipelago: the anoa ( Bubalus spp.) and babirusa ( Babyrousa spp.). Using genomic analyses and habitat suitability models, we show that, compared to closely related species, populations on mainland Sulawesi exhibit low heterozygosity, high inbreeding, a high proportion of deleterious alleles, and experience a high rate of anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, populations on smaller islands occupy higher-quality habitats, possess fewer deleterious mutations despite exhibiting lower heterozygosity and higher inbreeding. Site frequency spectra indicate that these patterns reflect stronger, long-term purging in smaller-island populations. Our results thus suggest that conservation efforts should focus on protecting small-island high-quality habitats and avoiding translocations from mainland populations. This study highlights the crucial role of small offshore islands for the long-term survival of Wallacea’s iconic and indigenous mammals in the face of development on the mainland.",

          "abstract": "Antagonistic interactions are critical determinants of microbial community stability and composition, offering host benefits such as pathogen protection and providing avenues for antimicrobial control. While the ability to eliminate competitors confers an advantage to antagonistic microbes, it often incurs a fitness cost. Consequently, many microbes only produce toxins or engage in antagonistic behavior in response to specific cues like quorum sensing molecules or environmental stress. In laboratory settings, antagonistic microbes typically dominate over sensitive ones, raising the question of why both antagonistic and nonantagonistic microbes are found in natural environments and host microbiomes. Here, using both theoretical models and experiments with killer strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we show that “boom-and-bust” dynamics—periods of rapid growth punctuated by episodic mortality events—caused by temporal environmental fluctuations can favor nonantagonistic microbes that do not incur the growth rate cost of toxin production. Additionally, using control theory, we derive bounds on the competitive performance and identify optimal regulatory toxin-production strategies in various boom-and-bust environments where population dilutions occur either deterministically or stochastically over time. Our mathematical investigation reveals that optimal toxin regulation is much more beneficial to killers in stochastic, rather than deterministic, boom-and-bust environments. Overall, our findings show how both antagonistic and nonantagonistic microbes can thrive under varying environmental conditions.",

          "abstract": "Salt marshes provide valuable ecosystem services but are vulnerable to drowning with accelerated sea-level rise (SLR). Marsh belowground biomass (BGB) production helps avoid drowning by building marsh surface elevation. Reductions in BGB can serve as an early warning sign of marsh deterioration, as they often precede decreases in aboveground biomass (AGB). However, landscape-scale BGB assessments to predict broad trends in marsh deterioration have not been previously available. We applied the Belowground Ecosystem Resiliency Model (BERM) to assess standing stocks and trends in both BGB and AGB over the past decade (2014–2023) across US Georgia coast Spartina alterniflora marshes (691 km 2 ). Over this time period, BGB and AGB averaged 841 ± 323 and 221 ± 14 g m −2 , respectively, but showed opposite trends. BGB decreased on average by 0.94% per year and over most of the marsh area (72%), while AGB increased on average by 0.66% per year and showed a net increase across most of the marsh area (88%). This disconnect suggests that AGB is not a good indicator of marsh resilience, and we highlight two areas with similar AGB but different BGB. Inundation intensity, an important predictor of BGB, rose through time and was negatively related to BGB. SLR trends suggest continuing increases in inundation, which will result in further declines in BGB followed by widespread marsh drowning. Landscape BGB assessments are a valuable tool to identify ecosystem vulnerability and proactively manage salt marshes and the services they provide under rising sea levels.",

Myeloid-specific deletion of Setdb1 prolonged heart allograft survival but reversed immune exclusion in tumor tissues. Interestingly, myeloid-specific Setdb1-knockout led to lower fibrosis in heart allografts and tumor tissues in mice. Our single-cell sequencing data showed that Setdb1 ablation impaired Fn1 + and SPP1 + profibrogenic macrophage reprogramming. Mechanistically, Fn1, which was induced by the CCR2-Creb/Setdb1 axis, upregulated the expression of genes related to fibrosis in fibroblasts and macrophages via ITGA5 and PIRA receptors.

We show that this wild rice allopolyploid originated around 0.7 Mya, and during subsequent diploidization, its two subgenomes have retained highly conserved synteny with the genomes of its extant diploid progenitors. This populational approach allowed us to distinguish parental legacy of inherited variation from postpolyploidy evolution, and our analyses revealed that whereas gene fractionation occurred in an early burst, accumulation of transposable elements (TEs) and homoeologous exchanges has been gradual. Patterns of homoeolog expression bias are highly variable across tissues, with no consistent subgenome expression bias. Our assessments of the impact of DNA methylation, TE distribution, and parental legacy on expression patterns provide some support for the TE load theory (the theory that the TE densities in flanking regions surrounding genes strongly influence expression levels), while also illustrating the complexity of transcription regulation.",

This record suggests a rapid increase in fire activity since approximately 50,000 y ago, indicating a decoupling from the monsoon climate, and this pattern is consistent with fire histories in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Papua New Guinea-Australia regions. By integrating extensive archaeological data, we propose that the intensified global expansion of modern human and population growth, coupled with the rising demand for fire use during cold glacial periods, resulted in a significant increase in fire utilization from 50,000 y onward.

Here, we report adult mammalian offspring derived from the genetic material of two sperm cells. These mice, which we refer to as androgenetic mice, were produced via targeted DNA methylation editing of seven imprinting control regions (ICRs) through CRISPR-based epigenome engineering. Two sperm cells were injected into an enucleated oocyte to form putatively diploid embryos. Allele-specific epigenetic editing was achieved by injecting guide RNAs with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences designed to match one allele but not the other. The birth of androgenetic mice that were able to develop to adulthood demonstrates that mammalian androgenesis is achievable by targeted epigenetic remodeling of a few defined ICRs.",

          "abstract": "Chloroplast division, a process tightly linked to the energy demands of plants, is initiated by the formation of the stromal filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring. The Z ring is highly dynamic, and its constriction provides the essential force for chloroplast division. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing Z-ring dynamics and constriction remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the chloroplast inner envelope membrane (IEM) protein ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLASTS6 (ARC6) interacts with the chloroplast stromal protein ARC3, and this interaction is negatively regulated by the conserved J-like domain of ARC6. ARC3 is found both distributed throughout the stroma and localized to a ring-like structure at the chloroplast division site. We demonstrate that ARC6 recruits ARC3 to the division site to form a ring-like structure, likely through direct interaction. This ARC6–ARC3 interaction enables ARC3 to bind FtsZs. Furthermore, we show that the ARC6–ARC3 complex significantly promotes the dynamics of chloroplast Z rings reconstituted in a heterologous system. Finally, the constriction of these reconstituted Z rings is markedly enhanced by ARC6–ARC3. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism that governs Z-ring dynamics and constriction, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying chloroplast division.",

Although HBZ protein is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the dynamics of HBZ protein localization and its contribution to oncogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular expression pattern of HBZ in primary HTLV-1–infected T cells from asymptomatic carriers and leukemic cells of ATL patients using the Proximity Ligation Assay. Nuclear localization of HBZ protein was significantly higher in fresh ATL cells than in HTLV-1–infected cells from carriers. Importantly, translocation of HBZ protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after TGF-β activation was observed in ATL patients, but not in HTLV-1 carriers. In ATL cells, the cellular transcription factors JunB and pSmad3 interact with HBZ and facilitate its nuclear translocation upon TGF-β stimulation. JUNB knockdown inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and promotes apoptosis in ATL cells but not in HTLV-1–infected nonleukemic cells, indicating that JunB has important roles in maintaining ATL cells. In conclusion, TGF-β-induced nuclear translocation of HBZ–JunB complexes is associated with ATL oncogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Tree species worldwide face increasing exposure to unprecedented macroclimatic conditions due to anthropogenic climate change, which may trigger biome shifts and ecosystem disruptions. We quantified climate change exposure–shifts to species’ currently unoccupied climate zones–for 32,089 tree species globally by 2100, assessing both species-level and local tree diversity risks. On average, 69% of species are predicted to experience macroclimatic shifts in at least 10% of their range, while 14% face exposure in over 50% of their range under a high-emission (4 °C warming) future scenario. This suggests that most species retain substantial climate refugia within their current range. However, local tree diversity exposure is predicted to be severe in vast regions, including Eurasia, the northwestern United States and Canada, northern Chile, and the Amazon Delta. Under a moderate (2 °C warming) scenario, high tree diversity exposure is mostly restricted to taiga regions in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings provide conservative estimates of climate-driven biodiversity risk, as our approach focuses solely on macroclimate and does not account for additional stressors such as land-use change or species interactions. Identifying tree species and areas of high macroclimatic shift exposure allows for targeted conservation strategies, including species stability monitoring, assisted migration, and the protection of climate refugia. Our results offer a foundation for prioritizing conservation actions in a rapidly changing climate, ensuring long-term ecosystem resilience.",

          "abstract": "Currently, catalytic recycling of polyethylene (PE) into high-value chemicals using solar energy often faces poor product selectivity and low efficiency. This is mainly due to the difficulty in effectively controlling the intermediates during PE photoreforming and the long-standing challenge of inefficient charge dynamics. Here, we present a solar-driven photothermal catalytic approach for the selective conversion of PE waste into propionic acid and hydrogen under ambient conditions. Atomically dispersed Ni sites supported on CeO 2 (Ni SA /CeO 2 ) achieve a propionic acid yield of 331 μmol h –1 with 94.8% selectivity in the photothermal reaction. This performance is 1.6 times higher than that of catalysts supported by Ni clusters (Ni NP /CeO 2 ). Additionally, Ni SA /CeO 2 exhibits a hydrogen yield of 0.23 mmol h –1 with stable long-term performance. Mechanistic studies reveal that single Ni atoms form linear coordination with oxygen atoms in CeO 2 , introducing unoccupied mid-gap states that effectively capture hot electrons and enhance the photothermal effect through local hotspot formation. In contrast, Ni clusters suffer from inefficient heat accumulation due to multistep phonon scattering. Furthermore, site isolation of Ni single atoms spatially separates the reaction intermediates and suppresses dimerization of the key intermediate COOHCH 2 CH 2 *, thereby greatly improving the selectivity for propionic acid. In contrast, closely packed Ni cluster sites promote intermediate coupling and the formation of undesirable byproducts, reducing selectivity. This work provides mechanistic insights into the advantages of atomic-scale catalyst design for selective chemical transformations.",

We identify millions of pairs of relatives within our sample (82 different kinds, in total), including not only conventional biological relatives such as siblings and cousins, but also relatives-in-law, relatives through adoption, twins, and relatives connected through twins. When fitting models which assume that family resemblance arises solely from additive genetic effects and assortative mating, we find that they describe much of our data well, but that they systematically underestimate the similarity of close relatives (particularly monozygotic twins), maternal relatives, relatives-in-law, and relatives through adoption.

          "abstract": "A hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the delayed interferon response. Interferons are typically produced upon host recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns, such as nucleic acids. While the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades host recognition of its RNA are well studied, how it evades immune responses to cytosolic DNA—leaked from mitochondria or nuclei during infection—remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein directly suppresses DNA sensing by cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). Although primarily known for packaging the viral RNA genome, we uncover that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein also binds DNA with high affinity and competitively blocks cGAS activation. Using cell-free biochemical and biophysical approaches, including single-molecule optical tweezers, we show that the nucleocapsid protein binds to DNA at nanomolar concentrations and cocondenses with DNA at micromolar concentrations, thereby impeding stable cGAS-DNA interactions required for signal propagation. Hyperphosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein diminishes its competitive binding capacity. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in directly suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway, strongly suggesting that this contributes to the delayed interferon response during infection. This study raises the possibility that nucleocapsid proteins of other RNA viruses may also exhibit moonlighting functions by antagonizing host nucleic acid–sensing pathways.",

          "abstract": "Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) plays an important role in both the mouse and human prostate. The endogenous ligand for ERβ is the dihydrotestosterone metabolite, 5β-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3β-Adiol). Thus, treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) should produce a phenotype similar to that seen in ERβ −/− mice. By comparing RNA-Seq of the ventral prostates (VP) of ERβ knockout mice (ERβ crispr−/− ) and wild-type (WT) mice, we confirmed that ERβ modulates androgen receptor (AR) signaling indirectly by suppressing AR coactivators. Compared to WT mice, basal cell genes from ERβ crispr−/− mouse VP were significantly upregulated. A population of abnormal basal cells coexpressing P63 and AR was identified in the ERβ crispr−/− mouse VP by immunohistochemistry. In men treated with 5-ARI for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), there was induction of a P63-positive intermediate cell population characterized by down regulation of Krt14 without significant change in the expression of Krt15, upregulation of AR and NKX3.1, and increased proliferation. In both VP of aging ERβ crispr−/− mice and in human prostates after 5-ARI treatment, there was substantial immune infiltration. Testosterone treatment inhibited immune infiltration in the VP of ERβ crispr−/− mice. We conclude that ERβ is a gene critical in maintaining normal basal cells and modulating immune environment in the prostate. Its loss leads to histological changes suggesting prostatitis and increases the number of intermediate cells, which are considered to be the cells of origin of prostate cancers. We suggest that an ERβ agonist could protect against 5-ARI-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and defects in the basal cell layer in BPH.",

Other ion channels, including Kv2.1 and Slo1, appear to form clusters through prominent intrinsically disordered sequences in the cytoplasm.

Our findings reveal that BMP-9 signaling intersects with VEGF pathways and contributes to the delicate balance between vascular growth and remodeling in the lungs. We also show that disruption of this pathway can shift vascular responses toward an HHT-like state, potentially altering disease susceptibility.

          "abstract": "The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection by facilitating desired movements and suppressing unwanted ones. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a key output nucleus, facilitates movement through disinhibition of the superior colliculus (SC). However, its role in action suppression, particularly in primates, remains less clear. We investigated whether individual SNr neurons in three male macaque monkeys bidirectionally modulate their activity to both facilitate and suppress actions and examined the role of glutamatergic inputs in suppression. Monkeys performed a sequential choice task, selecting or rejecting visually presented targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that SNr neurons decreased firing rates during target selection and increased firing rates during rejection, demonstrating bidirectional modulation. Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic inputs to the lateral SNr disrupted saccadic control and impaired suppression of reflexive saccades, providing causal evidence for the role of excitatory input in behavioral inhibition. These findings suggest that glutamatergic projections, potentially originating from sources including the subthalamic nucleus, contribute to the increased SNr activity during action suppression. Our results highlight conserved basal ganglia mechanisms across species and offer insights into the neural substrates of action selection and suppression in primates, with implications for understanding disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.",

Previously, we have shown that signaling of ABA in the endodermis leads to protoxylem (PX) differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that ROPs suppress PX differentiation in the roots of both Arabidopsis and tomato. Fourier transform and Shannon’s entropy show that endodermal ABA signaling controls the periodicity and overall order of PX secondary cell wall (SCW) coils in an ROP-dependent manner. Correspondingly, in the PX, GFP-ROP11 is initially dispersed and gradually becomes distributed in an oscillatory fashion with a periodicity corresponding to that of the SCW coils. Oryzalin treatments disrupt the frequency and increase the entropy of the GFP-ROP11 signal, suggesting that microtubules delimit ROP distribution. Signaling of ABA in the endodermis encourages the enlargement of metaxylem SCW pits, while ABA signaling in the stele limits this enlargement. Pit size and density are decreased in ROP mutants while ABA enhances ROP11 expression in the stele and broadens its distribution in the endodermis. Taken together, non-cell-autonomous and cell-autonomous interactions between ABA and ROPs regulate xylem differentiation and SCW patterning.",

          "abstract": "Recently, extensive evidence has demonstrated that the brain operates close to a critical state, characterized by dynamic patterns known as neuronal avalanches. The critical state, reflecting the delicate balance between neural excitation and inhibition, offers numerous advantages in information processing. However, the role of genetics in shaping brain criticality is not fully understood. Whether there is any shared genetic factor influencing the critical state and cognitive functions remains elusive. Here, we aimed to address these questions by examining the heritability of brain criticality and its relation to cognitive function by analyzing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in 250 monozygotic twins, 142 dizygotic twins, and 437 Not-twin subjects. We found that genetic factors substantially influenced brain criticality across various scales, encompassing brain regions, functional networks, and the whole brain. These genetic influences exhibited heterogeneity, with the criticality of the primary sensory cortex being more strongly influenced by genetic factors compared to that of the association cortex. Furthermore, we combined rs-fMRI data with transcriptional microarray data from the Allen Brain Atlas: Human Brain (ABHB) dataset and found that the organization of regional critical dynamics was highly explained by a specific gene expression profile. Finally, our results showed that the critical state was correlated with total cognition and had a genetic link with it. These findings provide empirical evidence that brain criticality is a biological phenotype and suggest a shared genetic foundation underlying brain criticality and cognitive functions. Our results pave the way toward revealing specific biological mechanisms contributing to critical dynamics and their associations with brain function and dysfunction.",

Here, we report a cross-talk between Ena/VASP proteins and WAVE2 that is important for cancer cell extravasation. Mutating the EVH1 domain recognition motif in WAVE2 abrogates chemotaxis of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and reduces their extravasation in a zebrafish model. In pilot experiments, orthotopic implantation of these cells into mice led to a reduction in macrometastasis, resulting in prolonged survival.

          "abstract": "Anticancer chemotherapy is an essential part of cancer treatment, but the emergence of resistance remains a major hurdle. Metabolic reprogramming is a notable phenotype associated with the acquisition of drug resistance. Here, we develop a computational framework that predicts metabolic gene targets capable of reverting the metabolic state of drug-resistant cells to that of drug-sensitive parental cells, thereby sensitizing the resistant cells. The computational framework performs single-gene knockout simulation of genome-scale metabolic models that predicts genome-wide metabolic flux distribution in drug-resistant cells, and clusters the resulting knockout flux data using uniform manifold approximation and projection, followed by k -means clustering. From the clustering analysis, knockout genes that lead to the flux data near that of drug-sensitive cells are considered drug sensitization targets. This computational approach is demonstrated using doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells. Drug sensitization targets are further refined based on proteome and metabolome data, which generate GOT1 for doxorubicin-resistant MCF7, GPI for paclitaxel-resistant MCF7, and SLC1A5 as a common target. These targets are experimentally validated where treating drug-resistant cancer cells with small-molecule inhibitors results in increased sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to doxorubicin or paclitaxel. The applicability of the developed framework is further demonstrated using drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer cells. Taken together, the computational framework predicts drug sensitization targets in an intuitive and cost-efficient manner and can be applied to overcome drug-resistant cells associated with various cancers and other metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Negative feedback of the cochlear efferent system plays a critical role in control of hearing sensitivity and protection from noise trauma. Type II auditory nerves (ANs) innervate outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea and provide an input to the cochlear efferent system to achieve hearing sensitivity controlling and protection; in particular, medial olivocochlear efferent nerves innervate OHCs to control OHC electromotility, which is an active cochlear amplifier in mammals. However, little is known about channel information underlying type II AN activity and consequent function. Here, we report that ATP-gated P2x7 receptor had a predominant expression at type II spiral ganglion (SG) neurons and the synaptic areas under inner hair cells and OHCs with lateral and medial olivocochlear efferent nerves. Knockout (KO) of P2x7 increased hearing sensitivity with enhanced acoustic startle response, auditory brainstem response, and cochlear microphonics by increasing OHC electromotility. P2x7 KO also increased susceptibility to noise and exacerbated ribbon synapse degeneration. Middle-level noise exposure could impair active cochlear mechanics resulting in hearing loss in P2x7 KO mice. These data demonstrate that P2x7 receptors have a critical role in type II SG neuron’s function and the cochlear efferent system to control hearing sensitivity; deficiency of P2x7 receptors can impair type II SG neuron’s function and the cochlear efferent suppression leading to increase of active cochlear amplification and hearing oversensitivity, i.e., hyperacusis, and susceptibility to noise, which may also associate with other hearing disorders, such as tinnitus.",

          "authors": "David Muramatsu, Henrik Weyer, Florian M. Gartner, Erwin Frey",
          "abstract": "The thymus is one of the most important organs of the immune system. It is responsible for both the production of T cells and the prevention of their autoimmunity. It comprises two types of tissue: The cortex, where nascent T cells (thymocytes) are generated; and the medulla, embedded within the cortex, where autoreactive thymocytes are eliminated through negative selection. In mice, the medulla exhibits a complex, convoluted morphology, which has raised the question of whether its form impacts its function. Intriguingly, experiments also reveal a reverse dependency: The interactions between medullary stroma and thymocytes shape the medullary structure. However, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of medulla morphogenesis emerging from these interactions remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual theoretical model showing that central, experimentally verified signaling pathways suffice to shape the convoluted medullary structure. The mathematical analysis of the model explains the observed effects of chemotaxis on thymocyte localization, and the reported morphological changes resulting from the modulation of thymocyte production. Our findings reveal that the cross-talk between medulla growth and negative selection of thymocytes not only regulates medullary volume but also orchestrates the morphology of the thymus medulla. This mechanism of structure formation robustly organizes the medulla in a way that accelerates thymocyte negative selection by improving their chemotactic migration into the medulla. Thereby, we identify a feedback between the function of the thymus medulla and its form. Our theoretical study motivates further experimental analysis of the spatial distribution of thymic cell populations and predicts morphological changes under genetic perturbations.",

Using a hypothesis-free computational approach, we identify putative ligand–receptor interactions from publicly available single-cell RNA datasets and further validate one of these (App-CD74).

          "abstract": "Climate change pushes species toward higher latitudes and altitudes, but the proximate drivers of range expansions vary, and it is unclear whether evolution facilitates climate change–induced range changes. In a temporally replicated field experiment, we translocated wall brown butterflies ( Lasiommata megera ) descending from range interior and range margin populations to sites at 1) the range interior, 2) the range margin, and 3) beyond the current northern range edge. Thereby, we tested for local adaptation in seasonal timing and winter survival and evaluated to what extent local adaptation influences the ongoing, climate-driven range expansion. Almost all individuals from all populations entered diapause at an appropriate time, despite previously identified among-population variation in diapause induction thresholds. Caterpillars of northern descent, however, grew faster than those from southern populations at all field sites. This may be a countergradient adaptation to compensate for the short, northern growing seasons, but we found no evidence for prewinter body mass affecting winter survival. In fact, winter survival was low overall—extremely so at the beyond range site—regardless of population origin, indicating that the primary constraint to range expansion is an inability to adapt to winter conditions. Hence, although range-expanding wall browns show clear local evolution of two traits related to seasonal timing, these putative local adaptations likely do not contribute to range expansion, which is instead limited by winter survival. To predict future range changes, it will be important to distinguish between the traits that evolve during range expansion and those that set the range limit.",

          "abstract": "Computational theories of reinforcement learning suggest that two families of algorithm—model-based and model-free—tightly map onto the classic distinction between automatic and deliberate systems of control: Deliberate evaluative responses are thought to reflect model-based algorithms, which are accurate but computationally expensive, whereas automatic evaluative responses are thought to reflect model-free algorithms, which are error-prone but computationally cheap. This framework has animated research on psychological phenomena ranging from habit formation to social learning, moral decision-making, and cognitive development. Here, we propose that model-based and model-free algorithms may not be as aligned with deliberate and automatic evaluative processing as prevailing theories suggest. Across three preregistered behavioral experiments involving adult human participants (total n = 2,572), we show that model-based algorithms shape not only deliberate but also automatic evaluations. Experiment 1 numerically replicates past findings suggesting that deliberate (but not automatic) evaluative responses are uniquely shaped by model-based algorithms but, critically, also reveals confounds that render interpretation of this evidence equivocal. Experiments 2 to 3 eliminate these confounds and reveal robust model-based contributions to automatic evaluative processing across two measures of automatic evaluation, supported by multinomial processing tree modeling. Together, these results suggest that dominant frameworks may considerably underestimate both the ubiquity of model-based algorithms and the computational sophistication of automatic evaluative processing.",

          "authors": "Christian M. Johansen, Elisabetta Benazzi, Jonas C. Peters",
          "abstract": "The Hantzsch ester (HEH 2 ) has found considerable utility as a photoreductant in synthesis, with photodriven transfer hydrogenation reactions typically limited to activated substrates. We recently established that the addition of an organic buffer of collidinium triflate [(ColH)OTf] and collidine (Col) allows photodriven transfer hydrogenation from HEH 2 to N 2 forming NH 3 (nitrogen reduction; N 2 R) in the presence of a Mo catalyst. Given the requirements for Mo-catalyzed thermally driven N 2 R, this result suggested the generation of a significant driving force for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) when irradiating HEH 2 in the presence of Col-buffer. In this study, we probe how Col-buffer enables efficient photodriven proton-coupled reductions with HEH 2 . Wavelength-dependent NH 3 yields are consistent with HEH 2 photoexcitation, and the combination of HEH 2 with Col-buffer is privileged. Data are presented, suggesting that HEH 2 is statically quenched via ET to [ColH]OTf through an H-bonded association complex to release ColH • and [HEH 2 ] •+ . Transient absorbance data and EPR studies establish that the resulting [HEH 2 ] •+ intermediate is rapidly deprotonated by Col to yield HEH • , in net furnishing HEH • and ColH • as potent H-atom donors. Broader utility of this reagent combination is demonstrated in the photoreduction of a range of C=O and N=O π-bonds by HEH 2 , with a significant boost in rates and yield, and altered reactivity, observed on addition of Col-buffer. ColH • is posited as the most potent PCET donor generated (BDFE N−H of 28 kcal mol −1 ).",

When monkeys report more confidence in a perceptual decision, that decision is more likely to be correct. It is not known how neural circuits in the primate brain assess the quality of perceptual decisions. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that decision confidence is related to the structure of population activity in the sensory cortex. And second, that this relation differs from the one between sensory activity and decision content. We trained macaque monkeys to judge the orientation of ambiguous stimuli and additionally report their confidence in these judgments. We recorded population activity in the primary visual cortex and used decoders to expose the relationship between this activity and the choice-confidence reports. Our analysis validated both hypotheses and suggests that perceptual decisions arise from a neural computation downstream of visual cortex that estimates the most likely interpretation of a sensory response, while decision confidence instead reflects a computation that evaluates whether this sensory response will produce a reliable decision. Our work establishes a direct link between neural population activity in the sensory cortex and the metacognitive ability to introspect about the quality of perceptual decisions.",

          "abstract": "Using machine learning (ML) to construct interatomic interactions and thus potential energy surface (PES) has become a common strategy for materials design and simulations. However, those current models of machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) consider no relevant physical constraints or global scaling and thus may owe intrinsic out-of-domain difficulty which underlies the challenges of model generalizability and physical scalability. Here, by incorporating the global universal scaling law, we develop an ultrasmall parameterized MLIP with superlinear expressive capability, named SUS 2 -MLIP. Due to the global scaling derived from the universal equation of state (UEOS), SUS 2 -MLIP not only has significantly reduced parameters by decoupling the element space from coordinate space but also naturally outcomes the out-of-domain difficulty and endows the model with inherent generalizability and scalability even with relatively small training dataset. The non-linearity-embedding transformation in radial function endows the model with superlinear expressive capability. SUS 2 -MLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art MLIP models with its exceptional computational efficiency, especially for multiple-element materials and physical scalability in property prediction. This work not only presents a highly efficient universal MLIP model but also sheds light on incorporating physical constraints into AI–aided materials simulation.",

          "abstract": "A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of valence electron density coupled with lattice distortion. Its formation is closely tied to the dynamical charge susceptibility, χ ( q , ω ) , which reflects the collective electron dynamics of the material. Despite decades of study, χ ( q , ω ) near a CDW transition has never been measured at nonzero momentum, q , with meV energy resolution. Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe 3 using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons, which soften via the Kohn anomaly, we find the electronic excitations exhibit purely relaxational dynamics well described by a diffusive model, with the diffusivity peaking just below the critical temperature, T C 1 . Additionally, we report for the first time a divergence in the real part of χ ( q , ω ) in the static limit ( ω → 0 ), a long-predicted hallmark of CDWs. Unexpectedly, this divergence occurs as T → 0 , with only a weak thermodynamic signature at T = T C 1 . Our study necessitates a reexamination of the traditional description of CDW formation in quantum materials.",

          "authors": "Kevin Lançon, Jiakang Tian, Haleigh Bach, Pierre Drapeau, Jean-Francois Poulin, Philippe Séguéla",
          "abstract": "Chronic pain arises from maladaptive changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region implicated in descending pain modulation. Chronic pain increases the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the ACC. Although a reduction in inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal neurons has been observed in neuropathic conditions, the identity of the specific interneurons responsible remains unclear. We show that chronic pain selectively impairs parvalbumin (PV), but not somatostatin, interneurons in the rostral ACC. This is characterized by a decrease in the density of PV interneuron processes, a reduction in their surrounding perineuronal net, and a lower expression of PV. Functionally, PV interneurons display diminished inhibitory efficacy in vitro and reduced phasic activation in response to aversive stimuli in vivo. Dopamine (DA) fibers preferentially contact PV interneurons and excite them via D1 dopamine receptor activation, increasing their excitability and enhancing the frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents on pyramidal neurons in healthy, but not neuropathic, conditions. Furthermore, we show that this pathway is involved in hunger-induced analgesia: Food deprivation increases DA release in the ACC and consequently decreases pain thresholds in neuropathic mice. Conversely, when mice are not food deprived, neuropathic pain significantly reduces DA release in the ACC. We conclude that the loss of PV interneuron inhibitory efficacy, alongside convergent hypodopaminergic signaling, synergistically contributes to pathological ACC dysfunction and associated symptoms of chronic pain.",

These diseases, if left untreated, can be lethal within hours. Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDAΦ, which promotes colonization of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate bacterial invasion. How this phage is organized and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDAΦ is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein (MCP) arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed α-helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the MCP presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage–phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis . Taken together, our results shed light on the structure, organization, and higher-order assembly of a biomedically relevant phage encoded in the genome of a human pathogen. Molecular insights gleaned from this study increase our understanding of phage evolution, phage-mediated bacterial adhesion, and pathogenicity.",

In cyanobacteria, single RRM domain proteins are involved in mRNA targeting to the thylakoid membrane and acclimation to certain stress conditions, but many details of their physiological functions and molecular targets have remained unknown. The model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a family of three genes encoding the RRM domain–containing proteins Rbp1, Rbp2, and Rbp3. Here, we verified the RNA-binding activity of Rbp3 in vivo and show that cells of a Δ rbp3 deletion strain had a lower photosystem (PS) I:PSII ratio and decreased pigment content and were significantly smaller than wild-type cells. To identify the set of interacting molecules, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with a strain expressing a C-terminally FLAG-tagged Rbp3. Mass spectrometry of the elution fraction suggested physical proximity between Rbp3, ribosomes, and a very small number of other proteins. The most highly enriched transcript in the coeluting RNA fraction was the psaAB mRNA. This was corroborated by fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses showing decreased psaA mRNA signals in Δ rbp3 , and colocalization with Rbp3 fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the wild type. Other mRNAs coenriched with Rbp3 encode thylakoid, plasma membrane, and carboxysome proteins.

Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance. Our study uncovers a mechanism enabling avian sour tolerance that involves changes to the sour receptor [otopetrin 1 (OTOP1)]. We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade.

          "abstract": "Prolonged wakefulness leads to persistent, deep recovery sleep (RS). However, the neuronal circuits that mediate this process remain elusive. From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep.",

          "abstract": "The evolution of soft-bodied squids, which provide a major part of the biomass in modern oceans globally, is poorly understood owing to their patchy fossil record. We provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of squids through “digital fossil-mining” techniques, revealing a new lagerstätte. The more than 250 fossil beaks of 40 species show that squids originated and rapidly radiated by 100 million years ago. Our data suggest that the radical shift from heavily shelled, slowly moving cephalopods to soft-bodied forms did not result from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (66 million years ago). Early squids had already formed large populations, and their biomass exceeded that of ammonites and fishes. They pioneered the modern-type marine ecosystem as intelligent, fast swimmers.",

The neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In this work, we simultaneously recorded hundreds to thousands of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex of freely behaving rats. Neural population activity drifted continuously along a one-dimensional manifold during all behaviors and behavioral states, including sleep, which points to an intrinsic origin of the drift. In awake animals, boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in population dynamics, which segmented the neural activity into temporal units. During tasks with recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the drift, encoding event information across multiple timescales. The results identify a hierarchical coding scheme for organizing events in time.",

Switching on Aldh1a2 or RA supplementation reactivated regeneration. Evolutionary inactivation of multiple Aldh1a2-linked regulatory elements accounted for the deficient Aldh1a2 expression upon injury in mice and rats.

Measuring the spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across embryogenesis, we find a high level of similarity in gene expression programs between species despite tens of millions of years of evolutionary divergence. Nonetheless, thousands of genes show divergence in their cell type specific expression patterns, with enrichment for functions in environmental response and behavior. Neuronal cell types show higher divergence than others such as the intestine and germline. This work identifies likely constraints on the evolution of developmental gene expression.",

Despite the transformative impact, visible-light photoredox catalysis remains constrained by the thermodynamic limits of photon energy and inefficiencies arising from unproductive back electron transfer, both of which become particularly pronounced in thermodynamically demanding reactions. In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design. The super-reducing capabilities of this organic catalyst system are demonstrated through efficient application in a broad scope of challenging arene reductions.",

          "abstract": "In Thailand, the word BaiKhao (ใบข้าว)—meaning “rice leaf”—embodies a quiet agricultural revolution. For generations, farmers gauged crops’ nitrogen fertilizer needs by visually assessing leaf greenness, a method vulnerable to variations in lighting conditions and human error. Today, the “BaiKhaoNK” mobile app transforms smartphones into optical sensors. Using built-in cameras, it quantifies chlorophyll levels through spectral analysis and recommends precise fertilizer doses. This innovation epitomizes agriphotonics, a field dedicated to harnessing light-based tools to monitor, analyze, and diagnose crops and their environments.",

We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multi-omic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction with p53 inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through co-activation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. In contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intra-luminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.",

Although details differ and matter, neuroinflammation exacerbating neurodegeneration has similarities across multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders, such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, lessons from successful disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis may provide insights into strategies for modulating neuroinflammation and reducing neural injury in other neurological conditions. In this Review, we discuss these lessons and potential strategies for counteracting neuroinflammation, including taming the microglia-orchestrated brain immune responses that contribute to progressing neuropathology.",

          "abstract": "The brain’s ability to prioritize sensory information is crucial for adaptive behavior, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated basal forebrain cholinergic neurons modulating olfactory bulb (OB) circuits in mice. The activity of cholinergic feedback axons in OB correlated with orofacial movements, with little responses to passively experienced odors. When mice engaged in an olfactory task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement correlated to odor aligned. This response shift was absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex during olfactory task engagement, and in OB, during an auditory task. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons impaired olfactory task performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells. Thus, the cholinergic system dynamically modulates sensory processing in a modality-specific and context-dependent manner.",

An advanced scanning electrochemical cell microscopy-thin-layer cyclic voltammetry technique was used to accurately determine the carrier transfer rate, stability, and assembly properties of SAMs. Ultimately, the efficiencies of PSCs exceeded 26.3%, mini-modules (10.05 cm 2 ) reached 23.6%, and perovskite-silicon tandem devices (1 cm 2 ) surpassed 34.2%.

          "abstract": "Prokaryotic defense-associated reverse transcriptases (DRTs) were recently identified with antiviral functions; however, their functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream noncoding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest through abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]–rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools.",

          "abstract": "Translation termination is essential in all living organisms because it ensures that proteins have lengths strictly defined by their genes. This universal process is mediated by peptide release factors (RFs) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl transfer RNA (peptidyl-tRNA) on the ribosome, presumably by activating a water molecule. We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2′-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs.",

          "abstract": "Human language is unique among communication systems since many elements are learned and transmitted across generations. Previous research suggests that this process is best predicted by infant-directed communication, i.e., a mode of communication directed by caregivers to children. Despite its importance for language, whether infant-directed communication is unique to humans or rooted more deeply in the primate lineage remains unclear. To assess this, we investigated directed and surrounding vocal communication in human infants and infants of wild nonhuman great apes. Our findings reveal that human infants receive dramatically more infant-directed communication than nonhuman great ape infants. These data suggest that the earliest hominins likely relied more on surrounding communication to become communicatively competent, while infant-directed vocal communication became considerably more prominent with human language.",

          "abstract": "While occupying an influential position within one’s social network brings many advantages, it is unknown how certain individuals rise in social prominence. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset that tracks an entirely new network of college freshmen ( N  = 187), we test whether “climbing the social ladder” depends on knowing how other people are connected to each other. Those who ultimately come to occupy the most influential positions exhibit early and accurate representations of their network’s general, abstract structure (i.e., who belongs to which communities and cliques). In contrast, detailed, granular representations of specific friendships do not translate into gains in social influence over time. Only once the network stabilizes do the most influential individuals exhibit the most accurate representations of specific friendships. These findings reveal that those who climb the social ladder first detect their emerging network’s general structure and then fine-tune their knowledge about individual relationships between their peers as network dynamics settle.",

          "abstract": "Adapting to change is a fundamental feature of human learning, yet its developmental origins remain elusive. We developed an experimental and computational approach to track infants’ adaptive learning processes via pupil size, an indicator of tonic and phasic noradrenergic activity. We found that 8-month-old infants’ tonic pupil size mirrored trial-by-trial fluctuations in environmental volatility, while phasic pupil responses revealed that infants used this information to dynamically optimize their learning. This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity. These findings demonstrate that infants actively adapt to environmental change, and that early differences in this capacity may have profound implications for long-term cognitive and psychosocial development.",

Through multiple methodologies, including phytolith analysis, micro–computed tomography scanning, and thin-section petrography, this recent research confirms the presence of abundant rice husk and leaf phytoliths adhering to red-slipped pottery (“Marianas Red”) at the Ritidian Site Complex in Guam, dated by radiocarbon to 3500 to 3100 years ago. This study addresses the long-standing question of whether the first Pacific Islanders transported rice with them from the Philippines across 2300 kilometers of open sea, representing the longest known ocean voyage of the time. During this early period, rice was restricted to special ritual events in the Marianas. The early voyage apparently was planned with provisions of rice at 3500 years ago.",

          "abstract": "Movement of pedestrian crowds is ubiquitous in human society. However, it is unclear what dynamical regimes pedestrian crowds can exhibit at different crowd densities, how pedestrians move in these different dynamical regimes, and in which dynamical regime the movement synchronization of pedestrians is most likely to occur. Here, we conducted a unidirectional crowd movement experiment, in which we tracked the movement of pedestrian crowds through foot tracking. We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained. We also demonstrate that pedestrians are most likely to synchronize their movements spontaneously at the onset of jamming. Our findings provide important insights into crowd dynamics.",

Our system contains eight four-kilobit memristor chips with embedded floating-point computing workflows and a heterogeneous training scheme, representing a heterogeneous CIM platform that leverages precision-limited analog devices to accelerate floating-point neural network training. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system by solving the one-dimensional Burgers’ equation and modeling the three-dimensional thermal conduction phenomenon. An expected nearly 116 times to 21 times increase in computational energy efficiency was achieved, with solution precision comparable to those of digital processors. Our results extend in-memristor computing applicability beyond edge neural networks and facilitate construction of future AI-for-Science computing platforms.",

          "abstract": "Conventional drug delivery methods for chronic disease often suffer from low potency and poor patient compliance, while current advanced devices face limitations because of bulkiness, frequent implantation needs, inflammation risk, and lack of precise control. To overcome these challenges, we developed the SUSTAIN—a smart, ultra-long-lasting, sequentially triggerable, and artfully implantable nozzle system. The SUSTAIN integrates an osmotic pressure–triggered module, an airflow-generated T-pipe (AGT), and a drug infusion pump (DIP) for controlled subcutaneous drug release. The AGT enables tunable dosing by varying NaHCO 3 /KH 2 PO 4 powder amounts, while shear thinning of the β-cyclodextrin/Pluronic F-127 hydrogel in the DIP ensures sustained drug infusion. In vivo studies show that the SUSTAIN delivers at least four doses of levothyroxine sodium over 10 days and three doses of semaglutide over 42 days, maintaining effective blood drug levels with minimal invasiveness. This system presents a highly promising solution for improving therapeutic outcomes and convenience in chronic disease management.",

Reducing hERG binding to obviate potential cardiac toxicity is crucial. Nanotechnology has been applied to drug delivery for reducing drug toxicity and improving efficacy, but few studies have addressed hERG-related cardiotoxicity. We report the use of self-assembling dendrimer nanosystems for drug formulation and delivery, which effectively reduced hERG binding and associated toxicity while promoting therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, these dendrimer nanosystems efficiently encapsulated the antimalarial drug chloroquine, the anticancer agent doxorubicin, and the NUPR1 inhibitor ZZW115, all three having high affinity to hERG channels. These nanoformulations showed three- to eightfold reduced hERG binding affinity, which, in animal models, translated to abolished toxicity. These nanodrugs exhibited prolonged circulation, leading to enhanced accumulation at disease sites and improved treatment outcomes. This study highlights the potential of nanotechnology to reduce hERG binding and related toxicity while improving drug efficacy, offering valuable perspectives for drug development.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and utilization, powered by renewable energy, are essential to achieving net-zero emissions and CO 2 valorization. While remarkable progress has been made in catalysts, solution design, and system engineering, recent breakthroughs reveal that nitrogen-containing molecules—specifically sp 2 -hybridized structures (e.g., pyridine) and sp 3 -hybridized moieties (e.g., ethanolamine) —hold untapped potential to revolutionize both CO 2 capture and conversion. These structures have been demonstrated as the Holy Grail in facilitating CO 2 activation, stabilizing key intermediates, and streamlining reaction pathways—capabilities rarely achievable with conventional strategies. However, limited mechanistic understanding of their physicochemical properties and interactions with CO 2 hampers broader application. This review highlights recent advances in leveraging sp 2 /sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen structures, unpacks their molecular roles in electrochemical CO 2 management, and offers a unifying framework for their dual-functionality across capture and conversion. By illuminating these nitrogen-based motifs, we uncover practical design principles and open avenues for integrating expanded N-containing compounds into energy technologies—paving the way for next-generation carbon management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Northern African climate is characterized by strongly contrasting wet summers and dry winters. Dust exported by the northeasterly trade (Harmattan) winds creates marine sedimentary records that have been long interpreted to show that northern African climate became drier and more variable across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary [2.58 million years ago (Ma)], when global climate cooled and high-latitude glacial-interglacial cycles intensified. However, questions about the impact of summer rainfall on winter dust fluxes and thus the history of the African summer monsoons remain. We present a leaf wax hydrogen isotope record from offshore northwestern Africa that demonstrates that rainfall regimes remained stable and varied solely in response to 21,000-year cycles in summer insolation from 3.5 to 2.5 Ma. We infer that the summer rains and winter winds respond to different climate forcings, with summer rainfall driven by solar radiation over the northern African landmass and the winter trades affected by high-latitude climate and meridional temperature gradients.",

The optical drive of coherent magnetic collective excitations, namely magnons, represents a promising route. The ability to arbitrarily and nonthermally increase the magnon frequencies with laser pulses could enable this progress. However, this effect has not been reported to date. To achieve it, here, we explore the optical resonant excitation of high-momentum magnons, which experimentally are observed to couple to low-momentum magnons, modifying the frequencies and amplitudes thereof. This evidence, not caused by laser heating, is explained with a resonant light-scattering mechanism coupling high- and low-momentum eigenmodes across momentum space. Our results disclose routes to inducing instabilities and phase transitions via mode softening and potentially even light-driven Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons and superconductivity mediated by high-momentum spin-fluctuations.",

However, improving emitter purity, stability, and scalability remains a challenge for quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate highly pure and stable single-photon emitters (SPEs) in h-BN by directly growing carbon-doped, centimeter-scale h-BN thin films using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g (2) (0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for h-BN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness (~0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (&gt;15 min), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD’s low-temperature synthesis and in situ doping. Our results demonstrate an effective method for large-scale production of high-purity, stable SPEs in h-BN, enabling robust quantum optical sources for various quantum applications.",

Cell-lineage analysis and functional assays reveal the developmental origin of HSCs during larval shell formation and their participation in hemocyte-mediated shell regeneration and soft-body blood supply. Widespread skeleton-related HSC-like cells are found in diverse invertebrate groups and bony fish group, suggesting skeletons as a universal niche for animal HSCs and HSC-skeleton association preceding vertebrate water-to-land transition. Comparison of invertebrate and vertebrate skeletal HSCs enables the macroevolutionary profiling of a core-set of animal HSC regulators. Our findings would boost fundamental paradigm shifts for hematopoiesis and stem cell research in invertebrates and provide the redefined understanding of vertebrate BM evolution and water-to-land transition.",

Our experimental results reveal the pressure-temperature conditions for amorphization, decomposition, and melting of labradorite and anorthite. The boundary between amorphous plagioclase and crystalline high-pressure phases in our phase diagram indicate diaplectic glass can form at 1300 to 1500 kelvin, and the melting line suggests that maskelynite can be generated above 3000 kelvin at high pressures.

Our system harnesses ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae , chemically coupled with an enzymatic cascade involving alcohol oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, to drive the nanoshell formation of polydopamine.

Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of YOD1 reduced Ang II– and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Subsequently, we used multiple proteomic analyses to identify and confirm STAT3 as a substrate protein for YOD1. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that the C155 site of YOD1 removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from K97 on STAT3, stabilizing STAT3 levels and enhancing its nuclear translocation in cardiomyocytes under Ang II stimulation. Notably, inhibiting STAT3 reversed the antihypertrophic effects of YOD1 deficiency in Ang II–challenged mice. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of YOD1 mitigated Ang II–induced pathological ventricular remodeling in mice. This study clarifies the role of YOD1 and introduces a previously unidentified YOD1-STAT3 axis in regulating pathological cardiac hypertrophy, providing valuable insights for drug development targeting this condition.",

In human CD4-receptor knock-in mice, 64 Cu-CD4-Nb1 specifically accumulated in different orthotopic tumors, correlating with histological CD4 + cell densities. Based on intratumoral CD4 + cell distribution patterns within the core and periphery, we distinguished responders to combined αPD-1/4-1BB antibodies early on-treatment. CD4-PET identified resistance to αPD-1 monotherapy, which was mitigated by adding regulatory T cell–depleting α4-1BB antibodies. Patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant αPD-L1 therapy revealed low CD4 + T cell densities in the tumor core.

Based on these findings, we further engineered a mucolipin TRP channel 1 (MTC1)–related therapeutic nanoplatform for endogenously triggering lysosomal zinc release to curb inflammation and block macrophage pyroptosis. This nanoplatform consists of mesoporous silica nanoparticles to deliver MTC1 agonists and carbon nanodots, which could synergistically exert antiatherosclerotic effect by scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species, inhibiting macrophage pyroptosis, modulating macrophage transition, and rebuilding atherosclerotic immune microenvironment.

The Divalia Fossae, surface troughs comparable in size to the Grand Canyon, encircle two-thirds of the equator. Two giant impacts reshaped the southern hemisphere, where an older basin is partially superposed by the younger Rheasilvia basin. The origin of the Divalia Fossae is widely accepted as directly linked to the Rheasilvia impact, either by tectonics caused immediately by the impact, up-spinning, or secondary cratering. We present several geologic constraints that support a tectonic origin of the troughs due to the adjustment of Vesta’s spin axis to a geoid changed by both large impacts. The best fit to Vesta’s gravitational field corresponds to a spin axis reorientation of 3° that, when coupled with despinning, induces a stress state that predicts Divalia Fossae’s established location, fracture type, and orientation. These insights underline the importance of tectonic processes in the early evolution of protoplanets.",

We review examples from the literature showing increasing demographic variability in recovering populations of baleen whales and present a simulation study on the expected response of recovered versus depleted whale population to environmental variability and climate impacts. We propose that baleen whales are more sensitive to environmental variability than previously recognized; that major demographic fluctuations will become the norm as baleen whales recover; and that climate-driven disruptions to whale population dynamics will be most dramatic in populations with the lowest rates of anthropogenic mortality.",

To identify potential in situ stimuli for growth, toxigenicity, and bloom persistence, we compared environmental factors and biological processes identified by metaomics to Chrysochromulina leadbeateri HABs between two fjords in northern Norway. We identified the polyketide ichthyotoxin leadbeaterin-1 from the C. leadbeateri bloom and found potentially associated candidate PKS genes of which most were higher expressed at bloom stations. A relative depletion of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate during the bloom was correlated with higher expression of genes involved in endocytosis, autophagy, and lysosomal activity.

We find that the firing rates of the somatostatin (SOM) interneurons align closely with the level of network synchrony irrespective of the target of modulatory input. Further analysis reveals that inhibition from SOM to parvalbumin interneurons must be limited to allow gradual transitions from asynchrony to synchrony and that the strength of recurrent excitation onto SOM neurons determines the level of synchrony achievable in the network. Our results are consistent with recent experimental findings on cell type–specific manipulations.

          "abstract": "Climate change is altering marine ecosystems, driving shifts in sea turtle distributions and challenging conservation efforts. Our study examines how climate change affects the global sea distribution of all seven sea turtle species, intersecting with marine protected areas (MPAs) and shipping corridors. Using species distribution models and environmental data from 2000 to 2024, we project sea turtle habitats under current conditions and three future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) for 2050 and 2100. Our results show substantial habitat redistributions, with poleward shifts and contractions, particularly under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Over 50% of sea turtle hotspots may disappear by 2050, with many new habitats in high shipping intensity areas. Alarmingly, only 23% of current hotspots are within MPAs, highlighting the need for adaptive conservation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Methane is a major greenhouse gas and a key component of global biogeochemical cycles. Microbial methane often deviates from isotope and isotopolog equilibrium in surface environments but approaches equilibrium in deep subsurface sediments. The origin of this near-equilibrium isotopic signature in methane, whether directly produced by methanogens or achieved through anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), remains uncertain. Here, we show that, in the absence of AOM, microbial methane produced from deep-sea sediments exhibits isotopolog compositions approaching thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy limitation. In contrast, microbial methane from salt marsh and thermokarst lakes exhibits significant hydrogen and clumped isotopic disequilibrium due to high free-energy availability. We propose that clumped isotopologs of methane provide a proxy for characterizing the bioenergetics of environments for methane production. Together, these observations demonstrate methane clumped isotopes as a powerful tool to better understand the relation between methane metabolisms and the energy landscape in natural environments.",

This study performs numerical simulations to investigate the conditions that were needed to cross between Taiwan and Yonaguni Island, where one of the world’s strongest ocean currents, the Kuroshio, remains active. We combined simulations based on three ocean models with data from an actual experimental voyage conducted in 2019. The results showed that travel across this sea would have been possible on both the modern and Late Pleistocene oceans if a dugout canoe was used with a suitable departure place and paddling strategy. Recognizing the Kuroshio, paddling to counteract this current, and using high-level navigation were crucial to success. This suggests that the Paleolithic maritime expansion in the Western Pacific involved both advanced technologies and strategic challenges.",

Depletion of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the highest expressed PM-ER tether protein, interfered with mechanotransduction from the PM to the ER, and affected the ER tension. We found that an optimized mechanical strain increased ER tension in a homeostatic manner, but excessive strain resulted in ER expansion, as well as activating ER stress. Last, we showed that changes in ER tension were linked with ER-mitochondria interactions and associated with cellular energetics and function. Together, these findings identify a PM-ER mechanotransduction mechanism that dose-dependently regulates cellular metabolism.",

This study presents a submillimeter magnetically actuated soft rotatable-tipped microcatheter (MSRM) designed to access small blood vessels and provide efficient, minimally invasive therapeutic interventions for blood clot treatment. The MSRM’s rotatable tip design enhances accessibility and navigation speed through a rotation-assisted active steering strategy. Improved blood clot treatment efficiency is achieved through the MSRM’s multifunctionality: It can accelerate drug-blood clot interactions, mechanically break down blood clots, and retrieve clot debris. The low invasiveness is attributed to the soft material design and conservative actuation strategy. The performance of the MSRM is validated in both in vitro phantom studies and in vivo rabbit models, and the invasiveness is evaluated using a human placenta model.",

Particularly, we develop electrically responsive hydrogels to establish rapidly detachable device/hydrogel interfaces, endowing the reusability of the biosensor array. Meanwhile, the adhesion of hydrogel/skin interfaces is also enhanced to facilitate high-fidelity signal acquisition. By analyzing the photoplethysmography (PPG) infrared (IR) signals, the biosensor array can accurately and responsively locate PAs across different types of free flaps in clinical cases, outperforming existing techniques. This biosensor array represents a promising platform for PA locating. The strategy of hydrogel interface design paves the way for the development of reusable flexible electronics in biomedical applications to avoid cross-infection and reduce device costs.",

Our 7.5-meter-long dugout, manufactured with edge-ground stone axes, was speedy and durable enough to cross this strait.

Here, we developed a unique ice-templating technique that constructs circumferential fibrous structures in hydrogels through slow freezing. Enhanced with rotary compression annealing, these hydrogels exhibit record-breaking features that cannot concurrently be achieved in conventional ice-templated and top-performing tough hydrogels, including high tensile properties, isotropic fatigue threshold of 2320 joules per square meter, ultracompressibility (8% strain after 500 cycles), and extraordinary burst pressure of 1.6 bar while maintaining 85 weight % water content.

We show that at the peak of acute inflammatory pain, superficial medullary dorsal horn projection neurons (PNs) that relay nociceptive information to the parabrachial nucleus reduce their intrinsic excitability and, consequently, action potential firing. When pain resolves, the excitability of these neurons returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current ( I A ) underlies the decrease in the excitability of medullary dorsal horn PNs in acute pain conditions. In chronic pain conditions, no changes of I A were observed, and medullary dorsal horn PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal a differential modulation of the excitability of medullary dorsal horn projection neurons in acute and chronic pain conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that, in acute pain conditions, tunes the output of the dorsal horn and, if lacking, could facilitate pain chronification.",

We propose a strategy to efficiently program microrobots into reconfigurable robust collectives to operate in various dynamic environments. Magnetic collectives are produced to achieve reconfigurable pattern transformation with considerable structural enhancement via well-designed gradient magnetic fields. The strong gradient magnetic field–induced connections among individual microrobots enable a record-breaking 700-fold output force enhancement, and 0.2-gram microrobot collectives generate Newton-level output forces. The proposed reconfigurable microrobot collectives provide a stable and promising approach to executing droplet, fluid, and solid manipulations via powerful output forces.

We found that, compared to control fish, predation-selected fish produced larger offspring and larger broods early in life. However, other life history parameters, such as interbrood interval and total number of offspring, showed no response. We also found that predation selected for smaller and lighter females and for shorter tails and gonopodia in males, with no effect on body coloration. Our results show that while several traits evolve fast under selection on adult predation, several “classic” predation-dependent traits seem unaffected by predation selection.

GI tumors from mice bearing heterozygous mutations in Stk11 (which encodes LKB1) display signatures of pathogenic IL-17–producing CD4 + T helper 17 (T H 17) cells. LKB1 constrains T cell inflammatory potential, as Stk11 /LKB1 haploinsufficiency promotes T cell differentiation toward pathogenic IL-17–producing T cell lineages (CD4 + T H 17 and CD8 + T c 17) in vitro and following intestinal infection. Mechanistically, aberrant CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)–dependent signaling drives pathogenic T H 17 cell programs downstream of LKB1 haploinsufficiency. Targeting this circuit via CRTC2 deletion or IL-17 blockade antagonizes GI polyp growth in mouse models of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

The NHEJ function of senataxin is redundant with the RECQL5 helicase and the HLTF translocase and is epistatic with ATM.

Using Higgs echo spectroscopy, we also uncover unconventional echo formation caused by inhomogeneous broadening and “soft” QP bands, which dynamically evolve under terahertz (THz) driving. Specifically, THz pulse pairs modulate the superconducting gap, imprinting coherence and forming a temporal “Higgs grating.” This grating produces echoes with distinctive characteristics: (i) echo rephasing spectral peaks at superconducting gap frequencies, (ii) asymmetric echo formation delays unlike those observed in atoms or semiconductors, and (iii) negative-time echo signals stemming from Higgs-QP anharmonic interactions.

Here, we demonstrate that, in mice, stressors shift the phase of the central pacemaker, housed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), through glutamatergic inputs from the anterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). Unlike light, which can phase delay or advance the central pacemaker, stressors consistently induce delays, effects attenuated by inhibiting aPVT neurons. Stressors robustly activate AVP-expressing neurons within the SCN and are associated with inhibition of VIP-expressing neurons, whereas light strongly activates VIP-expressing neurons with minimal effects on AVP-expressing neurons. Pairing stressors with light reveals distinct time-dependent interactions, enhancing phase delays at early night but abolishing phase advances at late night. Our findings uncover distinct SCN microcircuits that differentially encode light and stressors, providing insights into how environmental cues modulate circadian timing.",

Patterns in more inclusive taxonomic levels (e.g., families and orders) often become more complex because of interactions between biological traits and environmental conditions across different evolutionary lineages. Using supercomputing and artificial intelligence algorithms, we analyzed a high-resolution global dataset of fusuline foraminifera—the most diverse marine fossil group from the Carboniferous to the Permian (~340 to 252 million years ago)—at an unprecedented temporal resolution of &lt;45 thousand years. Our unbinned diversity reconstruction reveals unexpectedly simple diversity dynamics in this exceptionally well-preserved clade. We identify two (and likely a third) truncated exponential diversifications and four major diversity declines. During this interval, long-term cooling consistently promoted biodiversification, whereas warming events were closely linked to extinctions. These findings imply that the current rapid global warming, driven by anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, represents a critical threat to modern ecosystems.",

We directly probed the order parameters associated with the magnetic helices using resonant soft x-ray scattering and find two distinct nematic phases with complex spatiotemporal signatures. Using x-ray correlation spectroscopy, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on multiple disparate timescales. Our micromagnetic simulations and density functional theory calculations show that the fluctuations occur concomitantly with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of additional degrees of freedom.

This result is supported by evidence of temporal and geographical overlap between cetaceans and endothermic fish lineages in the fossil record, as well as correlations between cetacean diversification and the origin of endothermy in fishes. Phylogenetic comparative analyses identified correlations between endothermy, large body sizes, and specialized swimming modes while challenging diet specialization and depth range expansion hypotheses.

When combined, collagen networks rigidify via synergistic mechanical interactions and stiffen only with higher mechanical loads. However, how cells respond to the nonlinear elasticity of collagen in hybrid networks remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that when collagen rigidifies by the interpenetration of a second polymer, the amount of force that initially stiffens the network (onset of stiffening, σ c ) increases and is sufficient to stimulate an increase in intracellular tension. We investigated this effect by precisely controlling the nonlinear elasticity of collagen with the synthetic semiflexible polymer, polyisocyanopeptides. We find that small increases in σ c induce a biphasic response in cell-matrix interactions, influencing how cells migrate, proliferate, and generate contractile force. Our results suggest that cells adaptively respond to changes in the nonlinear mechanics of collagen, which may be a mechanistic behavior used during tissue homeostasis or when collagen rigidifies during pathological conditions.",

Simultaneously, uterine natural killer (uNK) cell proliferation results in the accumulation of immunotolerant subsets. Examination of endometrial biopsies from 924 women revealed that the recurrence risk of miscarriage closely aligns with the incidence of a weakened or stalled decidual reaction, more so than poor uNK cell expansion. Analysis of paired biopsies obtained in different cycles and modeling in assembloids intimated that prior miscarriages disrupt intercycle endometrial homeostasis and calibration of the decidual reaction. Our findings show that erosion of the decidual reaction following a miscarriage drives the recurrence risk irrespective of maternal age.",

We identified horizontal transfer of hdrA homologs and convergent evolution in carbon and energy metabolic genes as potential early steps in Methanovorans evolution. We also identified the erosion of genes required for methylotrophic methanogenesis along with horizontal acquisition of multiheme cytochromes and other loci uniquely associated with ANME. The assembly and comparative analysis of multiple Methanovorans genomes offers important functional context for understanding the niche-defining metabolic differences between methane-oxidizing ANME and their methanogen relatives.

Luminescence ages reveal a common sedimentary hiatus from ~26 to ~17 thousand years ago (ka), reflecting fluvial incision of &gt;35 meters triggered by sea level fall. Subsequent rapid aggradation occurred within these incised valleys during deglaciation between ~17 and ~9 ka and then slowed down afterward. A further synthesis on global continental rivers shows that sea level change affects large, low-gradient lowland fluvial systems farther upstream than generally recognized, with postperturbation geomorphologic equilibrium reachable in timescales comparable to the length of Quaternary glacial cycles.",

Existing methods to fix e-PTFE implants on host tissues mainly use invasive anchorage such as sutures, spiral tacks, or metal skeletons, which has limitations such as being time-consuming and causing leakage and tissue damage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a bioadhesive interface to realize the adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants. We integrate a hydrophilic and bioadhesive hydrogel layer on the hydrophobic and bioinert e-PTFE by designing a facile approach of freezing-induced micromechanical interlocking. The integration is robust enough as pulling hydrogel out of the interlocked pores on e-PTFE requires large energy dissipation. This bioadhesive interface enables instant (operating time &lt; 10 seconds) and secure (adhesion energy &gt;200 joules per square meter) adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants to wet tissue. The advantages for reducing inflammatory response, fibrogenesis, and the resultant postoperative adhesion are further demonstrated in a reconstructive surgery of an abdominal wall defect in rabbits.",

However, large size poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding nutrient transport: These constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations. Here, we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism—spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically generated density gradients—can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by ciliary actuation in extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a “biophysical scaffold” to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities before genetically encoded innovations.",

We show that morc-1 is overexpressed in csr-1 mutants and accumulates over CSR-1 licensed targets, coinciding with aberrant gain of H3K9me3, reduced H3K36me3, and transcriptional repression. Notably, loss of morc-1 fully rescues these chromatin defects and partially restores gene expression and fertility in csr-1 mutants. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MORC-1 in the wild-type germ line is sufficient to repress CSR-1 licensed targets and severely compromise fertility.

          "abstract": "Pension funds occupy a special position in the financial system: their long-term investment orientation and social outlook have led to calls for pension investment for purposes beyond the provision of retirement income. Scholars of financialization have questioned the possibilities to mobilize pension assets for other (e.g. social or environmental) goals by pointing to the constraining power of financial intermediaries. This article explores potential constraints on pension fund investments through an empirical case study of pension funds in the Netherlands. We show that pension funds’ position between members and financial intermediaries restricts their capacity to act as autonomous investors, albeit in asymmetric ways. Although pension fund boards are required to consider member preferences, knowledge deficits and organizational distance enable them to carve out discretionary space. However, due to regulatory requirements, their autonomy vis-à-vis financial intermediaries is more limited. We illustrate our findings with regards to pension funds’ adoption of sustainable investment.",
