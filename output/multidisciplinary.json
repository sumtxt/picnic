          "abstract": "The doughnut-shaped framework of social and planetary boundaries (the ‘Doughnut’) provides a concise visual assessment of progress towards the goal of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet 1–3 . Here we present a renewed Doughnut framework with a revised set of 35 indicators that monitor trends in social deprivation and ecological overshoot over the 2000–2022 period. Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall. These trends and inequalities reaffirm the case for overcoming the dependence of nations on perpetual GDP growth 4,5 and reorienting towards regenerative and distributive economic activity—within and between nations—that assigns priority to human needs and planetary integrity.",

          "abstract": "Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges in early childhood 1,2 , many autistic people are diagnosed later in life 3–5 . It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated ( r g = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism.",

          "abstract": "Microbial and viral co-evolution has created immunity mechanisms involving oligonucleotide signalling that share mechanistic features with human antiviral systems 1 . In these pathways, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling systems (CBASSs) and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response 2–4 . Here, in an unexpected inversion of this process, we show that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that represses a toxic effector. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing the spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TMβ. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TMβ-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful defence strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of the role of oligonucleotides in immunity.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria combat phage infection using antiphage systems and many systems generate nucleotide-derived second messengers upon infection that activate effector proteins to mediate immunity 1 . Phages respond with counter-defences that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE , wherein OptS is predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide products, including 2′,3′-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-c-di-AMP), which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ‘sponge’ that antagonizes second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.",

          "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is the first line of defence against antimicrobial agents and immunological attacks 1 . A key part of outer membrane biogenesis is the insertion of outer membrane proteins by the β-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM) 2–4 . Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae , a member of the Bacteroidota, a phylum that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum. For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota.",

          "abstract": "Stem cell-based human embryo models offer a unique opportunity for functional studies of the human-specific features of development. Here we genetically and epigenetically manipulate human blastoids, a 3D embryo model of the blastocyst 1 , to investigate the functional effect of HERVK LTR5Hs, a hominoid-specific endogenous retrovirus, on pre-implantation development. We uncover a pervasive cis -regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids. Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism. Despite mediating recruitment of TRIM28, at many of these promoters ZNF729 acts as a transcriptional activator. Together, our results illustrate how recently emerged transposable elements and genes can confer developmentally essential functions in humans.",

          "abstract": "Squamates (lizards and snakes) comprise almost 12,000 living species, with wide ecological diversity and a crown group that originated around 190 million years ago 1,2 . Conflict between morphology and molecular phylogenies indicates a complex pattern of anatomical transformations during early squamate evolution, which remains poorly understood owing to the scarcity of early fossil taxa 1,3 . Here we present Breugnathair elgolensis gen. et sp. nov., based on a new skeleton from the Middle Jurassic epoch (167 million years ago) of Scotland, which is among the oldest relatively complete fossil squamates. Breugnathair is placed in a new family, Parviraptoridae, an enigmatic group with potential importance for snake origins, that was previously known from very incomplete remains. It displays a mosaic of anatomical traits that is not present in living groups, with head and body proportions similar to varanids (monitor lizards) and snake-like features of the teeth and jaws, alongside primitive traits shared with early-diverging groups such as gekkotans. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple datasets return conflicting results, with parviraptorids either as early toxicoferans (and potentially stem snakes) or as stem squamates that convergently evolved snake-like dental and mandibular traits related to feeding. These findings indicate high levels of homoplasy and experimentation during the initial radiation of squamates and highlight the potential importance of convergent morphological transformations during deep evolutionary divergences.",

          "abstract": "Effectively addressing societal challenges often requires unrelated individuals to reduce conflict and successfully coordinate actions. The cultural logic of ‘honour’ is frequently studied in relation to conflict, but its role in competition and cooperation remains underexplored. The current study investigates how perceived normative and personally endorsed honour values predict competition and cooperation behaviours. In an online experiment testing preregistered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

          "abstract": "Witnessing social distress of others evokes social pain empathy, a complex process engaging cognitive, affective, and motivational dimensions. Although hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social function, their respective contributions to the process of social pain empathy have not been systematically characterized. To address this, we employed a multimethod approach, combining naturalistic fMRI, functional decoding, gene expression analysis, and pharmacological modulation using intranasal administration of OXT (24 IU) or AVP (20 IU) in a cohort of 163 participants. Our findings indicated that both OXT and AVP significantly enhanced pain empathy compared to placebo, with overlapping yet distinct neurofunctional and genetic modulation patterns. Specially, both neuropeptides engaged a shared perception-cognition-emotion network, including frontal regions, the insula, superior temporal sulcus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Crucially, they exhibited divergent mechanistic profiles: OXT preferentially influenced resting-state connectivity and perceptional-visual processing areas, while AVP exerted stronger modulation on perceptional-execution circuits. These differential effects aligned with their unique receptor expression patterns and interactions with distinct genetic systems. By delineating how OXT and AVP shape the multidimensional nature of social pain empathy, our findings provide a neurobiological framework for understanding these processes and offer potential pathways for targeted interventions in social cognition disorders.",

          "abstract": "Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena. Yet in practice, prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, and even as prizes proliferate, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic’s historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners’ papers become more innovative than their matched peers. This difference widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to nonprizewinners, prizewinners’ collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The findings’ implications for innovation in science and the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.",

Recognizing nature’s diverse values in decisions is a fundamental lever for sustainability transformation. While economic valuation of nature has a long history, it has struggled to recognize the full suite of nature’s values, particularly the broad, relational, intrinsic, and shared values reflecting the complexity of human–nature relationships. We explore opportunities to expand the consideration of values within the economics of biodiversity by reviewing conventional and heterodox economic approaches. We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames. Our perspective transcends the dominant economic framing of nature as a passive, largely substitutable asset, to also consider nature as place, self, and harboring agency. This helps to overcome the limitations of conventional economic assumptions, better reflects peoples’ lived experiences, and supports transformations toward more just and sustainable futures.",

          "authors": "Shijia Peng, Aaron M. Ellison, Charles C. Davis",
          "abstract": "Climate change is altering the timing of species’ life-cycle events (i.e., phenology), but the rates of phenological shifts vary across taxa. These mismatches in phenological response may disrupt interactions between interdependent species, such as plants and their pollinators, which may lead to reduced plant reproduction via pollen limitation and thus contribute to secondary extinction risks for plants. However, secondary extinction risk is rarely assessed under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we used ca. 15,000 crowdsourced specimen records of Viola species and their solitary bee pollinators, spanning 120 y across the eastern United States, and integrated climate data, phenological information, and species distribution models to quantify the risk of secondary plant extinction associated with phenological mismatch with their bee pollinators. We further examined geographical patterns in secondary extinction risk for plants and explored how their interactions between plants and generalist versus specialist pollinators influence such risk. Secondary local extinction risk of Viola spp. increases with latitude, indicating that future climate change will pose a greater threat to plant–bee pollinator networks at northern latitudes. Additionally, the sensitivity of secondary local extinction risk to phenological mismatch with both generalist and specialist bee pollinators varies by latitude, with specialist bees showing a sharper decline at higher latitudes. Our findings demonstrate that existing conservation priorities based solely on primary extinction risk directly caused by climate change may be insufficient to support self-sustaining populations of plants. Thus, incorporating secondary extinction risk resulting from ecological mismatches between plants and pollinators into future global conservation frameworks should be carefully considered.",

          "abstract": "Arguably, the most fundamental question in population ecology is what drives patterns in the abundance of populations? Small rodents exhibiting regular multiannual cycles in abundance have long been a test bed for addressing this question. The prevailing orthodoxy, the predation hypothesis, contends that nonmigratory, specialist predators are necessary, and specialist and generalist predators, combined, are both necessary and sufficient, for causing population cycles. Thus, variations in survival, from predation, are the key drivers of the cycles. However, this, and other competing theories, have hitherto lacked supportive demographic evidence and hence a solid evidential foundation. Here, we provide such evidence, analyzing 10 y of monthly data from a cyclic field vole population. We find, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, that recruitment, not survival, varied substantially from phase to phase in the cycles, made the major contribution to variations in population growth rate, and had cycle-phase-specific negative delayed density dependence. These results, their consistency with what is known from other systems, and the weak demographic foundations of the predation hypothesis, together suggest recruitment, specifically breeding-season length, not predation, as the cycles’ driving force. They therefore suggest that re-evaluation of the importance of the various determinants of population abundances, more generally, may be necessary.",

          "abstract": "Modularity among traits is thought to drive morphological evolution and diversification, with more modular species often showing greater morphological disparity and faster evolutionary rates. However, recent studies suggest this pattern is not universal, as higher integration can sometimes be linked to faster rates of evolution. In adaptive radiation, modularity likely facilitates morphological divergence, but its specific role in trait diversification within these events remains uncertain. Antarctic icefishes (Perciformes: Notothenioidei) have undergone adaptive radiation in the frigid Southern Ocean, yet the role of modularity in their craniofacial evolution remains poorly understood. Emerging from a common ancestor 22 Mya, these fishes developed unique morpho-physiological adaptations, such as antifreeze glycoproteins, that contributed to their evolutionary success, but the contribution of cranial modularity to their diversification is still unexplored. Here, we analyze skull shape across 172 perciform species using micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to investigate the tempo and mode of skull evolution in 80 notothenioids versus 92 perciform relatives. Notothenioids exhibit considerable cranial shape diversity, with skull shapes ranging from short to long faces. Fast rates of skull shape evolution occurred in smaller subclades following the emergence of cranial elongation, a derived trait within notothenioids. They also exhibit elevated evolutionary modularity relative to their perciform relatives, with reduced covariation among skeletal elements over time, likely corresponding with Miocene cooling events and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We propose that greater phenotypic modularity in notothenioid skulls represents a pivotal innovation, facilitating their evolutionary response to new ecological opportunities in the Antarctic.",

The MEPAN mouse recapitulates the major hallmarks of MEPAN, including a movement disorder, optic neuropathy, defects in protein lipoylation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the brain. MECR catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), and the mechanism by which loss of mtFASII leads to neurological disease is unknown. LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of Mecr mutant cerebella identified loss of subunits of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and subunits of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) complex. Native gels revealed altered OXPHOS complex and supercomplex formation and changes in binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to mitochondrial complexes. These results demonstrate that MECR plays a key role in the acylation of ACP which is necessary for ACP-LYRM-mediated supercomplex modulation and ISC biogenesis and suggest unique pathways for therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Diverse factors, including environmental features and cognitive processes, can drive animals’ movements and space use, with far-reaching implications. For example, repeated use of individual-level travel routeways (directionally constrained but imperfectly aligned routes), which results in spatial concentration of activity, can shape encounter-based processes including predation, mate finding, and disease transmission. However, how much variation in routeway usage exists across species remains unknown. By analyzing GPS movement tracks for 1,239 range-resident mammalian carnivores—representing 16 canid and 18 felid species from six continents—we found strong evidence of a clade-level difference in species’ reliance on repeatedly used travel routeways. Across the global dataset, tracked canids had a 15% (±7 CI) greater density of routeways within their home ranges than did felids, rising to 33% (±16 CI) greater in landscapes shared with tracked felids. Moreover, comparisons within species across landscapes revealed broadly similar home range routeway densities despite habitat differences. On average, canids also reused their travel routeways more intensively than did felids, with hunting strategies and spatial contexts also contributing to the intensity of routeway usage. Collectively, our results suggest that key aspects of carnivore routeway-usage have an evolutionary component. Striking interspecific and clade-level differences in carnivores’ reliance on reused travel routeways within home ranges identify important ways in which the movement patterns of real-world predators depart from classical assumptions of predator-prey theory. Because such departures can drive key aspects of human-wildlife interactions and other encounter-based processes, continued investigations of the relationships between movement mechanisms and space use are critical.",

          "abstract": "Trigger waves, self-regenerating fronts of biochemical activity that spread without losing speed or amplitude, are widespread in cell signaling. Apoptosis is one example of a process that propagates through the cytoplasm via trigger waves. Curiously, in some contexts, like synaptic pruning, apoptotic caspase activation is confined to specific subcellular regions. We hypothesized that at junctions between a thin cytoplasmic extension, like a dendritic spine, and a thicker one, like a dendrite, trigger wave propagation may be blocked even though diffusion is not, as a result of the general properties of trigger waves and bistable systems. This hypothesis was explored theoretically through modeling studies and dimensional arguments, which confirmed that trigger wave compartmentalization was possible and that the critical channel width required for compartmentalization was likely to be biologically relevant. These predictions were then tested experimentally with undiluted Xenopus egg extracts that were induced to undergo apoptosis. We found that channels that are less than a few microns in diameter are small enough to compartmentalize apoptosis, and that the critical width is inversely proportional to trigger wave speed. Thus, cellular projections and tubules can allow for the compartmentalization of biochemical states within a spatially continuous cytoplasm, a fundamental yet previously overlooked mechanism for controlling biochemical signaling and cellular functions.",

Wrapping NPs in cell-derived membranes has shown promise in improving targeted delivery, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Protein corona (PC) formation on NPs can significantly alter their biological identity to influence biodistribution, making its characterization on membrane-wrapped NPs (MWNPs) and unwrapped NPs crucial. In this study, we compared MWNPs incorporating membranes derived from megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 cells, which can accumulate in bone marrow (BM) and preferentially bind hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with unwrapped NPs. We investigated differences in PC composition, macrophage uptake, target cell uptake, and biodistribution in wild type (WT) mice and knockout mice that have low or absent expression of different opsonin proteins. In vitro, MWNPs with a PC exhibited increased target cell uptake and decreased macrophage uptake compared to unwrapped NPs with a PC. Proteomics revealed apolipoprotein B as the dominant opsonin on both NP types after incubation in mouse, bovine, or human serum, with other proteins like complement, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins also being present. Biodistribution studies indicated a complex interplay between the PC and targeting/clearance, where complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G adsorption on MWNPs led to macrophage clearance but also enabled HSPC targeting. Meanwhile, apolipoprotein E adsorption facilitated hepatocyte clearance but reduced immune cell uptake in the liver. Future research on PCs could determine whether these mechanisms are generalizable to other types of MWNPs, potentially revealing strategies to enhance their effectiveness as delivery systems.",

However, the potential of aGPCRs as targets for biologic therapeutics has not been extensively explored. CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells. We generated a panel of synthetic human antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of CD97, from which we identified an antibody that was efficiently internalized. This antibody binds to all isoforms of human CD97 but not to its close homolog, EMR2. Structure determination by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy revealed that this antibody targets the CD97 GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, whose presence is conserved in aGPCRs, through an unconventional binding mode where it extensively utilizes the light chain framework for antigen recognition. Screening of conjugation methods and payloads resulted in a stable ADC that effectively killed AML and GBM cell lines, as well as patient-derived GBM stem cells, with minimal cytotoxicity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting CD97, as well as the aGPCR GAIN domain in general, and uncovers a previously unrecognized surface that an antibody can utilize for antigen recognition.",

We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution.

          "authors": "Shumpei Morita, Jay T. Groves",
          "abstract": "T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen among vastly outnumbering noncognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen–TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multithread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multithread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.",

Hippocampal area CA2, which processes social memory, also makes direct connections to CA1. However, the function of these connections is unknown. To test whether CA2-CA1 connections might facilitate the interaction of social and episodic memories, we used models of behaving mice and in vitro electrophysiology that allow prior activation of CA2 by either novel social interaction or electrical stimulation before inhibitory avoidance training or induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1. We show that social novelty promotes consolidation of CA1-associated memory, which was blocked by the selective chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting CA2 neurons. In both cases, CA2 priming was time-dependent, involved direct CA2-CA1 connections, increased expression of plasticity protein protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), and promoted associativity via synaptic tagging and capture. Taken together, CA2-CA1 connections can significantly impact CA1 plasticity and memory consolidation. The inclusion of CA2 into hippocampal circuitry and function broadens the role of the hippocampus as an integrative memory hub.",

Using multiple cell types including the human SupT1 T cell line and purified CD4 + T cells, we demonstrate that PLSCR1 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 with diverse tropisms and subtypes, as well as HIV-2 and SIV. Mechanistically, we find that PLSCR1 blocks viral entry and cell-to-cell transmission, in part by restricting HIV-1 virion–cell and cell–cell fusion without affecting CD4 or CXCR4 expression or virus binding to the cell surface.

Even more rare are empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to keep pace with environmental change. Here, we explore these connections by conducting an integrative study on the breeding range of the yellow warbler ( Setophaga petechia ). Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we first identify loci associated with variation in bill morphology and individual quality. We then employ gene–environment association (GEA) analyses and find that precipitation is a key environmental driver of putative selection on bill shape. Finally, we test whether contemporary individuals whose bill shapes deviate from the historical relationship with precipitation experience increased stress (measured by telomere length) as a result of maladaptation. We also use historical DNA to test whether local populations have shifted their ranges over the past century, confirming that the observed changes are not due to range shifts. Our results align with predictions from GWAS and GEA analyses, indicating that birds with shallower bills in increasingly arid regions suffer higher stress (i.e., shorter telomeres) because of maladaptation. Overall, this study links genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data with stress biomarkers to improve understanding of the process of local adaptation and the consequence of failing to keep pace with changing climate conditions.",

          "abstract": "One of the reproductive barriers between diverging populations during formation of a new species is the sterility of their hybrids. The Prdm9- driven hybrid male sterility of Mus musculus musculus × Mus musculus domesticus hybrids depends on the interaction between PRDM9, a histone methyltransferase that determines the positions of meiotic recombination hotspots, and an as yet unknown X-linked genetic factor within the Hybrid sterility X2 ( Hstx2 ) locus. Here, we report that the Mir465 microRNA (miRNA) gene cluster is the predicted Hstx2 hybrid sterility factor. We show that removal of the Mir465 genes restores the fertility of sterile hybrids and improves meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Mir465 knockout also restores spermatogenesis in sterile chromosomal translocation carriers, demonstrating that Mir465 acts as a meiotic checkpoint that can be activated independently of Prdm9 intersubspecific incompatibility. Furthermore, the Mir465 knockout increases the global recombination rate in hybrids and in parental Mus m. domesticus mice. This demonstrates that Mir465 is responsible for the phenotypes of the two overlapping genetic loci, the Hstx2 engaged in fertility of hybrids and the Meiotic recombination 1 ( Meir1 ) controlling the recombination rate. The finding of enlarged Mir465 clusters in all European Mus m. musculus samples tested and the identification of differentially expressed targets suggest that the reproductive barrier between the two subspecies is sensitive to copy number variation of Mir465 genes. Together, the underdominant interaction between Prdm9 and Mir465 provides a rare example of Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility in hybrids of closely related species, making it accessible for further analysis at the molecular level.",

High-speed optical imaging reveals brief flashes between charged bubbles, arising from strong electric fields at curved gas–liquid interfaces.

          "abstract": "Neuroscience has long relied on macaque studies to infer human brain function, yet identifying functionally corresponding brain regions across species and measurement modalities remains a fundamental challenge. This is especially true for the higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often nonhomologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a long-standing ambiguity by supporting a correspondence between macaque ML and human FFA and between AL and more anterior temporal cortex in humans. This result is consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.",

          "abstract": "One of the most fascinating mysteries in the field of origins of life concerns the driving force that led to the selection of today’s 20 universal L -alpha amino acids in biology. An essential aspect of life’s emergence involves the formation of compartments, which offer encapsulation for target molecules and provide protection from hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Thus, polymers capable of assembly may have had a chemical evolutionary advantage over polymers that lacked this ability. We postulated that primordial peptide assembly could be one of the driving forces that led to the chemical selection of alpha amino acids in life today. To test this hypothesis, we generated depsipeptides, oligomers composed of ester bonds and peptide bonds that form readily under mild drying conditions, as model prebiotic peptides. However, it is unknown whether depsipeptides form assemblies in an aqueous environment similarly to peptides and proteins. To test the hypothesis that depsipeptides with alpha backbones will form assemblies more readily than beta backbones, we synthesized depsipeptides using a matrix of eight alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and six alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids. The reaction products were analyzed by microscopy and a physical stability analyzer to study assembly formation as well as various analytical techniques for chemical analysis. Our results demonstrate assembly formation in depsipeptide systems containing hydrophobic hydroxy acids and indicate that depsipeptide assemblies containing alpha hydroxy acid backbones are significantly more stable than beta analogs. Overall, our results offer an assembly-driven mode of selection for the alpha backbone in present-day biology.",

To promote de novo production of BTEX from renewable feedstocks, we developed a chemobiological platform that integrates microbial biosynthesis with chemical deoxygenation. Four metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed to produce one of four oxygenated precursors of BTEX—phenol, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, or 2,5-xylenol—from glucose or glycerol. After in situ two-phase extractive fermentation of the individual engineered strains using isopropyl myristate (IPM) as the organic solvent, the organic phase containing one of the oxygenated precursors was separated from the aqueous phase and subjected to distinct chemical deoxygenation reactions to reduce the precursor to the corresponding BTEX compound. This modular approach, based on the compatible organic solvent, streamlines biotransformation and consecutive chemical derivatization, providing a practical and viable route to sustainable BTEX production. The platform is extensible and provides a generalizable framework for integrating biosynthesis with chemical deoxygenation in hybrid bioprocessing.",

Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this, we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show that i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality. Overall, our findings illustrate the utility of the G. mellonella model system in conjunction with established in vivo models in studying infectious disease progression and treatment.",

The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wild-type and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to nonclustering strains and outcompete nonclustering strains in replication assays exhibited by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and an HBGA nonbinding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in postattachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and nonclustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.",

Recycling REEs from industrial waste provides a sustainable alternative to mining, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impacts. The mainstay approaches for REE recovery, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods, can be inefficient, consuming high energy and generating large aqueous and acid waste streams. Here, we introduce flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl 2 ) as an efficient method for REE separation and recovery by capitalizing on the free energies of formation (ΔG form ) of the metal chlorides and the boiling points of those metal chlorides. FJH-Cl 2 enables high-purity (&gt;90%) and high-yield (&gt;90%) REE recovery from waste magnets in a single step. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis show that this process reduces the number of steps by 3× while reducing energy consumption by 87%, greenhouse gas emissions by 84%, and operating costs by 54% while eliminating water and acid use by 100% compared to traditional methods.

          "abstract": "Dark Stars (DSs), i.e., early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter (DM), could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift DM halos. In 2023, three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric DS candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a follow-up analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a DS interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic DS candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, with the former being the second most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify, in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, a tentative feature ( S / N ∼ 2 ) indicative of the smoking gun signature of DSs: the He II λ 1640 absorption line. In view of ALMA’s recent identification of a probable O III nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated DS is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations, it would imply a DS embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of DSs, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.",

By leveraging single-cell variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) sequencing, this study identified 25 porcine antibodies to the HA stem, including two cross-group bnAbs, 14-8 and 15-1, from vaccinated specific-pathogen-free pigs and unvaccinated domestic pigs. Cryogenic electron microscopy analysis showed that 14-8 targeted the well-characterized central stem epitope, whereas 15-1 bound to a linear epitope spanning the HA1/HA2 junction. Additionally, while some porcine and human bnAbs targeted the central stem epitope via convergent molecular signatures, our results revealed a pig-specific recurring binding motif.

To further expand our understanding of structure–function relationships in this complex multiphase material system and provide a roadmap for transitioning this technology from a simple proof-of-concept to a viable large-scale energy storage alternative, we report insights into the nanoscale connectivity of the electrode’s conductive carbon network, explore different electrolyte compositions and material integration strategies, and highlight opportunities for device scaling. Through the use of FIB-SEM tomography, the electrode’s percolating fractal-like nano-carbon black network has been visualized at the nanoscale, providing insights into the theoretical energy storage capacity of this material. To reduce the required times for the production of functional electrodes, we also present a cast-in electrolyte approach, where centimeter-thick electrodes could be produced without the need for postcuring steps. In these prototypes, device performance scales linearly with electrode thickness and cell count, and a simple analytical model was developed to explain these scaling phenomena. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative ionic and organic electrolytes further contribute to improved electrochemical behavior, with the fabricated designs ultimately achieving a 10-fold increase in supercapacitor energy density compared to previous designs. Finally, we were able to fabricate a 12 V, 50 F supercapacitor module and a 9 V arch prototype that integrate energy storage into load-bearing architectural elements.

Here, we established diverse preclinical tumor models resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and focused on histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as it exhibited more pronounced alterations compared to other acylations. Next, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 as a key regulator responsible for the resistance-associated decrease in crotonylation levels. Furthermore, integrated crotonylomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling, supplemented by gene manipulation studies, revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance resulted from transcriptional suppression of HNF1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were regulated by reduced histone H3 lysine 56 crotonylation. Importantly, through pharmacological screening, we identified a histone decrotonylase inhibitor that enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity by activating epigenetic reprogramming through the selective upregulation of histone Kcr levels across multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism driven by crotonylation that contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, highlighting the potential of modulating crotonylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.",

Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green color. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris , develop as woven fibrillar structures, in contrast to the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibers, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue coloration. Our findings not only introduce a variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.",

It can have a large impact on host–parasite interactions and investigating this effect is vital both for understanding current parasite distribution and epidemiology, and predicting how this will change in the future. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether temperature and precipitation have an overall effect on parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals. This is a phylogenetically controlled quantitative synthesis to assess parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals across contrasting temperatures and precipitation. We found large variation in the effect of temperature on parasite prevalence, precipitation on parasite prevalence, and temperature on infection intensity. This provides robust quantitative evidence against the controversial “warmer sicker world” hypothesis. There was no effect of climate on parasitism, irrespective of whether the parasite was an endoparasite or ectoparasite, or across different parasite lifecycles. Although some host and parasite taxa were understudied, we found no consistent taxonomic patterns. Importantly, we revealed large gaps in the literature, including the relationship between humidity, prevalence, and infection intensity. Ectoparasites and reptile hosts were also very underrepresented, and deserve further study. Focusing future research on these gaps will help to confirm whether certain types of host–parasite interactions are more or less sensitive to changes in climate, with implications for conservation.",

          "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, is characterized by sickle erythrocytes that are prone to hemolysis, leading to anemia and vaso-occlusion crises. In sickle erythrocytes, hemoglobin aggregation is followed by altered cation permeability and subsequent dehydration. Interventions that restore cation permeability can decrease hemolysis and ameliorate the symptoms associated with SCD. PIEZO1 is a nonselective mechanosensitive cation channel that regulates erythrocyte volume. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO1 cause hemolytic anemia by increasing cation permeability, leading to erythrocyte dehydration in humans and mice. Although PIEZO1 plays a key role in erythrocyte homeostasis, its role in SCD remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the function of the PIEZO1 channel is upregulated in sickle erythrocytes of humans and mice, and this enhancement can be restored through a dietary intervention. We found that PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes resembles that of the GOF mutation causing hemolytic anemia. A diet enriched in the ω -3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid decreases PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes, attenuates hemolysis, and reduces hypoxia-induced sickling. Furthermore, EPA reduces inflammatory markers. We propose that PIEZO1 contributes to the increase in nonselective cationic conductance (i.e., Psickle), which leads to dehydration downstream of hemoglobin polymerization. Our results suggest that reducing PIEZO1 function represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reestablishing normal cation permeability in SCD.",

Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that BVRA physically and genetically interacts with nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor-like 2 (NRF2), a major transcriptional regulator of cellular redox signaling. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that BVRA and NRF2 coordinate the expression of antioxidant genes, many of which are typically dysregulated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.

We previously developed a bispecific antibody (bsAb), iMab/D5_AR, directed toward both the gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR) that is exposed within the HIV-1 PHI and toward CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells. CD4-binding led to prepositioning of the bsAb at the site of viral fusion, enhancing its neutralization potency and achieving 95% breadth (IC80 &lt; 5 μg/mL) against a panel of 119 pseudotyped, multiclade HIV-1 viruses. In the current study, we engineered a bsAb against NHR that also targets CCR5, one of two HIV-1 coreceptors on T cells. This optimized bsAb design further improves neutralization potency and achieves 100% neutralization breadth against the 119-member pseudotyped virus panel, including those resistant to CD4-binding iMab/D5_AR. Considering that nearly all initial HIV-1 infections occur via CCR5-tropic viruses, we expect our redesigned bsAb targeting CCR5 to be an effective prophylactic agent. These findings further support the rationale for pursuing the NHR as a therapeutic target for HIV-1 and lay the groundwork for a new class of engineered broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

Coupling this assay with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, we mapped distinct cargo profiles for AP-1 (which buds from the TGN and ARF1-positive endosomes) and AP-4, identifying the 45 kDa calcium-binding protein (CAB45) as an AP-1-dependent cargo and the Type-1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) as an AP-4-dependent cargo.

The separation between the viscous scale (the Kolmogorov scale) and the molecular mean free path ostensibly justifies a macroscopic description of reactive turbulence via the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. However, here we use molecular-level simulations to demonstrate that exothermic bimolecular reactions can cause the NS description of turbulence to break down in the near-continuum regime. Sufficiently energetic heat-releasing reactive collisions strongly distort the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution function, modifying not only the macroscopic chemical rate law but the kinetic-energy-transfer processes as well. This translational nonequilibrium ultimately introduces significant departures from the NS description in the kinetic energy spectra at scales orders of magnitude larger than both the molecular mean free path and the Kolmogorov length scale. These departures prove substantial enough to meaningfully alter integrated quantities, including the overall turbulence kinetic energy itself.",

          "abstract": "With the learning from living protein polymerization in nature, achieving living/controlled supramolecular assembly of biopolymers such as proteins in vitro is a longstanding challenge for material design. Herein, we provide a thiol-regulated interfacial protein aggregation (TRIPA) for unfolded protein systems with typical living polymerization features. By triggering globule proteins into the unfolded state through a reversible exchange reaction of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl agents (R-SH), protein monomers are partially unfolded and assembled at the air–water/solid–water interface (AWI/SWI) through the entropy-driven adsorption and conformation transition. The process could be well repeated over time to form a two-dimensional (2D) nanofilm at the interface by following a pathway of monomer-oligomer-2D assembly. Similar to living polymerization, the film thickness exhibited a linear increase with the assembly conversion ratio of the monomers. With the stepwise addition of native protein into the reaction system, the thickness periodically increased in a linear manner. Such living/controlled supramolecular polymerization (LCSP) of protein at the interface leads to the synthesis of a nanofilm with well-defined flat morphology, ultrahigh modulus, and nano- to macroscale controlled thickness. The resultant protein nanofilm could then attach onto a variety of flexible and rigid material surfaces to produce a stable structural color coating. Compelling evidence in the present work thus underlines a demonstration of LCSP of biopolymers in vitro. It may hold a solid impact by opening a window for living/controlled polymerization of versatile biospecies such as proteins, saccharides, nucleic acids, and cells.",

In contrast, only D. kwazulunatalensis exhibits striking signs of genomic reconfiguration in the diatom nucleus: intron insertions, increased guanine (G) and cytosine (C) content, and growing nucleotide similarity to host transcripts. These shifts suggest an incipient nucleomorph-like transformation. Metabolically, only D. kwazulunatalensis expresses a complete hexose phosphate export pathway, suggesting deeper metabolic integration, while both species retain simpler carbohydrate transport routes. Additionally, we propose that diatom karyokinesis might be controlled by a dual mechanism via suppression of key transcription factors at the G1-S checkpoint and nitrate availability. Together, our findings reveal a continuum of plastid integration degrees, from temporary organelle theft to genomic accommodation and metabolic codependence. Dinotoms thus serve not only as evolutionary artifacts but as living laboratories, illuminating how kleptoplastids inch toward permanence.",

          "abstract": "Granular materials under loading exhibit intermittent avalanches of varying sizes prior to full yielding, a hallmark of natural failure phenomena such as landslides and earthquakes. While continuum models for postyield plastic flow are well established, a unified framework connecting preyield avalanche dynamics to bulk rheology remains lacking. Here, we introduce a birefringent double-shear experiment that enables sustained probing of avalanche statistics and quasistatic flow behavior near the yielding transition. We find that the avalanche regime exhibits rate-weakening behavior, while the plastic regime is rate-independent, resulting in dual rheology under identical local shear rates and indicating hysteresis and mechanical instability. Within a stress-activated framework, we identify the mean normalized stress drop, a measure for mesoscale avalanche size, as a key field variable that bridges the two regimes. Incorporating this variable, we formulate a unified constitutive model that captures the entire yielding transition. These findings establish mesoscale avalanche evolution as a central mechanism underlying granular yielding rheology.",

          "abstract": "Site-specific DNA binding by proteins is critical for regulating transcriptional activity and cell fate decision. However, identifying proteins bound to specific genomic regions (e.g., promoter or enhancer regions) remains challenging. To address this, we developed a chemical epigenetic tool, named Site-specific noncanonical amino acid-mediated capture of protein (SCOPE), incorporating a photo-crosslinking amino acid into a nuclease-deficient dCas9 mutant. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying SCOPE enable the capture of proteins bound to, in theory, any genomic location, facilitating the study of the cell context–dependent DNA–protein interactions. Using SCOPE, we identified the OCT4/SOX2/CARHSP1 complex binding to the NANOG promoter to maintain pluripotency in hPSCs. During ectoderm differentiation, ZIC2 acts as a competitive inhibitor, binding the same promoter region to downregulate NANOG expression and promote differentiation. Additionally, SCOPE identified that ZNF8 binds to the distal regulatory region of OCT4 to maintain naïve pluripotency. In summary, SCOPE provides a robust system for uncovering cell context–dependent, site-specific genome regulators, offering valuable insights into gene regulation networks driving cell fate transitions.",

The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.",

          "abstract": "Putative metazoan body fossils from the Precambrian are curiously lacking morphological characteristics that link them unambiguously to extant animal phyla, including sponges. Chemical fossils such as the rare C 30 hydrocarbons 24- iso -propylcholestane (24- i pc) and 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), however, have been proposed as evidence for the Neoproterozoic emergence of the Demospongiae (Porifera) due to their prevalence in rocks of this age and the occurrence of their sterol precursors in contemporary demosponges. However, there are alternative hypotheses which posit that diagenetic alteration products of algal sterols, or those from Rhizaria or other protists, account for the enigmatic steroid distributions observed in these ancient sedimentary rocks. Here, we report additional support for the Neoproterozoic rise of demosponges through the chemical characterization of two previously unrecognized C 31 hydrocarbons—24- n -butylcholestane (24- n bc) and 24- sec -butylcholestane (24- sec bc). Precursor C 31 sterols from contemporary demosponges, as well as a suite of synthesized C 31 sterol standards were reduced to their sterane counterparts. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and collisionally activated dissociation mass spectra confirmed the presence of 24- n bc and 24- sec bc in well-preserved early Ediacaran rocks, and the coelution of these compounds with synthetic standards enhances the robustness of these findings. Co-occurrence of abundant 24- i pc and 24- sec bc was found for numerous Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rock/oil samples, closely mimicking the abundance patterns and high structural selectivity of major C 30 and C 31 sterols detected in numerous species of modern demosponges. These findings support the hypothesized first emergence of sponges during the Neoproterozoic Era.",

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to assemble repressive chromatin. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3 deposition is regulated by the H3K36 methyltransferase ASH1 and components of constitutive heterochromatin including the H3K9me3-binding protein HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1). Hypoacetylated histones are a defining feature of both constitutive heterochromatin and PcG-repressed chromatin, but how histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to normal H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression within PcG-repressed chromatin is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen to identify HDACs required for repression of PRC2-methylated genes. In the absence of HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1 (HDA-1), PRC2-methylated genes were activated and H3K27me3 was depleted from typical PRC2-targeted regions. At constitutive heterochromatin, HDA-1 deficient cells displayed reduced H3K9me3, hyperacetylation, and aberrant enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. CHROMODOMAIN PROTEIN-2 (CDP-2) is required to target HDA-1 to constitutive heterochromatin and is also required for normal H3K27me3 patterns. Patterns of aberrant H3K27me3 were distinct in isogenic ∆ hda-1 strains, suggesting that loss of HDA-1 causes stochastic or progressive epigenome dysfunction. To test this, we constructed a new Δhda-1 strain and performed a laboratory “aging” experiment. Deletion of hda-1 led to progressive epigenome decay over hundreds of nuclear divisions. Together, our data indicate that HDA-1 is a critical regulator of epigenome stability in N. crassa.",

          "abstract": "Hyperuniformity and giant number fluctuations represent opposite ends in a spectrum of statistical correlations found in physical systems outside of thermal equilibrium. Dynamic phase transitions exhibit critical points that are hyperuniform, while anomalously large fluctuations are often quoted as a hallmark of active matter. Here, we show that the apparently disordered state of active nematic defects exhibits suppression of fluctuations on scales as large as the system size, reminiscent of what is seen for ordered lattices. Modeling the nematic defects in terms of continuum densities, we show that their distribution becomes asymptotically hyperuniform in the limit where their proliferation is solely driven by activity, rather than by thermal fluctuations. When both effects are at play, the resultant hyperuniform structure is limited to a finite range of length scales, ℓ &lt; ℓ × , with ℓ × → ∞ as thermal unbinding is suppressed. The system of active nematic defects can therefore be said to possess hidden order across scales provided ℓ is comparable to the system size. This organization is most pronounced when considering the subpopulation of either the positive or the negative defects, illustrating lack of multihyperuniformity. Our experimental findings are supported by hydrodynamic theory and agent-based simulations, which further allow elucidating the role of both creation/annihilation of defect pairs and of their mutual repulsion and attraction in achieving hyperuniformity.",

          "abstract": "The homeostatic link between the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitophagy plays a significant role in how cells respond to various physiological and pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia–reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Changes in bacterial colony morphology are common during chronic human infections and are thought to provide a survival advantage. In the human pathogen Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB), a unidirectional transition from a smooth (MAB S ) to rough (MAB R ) morphotype frequently occurs during chronic infection. This transition has profound clinical implications, as MAB R induces a heightened proinflammatory response, contributing to increased morbidity. To better understand this phenomenon, we used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes essential for the survival of MAB S and MAB R . Our analysis revealed distinct genetic requirements for growth in vitro, including several genes involved in responding to environmental stresses. Notably, some of these uniquely essential genes are therapeutic targets in mycobacteria. In a murine infection model, the divergence in essential gene profiles between MAB S and MAB R was even more pronounced, driven partly by the differing host immune responses elicited by each morphotype. These findings demonstrate that the transition from a smooth to rough morphotype not only impacts MAB’s survival strategies but also highlights the importance of considering morphotype-specific genetic and functional adaptations when developing therapeutic approaches. Our work underscores the critical need to incorporate morphotype conversion into the prioritization of drug targets, as targeting morphotype-specific vulnerabilities could improve treatment outcomes for infections caused by this pathogen.",

          "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing is kinetically coupled to transcription as shown by the widespread effects of transcription speed on alternative splicing (AS) outcomes. The molecular basis for such kinetic coupling is incompletely understood, but one potential mechanism is through elongation rate–dependent alternative folding pathways of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). To search for RNA structures in nascent pre-mRNA, we modified Sequencing of Psoralen Crosslinked, Ligated And Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) [J. G. Ashley Aw et al. , Mol. Cell 62 , 603–617 (2016)] for use with C hromatin A ssociated R NA. We applied this method called Chromatin Associated RNA (CAR)-SPLASH to cells expressing wild-type and slow mutant RNA polymerase II and identified &gt;3,000 intramolecular RNA duplexes of which &gt;400 are proximal to splice sites. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) disruption of several such duplexes that sequester splice sites has a major impact on AS outcomes, even though the ASOs do not directly disrupt splice sites. ASO disruption of these regulatory elements that we designate “RNA kinetic switches” modified AS of NISCH Exon 18, GAK Exon 7, and MEGF8 Exon 14 in a way that depends on the rate of transcription elongation. We propose that these switches mediate kinetic coupling via the effects of transcription speed on folding of nascent RNA structures that modulate AS and that many nascent RNA structures can thereby serve as targets for splice-modifying ASOs.",

Theoretically, by screening founder generation individuals based on the cell phenotypes resulting from gene knock-ins and leveraging the high fecundity of animals, heritable descendants with targeted knock-ins can be efficiently generated. Therefore, we utilized the high fecundity of Xenopus tropicalis and easily observable pigment phenotypes to construct a BRAF V600E -targeted mitf locus knock-in model. Results indicated that this approach enabled efficient generation of BRAF V600E knock-in X. tropicalis and produced a versatile frog model. The BRAF V600E knock-in induced the transdifferentiation of RPE cells into retinal cells, resulting in a symmetric retinal structure in the eyes of these frogs. The transformation of RPE cells ultimately leads to these frogs becoming eyeless frogs, which serve as a tool for retinal regeneration research. Additionally, in eyeless frogs the BRAF V600E knock-in led to the abnormal proliferation of both melanocytes and xanthophores into melanocytic and xanthocytic nevi respectively. Consequently, eyeless frogs provide a model for studying abnormal pigment cell proliferation, offering a platform for investigating pigment cell nevus formation. Furthermore, the cdkn2b -knockout eyeless frogs serve as a valuable xanthophoroma model for tumor biology research. Overall, the BRAF V600E -targeted knock-in X. tropicalis not only represents a strategy for constructing gene knock-in animal models but also serves as a versatile tool for research in retinal regeneration and tumor biology.",

This transnitrosation cascade was established in vitro and involved Cys 610 (C610) of GC1 as the major SNO-donor. To assay the relevance of GC1 transnitrosation under physiological conditions and in oxidative pathologies, we studied a knock-in mouse in which C610 was replaced with a serine (KI αC 610S ) under basal or angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated conditions. Despite similar GC1 expression and NO responsiveness, the Ang II-treated KI mice displayed exacerbated oxidative pathologies including higher mean arterial pressure and more severe cardiac dysfunctions compared to the Ang II-treated WT. These phenotypes were associated with a drastic decrease in global S-nitrosation and in levels of SNO-Trx1 in the KI mice. To investigate the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of blood pressure, pressure myography and in vivo intravital microscopy were conducted to analyze the vascular tone of resistance vessels. Both approaches indicated that, even in the absence of oxidative stress, the single mutation C610S led to a significant disruption of the endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation while NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation remained unchanged. Mechanistically, the vasorelaxation defect was associated with decreased endothelial calcium influx and membrane hyperpolarization, independent of NO bioavailability. These findings indicate that the C610S mutation uncouples two NO signaling vasodilatory pathways (endothelial SNO and smooth muscle NO-cGMP) and suggest that GC1 transnitrosation activity is essential for endothelium-derived hyperpolarization.",

Notably, counterclockwise rotation consistently results in backward motion. Simulations reveal that this behavior arises when centrifugal suction, an inward force along the axis caused by radial outward flow from the propeller’s rotation, dominates over fluid backward acceleration, the primary thrust mechanism at high Re .

In this study, we find that inorganic Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles, rather than conventional endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), can repair the damaged MLVs to restore their structure and functions. These nanoparticles not only promote the growth and development of lymphatic vessels but also enhance the drainage capacity of impaired MLVs, thereby facilitating the transport of immune cells and macromolecules through these vessels. Unlike the conventional repair of damaged MLVs, this is an instance where inorganic nanoparticles have been explored to stimulate the expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3, thereby promoting the structural and functional recovery of these vessels. The enhanced drainage function of MLVs mediated by Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles significantly alleviates the symptoms of pre-formed fibrils (PFFs)-induced Parkinson’s disease in mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that inorganic nanoparticles can promote the growth and development of meningeal lymphatics like VEGF-C, providing a cost-effective and innovative strategy for repairing damaged MLVs to boost the therapeutic efficacy of CNS diseases.",

          "abstract": "The vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) has two great topographic divisions—brain and spinal cord—that together integrate the body’s internal physiology and behavioral interactions with the environment. To clarify the architecture of intra-CNS connectivity supporting this integration in a mammal (rat), network science analyses were applied at the level of gray matter regions (nodes) connected by directed and weighted axonal projections. Neuroanatomical evidence indicates a bilateral, predominantly sexually monomorphic neuronal network of 840 nodes and a projected 81,434 direct interconnections (of the 704,760 possible connections), representing a projected network density of 12%; 32% of identified connections terminate contralaterally, and 41% of identified connections participate in bidirectionally linking a pair of nodes. Local network differentiations examined with unsupervised multiresolution consensus cluster analysis revealed a nested hierarchy of interconnected modules (clusters or subsystems) that were conservatively assigned putative functional roles. This structure–function hierarchy includes only three first-order modules, indicating a tripartite systems architecture (distinct from the bipartite brain-spinal cord topographic division): a bilaterally symmetric module pair centered in the forebrain-midbrain, associated with behavior control, cognition, and affect; and a single bilateral module centered in the rhombicbrain-spinal cord, associated with behavior execution and reflex integration. This modular spatial patterning suggests possible developmental and phylogenetic correlates. Additional analyses of the CNS’s basic structural network plan included global neuronal network features—specifically, measures of centrality, rich club, and small world topology—that transcend modular boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains with explicit Coulomb interactions, also including counterions and salt ions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.",

          "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs), ubiquitous mobile DNAs, are largely repressed by cellular mechanisms such as epigenetic silencing and RNA decay, yet some retain the ability to transpose. The Arabidopsis long terminal repeat retrotransposon Copia93 , also known as Evade , exhibits exceptionally high transpositional activity, but the mechanism underlying its extraordinary mobility remains unclear. Here, we identify an Element for Nuclear Expression (ENE) motif within the 3′ UTR of Evade that forms a triple helical RNA structure with the poly(A) tail, shielding the transcript from deadenylation and degradation. Deletion of the ENE motif significantly reduces Evade transcript stability, extrachromosomal DNA levels, and de novo insertions. Furthermore, we show that the mRNA deadenylase CCR4a directly binds Evade RNA to shorten its poly(A) tail, thereby suppressing transposition. Loss of CCR4a leads to Evade upregulation, while additional deadenylases contribute to its repression in the absence of CCR4a. Our findings uncover an RNA-based strategy that enhances transposon stability and mobility, illustrating a coevolutionary arms race between host silencing pathways and TE-encoded structural elements.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 plays a crucial role in regulating excitability of small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and is an emerging target for pain therapeutics. Using dynamic clamp, we systematically manipulated Nav1.8 conductance to assess its impact on action potential (AP) electrogenesis, rheobase, and repetitive firing in native rat DRG neurons and those expressing the gain-of-function Nav1.7L858H mutation which underlies inherited erythromelalgia, a human genetic pain disorder. Our findings reveal that the Nav1.8 contribution to net sodium current is highly correlated with AP voltage threshold. Nav1.8 conductance regulated AP overshoot and voltage threshold without significantly affecting undershoot or resting membrane potential. We identified two populations of wild-type DRG neurons: strong responders (50% of cells), which exhibited substantial rheobase modulation with alterations in Nav1.8 conductance, and weak responders (50% of cells), which remained largely unaffected. In hyperexcitable Nav1.7L858H-expressing neurons, partial Nav1.8 subtraction (50%) restored rheobase above control levels in 63% of cells. However, weak responders (37%) remained hyperexcitable. The effect of Nav1.8 subtraction in responsive neurons supports the conclusion that Nav1.8 inhibition can reduce neuropathic pain. However, the presence of weakly responsive DRG neurons suggests that other channels might need to be targeted for full pain relief.",

          "abstract": "Knowing the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter’s bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter’s atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential nonuniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter’s midlatitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A nonuniform water vapor distribution emerges in the midlatitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from subsolar to supersolar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter’s midlatitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a supersolar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the nonuniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Endogenous pathogens can constrain virulence to ensure survival in the host. Pathogenic state can be controlled by metabolic responses to the prevailing microenvironment; however, the coupling and effector mechanisms are not well understood. Flux through the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway can modulate virulence of the oral pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis , and here we show that this is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent differential partitioning of gingipain proteases. The OCM essential precursor pABA inhibits the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and consequently relieves inhibition of its cognate kinase, Ptk1. We found that in the absence of pABA, reduced Ptk1 kinase activity blocks extracellular release of gingipains. Surface retention of gingipains confers resistance to neutrophil mobilization and killing, and virulence in animal models of disease is elevated. Reciprocally, Ptk1 and gingipains are required for maximal flux through OCM, and Ptk1 can phosphorylate the OCM pathway enzymes GlyA and GcvT. Further, ALP, an alkaline phosphatase involved in synthesis of DHPPP, which combines with pABA to make DHP, is phosphorylated and activated by Ptk1. We propose, therefore, that although the primary function of Ptk1 is to maintain OCM balance, it mechanistically couples metabolism with tunable pathogenic potential through directing the location of proteolytic virulence factors.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 58 million people worldwide are believed to be infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of chronic liver diseases. Hepacivirus ratti strain rn-1, which was discovered from Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and designated Norway rat hepacivirus 1 (NRHV1), shares similar properties with HCV in terms of genetic homology, target cell tropism, pathogenicity, and the immune response. In vivo infection systems for NRHV1 will help overcome the challenges in HCV research for vaccine development. However, the virological characteristics of NRHV1, such as the mechanisms of cell entry, remain largely unexplored, in part owing to a paucity of cell culture systems for NRHV1. Here, we identified the host factors that facilitate NRHV1 entry by profiling the gene expression of two cell lines with different susceptibilities to NRHV1 infection. NRHV1 employs rodent orthologues of HCV entry factors, including scavenger receptor class BI, CD81, and occludin, and utilizes claudin-3 (CLDN3) but not claudin-1. The expression of rat and mouse, but not human, CLDN3 facilitates the entry of NRHV1 into murine cell lines that are nonsusceptible to NRHV1 infection. The host-specific cell entry of CLDN3 is determined by two amino acid residues, Ile 44 and Trp 46 , in extracellular loop 1. These findings suggest that CLDN3 serves as an entry factor for rat hepacivirus.",

The most prominent form of this belief is known as “ effective accelerationism ,” and adherents view unrestricted progress in AI as a solution to humanity’s problems. Rooted in the broader political ideology of accelerationism, this movement positions itself directly in opposition to “AI doomers” or “decelerationists,” who advocate for AI safety and slow, cautious development. Effective accelerationists often dismiss concerns about existential risk, arguing that technological stagnation is a greater danger than uncontrolled advancement. Public interest AI inverts AI accelerationism, promoting more equitable, sustainable, and democratically accountable technological progress. This approach directly addresses the risks and potential harms of unregulated acceleration by aligning AI with public values rather than solely with private interests.",

However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription. The biological importance of remodelers may thus reflect both their effects on nucleosome mobilization and the corresponding consequences on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive evolution is key for species to persist in a warming climate. However, how adaptive genetic variants arise and shape both past and future evolutionary trajectories remains largely unknown. In this work, we integrate genomics with functional and ecological assays to unravel the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of alleles governing adaptation to climate through flowering time in an Alpine carnation. We reveal that “warm” and “cold” alleles of the flowering inhibitor CENTRORADIALIS ( DsCEN/2 ) originated through recombination of highly divergent haplotypes during the carnation radiation, implicating ancestral variation in seeding climate-adaptive alleles. These alleles survived in glacial refugia before mediating the species’ range expansion in response to postglacial warming. We predict that, by recapitulating past evolution, warm alleles will continue to facilitate adaptation under future climate change.",

However, previous observations have shown much lower abundances of this molecule than predicted by atmospheric chemistry models. We report JWST spectroscopic observations of phosphine in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf Wolf 1130C. Multiple absorption lines due to phosphine are detected around 4.3 μm, from which we calculate a phosphine abundance of 0.100 ± 0.009 parts per million. This abundance is consistent with disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry models that reproduce the phosphine abundances in Jupiter and Saturn, and is much higher than abundances previously reported for other brown dwarfs or exoplanets. This difference may be related to the low abundance of elements heavier than helium in Wolf 1130C.",

          "abstract": "Upwelling generates a nutrient-rich “cold tongue” in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP), with impacts on global climate, oceanic biological productivity, and the carbon cycle. The cold tongue was reduced during the Pliocene Epoch, a feature attributed to weaker upwelling and an associated deepening of the surface mixed layer in the EEP. Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.",

How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips—forming the root’s extracellular diffusion barrier—restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.",

We evaluated the ability of open-source AI-powered protein design software to create variants of proteins of concern that could evade detection by the biosecurity screening tools used by nucleic acid synthesis providers, identifying a vulnerability where AI-redesigned sequences could not be detected reliably by current tools.

Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.",

For ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transitions through intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation, with these transitions shaping the post-synaptic response. Here, we determine structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. Agonist binding to a single site stabilizes a closed structure where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit transitions to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Uniting this intermediate structure with single-channel recordings informs a sequential activation mechanism where asynchronous subunit transitions prime the receptor for activation, a finding with implications for an entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.",

Traditional waste-to-energy methods such as incineration and pyrolysis, as well as most chemical upcycling methods for PVC utilization, require thorough, high-temperature dechlorination to prevent the release of toxic chlorinated compounds. We present here a strategy for upgrading discarded PVC into chlorine-free fuel range hydrocarbons and hydrogen chloride in a single-stage process catalyzed by chloroaluminate ionic liquids. This approach offsets endothermic dechlorination and carbon-carbon bond cleavage with exothermic alkylation and hydrogen transfer by isobutane or isopentane in a low-temperature tandem process. The light isoalkanes are available from refinery processes and partly from recycling of the product stream. This process is suitable for handling real-world mixed and contaminated PVC and polyolefin waste streams.",

          "abstract": "Millions of Americans must attend mandatory court dates every year. To boost appearance rates, jurisdictions nationwide are increasingly turning to automated reminders. However, previous research paints an incomplete picture of their effectiveness—in particular, there has been little work assessing the impact of reminders on downstream arrests and incarceration. In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment. The effectiveness of reminders bolsters the theory that lapses in memory or comprehension contribute to missed court appearances.",

          "abstract": "One of the most widely cited objections to hypotheses that defend a central role for humans in late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions in South America has been the assumption that extinct megafauna was a marginal resource in early human economies. On the basis of accurate chronological frames and faunal quantitative data, we demonstrate that extinct megafauna were the principal prey item of early foragers from ~13,000 to 11,600 calibrated years before the present, and this fact had likely been obscured by lumping together pre- and postextinction archaeological faunal assemblages within a single chronological window. We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened. This strongly reinforces the idea that humans must be central to the debate on Quaternary extinctions in South America.",

          "abstract": "The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer has been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.",

The epigenetic mechanism underlying spatiotemporal gene regulation during in vivo neuron differentiation remains largely unknown. Granule cells (GCs) constitute the vast majority of neurons in the cerebellum, which contains most of neurons in the brain. Here, we show that Atoh1-Cre –mediated knockout (ACKO) of Kmt2d encoding the lysine methyltransferase KMT2D (MLL4) in cerebellar GC lineage inhibits the transition of GC progenitors to GCs while cell non-autonomously affecting other cerebellar cells. Kmt2d ACKO impaired cerebellum-associated behaviors and caused facial peculiarity, microcephaly, and reduced body size in mice. KMT2D temporally activated neuronal differentiation programs in cerebellar GCs. KMT2D-mediated activation of the key neuronal transcription factor genes En2 , Pax6 , and Myt1l via super-enhancer/enhancer programming was critical for GC differentiation. These findings reveal a unique epigenetic mechanism in which KMT2D temporally orchestrates gene expression required for cerebellar GC differentiation by programming neuronal enhancers.",

In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2 , which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle–mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline–deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet–induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.",

Deep learning enables ultrafast reconstruction but is limited to spectra of up to three dimensions and cannot provide faithful reconstruction under unseen acceleration factors. Extending deep learning to handle higher-dimensional spectra and varying acceleration factors is desirable. However, scalability requires complex networks and more data, seriously hindering applications. To address this, we designed a network to learn data in one dimension (1D). First, time-domain signals were modeled as the outer product of 1D exponentials. Then, each 1D exponential was approximated with a rank-one Hankel matrix. Last, reconstruction error was corrected with a neural network. Here, we demonstrate robust 3D NMR reconstruction across acceleration factors (2 to 33) using one trained network. In addition, we find that reconstruction of 4D NMR is possible with artificial intelligence. This work opens an avenue for accelerating arbitrarily high-dimensional NMR. ",

The sensor enables direct probing of the amide I band in sub-10-nanometer proteins. By using s-CFW to amplify target spectral features, the developed physics-informed CNN achieves a mean relative error of less than 0.1 in predicting secondary structure percentages, more than twice as accurate as a pristine CNN.

However, existing projections often do not align with past data, complicating adaptation planning, impact assessments, and communication. We present a spatial Bayesian model that generates local projections at tide gauge sites from historical records. The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The model enables projections of local relative sea level rise for any given global temperature trajectory, illustrated with three IPCC AR6 Working Group III pathways.",

We show that floods driven by compound space-time storm clustering have higher peaks, volumes, and durations compared to those from isolated storms or single-mode clustering. Under future climate conditions (2070 to 2100; SSP3-7.0 scenario), projections indicate a 26% rise in the number of extreme storms, an 8% increase in average storm precipitation, and a 17% reduction in dry intervals preceding flood peaks. The dominant flood type is projected to shift from those produced by isolated storms (38%) to ones produced by compound storm clustering (49%)—the type of floods that have been responsible for catastrophic floods historically. These findings highlight the need to incorporate storm clustering and its changes into design flood analysis and management strategies for the LMRB.",

          "abstract": "The distinct compositions of metallic cores from noncarbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) reflect differences in accretion and differentiation histories of earliest inner and outer Solar System planetesimals. Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.",

Subsequently, using rJN.1, rJN.1-D130A-dFCS, and rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS as the backbones, we generated three recombinant viruses expressing a nonfunctional, soluble, and stabilized prefusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSVF).

However, rJN.1-mTRS-D130A-dFCS-RSVF was poorly immunogenic.

Using pooled phenotype sorting and sequencing of male Drosophila melanogaster from natural populations, we identified starvation resistance–associated variants, many in regulatory regions or altering protein sequences. RNA interference experiments showed that 85.7% (66 of 77) of the candidate genes with nonlethal knockdown effects influenced starvation resistance. Of these, 49 had sex-dependent effects, including 12 with sexually antagonistic effects—all increasing resistance in females but decreasing it in males. These patterns were not explained by sex-biased expression or knockdown efficiency. Analysis of the Lnk gene revealed that both nonsynonymous mutations and expression changes had sex-dependent effects. Our findings indicate that polygenic architecture, sex-dependent effects, and pleiotropy jointly shape evolutionary outcomes and that some variants maintained by these forces may enable rapid responses to environmental change.",

Here, we propose and demonstrate a nonvolatile silicon photonic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switch enabled by tailored stiction effect based on van der Waals (vdW) force. The device uses a unique split waveguide crossing (SWX) with a push-pull MEMS actuator to efficiently switch the mode propagation.

We determined the functions of individual constituent proteins in the structure and function of Eut BMCs and demonstrated that EutQ is essential for cargo encapsulation and Eut BMC formation through specific association with the shell and cargo enzymes. We found that Eut proteins can self-assemble to form cargo and shell aggregates independently in vivo and that the biogenesis of Eut BMCs follows a “shell-initiated” pathway.

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.",

We showed that potential trimethoprim-resistance dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ) genes enriched in lytic phages could confer trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli . Sequence analysis revealed that lytic phages rarely transfer these potential dfrA genes into their bacterial hosts. Functional studies showed that these dfrA genes not only enhance phage reproduction in the presence of trimethoprim but also promote bacterial growth during phage infection.

          "abstract": "The performance of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between transconductance and temporal response. While increasing channel thickness enhances its capacitance and thereby amplifies transconductance, it simultaneously impedes ion transport kinetics, leading to slower switching speeds. Here, we present a three-dimensional electrolyte-surrounded OECT architecture that redefines ion transport dynamics by enabling multidirectional ion doping to the channel for efficient and rapid switching. Our proposed approach achieves a remarkable enhancement in the operational bandwidth of OECTs, reaching 26 kHz while preserving their high transconductance, notably using a commercially available conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). This is enabled by micro/nanostructured channel design that enhances ion accessibility and minimizes parasitic effects. This advancement allows for continuous, wide-frequency neural signal recording from peripheral nerves. This work offers a robust strategy for achieving both high transconductance and fast switching in OECTs, establishing a foundation for the development of next-generation, high-speed bioelectronic interfaces.",

During ischemia, mammalian CI transitions from a turnover-ready, structurally “closed” state toward a dormant “open” state that prevents it from functioning in reverse during reperfusion to produce reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening. The direct correlation of NUQM binding with closed/open status in Pp -CI provides opportunities for investigating regulatory mechanisms relevant to reversible catalysis and ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

Our findings indicate that a topological transition occurs in response to modulation frequency increases, producing anomalous edge states with chirality within Floquet harmonic bandgaps. The open nature of the metasurface facilitates harmonic generation via Floquet edge states. Experimentally, we confirm the existence of Floquet harmonic bands and the robust unidirectional propagation of these edge states. In addition, we propose a large-scale coding scheme to dynamically reconfigure propagation paths through programmable binary states of the meta-units.

Here, we designed and developed pseudo-rhodamine electrochromic molecules through a “tandem all-in-one” synthetic strategy that covalently integrates three distinct functional units within a single molecule. This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states. The design principle showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of ultrafast electrochromic video displays.",

Disentangling the relative effects of these factors is challenging yet crucial for designing management strategies. We used a temperature-dependent population dynamics model to assess the impacts of lake warming and fishing on 521 freshwater fish populations in the Midwestern United States—a transitional zone between cold- and warmwater species. Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.",

Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.",

Within 1 week of treatment, AT MΦs decreased and became lipid laden, while extracellular vesicles secreted from AT decreased and reduced in lipid content. Within 2 weeks, glucose tolerance returned to levels of lean controls, followed by weight loss and reduced food intake. After 4 weeks, AT browning and amelioration of hepatic steatosis were evident. The physiological shifts were reproducible in three rodent models of obesity, spanning sexes and gonadal status.

This reduction is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which have little to no α2,6-linked sialic acid. To understand how α2,6-linked sialic acid affects T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell–specific deletion of sialyltransferase gene St6gal1 . The lack of α2,6-linked sialic acid leads to reduced responsiveness in naïve T cells, leading to impaired T cell responses against Listeria monocytogenes infection and tumor growth. PD-1 pathway blockade partially restores St6gal1 -deficient T cells’ ability to control tumor growth.

          "abstract": "Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to balance growth and defense. The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription. Here, we show that PAF1C regulates the growth-defense tradeoff by repressing defense genes expression in Arabidopsis . Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1. Collectively, this study identifies the NPR1-PAF1C-HDA6 module that regulates the growth-defense tradeoff.",

TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) is a core transcriptional repressor in the plant circadian system that is phosphorylated near its N terminus. Phenotype testing of TOC1 phosphosite mutants shows incomplete rescue of the short period toc1 mutant. We establish that TOC1 phosphorylation (particularly at S175) is necessary for optimal interaction with FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5 (PIF5) at the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) promoter to down-regulate CCA1 expression. Expression of the closely related LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) also requires TOC1 but is independent of TOC1 phosphorylation, suggesting different TOC1-dependent gene repression mechanisms. We additionally show that TOC1 phosphorylation–dependent interactions at specific clock gene promoters selectively regulate these circadian system components more acutely than nonrhythmic genes. Our genome-wide analysis demonstrates that the TOC1 phosphostate is important for optimal chromatin presence and robust rhythmic gene expression.",

Glaciers in the western United States are projected to disappear by 2100 CE, but whether they were previously absent in the current interglacial (past 11,700 years) remains debated. Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene. These findings imply that a glacier-free Sierra Nevada is unprecedented since before the Holocene. Future alpine glacial environments in California are thereby likely a no-analog scenario within the current interglacial.",

By implementing quadruple-pass focusing of 5.7-millijoule, 800-nanometer femtosecond pulses in nitrogen, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement in the energy of N 2 + lasing, yielding an output of approximately 4.4 microjoules. This multipass configuration also reduces the lasing threshold by nearly 70%, facilitates spectral broadening of pump pulses, and compresses the pulse duration of N 2 + lasing. Capitalizing on these combined effects, we developed a single-beam coherent Raman spectroscopy, which enables simultaneous detection of multiple species and exhibits high sensitivity at the parts-per-million level.

How cellular Ca 2+ balance is maintained during stress remains unresolved. Here, we identify an intracellular phosphoregulatory module comprising calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK)–ER-type Ca 2+ -ATPases 1 (ECA1) that integrates [Ca 2+ ] cyt flux with abscisic acid (ABA) homeostasis to modulate root growth under osmotic stress. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth.

We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.",

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.",

In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal–induced mouse peritonitis.

          "abstract": "T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) play a pivotal role in maintaining immune self-tolerance and prevention of autoantibody induction. However, the stages of Tfr formation have still not been clarified. Here, we found that 30 to 50% of circulating Tfr in human blood have a naïve-like phenotype (preTfr, CD45RA + CD45RO − Foxp3 + CXCR5 + ). PreTfr are expandable in vitro while retaining suppressive capacity. They are transcriptionally similar to naïve T regs (nT regs ) ex vivo, but after stimulation, they gain increased expression of Tfr-related suppressive molecules such as IL-1RA, suggesting that they are primed for full differentiation into mature Tfr. Further, we demonstrate that preTfr but not nT reg are significantly reduced in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and patients with sepsis and that this loss is correlated with increased anti–interferon-γ antibodies and activated atypical B cells. Together, these data suggest that Tfr are disrupted at the earliest stage of their formation during severe disease and may be an important therapeutic target in future vaccine developments.",

          "abstract": "In March 2024, a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b virus was identified in US dairy cows, with spillover to cats, poultry, and humans. Up to 30% of commercial pasteurized milk tested contained viral genome copies. The impact of residual viral remnants on host immunity is unknown. Orally ingested proteins can stimulate gut-associated lymphoid tissues, potentially inducing tolerance and altering responses to later infection. We found that milk pasteurization fully inactivated pandemic H1N1 and bovine H5N1 influenza viruses yet preserved hemagglutinin (HA) protein integrity. In mice, repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus did not alter mortality after H5N1 virus challenge. Preliminary data showed that naïve mice exposed to improperly pasteurized milk containing live H5N1 virus developed lethal infection, whereas prior H1N1 infection conferred protection. Mice with preexisting H1N1 immunity remained protected when challenged with bovine H5N1 virus after exposure to H5N1 pasteurized in milk. These findings suggest that pasteurized milk containing inactivated H5N1 virus poses minimal health risks.",

          "abstract": "Across human cultures and historical periods, women, on average, live longer than men, a pattern best understood from a comparative evolutionary perspective. Here, we analyzed adult life expectancy in 528 mammal and 648 bird species in zoos. Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of fluidic vortex rings have long captivated researchers because of their complex behavior despite simple structure. Photonic toroidal vortices constitute a family of three-dimensional, spacetime nonseparable structured light fields carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, as solutions to the dispersive Maxwells’ equations, these wave packets do not survive nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by transverse and longitudinal OAM, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by longitudinal OAM. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion and induces topological transformations of vortex lines, characterized by annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. The renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the functional role of NKAPL (nuclear factor κB activating protein-like)—an SCZ risk-associated gene—and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1635 in cognitive deficits related to SCZ. We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.",

          "abstract": "Researchers often discuss consumers as a means of labor control. In contrast, I ask how workers leverage consumers to resist control over their labor process. Focusing on sponsored content creation as a case, I explain how creators prioritize audience interests to resist sponsors’ control over their creative decisions. Using semi-structured interviews with 39 content creators and observations of a conference session, I show that the managerial practices of sponsoring brands contradict audience expectations due to the relational labor that creators perform to build a sense of community, authenticity, and trustworthiness in the eyes of audiences. Second, I document the role of part-time content creation and YouTube’s paid channel memberships in enhancing creators’ capacity to be selective with sponsorship requests and resist brand interventions that may ultimately lead to a decline in audience engagement. I extend the literature by theorizing when consumers enable workers to resist labor control.",
