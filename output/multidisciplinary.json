          "authors": "Xiao-Feng Tan, Ana I. Fernández-Mariño, Yan Li, Tsg-Hui Chang, Kenton J. Swartz",
          "abstract": "Action potentials are generated by opening of voltage-activated sodium (Na v ) and potassium (K v ) channels 1 , which can rapidly inactivate to shape the nerve impulse and contribute to synaptic facilitation and short-term memory 1–4 . The mechanism of fast inactivation was proposed to involve an intracellular domain that blocks the internal pore in both Na v 5,6 and K v 7–9 channels; however, recent studies in Na v 10,11 and K v 12,13 channels support a mechanism in which the internal pore closes during inactivation. Here we investigate the mechanism of fast inactivation in the Shaker K v channel using cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and electrophysiology. We resolved structures of a fully inactivated state in which the non-polar end of the N terminus plugs the internal pore in an extended conformation. The N-terminal methionine is deleted, leaving an alanine that is acetylated and interacts with a pore-lining isoleucine residue where RNA editing regulates fast inactivation 14 . Opening of the internal activation gate is required for fast inactivation because it enables the plug domain to block the pore and repositions gate residues to interact with and stabilize that domain. We also show that external K + destabilizes the inactivated state by altering the conformation of the ion selectivity filter rather than by electrostatic repulsion. These findings establish the mechanism of fast inactivation in K v channels, revealing how it is regulated by RNA editing and N-terminal acetylation, and providing a framework for understanding related mechanisms in other voltage-activated channels.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is associated with poor cancer prognoses 1 . Large numbers of excised signal circles (ESCs) are produced as by-products of antigen receptor rearrangement during V(D)J recombination 2,3 . However, current dogma states that ESCs are progressively lost through cell division 4 . Here we show that ESCs replicate and persist through many cell generations and share many properties in common with circular extrachromosomal DNAs. Increased ESC copy numbers at diagnosis of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were highly correlated with subsequent relapse. By taking advantage of the matching recombination footprint that is formed upon the generation of each ESC, we measured ESC persistence and replication and found increased ESC replication in patients who later relapsed. This increased replication is controlled by cell-intrinsic factors and corresponds to increased expression of DNA replication- and repair-associated genes. Consistent with high ESC levels having a role in disease progression, the number of mutations typical of those caused by the V(D)J recombinase–ESC complex was significantly increased at diagnosis in patients who later relapsed. The number of such mutations in genes associated with relapse increased between diagnosis and relapse, and corresponded to clonal expansion of cells with high ESC copy numbers. These data demonstrate that the by-product of V(D)J recombination, when increased in abundance, potently associates with the V(D)J recombinase to cause adverse disease outcomes.",

          "abstract": "GABAergic neurons are essential cellular components of neural circuits. Their abundance and diversity have increased significantly in the human brain, contributing to the expanded cognitive capacity of humans 1 . However, the developmental mechanism underlying the extended production of GABAergic neurons in the human brain remains elusive. Here we uncovered the microglial regulation of the sustained proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts in the human medial ganglionic eminence (hMGE). We showed that microglia are preferentially distributed in the proliferating zone and identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor IGR1R as the predicted top ligand–receptor pair underlying microglia–progenitor communication in the prenatal hMGE. Using our newly developed neuroimmune hMGE organoids, which mimic the hMGE cytoarchitecture and developmental trajectory, we demonstrated that microglia-derived IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation and production of GABAergic neurons. Conversely, IGF1-neutralizing antibodies and IGF1 knockout human embryonic stem-cell-induced microglia abolish the induced microglia-mediated progenitor proliferation. Together, these findings revealed a previously unappreciated role of microglia-derived IGF1 in promoting the proliferation of neural progenitors and the development of GABAergic neurons in the human brain.",

          "abstract": "The molecular hydrogen ions (MHI) are three-body systems suitable for advancing our knowledge in several domains: fundamental constants, tests of quantum physics, search for new interparticle forces, tests of the weak equivalence principle 1 and, once the anti-molecule $$\\overline{p}\\,\\overline{p}\\,{e}^{+}$$ p ¯ p ¯ e + becomes available, new tests of charge–parity–time-reversal invariance and local position invariance 1–3 . To achieve these goals, high-accuracy laser spectroscopy of several isotopologues, in particular $${{\\rm{H}}}_{2}^{+}$$ H 2 + , is required 4 . Here we present a Doppler-free laser spectroscopy of a $${{\\rm{H}}}_{2}^{+}$$ H 2 + rovibrational transition, achieving line resolutions as large as 2.2 × 10 13 . We accurately determine the transition frequency with 8 × 10 −12 fractional uncertainty. We also determine the spin–rotation coupling coefficient with 0.1 kHz uncertainty and its value is consistent with the state-of-the-art theory prediction 5 . The combination of our theoretical and experimental $${{\\rm{H}}}_{2}^{+}$$ H 2 + data allows us to deduce a new value for the proton-electron mass ratio m p / m e . It is in agreement with the value obtained from mass spectrometry and has 2.3 times lower uncertainty. From combined MHI, H/D and muonic H/D data, we determine the baryon mass ratio m d / m p with 1.1 × 10 −10 absolute uncertainty. The value agrees with the directly measured mass ratio 6 . Finally, we present a match between a theoretical prediction and an experimental result, with a fractional uncertainty of 8.1 × 10 −12 . Both results indicate a notable confirmation of the predictive power of quantum theory and the absence of beyond-the-standard-model effects at these levels.",

          "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing provides an unbiased and complete view of the human genome and enables the discovery of genetic variation without the technical limitations of other genotyping technologies. Here we report on whole-genome sequencing of 490,640 UK Biobank participants, building on previous genotyping effort 1 . This advance deepens our understanding of how genetics associates with disease biology and further enhances the value of this open resource for the study of human biology and health. Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. Although most associations with disease traits were primarily observed in individuals of European ancestries, strong or novel signals were also identified in individuals of African and Asian ancestries. With the improved ability to accurately genotype structural variants and exonic variation in both coding and UTR sequences, we strengthened and revealed novel insights relative to whole-exome sequencing 2,3 analyses. This dataset, representing a large collection of whole-genome sequencing data that is available to the UK Biobank research community, will enable advances of our understanding of the human genome, facilitate the discovery of diagnostics and therapeutics with higher efficacy and improved safety profile, and enable precision medicine strategies with the potential to improve global health.",

          "abstract": "Tunability in active metasurfaces has mainly relied on shifting the resonance wavelength 1,2 or increasing material losses 3,4 to spectrally detune or quench resonant modes, respectively. However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as a limited Q factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on–off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far field. Here we demonstrate temporal symmetry breaking in metasurfaces through ultrafast optical pumping, providing an experimental realization of radiative-loss-driven resonance tuning, allowing resonance creation, annihilation, broadening and sharpening. To enable this temporal control, we introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum. Even though their unit cells are geometrically asymmetric, coupling to the radiation continuum remains fully suppressed, which, in this work, is achieved by two equally strong antisymmetric dipoles. By using selective Mie-resonant pumping in parts of these unit cells, we can modify their dipole balance to create or annihilate resonances as well as tune the linewidth, amplitude and near-field enhancement, leading to potential applications in optical and quantum communications, time crystals and photonic circuits.",

          "abstract": "Parent-of-origin effects (POEs) occur when the effect of a genetic variant depends on its parental origin 1 . Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, POEs are believed to occur due to parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, resulting in opposing parental influences 2 . Despite their importance, POEs remain underexplored in complex traits, owing to the lack of parental genomes. Here we present an approach to infer the parent of origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging interchromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and X chromosome data, and sex-specific crossover in siblings. Applied to the UK Biobank, this enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 109,385 individuals. Genome-wide association study scans for 59 complex traits and over 14,000 protein quantitative trait loci contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 POEs and confirmed more than 50% of known associations. More than one third of these showed opposite parental influences, especially for traits related to growth (for example, IGF1 and height) and metabolism (for example, type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels). Replication in up to 85,050 individuals from the Estonian Biobank and 42,346 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) validated 87% of testable associations. Overall, our findings highlight the contribution of POEs to complex traits and support the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

          "abstract": "Extinction learning—the suppression of a previously acquired fear response—is critical for adaptive behaviour and core for understanding the aetiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4–12 Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses. Our results reveal the neurophysiological mechanisms and representational characteristics of context-dependent extinction learning in the human brain. In addition, they show that the mutual competition of fear and extinction memory traces provides a mechanistic basis for clinically important phenomena such as fear renewal and extinction retrieval.",

          "authors": "Setayesh Radkani, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Rebecca Saxe",
          "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and observers infer shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three preregistered experiments ( N = 1 , 254 ) and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework that captures and explains these inferences and their interactions quantitatively and parsimoniously. When people have different priors about norms or authorities, the model predicted and we experimentally confirmed that observing punishment by the authority can sustain polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

          "authors": "Sergey Gavrilets, Paul Seabright",
          "abstract": "People and cultures differ in the extent to which they view the world as a zero-sum environment (where one person’s gain is another’s loss) or a positive-sum environment (where certain actions can benefit everyone). These beliefs shape individuals’ willingness to work, invest, collaborate, or show hostility toward out-groups, and accept or reject various social policies. We model dyadic interactions in a heterogeneous population where individuals biased toward a zero-sum worldview are more likely to invest in competition, while those biased toward a positive-sum worldview are more likely to invest in cooperation. The environment alternates stochastically between cooperative and competitive states. Without social influence, the more accurate worldview yields higher utilities and spreads throughout the population. However, assortative matching by bias can favor the positive-sum worldview even if a positive-sum environment is somewhat less likely. With peer conformity, inaccurate worldviews can persist after a structural change in the environment, leading to cultural evolutionary mismatch. In the presence of cultural authorities who can alter beliefs, either both worldviews can coexist or one excludes the other. Moreover, when assortative matching and conformity interact, authorities may profit by amplifying individuals’ biases, creating enclaves of similarly biased people who can pay the authorities enough to make investment in persuasive technology economically viable. Cultural evolutionary mismatch is more likely in cultures marked by strong peer conformity and high responsiveness to authority when the authority promotes a suboptimal worldview. This study demonstrates how real-world conditions, peer influence, and authority interventions can perpetuate or shift zero-sum and positive-sum worldviews-at times leading to inaccurate beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Science is characterized by collaboration and cooperation, but also by uncertainty, competition, and inequality. While there has always been some concern that these pressures may compel some to defect from the scientific research ethos—i.e., fail to make genuine contributions to the production of knowledge or to the training of an expert workforce—the focus has largely been on the actions of lone individuals. Recently, however, reports of coordinated scientific fraud activities have increased. Some suggest that the ease of communication provided by the internet and open-access publishing have created the conditions for the emergence of entities—paper mills (i.e., sellers of mass-produced low quality and fabricated research), brokers (i.e., conduits between producers and publishers of fraudulent research), predatory journals, who do not conduct any quality controls on submissions—that facilitate systematic scientific fraud. Here, we demonstrate through case studies that i) individuals have cooperated to publish papers that were eventually retracted in a number of journals, ii) brokers have enabled publication in targeted journals at scale, and iii), within a field of science, not all subfields are equally targeted for scientific fraud. Our results reveal some of the strategies that enable the entities promoting scientific fraud to evade interventions. Our final analysis suggests that this ability to evade interventions is enabling the number of fraudulent publications to grow at a rate far outpacing that of legitimate science.",

          "abstract": "Whether and to what degree culture modifies cognition has been an area of research often limited by possibilities to gather relevant data across societies. In this project, we leverage webcam-based eye-tracking to study cultural variations of cognitive processes underlying in-group favoritism. Participants (n = 1850, k = 20) are assigned to an in-group based on a color perception task, complete a group reinforcement stage, and then make decisions to allocate points between themselves and random matched players in a repeated decomposed dictator game, facing either an in- or an out-group member. During this task, we recorded eye-gaze with participants’ webcams. Results show substantial variation in behavioral in-group favoritism across cultures, linking discrimination based on group membership to higher societal uncertainty. Individual preferences for prosociality conditioned differences in visual search effort, but the directionality of the effect differs between countries. Individual-level predictors explained participants remaining colorblind toward others’ group membership, where society-level predictors did not. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of taking culture into account when assessing cognitive processes underlying behavior. Implications for globally oriented policymaking to reduce discrimination are discussed.",

          "abstract": "What will it take to eliminate hunger in a world that is increasingly serious about climate change mitigation? For the past two decades, climate activism and mitigation efforts have largely focused on energy, industry, and transportation as the main contributors to anthropogenic warming. Although there is a long way to go to eliminate emissions from these sources, increasing international ambition means that attention is now turning to other hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Net zero food systems in particular pose unique challenges for humanity, given the moral dimensions of food security and the strong potential for vicious cycles: Globally hunger is back on the rise, the changing climate is already making food production for a growing population more difficult, and food shocks could lead to more land use change emissions that accelerate warming and feed back to negatively impact agricultural productivity and hunger. The dynamics of food production and consumption differ from other sectors and reveal several dimensions in which it will be critical to get policy right. Recent science suggests that two coordinated efforts will be needed to meet this challenge—a revamped focus on smallholder adaptation and productivity, and new “safety valve” institutions that sit at the intersection of food production and climate mitigation efforts and can operate at the relevant spatial and temporal scales to avoid negative tradeoffs in the quest to eliminate hunger and stabilize earth’s climate.",

These places bear virtually no responsibility for climate change but will face sea-level rise, fresh water resource degradation, and intensified storms that will kill or dislocate exposed publics, and damage local economies. To alleviate this crisis, the global community has begun discussing who is responsible for climate mitigation and adaptation costs for those affected by climate change, in addition to continued debates around the distribution of responsibility for climate change. Missing from this analysis, however, are systematic efforts to elicit the preferences and perceptions of publics in these threatened small-island states and territories. Here, we report results from a large-sample (n = 14,710) cross-national survey of publics living in climate-vulnerable states and territories, conducted in June–July 2022. By quota sampling through Facebook’s ad platform, we generate survey samples at the national or territorial level for publics in 55 small-island states, territories, and subnational regions in the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Caribbean. We find widespread awareness and concern about the threat posed by climate change and sea-level rise, in contrast to what existing research finds in the Global North. We also find that climate-vulnerable publics believe their home governments, large polluters, and former colonial powers are all responsible for helping to manage the climate crisis, irrespective of these actors’ relative carbon emissions. These findings fill an important gap by depicting climate beliefs among the communities at the frontlines of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the influence of low-density Indigenous populations in paleofire records has been methodologically challenging. In the Southwest United States, well-replicated fire histories suggest that abundant lightning and suitable climate conditions drove frequent low-severity wildfires in dry pine forests independent of human activities even as ethnography provided hints that highly mobile indigenous populations used fire in myriad land use contexts. Here, we leverage published and unpublished tree-ring fire history records from pine forests in Western Apache (Ndee) traditional territory in central and eastern Arizona (N = 34 sites, N = 649 trees) to demonstrate that historical fire regimes were overwhelmingly influenced by Ndee cultural burning. Our tree-ring synthesis shows significantly more frequent fires in Ndee territory than elsewhere in the region for centuries before the establishment of reservations (1600–1870 CE). Despite the heightened fire activity, fires were largely small and asynchronous, occurred disproportionately in late April and May, when Ndee invested significant subsistence activities in these pine forests, and occurred independent of climate drivers. This suggests that Ndee fire stewardship created a patchwork of nearly annual small, spring fires that inhibited natural fire spread and limited the influence of drought on fire activity. Our work shows that even relatively small, highly mobile populations of forager-gardeners had significant influence on some pre-Euroamerican fire regimes despite abundant natural ignitions. Our study shows clearly that Indigenous fire management impacted fire-size distributions, fire frequencies, and fire seasonality in ways that cannot be explained by seasonal and annual lightning densities.",

AA-20 reduces polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner in both human cells and C. elegans , where it also promotes fitness. Consistently, we found that AA-20 extends lifespan in WT C. elegans, but not in autophagy-deficient mutants.

          "abstract": "Topological states of matter, first discovered in quantum systems, have opened new avenues for wave manipulation beyond the quantum realm. In elastic media, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that support the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of theoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been physically realized. To close this gap, we present a strategy capable of systematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with desired topological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry, which systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry properties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the topological character into mathematical information at a small set of wavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for topology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice symmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive morphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these band morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further fabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical realization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This methodology establishes a paradigm for engineering topological elastic lattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and paving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial configurations.",

          "abstract": "Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) results in spin polarization of electrons transmitted through chiral molecules and materials. Since CISS results in spin polarization even at room temperature, it affords the possibility of using it to develop quantum technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. We have shown previously that photo-driven hole transfer within DNA hairpins provides a facile route to generate spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs). To study the effect of CISS on the spin dynamics of SCRPs in DNA hairpins, we prepared a series of electron donor—chiral bridge—acceptor molecules where the chiral bridge is a B-form DNA helix consisting of 4 to 6 base pairs. Naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) serves as the hairpin linker chromophore and electron acceptor. Photoexcitation of NDI results in rapid hole transfer through the π-stacked purine bases of the DNA and trapping of the hole on a terminal stilbene diether (Sd) to generate the NDI •− - Sd •+ SCRP. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the SCRPs at X- (9.6 GHz), Q- (34 GHz), and W- (94 GHz) bands show that the CISS effect imparts significant triplet character to the SCRP. We do not observe a significant dependence of CISS on DNA length, likely resulting from hole delocalization over the guanine bases in the G-tract. Interestingly, we find that the CISS contribution significantly increases with magnetic field strength. These findings should be considered in any future modeling of CISS.",

          "abstract": "Memory generalization allows an organism to adapt to new conditions, but overgeneralization of fear or traumatic experiences can be detrimental to survival and contributes to the development of various mental disorders. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fear memory generalization, especially in the hippocampus, remain largely unknown. In this study, utilizing a well-established mouse model of fear memory generalization, we investigated the role of endocannabinoids (eCBs)-mediated GABAergic synaptic inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in regulating contextual fear memory generalization. Our results revealed that pharmacological or genetic blockade of CB1R in hippocampal CA1 resulted in overgeneralization of contextual fear memory but not fear memory expression. Subsequent investigations in conditional knockout mice revealed the involvement of CB1R in GABAergic neurons, but not those in glutamatergic neurons or astrocytes, in this overgeneralization. In addition, activation of GABA A receptors on pyramidal neurons was required for inducing overgeneralization via AM281, a CB1R antagonist. Neural mechanistic studies showed that eCBs/CB1R signaling regulates both the activity and plasticity of inhibitory synapses during generalization, highlighting the prominence of the disinhibition of CB1R in interneurons during this process. Subsequently, we delved into the downstream effects and found that eCB-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons was regulated by the aforementioned mechanisms. Our findings illustrate that the eCBs/CB1R signaling pathway modulates the balance between fear memory discrimination and generalization by controlling inhibitory inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons, accompanied by alterations in excitatory plasticity within this region.",

          "abstract": "HvAACT1 is a major aluminum (Al)-tolerance gene in barley, encoding a citrate transporter that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. This transporter facilitates citrate secretion from the roots, thereby detoxifying external Al ions—a major constraint of crop production on acidic soils. In this study, we present the outward-facing crystal structure of HvAACT1, providing insights into a citrate transport mechanism. The putative citrate binding site consists of three basic residues—K126 in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2), R358 in TM7, and R535 in TM12—creating substantial positive charges in the C-lobe cavity. Proton coupling for substrate transport may involve two pairs of aspartate residues in the N-lobe cavity, one of which corresponds to the essential Asp pair found in prokaryotic H + -coupled MATE transporters belonging to the DinF subfamily. Structural coupling between proton uptake in the N-lobe and citrate extrusion in the C-lobe can be enabled by an extensive, unique hydrogen-bonding network at the extracellular half of the N-lobe. Mutation-based functional analysis, structural comparisons, molecular dynamics simulation, and phylogenic analysis suggest an evolutionary link between citrate MATE transporters and the DinF MATE subfamily. Our findings provide a solid structural basis for citrate transport by HvAACT1 in barley and contribute to a broader understanding of citrate transporter structures in other plant species.",

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH PVN ) control both the neuroendocrine stress axis as well as stress-associated behaviors. However, it is currently unclear how the resting activity of these neurons is coordinated with both spontaneous behavior and ultradian pulses of corticosteroid secretion. To investigate this, we performed fiber photometry recordings of CRH PVN neuron activity in Crh-Ires-Cre mice and a newly generated line of Crh-Ires-Cre rats. In both mice and rats, CRH PVN neurons displayed an ultradian rhythm of activity with reoccurring upstates of activity approximately once per hour over the 24-h day. Upstates in activity were coordinated with increases in animal activity/arousal. Chemogenetic activation of CRH PVN neurons was also sufficient to induce behavioral arousal. In rats, increases in CRH neural activity preceded some pulses of corticosteroid secretion but not others. Thus, while CRH PVN neurons display an ultradian rhythm of activity over the 24-h day that is coordinated with behavioral arousal, the relationship between CRH PVN activity and pulses of corticosteroid secretion is not one-to-one.",

In the high-latitude regions of Northern Europe that are currently subject to rapid climate warming, we lack a comprehensive understanding of faunal biodiversity in the last glacial period due to the extreme rarity of preserved organic remains. Here, we present a stratified sediment deposit with a diverse faunal composition preserved in a bone-bearing layer in Arne Qvamgrotta, part of the Storsteinhola cave system (68.10° N 16.38° E) in Northern Norway. Chronological analyses of sediments and bones including radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, uranium–thorium, and phylogenetic dating place the faunal assemblage in Marine Isotope Stage 5a (MIS 5a, Odderade interstadial, ~85 to 71 ka). Combining comparative osteology and bulk-bone metabarcoding, we identify 46 taxa, including mammals, birds, and fish, with several species not previously found in Fennoscandia. The fauna implies a nonanalogous cold-adapted coastal community, with close proximity to sea ice and nearby freshwater bodies. Mitogenome analyses of a subset of taxa identify extinct lineages which attest to a lack of habitat tracking and the absence of a local refugium during the subsequent fully glaciated periods.

          "abstract": "Kagome metals have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their potential to host exotic quantum states. Among these, CsV 3 Sb 5 has attracted significant attention for the unusual coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) order and unconventional superconductivity, presenting an ideal system for exploring the emergent phenomena from the interplay of phonons, electronic fluctuations, and topological effects. The nature of CDW formation in CsV 3 Sb 5 is unconventional and has sparked considerable debate. In this study, we examine the origin of the CDW state via ab initio finite-temperature simulations of the lattice dynamics. Through a comparative study of CsV 3 Sb 5 and 2H-NbSe 2 , we demonstrate that the experimental absence of phonon softening—a hallmark of conventional CDW transition—in CsV 3 Sb 5 along with the presence of a weakly first-order transition, can be attributed to quantum zero-point atomic motion. This zero-point motion smears the free energy landscape of CDW, effectively stabilizing the pristine structure even below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to a weak first-order transition. Our predicted lattice dynamical behavior is supported by coherent phonon spectroscopy in single-crystalline CsV 3 Sb 5 . Our results provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to no phonon softening, including cuprates, and highlight the surprising role of quantum effects in emergent properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV 3 Sb 5 .",

          "abstract": "The phage shock protein A (PspA), a bacterial member of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III superfamily, forms rod-shaped helical assemblies that internalize membrane tubules. The N-terminal helix α0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor; the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix α0 in the presence of Escherichia coli polar lipid membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: Binding of the N-terminal helix α0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix α0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix-membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends. Our results provide insights into the molecular determinants and a potential mechanism of vesicular membrane remodeling mediated by a member of the ESCRT-III superfamily.",

          "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells engage target cells via the immunological synapse (IS), where inhibitory and activating signals determine whether NK cell cytotoxicity is suppressed or activated. We previously reported that cancer cells can rapidly remodel their actin cytoskeleton upon NK cell engagement, leading to F-actin accumulation at the synapse. Here, we show that this process inhibits NK cell activation as indicated by impaired MTOC and lytic granule polarization. Exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that actin remodeling drives the recruitment of inhibitory ligands, such as HLA-A, -B, and -C, to the synapse. Disrupting HLA interaction with their cognate inhibitory receptors KIRs restores NK cell activation. Using NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR receptors, matched or unmatched to HLA molecules on cancer cells, we show that synaptic F-actin accumulation and matching KIR–HLA interactions jointly suppress NK cell cytotoxicity. Our findings reveal an immune evasion strategy in which cancer cells impair NK cell activation by altering synaptic signaling through actin cytoskeleton–driven recruitment of inhibitory signals to the IS.",

          "abstract": "Insects are declining worldwide. These declines have been documented across taxonomic groups and are worrisome given ecosystem services provided by insects. Long-term data have illuminated butterfly declines across geographic regions. However, critical questions remain on how butterfly declines are distributed across species and functional groups, limiting effective conservation. Here, we show unprecedented changes in butterfly biodiversity resulting from 32 y of species levels declines throughout the Midwestern United States. No species increased over the three-decade study period and abundance declined across every functional group (e.g., rare, common, migratory, resident; annual mean trend: −0.9 to −2.3% per year). Species richness declined across all but one functional group, with concomitant increases in evenness (e.g., abundance among species) in several groups resulting from steeper losses in abundance for common species (abundance: −1.9% per year; richness: −0.04% per year) as compared to rare species (abundance: −0.9% per year; richness: −1.33% per year). Our results paint a bleaker picture than other butterfly studies likely due to our long time series of data and ability to include rare species. Such widespread declines undoubtedly affect other trophic levels and ecosystem services. Focusing risk assessments and management interventions only on rare species is likely to be insufficient given broad declines across species, which have fundamentally restructured butterfly communities in the region. As such, conservation efforts should shift focus to species assemblages and entire communities when possible.",

          "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are nonpathogenic DNA viruses with potent gene delivery capabilities, making them essential tools in gene therapy and biomedical research. Despite their therapeutic importance, key aspects of AAV natural biology remain obscure, complicating efforts to explain rare AAV-associated diseases and optimize gene therapy vectors. By analyzing sequence data from virus isolates and endogenous viral elements (EVEs), I reveal a striking evolutionary pattern: While AAV sublineages, defined by the replication-associated ( rep ) gene, have broadly codiverged with host groups over millions of years, capsid ( cap ) diversity has been shaped by extensive recombination. In particular, one capsid lineage, Mammalian-wide ( M-wide ), has spread horizontally across diverse rep lineages and host taxa through multiple recombination events. Furthermore, several AAVs with M-wide capsids—including AAV-4, AAV-12, and bovine AAV (BAAV)—originate from historical adenovirus (Ad) stocks, raising the possibility that laboratory conditions contributed to capsid transfer. Distinguishing natural from laboratory-driven recombination is essential for understanding AAV ecology and its implications for gene therapy. A systematic sequencing effort in human and primate populations is needed to assess the extent of recombinant capsid acquisition, determine the impact of laboratory-driven recombination on circulating AAV diversity, and track ongoing recombination events that could affect vector safety and efficacy.",

          "abstract": "The Eoarchean quartz-pyroxene rock from Akilia Island in Greenland has been proposed as one of Earth’s oldest banded iron formations (BIF) and a potential host for the earliest biosignatures. However, the origin of its protolith, whether it metamorphosed from an igneous or sedimentary precursor, remains debated. Here, we revisit this longstanding Akilia controversy using potassium isotope analyses, comparing Akilia samples with BIFs and black shales spanning the Eoarchean to Mesoproterozoic. Our results demonstrate that BIFs and black shales show systematic potassium isotope variations correlated with their potassium contents. Potassium-poor BIF layers display heavier isotopic compositions close to seawater values, whereas clay-rich layers exhibit elevated potassium contents and lighter isotopic signatures. The Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock was initially characterized by low potassium concentrations and heavy potassium isotopic compositions consistent with chemical sediments deposited from ancient seawater. It was subsequently modified by metasomatic fluids derived from nearby metamorphosed igneous rocks. These findings support a sedimentary origin for the Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock. Furthermore, our study provides an isotopic framework for interpreting ancient oceanic environments and offers insights into the potassium cycling and habitability of early Earth.",

          "abstract": "Self-assembly (SA) plays a pivotal role in nanotechnology, offering cost-effective methods for bottom–up fabrication and providing versatile model systems for investigating fundamental interactions in various bioinspired systems. However, current methods for investigating and quantifying the dynamics of SA systems are limited in their applicability to planar interfaces, particularly in liquid environments. These methods typically rely on analyzing the collective behavior of particle suspensions rather than directly probing the specific interactions between individual particles. Here, we introduce Casimir self-assembly (CaSA) as a platform, integrating colloidal science, nanophotonics, and fluctuational electrodynamics to study long-range interactions and stability in planar SA systems. Using thermal fluctuations as a probe and visible-range Fabry–Pérot resonances as an optical readout, we demonstrate that CaSA enables a direct in situ study of the Casimir–Lifshitz electrostatic interaction. This approach allows us to map stability regimes of colloidal materials by varying ionic strength and identifying conditions for stable assembly and aggregation limits, and moreover is used to measure the surface charge density of an individual colloidal object down to fractions of an electron charge per square nanometer. Our platform overcomes the limitations of current methods, providing an experimental tool for exploring SA dynamics in situ and expanding the understanding of suspension stability in liquids at the single-particle level. With potential for future applications, CaSA is scalable for studying interfacial forces and is adaptable to multivalent electrolytes and biosensing.",

          "abstract": "Influenza represents a significant threat with seasonal epidemics that can transition to global pandemics, and cross-species infection presenting a continuous challenge. While vaccines and several antiviral drugs are available, constant genetic changes vitiate these prevention and treatment options. Consequently, we decided to search for inhibitors against one of the virus’s validated drug targets, its M2 channel that is blocked by aminoadamantanes. Regrettably, widespread mutations in M2 abolish the antiflu activity of said blockers. Therefore, we devised bacteria-based genetic assays that can screen for drugs against aminoadamantane-sensitive and resistant M2 channels and map the resistance potential of any identifiable blocker. Subsequent in cellulo testing and structure–activity relationship studies yielded a synergistic combination of two compounds, Theobromine and Arainosine, that exhibited remarkable antiviral activity by directly inhibiting the virus’s channel. The drug duo was potent against H1N1 pandemic swine flu, H5N1 pandemic avian flu, and aminoadamantane-resistant and sensitive strains alike, exhibiting activity that surpassed oseltamivir, the leading antiflu drug on the market. When this drug duo was tested in an animal model, it once more outperformed oseltamivir, considerably reducing disease symptoms and viral RNA progeny. Importantly, harnessing the bacterial genetic selection, we could demonstrate that the drug duo’s potential for eliciting drug resistance is significantly smaller and molecularly distinct from that of aminoadamantanes. In conclusion, the outcome of this study represents a new potential treatment option for influenza alongside an approach that is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other viral targets.",

          "abstract": "The molecular origins of water’s anomalous properties have long been a subject of scientific inquiry. The liquid–liquid phase transition hypothesis, which posits the existence of distinct low-density and high-density liquid states separated by a first-order phase transition terminating at a critical point, has gained increasing experimental and computational support and offers a thermodynamically consistent framework for many of water’s anomalies. However, experimental challenges in avoiding crystallization near the postulated liquid–liquid critical point have focused attention to water’s canonical glassy states: low-density and high-density amorphous ice. Here, we use two Deep Potential machine-learning models, trained on the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed density functional and the highly accurate Many-Body Polarizable potential, to conduct an investigation of water’s glassy phenomenology based on quantum mechanical calculations. Despite not being explicitly trained on amorphous ices, both models accurately capture the structure and transformation of the water glasses, including their interconversion along different thermodynamic paths. Isobaric quenching of liquid water at various pressures generates a continuum of intermediate amorphous ices and density fluctuations increase near the liquid–liquid critical pressure. The glass transition temperatures of the amorphous ices produced at different pressures exhibit two distinct branches, corresponding to low-density and high-density amorphous ice behaviors, consistent with experiment and the liquid–liquid transition hypothesis. Extrapolating transformation pressures from isothermal compressions to experimental compression rates brings our simulations into excellent agreement with data. Our findings demonstrate that machine-learning potentials trained on equilibrium phases can effectively model nonequilibrium glassy behavior and pave the way for studying long-timescale, out-of-equilibrium processes with quantum mechanical accuracy.",

These functions are driven by contraction of the orbicularis oculi (OO), which is a unique skeletal muscle with a circular geometry and diffuse innervation. It is thought that this distributed innervation may allow for differential segmental activation and contraction, but it is not currently understood how sequenced activation patterns relate to differential muscle contraction, nor how segmental contraction creates the kinematics that drive the eyelid’s critical functions. In fact, motion of the eyelid has predominantly been modeled in only a single dimension (open–close). Here, we show that eyelid motion has important two-dimensional features that vary between eyelid behaviors. Using distributed intramuscular electromyography, we further show that activation differs segmentally across the OO, and that patterns of activation change to produce different behavior-specific eyelid kinematics. Our results demonstrate the role of segmental activation in eyelid motion, highlighting the importance of precise neural control in producing natural eyelid behavior. We anticipate that this research is a starting point for robust mechanistic models of eyelid function. This knowledge has critical implications for diagnosis and treatment of eyelid paralysis.",

          "abstract": "Identifying reaction intermediates is a critical component of elucidating the mechanisms of chemical reactions. Spectroscopic techniques are instrumental in this identification process. The capacity of AI to establish the correlations between spectra and chemical substances renders it a suitable tool for spectra analysis. However, the presence of limited data, or even the absence of data, is a common occurrence for intermediates with transient characteristics. This poses a significant challenge in meeting the data requirements of AI models. Herein, we propose a generalizable machine learning model that utilizes zero-shot learning to identify chemical reaction intermediates by their spectra in unseen catalytic systems. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and visual dimensionality reduction, it was determined that the model’s superior generalizability is attributable to its capacity of learning common patterns of spectra-intermediates, effectively mapping disparate catalytic systems to analogous digital spaces. Therefore, the model can be directly used without fine-tuning parameters for unseen systems even in the presence of noise or solvents. This work demonstrates the application of zero-shot learning in machine learned spectroscopy and illustrates the prediction mechanism, providing a perspective for interpretable and robust cross-system prediction. It lays a solid foundation for the application of spectral descriptors in real reaction systems and the comprehension of chemical reaction mechanisms.",

We show that the nonequilibrium kinetics at which these elongated links, or spaghetti, adhere to the available volume without mutual crossings is logarithmic in time, as opposed to the algebraic growth in lower dimensions for needle-like packings. We attribute this qualitatively different behavior to a delay in the activation of depletion forces caused by the 3D nature of the problem. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict the kinetic scaling characterizing an algebraic growth due to the nucleation of local bundles.

Despite extensive studies of this organism, the metabolic mechanisms driving its adaptation to varying niches remain elusive. We here gathered genomic resources from 1,807 S. cerevisiae strains and assembled them into a high-quality pangenome, facilitating the comprehensive characterization of genetic diversity across isolates. Utilizing the pangenome, 1,807 strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (ssGEMs) were generated, which performed well in quantitative predictions of cellular phenotypes, thus helping to examine the metabolic disparities among all S. cerevisiae strains. Integrative analyses of fluxomics and transcriptomics with ssGEMs showcased ubiquitous transcriptional regulation of metabolic flux in specific pathways (i.e., amino acid synthesis) at a population level. Additionally, the gene/reaction inactivation analysis through the ssGEMs refined by transcriptomics showed that S. cerevisiae strains from various ecological niches had undergone reductive evolution at both the genomic and metabolic network levels when compared to wild isolates. Finally, the compiled analysis of the pangenome, transcriptome, and metabolic fluxome revealed remarkable metabolic differences among S. cerevisiae strains originating from distinct oxygen-limited niches, including human gut and cheese environments, and identified convergent metabolic evolution, such as downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Together, these results illustrate how yeast adapts to distinct niches modulated by genomic and metabolic reprogramming, and provide computational resources for translating yeast genotype to fitness in future studies.",

We extend this concept by engineering phage λ to deliver CRISPR-guided transposases, accomplishing large insertions and targeted gene disruptions. To achieve this, we engineered phage λ using homologous recombination paired with Cas13a-based counterselection for precise phage modifications. Initially, we established the utility of Cas13a in phage λ by conducting minimal recoding edits, deletions, and insertions. Subsequently, we scaled up the engineering to embed the comprehensive DNA-editing CRISPR-Cas transposase (DART) system within the phage genome, creating λ-DART phages. These modified λ-DART phages were then employed to infect Escherichia coli , generating CRISPR RNA-guided transposition events in the host genome. Applying our engineered λ-DART phages to monocultures and a mixed bacterial community comprising three genera led to efficient, precise, and specific gene knockouts and insertions in the targeted E. coli cells, achieving editing efficiencies surpassing 50% of the population. This research enhances phage-mediated genome editing by enabling efficient in situ gene integrations in bacteria, offering an avenue for further application in microbial community contexts.

However, there are several interactions whose biological relevance remains obscure, such as the ability of NS1 to bind and activate class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). PI3Ks are highly regulated lipid kinases that act as critical nodes in multiple cell signaling networks and are also important proto-oncogenes. This activation is mediated by NS1 binding specifically to the p85β subunit. To better understand the consequences of this interaction, we developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to selectively track the different PI3K heterodimers and, using this system, we found that NS1 induces an isoform-specific relocation and activation of the different PI3K heterodimers. We found that clinically relevant oncogenic mutations in both catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3K could mimic the effect caused by NS1, and partially rescue the loss of viral fitness in a recombinant virus encoding a p85β-binding deficient NS1.",

In this study, we developed a computational workflow to identify viral introductions and trace locally circulating clusters. We analyzed over 26,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and their associated metadata, collected between January and October 2021, to explore introduction and local dispersal patterns in Greater Houston, a major metropolitan area known for its demographic diversity. Our analysis identified more than 1,000 independent introduction events, resulting in clusters of varying sizes. The majority of introductions originated from domestic sources, while international introductions occurred earlier and were associated with larger cluster sizes. An analysis of locally circulating clusters revealed age-structured transmission dynamics. Geographic reconstruction of cluster spread identified Harris County as the primary viral source for surrounding areas. The outbreak in the source population was characterized by 1) a smaller proportion of new cases associated with external viral imports and 2) longer persistence times of circulating lineages. Overall, our high-resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic provides essential insights into the local-scale transmission landscape, supporting outbreak-specific, regional response strategies and public health planning.",

          "abstract": "The question of whether or not passive subwavelength cavities can alter the properties of quantum materials is currently attracting a great deal of attention. In this article, we show that the Fermi liquid parameters of a two-dimensional metal are modified by cavity polariton modes, and that these changes can be monitored by measuring a paradigmatic magneto-transport phenomenon, Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in a weak perpendicular magnetic field. This effect is intrinsic, and totally unrelated to disorder. As an illustrative example, we carry out explicit calculations of the quasiparticle velocity of graphene in a planar van der Waals cavity formed by natural hyperbolic crystals and metal gates. The largest effects of the cavity occur when the phonon polariton modes of the former match energetically the graphene plasmon. For typical graphene carrier densities this occurs in the Terahertz spectral range.",

          "abstract": "Efficient gene expression depends on the tightly regulated export of messenger RNA (mRNA) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which are densely modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Although dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to a variety of human diseases, the precise distribution of O-GlcNAc within the NPC and its effects on mRNA export remain poorly understood. Here, we combined single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction (SPEED) microscopy with stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to map the nanometer-scale distribution of an O-GlcNAc analog (GlcNAz) within NPCs and to quantify the export kinetics of mRNA–protein complexes (mRNPs) under both normal and perturbed O-GlcNAcylation conditions. Under basal conditions, GlcNAz is predominantly localized around the central channel of the NPC. However, both hypo- and hyper-O-GlcNAcylation cause GlcNAz to redistribute toward the nuclear and cytoplasmic peripheries. This shift is paralleled by changes in mRNP localization and altered distributions of key, highly O-GlcNAcylated, phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins. These architectural rearrangements are accompanied by functional consequences: Elevated O-GlcNAcylation nearly doubles mRNA export efficiency (~61%), while reduced O-GlcNAcylation lowers it to ~16%, along with reduced NPC engagement. The transport receptor TAP exhibits analogous efficiency changes, reinforcing the role of O-GlcNAcylation as a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Together, these results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation modulates NPC architecture and transport dynamics to fine-tune mRNA export, and indicate that targeted modulation of NPC O-GlcNAc levels may offer a promising strategy for addressing diseases associated with nuclear transport dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "X-succinate synthases (XSSs) are glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) that catalyze the addition of hydrocarbons to fumarate via radical chemistry, thereby activating them for microbial metabolism. To date, the only structurally characterized XSS is benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS), which functionalizes toluene. A distinct subclass of XSSs acts on saturated hydrocarbons, which possess much stronger C(sp 3 )–H bonds than toluene, suggesting mechanistic and structural differences from BSS. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of one such enzyme, (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase (MASS) from Azoarcus strain HxN1, which functionalizes n -alkanes (C6–C8). The structure reveals an asymmetric dimer in which both sides contain a catalytic α-subunit and accessory γ-subunit. One α-subunit also binds two additional subunits, β and δ. The β-subunit binds a [4Fe–4S] cluster and adopts a fold similar to BSSβ. The β-subunit appears to regulate the flexibility of the α-subunit to enable opening of the active site, affording the binding of n -alkane substrates. The δ-subunit, which lacks homology to known GRE subunits, adopts a rubredoxin-like fold that binds a single Fe ion, an architecture not previously reported for GREs. MASSδ occupies the same region of the α-subunit as the activating enzyme (AE) and may regulate the conformational changes required for glycyl radical installation. Structural comparisons between MASS and BSS reveal differences in how fumarate is bound and show amino acid substitutions that could account for the binding of alkanes versus toluene. Together, this structure offers insight into anaerobic alkane activation via fumarate addition.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria and phages have been in an ongoing arms race for billions of years. To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by counterdefense mechanisms of specific phages. These defense/counterdefense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed “pan-immune” system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka–Volterra type model of a bacteria/phage community interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counterdefense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counterdefense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a “dying” strain survives, thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain. This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the “island migration” model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.",

          "abstract": "During development, groups of cells generate shape by coordinating their mechanical properties through an interplay of self-organization and prepatterning. Hydra displays a striking planar pattern of actin fibers at the organism scale, and mechanics influence the morphogenesis of biological structures during its prepatterned regeneration. However, how mechanics participate in the formation of an ordered pattern from a totally disordered state remains unknown. To study this, we used cellular aggregates formed from dissociated Hydra cells, which initially lose all actin polarity yet regenerate a long-range actin pattern. We showed quantitatively that the actin meshwork evolves from a disordered symmetric state to an ordered state in which rotational symmetry is broken, and translation symmetry is partially broken, with the nematic and smectic order parameters increasing over days. During the first hours, the actin meshwork displayed spatial heterogeneity in the nematic order parameter, and ordered domains separated by line defects progressively grew and fused. This suggests that local cell–cell interactions drive the transition from disorder to order. To understand the mechanism of ordering, we perturbed the tissue’s physical constraints. We showed that while topology and geometry do not have a direct effect, anisotropic stretch biases the emerging orientation of the actin meshwork within hours. Surprisingly, although a Wnt head organizer is expected to play a role in the actin ordering, the stretch-associated alignment happened without the prior formation of a head organizer. This demonstrates the role of tissue mechanics in the alignment of the actin fibers during the disorder-to-order transition.",

          "abstract": "Small open reading frames (smORFs) encode microproteins that play crucial roles in various biological processes, yet their functions in adipocyte biology remain largely unexplored. In a previous study, we identified thousands of smORFs in white and brown adipocytes derived from the stromal vascular fraction of mice using ribosome profiling. Here, we expand on this work by identifying additional smORFs related to adipocytes using the in vitro 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model. To systematically investigate the functional relevance of these smORFs, we designed a custom CRISPR/Cas9 single guide RNA (sgRNA) library and screened for smORFs influencing adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. Through a dropout screen and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting of lipid droplets, we identified dozens of smORFs that regulate either cell proliferation or lipid accumulation. The smORFs on the 5’- and 3’-untranslated regions (i.e., upstream smORFs (uORFs) and downstream smORFs (dORFs)) of functional genes can exert activity through cis-regulatory effects of the main ORF on these messenger RNAs (mRNAs), such as uORFs of MDM2 that impact proliferation. However, other smORFs, especially those from mRNAs with no other ORFs, point to a functional microprotein. Indeed, we tested a candidate smORF 1183 from a long noncoding RNA 923011K14Rik and demonstrated that the microprotein regulates adipocyte differentiation. These findings highlight the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based screening to uncover functional smORFs and provide a framework for further exploration of microproteins in adipocyte biology and metabolic regulation.",

However, this notion has proven difficult to test given the overall uncertainty about both geographic locations and paleoclimates of ancestral species. By the resolution of both challenges, we reveal that early primates dispersed and radiated in higher latitudes, through diverse climates, including cold, arid, and temperate conditions. Contrary to expectations of the warm tropical forest hypothesis, warmer global temperatures had no effect on dispersal distances or the speciation rate. Rather, the amount of change in local temperature and precipitation substantially predicted geographic and species diversity. Our results suggest that nontropical, changeable environments exerted strong selective pressures on primates with higher dispersal ability – promoting the primate radiation and their subsequent colonization of tropical climates millions of years after their origin.",

Orally administered ADRIANA has potent analgesic effects in several nociceptive pain models of mice and nonhuman primates without cardiovascular effects. Mice with genetic loss of the α2B adrenoceptor showed normal responses to mechanical pain, but the analgesic effect of ADRIANA was not significantly detected.

During thymocyte maturation, single-positive thymocytes were found to develop more and longer microvilli than double-positive thymocytes. However, the deletion or inhibition of Cdc42, a small Rho family protein, significantly reduced both the number and length of microvilli in single-positive thymocytes, leading to decreased cell mass. This reduction in microvilli correlates with a decrease in antigen recognition, leading to diminished T cell activation and adhesion, as well as reduced TIS production, while intrinsic migratory properties remain unaffected.

However, the template RNA species that undergoes RAN translation endogenously remains unclear.

These cryptic m 7 G-capped mRNAs are at least partially polyadenylated and are more abundant than transcripts derived from intron retention or circular intron lariats. In RAN translation reporter assays, intronic template transcripts–even those with short (32 nucleotide) leaders–exhibited robust expression compared to exon–intron and repeat-containing lariat reporters. To assess endogenous repeat-containing lariat RNA contributions to RAN translation, we enhanced endogenous lariat stability by knocking down the lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1.

Type II anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) inhibit and control Cas9 but are generally impermeable to the cell membrane due to their size and anionic charge. Moreover, existing Acr delivery methods are long-lived and operate within hours (e.g., viral and nonviral vectors) or require external devices (e.g., electroporation), limiting therapeutic applications. To address these problems, we developed a protein-based anti-CRISPR delivery platform, LF N -Acr/PA, which delivers Acrs into cells within minutes. LF N -Acr/PA is a nontoxic, two-component protein system derived from anthrax toxin, where protective antigen (PA) proteins bind receptors widespread in human cells, forming a pH-triggered endosomal pore that an engineered Acr (LF N -Acr) binds and uses to enter the cell. In the presence of PA, LF N -Acr enters human cells (e.g., immortalized cell lines, embryonic stem cells, and 3D cell cultures) at concentrations as low as 2.5 pM to inhibit up to 95% of Cas9-mediated knockout, knock-in, transcriptional activation, and base editing. Timing LF N -Acr delivery reduces off-target base editing and increases Cas9 specificity by 41%.

Here, we address this issue by presenting a crustal-scale analytical signal-amplitude model obtained from high-resolution airborne and shipborne magnetic data across cratons within East Asia. Magmatic, magnetic, and basin-history constraints show that the eastern North China craton experienced focused weakening, thickening, and catastrophic destruction of its mantle lithosphere due to a unique combination of circum-craton subduction and subsequent collision since the Paleozoic. By contrast, the adjacent South China craton was not impacted in this way, and thus, its mantle root was spared from destruction. The long-term survival of cratons may stem from the infrequent occurrence of sustained circum-cratonic subduction or collisional processes capable of destabilizing their lithospheric roots.",

During the second decline in CO 2 (72 to 68 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred throughout the deep Atlantic (&gt;2,000 m water depth). Paired with δ 13 C and δ 18 O vertical profiles from the same locations, the [CO 3 2 − ] results suggest progressively greater sequestration of biological carbon occurred in the South Atlantic as the volume of Southern Source Water expanded during glacial inception. Shoaling of the carbonate ion saturation horizon during the second decline in pCO 2 resulted in seafloor calcium carbonate dissolution and enhanced alkalinity, likely contributing to further draw down of atmospheric CO 2 . We also document carbon release from the deep South Atlantic during glacial Terminations I and II when atmospheric CO 2 was rising. Overall, our results highlight the tight linkage between pCO 2 and deep Atlantic carbon storage over the last glacial cycle.",

          "abstract": "Air-breathing vertebrates incorporate a fraction of isotopically anomalous air O 2 in their body water. The 17 O isotope anomaly of air O 2 (expressed as Δ’ 17 O air ) is related to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations ( p CO 2 ) and gross primary production (GPP). Tooth enamel records the Δ’ 17 O of body water and can thus preserve such paleo- p CO 2 or paleo-GPP information over geological time periods. Here, we demonstrate the potential of respective reconstructions of atmospheric p CO 2 or GPP from the triple oxygen isotope composition of fossil dinosaur tooth enamel. The data from unaltered enamel samples, along with an assumed modern GPP t /GPP 0 ratio of 1 for the Mesozoic, suggest a mean Late Jurassic p CO 2 = 1,200 ± 150 ppmv and Late Cretaceous p CO 2 = 750 ± 200 ppmv. These estimates are in good agreement with other p CO 2 proxy data for the same time intervals. When utilizing a p CO 2 inferred from other proxies, tooth enamel Δ’ 17 O PO4 may also serve as a proxy for GPP. Using published p CO 2 data, we reconstructed GPP t /GPP 0 ratios with 1.20 ± 0.17 for the Late Jurassic and 2.24 ± 0.96 for the Late Cretaceous, which would imply a 20 to 120% higher GPP in the Mesozoic than today. Overall, triple oxygen isotope analysis of fossil teeth of terrestrial amniotes can provide insights into past atmospheric greenhouse gas content and global primary productivity.",

Through RNA-seq analysis of primary brain glial cells, we identified immune-responsive gene 1 ( Irg1 ) as one of the highly upregulated genes under inflammatory conditions. Validation in the spinal cords of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical MS model, confirmed elevated Irg1 levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells in the EAE group, raising concerns as to whether Irg1 is detrimental or protective. Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease, increased mononuclear cell infiltration, and increased levels of triple-positive CD4+ T cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFNγ. Adoptive transfer in Rag-1 KO and single-cell RNA sequencing highlighted the crucial role of Irg1 in shaping pathogenic Th17 cells. A lack of Irg1 in macrophages elevates Class II expression, promoting the polarization of myelin-primed CD4+ T cells into pathogenic Th17 cells via the NLRP3/IL-1β axis. Moreover, bone marrow chimeras revealed that immune cells lacking Irg1 maintained pathogenic and inflammatory phenotypes, suggesting its protective role in autoimmune diseases, including MS.",

          "abstract": "DNA loop extrusion by cohesin has emerged as a critical pathway for chromosome organization. In vitro single-molecule experiments indicate that loop extrusion requires the assembly of a heteropentameric complex consisting of the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer, STAG1, NIPBL, and the kleisin SCC1. The complexity of the complete extrusion machinery, consisting of multiple subunits, DNA binding sites, and ATPases poses substantial challenges for revealing the underlying biomolecular mechanism. As a result, a number of different models have been proposed, many of which do not agree on key mechanistic aspects, such as the details of DNA loading, holoenzyme assembly, or the consequences of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we use mass photometry to comprehensively quantify all the key biomolecular interactions required for DNA loop extrusion. We find that STAG1 binds tightly to the trimeric complex formed by the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer and SCC1, and together they weakly, but cooperatively, bind the DNA. Full-length NIPBL tightly binds DNA, acting as a DNA anchor during the mechanochemical loop extrusion cycle. Cohesin mutants incapable of head engagement, and those lacking DNA-binding domains in the ATPase heads show negligible differences in overall DNA-affinity, suggesting a minor role of these features for DNA binding. Instead, we find an ATP-modulated DNA binding site created by the interaction of STAG1 with SMC1/SMC3/SCC1, important for repeated grabbing and release of DNA critical to extrusion. Our results call for a careful reexamination of the proposed mechanisms and set energetic boundaries for future proposals.",

Whether this functional coupling is universally conserved across eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we show using long read RNA sequencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that splicing inactivation does not result in widespread CPA impairment, and that inactivation of CPA has limited impact on splicing efficiency. The negative impact of CPA inactivation on splicing is mainly due to transcription termination defects that promote readthrough transcription, leading to splicing inhibition for downstream intron-containing genes. The deleterious effect of 5′ extensions on splicing is length-dependent and can be detected independently from CPA inactivation for endogenous or synthetic genes. Deficient termination can also promote usage of cryptic splice sites and long-range intergenic splicing events. These results argue against a broad coupling between splicing and CPA in S. cerevisiae but show that efficient CPA-mediated transcription termination is critical for splicing fidelity and efficiency in a compact genome.",

Here, we demonstrate this link for the important problem of thermal convection. We show how the hierarchical plume network in the near-wall region of the flow, which becomes increasingly sparse with increasing distance away from the wall, is connected to the marginal stability of the thermal boundary layer and the resulting global heat transport. Our results, which are based on a series of direct numerical simulations for Rayleigh numbers up to R a = 10 11 in a relatively shallow layer, suggest a highly fluctuating thermal boundary layer that is composed of local building blocks in terms of plumes, which are the essential drivers of turbulent heat transport. These thermal plumes are found in a dynamically perpetual process of formation and aggregation that can be described, particularly well for Rayleigh numbers R a ≳ 10 9 , by a von Smoluchowski equation resulting in a gamma distribution of the local plume spacing, consistent with measurements. Similarity manifests with respect to the horizontal extension of the network, the vertical hierarchical plume clustering away from the wall and the number of plumes, over an order of magnitude of the thermal boundary layer thickness. Our findings suggest the dominance of dynamical local processes near the wall, rather than a global boundary layer instability.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the expression of CD45 isoforms on human yellow fever virus vaccine (YFV-17D) specific CD8 T cells longitudinally after vaccination. As expected, effector CD8 T cells at day 14 express CD45RO but within 4 to 6 wk these virus-specific CD8 T cells become CD45RA positive and remain CD45RA for &gt;10 y. The journey for these YFV-specific CD8 T cells goes from naive (CD45RA+ CCR7+) to effector/effector memory (CD45RO+ CCR7−) to Temra (CD45RA+ CCR7−) to stem-cell memory (CD45RA+ CCR7+). These YFV-specific CD8 T cells rarely acquire the canonical Tcm phenotype (CD45RO+ CCR7+). This CD45RO to RA switch coincides with clearance of YFV, so we hypothesized that antigen may be playing a role in regulating CD45 expression. We addressed this issue by ex vivo analysis and provide evidence that this switch is indeed regulated by antigen. Sorted YFV-specific CD45RO effector CD8 T cells reexpress CD45RA when cultured ex vivo in the absence of antigen and retain CD45RO in the presence of cognate peptide. We also extended these ex vivo analysis to human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD8 T cells and show that CD45RO cells transition to CD45RA in the absence of antigen and CD45RA cells become CD45RO when stimulated with CMV peptide. We then show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike-specific CD8 T cells can repeatedly undergo the same CD45RA to RO to RA transition in vivo after the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Again, the canonical Tcm phenotype spike-specific memory CD8 T cells were not readily detectable. These studies warrant a reevaluation of how human memory CD8 T cells are defined.",

Inside the protein matrix, chromophore nonplanarity and flexibility have long been argued to govern the fluorescence efficiency of FPs, yet their fundamental roles and relative importance have been elusive which hinder the rational design of versatile FPs and biosensors. Herein, we tackle this central question by investigating two recently engineered FP-based turn-on chloride (Cl – ) sensors, ChlorON1 and 3, using an ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopic toolset together with advanced multireference simulations for both structure and spectrum. We elucidate that fluorescence enhancement of the chloride-bound ChlorON3 stems from a substantially more twisted chromophore than ChlorON1 via comprehensive simulations starting from the available crystal structure of parent protein (mNeonGreen), also featuring an enhanced radiative pathway due to an adjacent leucine residue in the emissive population. This finding indicates that the commonly stated chromophore planarity is not, but conformational rigidity is, the decisive factor for high fluorescence efficiency. Such mechanistic insights into FPs are generalizable to chromoproteins and other photosensitive biomolecules, which can facilitate the targeted design of brighter and/or tunable biosensors.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is the origin of a novel tissue that attracts resources, spreads beyond boundaries, avoids normal controls, and escapes immunity. How does a novel tissue arise? The puzzle is that two seemingly different processes appear to be the primary driving force. On the one hand, overwhelming evidence links (epi)genetic driver mutations to the origin and progression of tumors. Common oncogenic mutations such as KRAS accelerate cell division, and common knockouts of tumor suppressors such as TP53 abrogate cell death or checks on cell division. On the other hand, cancerous tissues create complex traits that require intricate changes in cells and multiple interactions between different cell types. Such novelty often arises by hijacking the developmental plasticity that normally creates the diverse cells and tissues of our bodies from a single original zygotic cell. How can we reconcile the simple genetic changes in carcinogenesis with the complex developmental plasticity that creates novel tissues? This perspective advocates a new model. (Epi)genetic mutations release developmental plasticity. That developmental plasticity creates novel cellular interactions and complex tissues. Initially, novel traits created by developmental plasticity may not be stably heritable, thus subsequent (epi)genetic changes must stabilize the phenotypic novelty. Recent studies show how classic oncogenic and tumor suppressor driver mutations, such as KRAS and TP53 , may primarily act in early carcinogenesis as broad releasers of developmental plasticity rather than as stimulators of cell division or knockout of limitations on cellular clonal expansion. In the new model, genetics releases, plasticity creates, and genetics stabilizes.",

In comparison, much less is known about the elementary conformational control mechanisms at the ribosome. Yet, proteins encounter major folding and aggregation challenges during translation. Here, using selective ribosome profiling and optical tweezers with correlated single-molecule fluorescence, with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as a model system, we show that the Escherichia coli chaperone trigger factor (TF) accelerates nascent chain folding. TF scans nascent chains by transient binding events, and then locks into a stable binding mode as the chain collapses and folds. This interplay is reciprocal: TF binding collapses nascent chains and stabilizes partial folds, while nascent chain compaction prolongs TF binding. Ongoing translation controls these cooperative effects, with TF-accelerated folding depending on the emergence of a peptide segment that is central to the core DHFR beta-sheet. The folding acceleration we report here impacts processes that depend on folding occurring cotranslationally, including cotranslational protein assembly, protein aggregation, and translational pausing, and may be relevant to other domains of life.",

Current treatments are limited to supplemental and/or hyperbaric oxygen to accelerate CO elimination. Even with oxygen therapy, nearly half of CO poisoning survivors suffer long-term cardiac and neurocognitive deficits related to slow CO clearance, highlighting a need for point of care antidotal therapies. Given the natural interaction between CO and ferrous heme, we hypothesized that the hemoprotein RcoM, a transcriptional regulator of microbial CO metabolism, would make an ideal platform for CO-selective scavenging from endogenous hemoproteins. We engineered an RcoM truncate (RcoM-HBD-CCC) that exhibits high CO affinity ( K a,CO = 2.8 × 10 10 M −1 ), remarkable selectivity for CO over oxygen ( K a,O2 = 1.4 × 10 5 M −1 ; K a,CO / K a,O2 = 1.9 × 10 5 ), thermal stability (T m = 72 °C), and slow autoxidation rate ( k ox = 1.1 h −1 ). In a murine model of acute CO poisoning, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC accelerated CO clearance from hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs) and was rapidly excreted in urine. Moreover, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC elicited minimal hypertension in mice compared to infused globins (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and neuroglobin), attributed to a comparatively limited reactivity toward nitric oxide (NO) via dioxygenation [ k NOD (RcoM) = 6 to 8 × 10 6 M −1 s −1 vs k NOD (Hb) = 6 to 8 × 10 7 M −1 s −1 ]. These data suggest that RcoM-HBD-CCC is a safe, selective, and efficacious CO scavenger. By limiting hypertension through minimal NO scavenging, RcoM-HBD-CCC improves end-organ adverse effects compared with other hemoprotein-based therapeutics.",

Successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional subregion of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, that supports goal-directed behavior.",

While previous research has shown that neuronal activity can regulate ribosome localization and modify translation rates, little is known about ribosomal assembly within neuronal processes. Here, we investigated the potential for local ribosome maturation in rat neurons using proteomics, RNA sequencing, and imaging methods. We detected an abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors in distal neuronal compartments, particularly those associated with the late stages of ribosome assembly. Moreover, we detected cytosolic pre-ribosomal RNA species in dendrites, as well as the enzymes necessary for their processing, suggesting that local ribosome maturation can occur far from the nucleus. These findings challenge conventional models that confine ribosome biogenesis to nuclear and perinuclear regions and suggest that neurons may fine-tune local protein synthesis by regulating ribosome assembly near synaptic sites. This mechanism may enable rapid modulation of the translational capacity in response to physiological changes, regulating synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis in neurons.",

Here, we revealed that during the larval–prepupal transition in Drosophila melanogaster , the 20E-activated Kr-h1-BR-C axis is a prerequisite for wing disc morphogenesis. Mechanistically, 20E-EcR/USP-Met-Tai directly activates Kr-h1 that upregulates BR-C expression via the positive Kr-h1 binding sites (PKBS) in the BR-C enhancers. Furthermore, we showed that 20E-induced H3K27 acetylation increases chromatin accessibility of the PKBS-containing enhancers, facilitating the maximum of BR-C expression that promotes developmental transitions. Collectively, in response to different hormone stimuli, a single transcription factor either negatively or positively regulates the expression of the same target gene depending on chromatin accessibility of its different enhancer regions, thus manipulating distinct developmental events.",

Simplified models must negotiate a tradeoff between tractability, predictive power, and ease of interpretation. We present a modeling paradigm for estimating predictive, mechanistic models of neurons and small circuits that navigates these issues using methods from systems theory. The key insight is that membrane currents can be modeled using two scalable system components optimized for learning: linear state space models, and nonlinear artificial neural networks. Combining these components, we construct two types of membrane currents: lumped currents, which are flexible, and data-driven conductance-based currents, which are interpretable. The resulting class of models—which we call recurrent mechanistic models (RMMs)—can be trained in a matter of seconds to minutes on intracellular recordings during an electrophysiology experiment, representing a step change in performance over previous approaches. As a proof-of-principle, we use RMMs to learn the dynamics of two groups of neurons, and their synaptic connections, in the Stomatogastric Ganglion, a well-known central pattern generator. Due to their reliability, efficiency, and interpretability, RMMs enable qualitatively new kinds of experiments using predictive models in closed-loop neurophysiology and online estimation of neural properties in living preparations.",

The disorder features severely thickened, red, and scaly skin at sites of wound healing or repetitive movement including on the face, genitals, flexural areas, and the palms and soles. EMP2 has previously been shown to directly associate with focal adhesion kinase, which links cell junction forces to signaling pathways relevant to proliferation, migration, and wound healing. Using single-cell spatial transcriptomics in affected tissue, we found ectopic suprabasal activation of signaling pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which we confirmed with western blotting in affected cells, supporting a gain-of-function mechanism for mutant EMP2. Remarkably, treatment with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, led to marked clinical improvement underscoring the key role of EMP2 in epidermal differentiation and proliferation.",

Especially brain vasomotion and arterial pulsations modulated by noradrenaline drive the intracranial fluid dynamics. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) entails lessened orexinergic output to wake-promoting systems including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus. As arousal state and noradrenergic signaling affect CSF-ISF clearance, we chose patients with NT1 as a human orexin-targeted model of sleep-related pathology bridging the gap between healthy awake and sleep with respect to CSF flow pulsations. We also investigated the sensitivity of magnetic resonance encephalography to detect flow with a phantom model and sought to replicate earlier pulsation findings in sleep. In this case–control study, we used fast functional MRI to map brain pulsations in groups of healthy sleeping controls (n = 13), healthy awake controls (n = 79), and awake NT1 (n = 21) patients. We measured the very low frequency (0.008 to 0.1) and cardiorespiratory frequencies and calculated in each frequency band the coefficient of variation, spectral power, and full band spectral entropy to obtain brain pulsation maps. We uncovered a brain pulsation profile from healthy waking to sleep to a sleep-related pathology NT1 prominently affected in the vascular-related vasomotor and brain arterial pulsations. Our results established how drivers of brain hydrodynamics are affected by a specific loss of key neurotransmitter governing arousal compared to healthy sleep. We also showed with a phantom model that MREG is sensitive to flow-related signal changes and solidified evidence of brain pulsations in the healthy states of sleep and wakefulness.",

Here, we compare germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice to assess the effects of the gut microbiota on placental/fetal development at embryonic day (E)11.5 (end of placentation) and E17.5 (near term). Pregnancy- and microbiota-associated changes in gene expression occur along the gut, including those related to angiogenesis, while bacterial composition and fermentation activity remain stable. Placental weights at E11.5 and fetal weights at E17.5 are significantly reduced in GF animals. Compared to CONV-R dams, the GF maternal decidua exhibits similar vascular histomorphometric features at E11.5 and E17.5, and numbers of uterine NK-cells (effectors of vascular remodeling) at E11.5. In contrast, angiogenesis is disturbed in the GF fetal-derived placental compartment (junctional and/or labyrinth zones) at E11.5, as judged by i) increased levels of proangiogenic proteins (angiopoietin-2, FGF-2, follistatin, SDF-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C); ii) increased levels of phos-VEGFR2 and phos-p38-MAPK yet reduction in phos-ERK1/2; and iii) reduced expression of junctional zone glycoprotein genes associated with angiogenesis and fetal growth, resulting in reduced endothelial cell density at the labyrinth zone at E17.5. Colonization of GF mice before pregnancy with cecal microbiota from CONV-R animals rescues fetal growth and altered transcriptomic, proteomic, and immunohistochemical features in the fetal GF placental compartment. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing demonstrated increased expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal-associated oxidative stress genes in endothelial cell clusters in the GF fetal placental compartment (E11.5, E17.5), mimicking oxidative stress signatures in human IUGR.

Here, we focus on the white shark, for which female philopatry has been previously proposed, and produced a chromosome-level genome, high-coverage whole-genome autosomal, and uniparental datasets to investigate mitonuclear discordance. We first reconstructed the historical population demography of the species based on autosomal data. We show that this species once comprised a single panmictic population, which experienced a steady decline until recent times when it fragmented into at least three main autosomal genetic groups. Mitochondrial data depict a strikingly different picture, inconsistent with the spatial distribution of autosomal diversity. Using the demographic scenario established from autosomal data, we performed coalescent and forward simulations to test for the occurrence of female philopatry. Coalescent simulations showed that the model can reproduce the autosomal variability, confirming its robustness. A forward simulation framework was further built to explicitly account for a sex-biased reproduction model and track both autosomal and uniparental markers (Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA). While our model generates data that are consistent with the observed Y chromosome variation, the mitochondrial pattern is never reproduced even under extreme female philopatry (no female migration), strongly suggesting that demography alone cannot explain the mitonuclear discordance. Our framework could, and perhaps should, be extended to other shark species where philopatry has been suggested. It is possible that the proposed widespread occurrence of female philopatry in sharks should be revisited.",

Here, we show that when introduced into mice, this substitution causes substrates of the enzyme to accumulate in amounts that correlate negatively with ADSL expression levels. In the brain, where the expression of the enzyme is low, the substitution results in particularly high substrate levels. When the behavior of the mice is analyzed, female mice expressing the modern human-like version of ADSL access water more efficiently for drinking than their wild-type littermates. In addition to the amino acid substitution, a haplotype in the ADSL gene occurs at a carrier frequency of &gt;97% in present-day humans and exhibits evidence of positive selection. It is associated with less ADSL expression as well as with increased concentrations of succinyladenosine, one of the substrates of the enzyme, in cerebrospinal fluid.

Four distinct IgG1-Fc glycoforms, varying in core fucosylation and nonreducing terminal galactosylation, were generated through a combination of cell engineering and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Stable-isotope-assisted NMR spectroscopy, incorporating both glycan and protein signals, revealed that galactosylation induces chemical shift perturbations extending from the glycan–protein interface to the C H 2–C H 3 domain boundary. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the absence of galactose enhances the mobility of both the glycan and the C H 2 domain, broadening the conformational landscape of the Fc quaternary structure. This increased flexibility likely contributes to a greater entropic penalty upon binding to effector molecules, which constrain the Fc in an asymmetric conformation. Conversely, the effects of fucosylation are more localized, primarily influencing the dynamics of residues involved in Fcγ receptor IIIa binding. These findings provide atomic-level insights into the distinct yet synergistic mechanisms by which galactosylation and fucosylation modulate IgG1-Fc dynamics and effector functions, offering crucial information for the optimization of therapeutic antibodies.",

          "abstract": "The Notch signaling pathway regulates cellular differentiation by activating transcription through an unusual heterotrimeric complex comprising the Notch receptor’s intracellular domain (NICD), the DNA-binding protein CSL, and the coactivator MAML. NICD has two binding sites for CSL, a short motif in the RAM region and an ankyrin domain (ANK), connected by an intrinsically disordered linker and which form a bivalent ternary complex with CSL and MAML. Although bivalency is required for maximal transcription activation, the energetic contributions of bivalency and heterotrimer formation within this essential complex are unknown. To elucidate the energetics of bivalency, we first determine the free energy of the CSL-ANK-MAML heterotrimer, using isothermal titration calorimetry and developing an obligate heterotrimer model to analyze the data. By comparing this heterotrimerization reaction with binding reactions involving different regions of RAMANK, we determine the energetic contribution of bivalency to heterotrimer assembly. We show that bivalency through the disordered linker increases the effective concentration of ANK, and that the bivalent interaction enhances occupancy of RAM and ANK at their binding sites on CSL by about three orders of magnitude. By redefining the standard state to a lower, more physiological protein concentration, we reveal the importance of the RAMANK intrinsically disordered linker for assembly of the Notch transcription activation complex. This work provides a framework whereby the energetic contributions of intrinsically disordered linkers to higher-order multivalent assembly may be analyzed.",

Similarly to the existence of a hexatic phase between normal solid and fluid, we identify an intermediate phase between a phase of normal elastic response at high pressure, and fluid matter at zero pressure. The mechanical response in the intermediate phase is accompanied by plasticity that is generically associated with “nonaffine” quadrupolar events seen in the resulting displacement field. Gradients of the quadrupolar fields act as dipole charges that screen elasticity, breaking both translational and chiral symmetries. We highlight angular correlations that exhibit diverging correlation lengths at this transition and determine the critical scaling exponents.",

We conducted a meta-analysis of paternity in 63 species across diverse plant families to assess paternity within fruits. Our results reveal that almost 50% of flowering plant species with multiseeded fruits have a single pollen parent. Our results question the prevailing notion that multiple paternity of seeds within fruits is widespread, especially when, in addition to single paternity in multiseeded fruits, a large number of species have single-seeded fruits. We provide insights into the role of sibling rivalry and kin selection in driving genetic relatedness of seeds within fruits.

Apart from a large-scale reconstruction of primary metabolism, the model includes the full known potato secondary metabolism, spanning over 566 reactions that facilitate the biosynthesis of 182 distinct potato secondary metabolites. Constraint-based modeling identifies that the activation of the largest amount of secondary (defense) pathways occurs at a decrease of the relative growth rate of potato leaf, due to the costs incurred by defense. We then obtain transcriptomics data from experiments exposing potato leaves to two biotic stress scenarios, a herbivore and a viral pathogen, and apply them as constraints to produce condition-specific models. We show that these models recapitulate experimentally observed decreases in relative growth rates under treatment as well as changes in metabolite levels between treatments, enabling us to pinpoint the metabolic rewiring underlying growth–defense trade-offs. Potato-GEM thus presents a useful resource to study and broaden our understanding of potato and general plant defense responses under stress conditions.",

          "abstract": "TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is a signaling adaptor protein that is ubiquitously expressed but has highly distinct cell type–specific functions. TRAF3 plays critical roles in restraint of B lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and homeostatic survival. Consistent with such roles, loss-of-function mutations in TRAF3 have long been found in various human B cell malignancies. Mice lacking TRAF3 specifically in B cells have autoimmune manifestations, lymphadenopathy, and increased incidence of B cell lymphomas. More recently, human patients with germline TRAF3 mutations leading to haploinsufficiency have been reported; the phenotypes of these patients show striking similarities with those of mice with TRAF3-deficient B cells. This raises the important knowledge gap of how relative quantity of TRAF3 protein regulates B cells. To address this question, we investigated the effect of decreased B cell TRAF3 using mice whose B cells are heterozygous for loss of Traf3 . Traf3 +/− B cells displayed multiple functional abnormalities, to an extent intermediate between Traf3 +/+ and Traf3 −/− B cells, indicating a striking dose–response of B cells to relative quantities of TRAF3. Additionally, B cell TRAF3 protein—but not transcript—was reduced in B cells from normal aged mice and humans, consistent with increased occurrence of both B cell hyperactivity and B cell malignancies in older populations. Treatment of aged mice with a proteasome inhibitor restored the level of B cell TRAF3, suggesting age-related chronic signaling through receptors that lead to TRAF3 degradation. Thus, relative levels of B cell TRAF3 protein have important biological impacts on B cell function.",

However, its practical use has been constrained by weak magnetoelectric effects and limited overall performance, particularly under mechanical strain. Herein, we fabricated robust magnetoelectric polymer-inorganic nanocomposites through an interfacial cocrystallization strategy. By leveraging diazonium chemistry on vanadium diselenide (VSe 2 ) monolayers, we created a submolecular-flat interface between ferromagnetic VSe 2 and ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocrystals. This highly crystalline interface has few mobile polymer chains and thus limits energy dissipation and enhances interfacial energy transfer. The scalable composite films show exceptional magnetoelectric performance, with a magnetocapacitive coefficient of 23.6%. These films enable ultrafast magnetoelectric detection, approaching a 10-fold increase in speed compared with conventional sensors, and offer opportunities for integrating multifunctional materials such as thermoelectric coolers into wearable devices.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian hosts deploy a multitude of germ line–encoded mechanisms to detect and restrict virus infection. These mechanisms must avoid pathological responses to endogenous retroviruses and other endogenous retrotransposable elements (RTEs)—viruses and viruslike genomic parasites that have invaded the host germ line and are passed down the generations as host genes. Although the location, specificity, and sensitivity of innate pattern recognition receptors and restriction factors are tuned to facilitate discrimination of infecting viruses from those that are part of self, immune cross-reactions do occur. The RTE viral heritage may, therefore, compromise the ability of the host to respond to virus infection without risking pathology. Nevertheless, RTEs have the potential to be co-opted as an alarm amplification system, to be repurposed as antiviral factors, and to contribute to the evolution of antiviral genes.",

Understanding these tissue context–dependent sex differences in the immune system is critical to deciphering the exact mechanisms that determine why women and men experience organ-specific infections, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, and cancers differently.

We posit that the multiple components of the immune system each present trade-offs (such as self-defense–self-harm, and investments in memory–retaining flexibility for future responses) that vary through life, and that variation in how immune components balance these trade-offs increases homeostasis to external and internal threats.

          "abstract": "Waiting in a line (or a queue) is an unavoidable social interaction that occurs frequently in public spaces. Despite its wide prevalence and rich parametric variability, few studies have addressed the risks of airborne infection while waiting in a line. Here, we use a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations to assess the flow patterns in a simplified waiting line setting. From observations of the transport of breath-like expulsions, we reveal the presence of fluid dynamical counter-currents —due to the competing effects of line kinematics and thermal gradients. Depending on the walking speed, an intermediate temperature range can potentially heighten the infection risks by allowing the breath plume to linger; however, colder and warmer ambients both suppress the spread. Current guidelines of increasing physical separation appear to have a limited impact on reducing aerosol transmission. This work highlights the need for updated transmission mitigation guidelines in settings where physical separation, interaction duration, and periodicity of movements are factors.",

Hospitalization risks for cause-specific CVDs consistently increased following TC exposure, generally peaking around 2 months postexposure and dissipating by 6 months. Overall, each additional TC day was associated with a 13% (95% confidence interval, 7 to 19%) increase in CVD hospitalizations in 6 months following TCs. Particularly high TC-attributable burden was found for ischemic heart diseases and stroke, especially among males, individuals aged 20 to 59 years, and those with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The TC-attributable proportions of CVD hospitalizations showed decreasing trends in less deprived populations and increasing trends in more deprived populations from 2000 to 2019.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of sedentary farming economies, especially in contexts intensified by plow agriculture, has been argued to underpin marked increases in economic inequality and its intergenerational transmission across Eurasia. To assess this presumed causal relationship, we examine relational (burials) and material (house sizes) inequalities in the Carpathian Basin, a large region in central Europe, from the time the first farmers arrived in southeastern Europe through the next five millennia to the Bronze Age. We find that although farming did increase the potentials for both relational and material inequalities, the potential was rarely reached and then only for short durations. We identify a series of leveling mechanisms varying over time, including the removal of material wealth from circulation through the placement in graves, community fission, and investments of surplus labor in infrastructural investments. In the Carpathian Basin, only after at least 5000 years were the intergenerational potentials of material wealth transmissions more broadly realized.",

Several broad NA inhibition monoclonal antibodies (BImAbs) targeting the highly conserved enzymatic pocket have been previously described. However, the molecular characteristics, clonal evolutionary trajectory, and B cell sources of BImAbs remain poorly understood. Here, using NA-mutant probes, we comprehensively profiled the immune signatures of NA-specific memory B cells (MBCs) from a healthy individual with NA cross-inhibition activity. From the NA-specific MBC repertoires, we identified a series of NA BImAbs with molecular features characterized by long HCDR3 regions with an “xxxDRxxx” motif, which exhibited broad inhibition against diverse influenza NAs. Clonal lineage tracing revealed that BImAbs followed a clonal evolutionary trajectory encompassing classical MBC (cMBC) and atypical MBC (aMBC). Both cMBC- and aMBC-derived BImAbs displayed similar inhibition against influenza NA. These findings enhance our understanding of the development of NA BImAbs and provide a foundation for the rational design of NA-based universal flu vaccines.",

Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved the way for quantum technology. Here, we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multiphoton frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four SDs. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.",

How SWR1 is directed to the flanking acetylated +1 nucleosome, its physiological substrate, has been enigmatic. We show by live-cell, single-molecule tracking that SWR1 subunits Bdf1 and Yaf9 harboring histone acetylation reader domains differentially regulate chromatin binding: Bdf1 promotes SWR1 association, while Yaf9-YEATS slows its dissociation. Notably, single-molecule tracking and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with exonuclease treatment reveal Bdf1 and Yaf9 contributions to global SWR1 targeting and histone exchange at +1 nucleosomes. Our findings highlight the in-cell biochemistry of histone readers and suggest a generalizable, two-stage mechanism wherein acetylated nucleosome interactions initially constrain the three-dimensional diffusion of SWR1 to increase local concentration, followed by stochastic one-dimensional diffusion at nucleosome-depleted regions with directional capture by acetylated +1 nucleosomes.",

While periodic phononic crystals enable precise bandgap engineering, their ability to suppress acoustic waves is limited to specific frequency ranges. Here, we experimentally demonstrate surface acoustic wave control using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure, exhibiting characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leads to broad-range acoustic transmission reduction and bandgap-like regions of particularly strong suppression. By integrating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern, we achieve efficient waveguiding at frequencies within these bandgaps. Both simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the waveguides, demonstrating the flexibility of hyperuniform structures to support complex waveguide shapes. These findings provide an alternative approach to overcome limitations of traditional phononic crystals and advance acoustic technologies such as mechanical quantum computing and smartphone filters.",

Notable candidates are tenofovir (TFV) prodrugs. We have previously developed an LA TFV through a modified lipophilic ProTide strategy. Given the process chemistry challenges presented by amino acid chiral centers in ProTides, a simplified lipophilic amino acid–free crystalline phosphonate prodrug of TFV (M5TFV) has been created. Intramuscular injections of M5TFV nanosuspension (NM5TFV) were well tolerated in Sprague-Dawley rats and HBV transgenic mice. Notably, single doses at 200 and 400 milligrams per kilogram TFV equivalents produced &gt;2.5 log 10 reduction in HBV DNA beyond 2 months in transgenic mice. Reductions of covalently closed circular DNA were seen in hepatocyte-like cells. These promising findings support further development of NM5TFV as an ultra-LA formulation.",

We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of T H 17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between T H 17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.",

          "abstract": "Glia-derived secretory factors are essential for brain development, physiology, and homeostasis, with their dysfunction linked to a variety of neurological disorders. Through genetic and biochemical approaches, we identified odorant binding protein 44a (Obp44a), a noncanonical α-helical fatty acid binding protein (FABP) highly expressed in Drosophila central nervous system glia. Obp44a binds long-chain fatty acids and shuttles between glia and neurons, acting as a secretory lipid chaperone and scavenger to support lipid storage, efflux, and redox homeostasis. Notably, Obp44a is recruited to apoptotic cells and injured axons, especially when glial engulfment is impaired, demonstrating its role in lipid waste management and clearance of cellular debris during development and in pathological states. Our findings highlight FABPs’ importance in regulating brain lipid dynamics and neuronal response to stress and injury. By visualizing FABP function in vivo, this study provides insights into how defective lipid regulation may contribute to neuronal stress and disease progression.",

          "abstract": "Venus diverged from Earth’s evolutionary path through the development of a carbon dioxide (CO 2 )–dominated atmosphere, although studies dispute whether this atmosphere arose shortly after accretion or after a protracted period of surface habitability. Widespread volcanic features suggest that volcanic outgassing may have played a pivotal role in the transformation of Venus. However, the formation of volcanic units on Venus by basaltic lavas can only outgas a minor fraction of the CO 2 in the current atmosphere. Here, we model the erosion of long, meandering channels on Venus called canali and show that carbonatite lavas have the unique properties required to erode the canali. Our results suggest that eruption of these carbonatites may have delivered a total mass of CO 2 comparable to that of the modern atmosphere, resolving challenges to the formation of Venus’ atmosphere within the recent past and suggesting that exoplanets in the “Venus zone” may exhibit the potential for prolonged habitability.",

The largest baleen whales use a high-drag lunge-feeding strategy that is hypothesized to come at a high energetic cost, thus requiring exceptional calorie intake. We used biologging tags to measure respiratory rates in foraging rorquals and demonstrate that their field metabolic rates are less than half that predicted by prey consumption estimates and by scaling predictions from smaller marine mammals. The relative cost of rorqual foraging decreases with increasing size as larger whales spend disproportionately longer time filtering prey from engulfed water. By decoupling active swimming and filtration, the largest rorquals forage with limited movement costs. The evolution of lunge feeding confers an energetic advantage that is unique among filter feeders and may have provided an evolutionary pathway to the largest body sizes.",

Recent evidence shows that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), used in diabetes management, can induce BP (DPP4i-BP). DPP4i-BP differs from typical BP in its genetic, clinical, and immunological features, but methods to specifically detect DPP4i-BP autoantibodies have been unavailable. This study used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with “domain-swapped BP180” proteins to identify autoantibodies in DPP4i-BP, which targeted BP180 regions from the seventh noncollagenous domain to the fourth collagenous domain (NC7-Col4). These epitopes were associated with DPP4i-BP–specific human leukocyte antigen class II peptide epitopes. Notably, the duration of DPP4i intake before BP onset was significantly shorter in patients with anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies than those without them. Measuring the autoantibodies enabled the early diagnosis of DPP4i-BP before epitope spreading. Furthermore, anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies were detected in some patients with diabetes taking DPP4i without BP, suggesting that these assays may offer potential tools for early identification of at-risk individuals.",

After being specifically uptaken by the postsynaptic interneurons innervated by corticospinal tract (CST) axons, Glu-UCNP not only serves as internal light transducers that convert near-infrared light to visible light but also acts as nanobeacons that guide axonal sprouting toward postsynaptic neurons of glutamatergic synapses. This in situ optogenetic modulation successfully demonstrated the restoration of spinal motor circuits by rebuilding functional connections between CST axons and postsynaptic interneurons. It was corroborated by live-cell recording, immunofluorescence staining, in vivo Ca 2+ imaging, and pellet-reaching tests. Transcriptome sequencing further elucidated the molecular network changes underlying this optogenetic modulation.

Here, we assess the roles of the RSC, ISW1, and CHD1 adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent chromatin remodelers in generating nucleosome dynamics in vivo. We compare DNA methylation rates in wild-type cells and chromatin remodeler mutants by normalizing nuclear methylation rates to the nonnucleosomal mitochondrial DNA methylation rate in each strain. Depletion of both Isw1 and Chd1 increases the normalized methylation rate, suggesting that these remodelers act together to suppress nucleosome dynamics. Separate depletion of Isw1, Chd1, or Rsc8 has little effect. A decaying sine wave model used to fit nucleosome phasing data shows that nucleosome dynamics decrease with distance from the promoter in an Isw1/Chd1-dependent manner. Furthermore, the TFIIIB and TFIIIC transcription factors exhibit differential dynamics at transfer RNA genes in vivo. Our analysis provides insight into nucleosome and transcription factor dynamics in vivo.",

Using a comprehensive fire occurrence dataset, we analyze fire season onset and climate controls on its variability and change during 1992–2020 in 13 California ecoregions. Northern California ecoregions show stronger trends toward earlier onset compared to more arid southern California ecoregions. Onset has trended earlier for all but one ecoregion. Interannual variability of onset is dominated by climate variability and its influence on fuel moisture. Trend attribution inferred from onset-climate relationships suggests that anthropogenic warming advanced fire season onset by 6 to 46 days during 1992–2020 in 11 of 13 ecoregions. Continued warming is expected to further promote earlier fire season onsets.",

Our developments provide a comprehensive molecular picture at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of the nonlinear, linear, and fluctuating dynamic phenomena that single nanocrystals undergo during the GLC-EM experiment. We determined atomic structures of 66 temporal structural states, extracted from 15 time trajectories of individual nanocrystals. Large (478 to 698 atoms) and small (&lt;300 atoms) nanocrystals show etching that preserves a stable core, whereas mid-sized (351 to 571 atoms) nanocrystals present dynamics that change the coordination of the core.",

Conditional ablation of BACH2 diminished the ability of ILC2 progenitors to differentiate into ILC2s. Integration of the scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and CUT&amp;Tag-seq techniques revealed that BACH2 modulated the transcriptional profiles and epigenetic landscapes of ILC2 progenitors. Furthermore, BACH2 ablation compromised the functionality of ILC2s, resulting in a resolution of allergic airway inflammation. Notably, the different binding sites of BACH2 in ILC2s and T H 2 cells suggested that BACH2 binds to IRF4 to control the function of ILC2, underscoring its context-specific effects on allergic airway inflammation.

However, their propensity for rapid crystallization and oxidation severely limits stability and carrier mobility. Here, we strategically enhance perovskite TFT performance by incorporating 2-thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) into 3D tin-based perovskites. The induction of the pseudo-halide SCN − into a bilayer quasi-2D perovskite intermediate phase, combined with the strong interaction between sulfur-bearing thiophene rings (TEA + ) and Sn-I octahedra, effectively reorients perovskite crystallization while inhibiting Sn 2+ oxidation and reducing trap density. Consequently, TEASCN-based TFTs achieve an average hole mobility of more than 60 square centimeters per volt per second and an on/off current ratio surpassing 10 8 , standing out among state-of-the-art p-type perovskite TFTs. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices preserve 84% of their initial mobility after 30 days in an N 2 atmosphere, underscoring their remarkable stability.

Here, we show that deletion of the transcriptional regulators, yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ), from Osterix-expressing cells, which reside in the cambium, impairs periosteal expansion. YAP activation increases chromatin accessibility, preferentially at TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) binding sites, and regulates both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cellular functions. We identify bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( Bmp4 ) as a YAP-TEAD target gene expressed in the cambium. In YAP/TAZ knockout mice, BMP4 delivery increased periosteal expansion through matrix accumulation and fibrous layer cell proliferation. Conversely, in wild-type mice, BMP4 delivery increased osteogenic activity and angiogenesis. Together, these data identify YAP-mediated transcriptional programs that promote layer-specific periosteal expansion.",

Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of quantum Darwinism and the underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a computationally and experimentally inexpensive quantifier to probe quantum-to-classical transitions.

Mn/Cr ratios in carbonaceous chondrites and the bulk silicate Earth indicate that meteorite parent bodies and Earth have variable depletions in volatile elements compared to the bulk Solar composition. This depletion is a consequence of the local temperature decreasing as a function of heliocentric distance before planetesimal accretion. Back-tracking the present-day ε 53 Cr composition of the hypothetical proto-Earth fraction shows that the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation from the bulk Solar composition occurred no later than ~3 Ma after CAI formation, similar to disk regions of carbonaceous chondrites at greater heliocentric distances. The timing of limited solid-gas interaction due to the dissipation of gas from the protoplanetary disk caused the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation and provides a lower limit on its lifetime.",

          "abstract": "Synchronization underpins coherence in natural and engineered systems, unifying dynamics and countering noise while remaining vulnerable to disturbances threatening the stability and risking desynchronization. Here, we present a counterintuitive approach: harnessing noise to dilute the energy of unwanted fluctuations from external disturbances, thereby enhancing stability while preserving synchronization through the system’s inherent noise suppression at the synchronized frequency. Through experiments with micromechanical oscillators and macroscale rotors, combined with stochastic averaging analysis, we show that this noise dilution effect improves synchronization efficiency, bolsters resistance to interference, and enhances long-term frequency stability. These findings position white noise of appropriate intensity as a dilution element for mitigating unwanted disturbances, providing previously unidentified insights into stability and resilience in complex synchronized systems.",

          "abstract": "Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure–function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer–promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains. Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.",

This study introduces an intelligent blood pressure management system (BPMS) for real-time monitoring and adaptive intervention through a closed-loop framework integrating sensors, control circuits, and microneedle electrodes. A hierarchical microneedle architecture, featuring gold nanoparticle (Au NP) electrocatalysts and copper-nitrogen–doped carbon nanoribbon (Cu-NC NB) nanozymes, selectively catalyzes the in situ generation of nitric oxide (NO) for vasodilation. To enhance NO delivery, an electroosmotic flow (EOF) mechanism extends the diffusion range up to 4 millimeters through a porous microneedle (PMN) array, enabling effective vascular penetration. In vivo studies in rabbits and pigs confirm that BPMS dynamically regulates NO release in response to fluctuating blood pressure, achieving real-time hemodynamic control.

Hybridization between the metal’s surface d orbitals and molecular p orbitals profoundly alters both the interfacial molecular layer and adjacent metal interface atomic layers, causing substantial changes in the magnetic properties of metal/molecule heterostructures. While magnetic modifications within the metallic layer are relatively well understood, the interfacial magnetism remains elusive. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, we investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures and identify a distinct interfacial magnetic component that appears universal across various cobalt/molecule combinations. Our findings reveal a highly anisotropic magnetic layer localized at the interface, which has remained undetected in static measurements. This interfacial layer likely originates from strong chemical modifications in the cobalt surface induced by chemisorbed molecules. These results underscore the crucial role of molecular chemisorption in shaping interfacial magnetic properties, offering further opportunities for tuning functionalities in molecule-based spintronic devices.",

However, two-pore domain K + (K 2P ) channels lack a VSD and instead rely on K + movement within the selectivity filter (SF) to convert voltage changes into pore opening. To uncover the atomistic basis of voltage gating in TREK K 2P channels, we integrated large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with extensive mutagenesis and patch-clamp electrophysiology, including sucrose-based experiments. Simulations revealed an asymmetric stability difference along the SF that results in a water-permeable extracellular side and a watertight intracellular side. Inactivation during inward flux occurs when water penetrates into the inner binding site and halts ion permeation, followed by the unbinding of three K + ions, consistent with gating charge analysis. Our findings provide unprecedented atomistic insights into the C-type inactivation of TREK K 2P channels and establish a framework for investigating noncanonical voltage gating mechanisms in other ion channels.",

In addition, P2Ns-NAR(NAR) alleviated AKI by reducing fibrosis and lowering Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor κB levels in the kidneys. Notably, P2Ns-NAR(NAR) outperformed other formulations, providing a 50% lower effective dose.

The pores are integrated with azobenzene units with photo-adaptable trans-to-cis isomerization, enabling dynamic pore size regulation at angstrom scale.

The foams exhibited high tensile stress (~400 kPa) comparable to that of brittle foams and had excellent ductility, with an elongation of 137.0%. The foams also displayed outstanding cyclic elastic behavior, retaining more than 90% of their compressive stress after 100 cycles. In addition, the foams were water-weldable, recovering 87.3% of their original tensile stress and nearly 100% of their elongation, allowing them to be tailored into customized geometric structures.

Using a melanoma cell model consisting of nontumoral melanocytic Mel-ST cells and their metastatic counterpart obtained by H-Ras transformation, we unexpectedly find minimal effects of eIF2A depletion on translation. Interactome studies identified centrosomal proteins as major binding partners of eIF2A. We found that eIF2A colocalizes with the centrosome, enhances centrosome composition, and promotes centrosome orientation during cell migration. Migration requires the C-terminal disordered region of eIF2A, involved in mRNA binding. Interaction with mRNA, however, does not require ongoing translation.

By combining data from 1046 hydrological stations with ISIMIP3a reconstructions, we provide a comprehensive national assessment showing that streamflow has declined across more than 70% of stations over the past six decades. Although regional heterogeneity exists, these declines are primarily concentrated in the north and driven by land use and cover change, further exacerbated by water abstraction, diversion, and regulation. In contrast, climate change and variability dominate the increases in streamflow, primarily in the south.

To address this, we present Stressomic, a wearable multiplexed microfluidic biosensor for noninvasive monitoring of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in sweat. Stressomic integrates iontophoresis-driven sweat extraction with bursting valve-regulated microfluidic channels for continuous sampling and analysis. Gold nanodendrite–decorated laser-engraved graphene electrodes achieve picomolar-level sensitivity, enabling simultaneous detection of multiple stress hormones. Electrochemical assays and human studies demonstrate that Stressomic reliably tracks hormone fluctuations in response to physical, psychological, and pharmacological stressors. Distinct temporal patterns reveal the dynamic interplay between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system.

Here, we propose a model linking guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis to the membrane binding and tubulation required for transport carrier formation. We find that GTP binding stabilizes interactions between AMPH-1 and the membrane through amphipathic, amino-terminal α helices, which are found at the tips of the arc-shaped, homodimeric structure. By contrast, in the posthydrolysis, guanosine diphosphate–bound state, these helices are repositioned to interact with the amino-terminal helices of other homodimers, to form an oligomeric AMPH-1 lattice that tubulates the membrane, in preparation for carrier formation by membrane fission.",

Next, we solved a 4.2-Å resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of this 11-nanometer LPL filament using purified protein. The filament is made of repeating pairs of LPL molecules with occluded active sites, rendering the LPL inactive. The comparison of the in situ subtomogram average and the in vitro cryo-EM structure indicates that the previously uncharacterized physiological storage form of LPL is an inactive filament.",

Probing multiple biomechanical parameters of arteries simultaneously throughout the cardiac cycle is highly important but remains challenging. Here, we report a method to quantify arterial anisotropic stiffness, arterial wall stresses, and local blood pressure in a single measurement. With programmed ultrasound excitation and imaging, arterial axial and circumferential guided waves were simultaneously induced and measured in the longitudinal view. Then, a mechanical model was proposed to quantitatively predict the correlation of arterial guided waves with arterial biomechanical parameters. Our experimental design and biomechanical model enable an elastography method to assess temporal variations in blood pressure, bidirectional stiffness, and mechanical stresses in arterial walls. In vivo experiments were performed on healthy young, normotensive older, and hypertensive older volunteers. The results demonstrate that our method can find applications in understanding aging of cardiovascular system and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.",

          "abstract": "Technologies based on quantum effects of spin defects, such as computation, communication, sensing, and anticounterfeiting, have developed rapidly. However, limited by specific crystal structure required for spin defects, wide extension of their application faces challenges. A notable challenge is fabricating spin defects in general-purpose, low-cost amorphous materials such as polymers. Here, we propose an in situ laser–induced fabrication strategy of spin defects from polymers based on manipulation of main and side chains of polymers (MMSCP). By using 17 laser parameters and 8 polymers, we successfully fabricated silicon carbide spin defects derived from material mismatches. ODMR contrast and linewidth are consistently above 0.15% and below 54 megahertz, respectively. Benefiting from minimal damage of laser direct writing and stable covalent bonding, MMSCP effectively fabricates spin defects in manufactured microfluidic devices, cardiac patches, and medicine bottles and applies them to sensing and anticounterfeiting. Overall, MMSCP represents a paradigm that revolutionizes the application scheme of spin defects.",

          "abstract": "Neural circuits governing all motor behaviors in vertebrates rely on the proper development of motor neurons and their precise targeting of limb muscles. Transcription factors are essential for motor neuron development, regulating their specification, migration, and axonal targeting. While transcriptional regulation of the early stages of motor neuron specification is well established, much less is known about the role of transcription factors in the later stages of maturation and muscle targeting. Defining the molecular mechanisms of these later stages is critical for elucidating how motor circuits are constructed. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation. Moreover, we find that NFIA is required for proper mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production, providing an important link between transcription factors and metabolism during motor neuron development. Together, these findings underscore the critical role of NFIA in instructing the assembly of spinal circuits for movement.",

          "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) develops after an initial injury. It causes prolonged pain that persists beyond the usual expected time for tissue healing. Mechanisms underlying pain chronicity of CRPS-I remain unknown. Here, we identified the presence of long-lasting infiltration of macrophages in local dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat model of CRPS-I. We demonstrate that regenerating islet-derived 3β (Reg3β) is specifically produced by DRG neurons upon model establishment and functions as an important signaling molecule to drive proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in local DRG. Infiltrated macrophages produce TNF-α, which causes hyperexcitability of nociceptive DRG neurons and reciprocally promotes Reg3β overexpression and secretion from DRG neurons to recruit more macrophages. Our work reveals a positive feedback signaling conveyed by neuronal Reg3β/macrophage TNF-α that contributes to neuroinflammation in DRG, resulting in persistent pain in a rat model of CRPS-I. This finding provides insights into the neuroimmune interaction in local DRG that contributes to pain chronicity of CRPS-I.",

Although the receptor signals through inhibitory G proteins, more work is necessary to understand differences in transducer coupling and its relation to functional activity. To develop a molecular understanding of the differences underlying transducer coupling and activation, we performed structure-activity relationship studies of 5-HT1A with distinct G proteins. Through a combination of in vitro assays, we identified a potent partial agonist that selectively engages a G protein subtype. We further investigated the differences in G protein engagement at 5-HT1A with cryo–electron microscopy, determining structures of 5-HT1A bound to distinct ligands and G protein subtypes. Combined with subsequent structure-guided mutagenesis and signaling assays, our studies uncover both orthosteric and allosteric determinants of agonist-specific stimulation of distinct transducers.",

Notably, normal prion protein (PrP C ) is essential for prion-induced rapid neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the unstructured N-terminal region of PrP C induces rapid and lethal neurodegeneration in mice, accompanied by the hallmark of prion disease, spongiosis. The neurotoxic N-terminal PrP is soluble, associates peripherally with lipid membranes, and induces neurotoxicity only when a critical threshold is exceeded. Both the N-terminally localized KKRPKP sequence and octarepeats contribute to neurotoxicity, with KKRPKP being essential. Without it, the N-terminal PrP is innocuous but exacerbates either neurodegeneration caused by N-terminal PrP or neurodegeneration in prion disease induced by intracerebral prion inoculation in mice. Our findings establish that soluble N-terminal PrP causes rapid neurodegeneration in prion disease and is a target for intervention.",

However, most IMS platforms lack microscopy-level spatial resolution and cellular morphological contrast, necessitating subsequent histochemical staining, microscopic imaging, and advanced image registration to correlate/link molecular distributions with specific tissue features and cell types. We present a diffusion model–based virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with periodic acid–Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite using IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach uses optimized noise sampling during the diffusion model’s inference to achieve reliable and repeatable virtual staining. We believe this virtual staining method will open avenues for IMS-based biomedical research.",

Here, using highly accurate duplex sequencing, we detected de novo mutations in single oocytes, blood, and saliva in women 20 to 42 years of age. We found that, with age, mutations increased in blood and saliva but not in oocytes. In oocytes, mutations with high allele frequencies were less prevalent in coding than noncoding regions, whereas mutations with low allele frequencies were more uniformly distributed along the mtDNA, suggesting frequency-dependent purifying selection. Thus, mtDNA in human oocytes is protected against accumulation of mutations with aging and having functional consequences. These findings are particularly timely as humans tend to reproduce later in life.",

However, when dysregulated, they lead to genomic instability and numerous human diseases. R-loops are tightly regulated, with RNase H1 acting as a key enzyme responsible for resolving DNA/RNA hybrids. Here, we identify the DNA-binding protein AND-1 as an essential factor in R-loop regulation through directly binding to R-loop structures, where it enhances the recruitment of RNase H1 and stimulates its endonuclease activity. We also provide in vivo evidence that R-loop accumulation occurs in the mammary gland tissue of AND-1–deficient mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of AND-1 decreases ESR1 expression by disrupting R-loop regulation at the enhancer region of the ESR1 gene in estrogen receptor–positive (ER + ) breast cancer cells, thereby overcoming resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism by which AND-1 modulates R-loop dynamics and present a promising therapeutic strategy to combat endocrine resistance in breast cancer.",
