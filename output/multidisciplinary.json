          "abstract": "Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been an important goal in psychology 1,2 . A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this.",

However, such atlases are unavailable 5 . Here we present a whole mouse brain dataset of Nissl-based cytoarchitecture with isotropic 1-μm resolution, achieved through continuous micro-optical sectioning tomography. By integrating multi-modal images, we constructed a three-dimensional reference atlas of the mouse brain, providing the three-dimensional topographies of 916 structures and enabling arbitrary-angle slice image generation at 1-μm resolution. We developed an informatics-based platform for visualizing and sharing of the atlas images, offering services such as brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping and intelligent stereotaxic surgery planning. This atlas is interoperable with widely used stereotaxic atlases, supporting cross-atlas navigation of corresponding coronal planes in two dimensions and spatial mapping across atlas spaces in three dimensions. By facilitating the data analysis and visualization for large brain mapping projects, our atlas promises to be a versatile brainsmatics tool for studying the whole brain at single-cell level.",

          "authors": "Violetta Sharoglazova, Marius Puplauskis, Charlie Mattschas, Chris Toebes, Jan Klaers",
          "abstract": "Classical mechanics characterizes the kinetic energy of a particle, the energy it holds due to its motion, as consistently positive. By contrast, quantum mechanics describes the motion of particles using wave functions, in which regions of negative local kinetic energy can emerge 1 . This phenomenon occurs when the amplitude of the wave function experiences notable decay, typically associated with quantum tunnelling. Here, we investigate the quantum mechanical motion of particles in a system of two coupled waveguides, in which the population transfer between the waveguides acts as a clock, allowing particle speeds along the waveguide axis to be determined. By applying this scheme to exponentially decaying quantum states at a reflective potential step, we determine an energy–speed relationship for particles with negative local kinetic energy. We find that the smaller the energy of the particles—in other words, the more negative the local kinetic energy—the higher the measured speed inside the potential step. Our findings contribute to the ongoing tunnelling time debate 2–6 and can be viewed as a test of Bohmian trajectories in quantum mechanics 7–9 . Regarding the latter, we find that the measured energy–speed relationship does not align with the particle dynamics postulated by the guiding equation in Bohmian mechanics.",

          "abstract": "In a classic example of adaptation, harmless Batesian mimics gain protection from predators through resemblance to one or more unpalatable models 1,2 . Mimics vary greatly in accuracy, and explaining the persistence of inaccurate mimics is an ongoing challenge for evolutionary biologists 3,4 . Empirical testing of existing hypotheses is constrained by the difficulty of assessing the fitness of phenotypes absent among extant species, leaving large parts of the adaptive landscape unexplored 5 —a problem affecting the study of the evolution of most complex traits. Here, to address this, we created mimetic phenotypes that occupy hypothetical areas of trait space by morphing between 3D images of real insects (flies and wasps), and tested the responses of real predators to high-resolution, full-colour 3D-printed reproductions of these phenotypes. We found that birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate among insects on the basis of subtle differences in appearance, but this ability is weaker for pattern and shape than for colour and size traits. We found that mimics gained no special protection from intermediate resemblance to multiple model phenotypes. However, discrimination ability was lower in some invertebrate predators (especially crab spiders and mantises), highlighting that the predator community is key to explaining the apparent inaccuracy of many mimics.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how animals and humans learn from experience to make adaptive decisions is a fundamental goal of neuroscience and psychology. Normative modelling frameworks such as Bayesian inference 1 and reinforcement learning 2 provide valuable insights into the principles governing adaptive behaviour. However, the simplicity of these frameworks often limits their ability to capture realistic biological behaviour, leading to cycles of handcrafted adjustments that are prone to researcher subjectivity. Here we present a novel modelling approach that leverages recurrent neural networks to discover the cognitive algorithms governing biological decision-making. We show that neural networks with just one to four units often outperform classical cognitive models and match larger neural networks in predicting the choices of individual animals and humans, across six well-studied reward-learning tasks. Critically, we can interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts, enabling a unified comparison of cognitive models and revealing detailed mechanisms underlying choice behaviour. Our approach also estimates the dimensionality of behaviour 3 and offers insights into algorithms learned by meta-reinforcement learning artificial intelligence agents. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for studying healthy and dysfunctional cognition.",

          "abstract": "Alkenes are a central part of organic chemistry 1–3 . However, although most alkenes are easy to prepare, the controlled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes, those with four groups around the central C=C bond, remains challenging 1–5 . Here we report the boron-mediated assembly of tetrasubstituted alkenes with complete control of the double-bond geometry. The migrating group and electrophile add syn across the alkyne. Mild oxidation leads to intermediate borinic esters 6 , which can be isolated and purified or reacted directly in a range of transformations, including cross-couplings and homologation reactions. In particular, subjecting the intermediate borinic esters to Zweifel 7,8 olefination conditions can give either retention or inversion of the double-bond geometry, depending on whether base is present or not. Different positional and stereoisomers of the tetrasubstituted alkenes can be easily accessed, highlighting the breadth and versatility of the method. This was showcased through its successful application to the rapid synthesis of drug molecules and natural products with high yield and stereocontrol. Not only does this method provide efficient access to the long-standing challenge of the stereocontrolled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes but it also introduces new concepts related to the intervention of non-classical borenium ions in the Zweifel olefination.",

          "abstract": "Barrier tissues isolate organisms from their surrounding environment. Maintaining the integrity of the tissues is essential for this function. In many seed plants, periderm forms as the outer barrier during secondary growth to prevent water loss and pathogen infection 1 . The periderm is regenerated when its integrity is lost following injury; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, despite its importance for plant survival. Here we report that periderm integrity in Arabidopsis roots is sensed by diffusion of the gases ethylene and oxygen. Following injury of the periderm, ethylene leaks out through the wound and oxygen enters, resulting in attenuation of ethylene signalling and hypoxia signalling. This condition promotes periderm regeneration in the root. When regeneration is complete and barrier integrity is re-established, pre-injury levels of ethylene and hypoxia signalling are regained. Gas diffusion monitoring is also used to re-establish the barrier in inflorescence stems after the epidermis is injured. We thus propose that gas diffusion is used by plants as a general principle to monitor and re-establish barrier integrity.",

However, owing to poor DNA preservation, questions about regional interconnectivity over time have not been addressed because whole-genome sequencing has not yet been possible. Here we sequenced a 2× coverage whole genome from an adult male Egyptian excavated at Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات). Radiocarbon dated to 2855–2570 cal. bce , he lived a few centuries after Egyptian unification, bridging the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The body was interred in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb 1 , potentially contributing to the DNA preservation. Most of his genome is best represented by North African Neolithic ancestry, among available sources at present. Yet approximately 20% of his genetic ancestry can be traced to genomes representing the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. This genetic affinity is similar to the ancestry appearing in Anatolia and the Levant during the Neolithic and Bronze Age 2–5 . Although more genomes are needed to fully understand the genomic diversity of early Egyptians, our results indicate that contacts between Egypt and the eastern Fertile Crescent were not limited to objects and imagery (such as domesticated animals and plants, as well as writing systems) 6–9 but also encompassed human migration.",

          "abstract": "The cause of Mars’s loss of surface habitability is unclear, with isotopic data suggesting a ‘missing sink’ of carbonate 1 . Past climates with surface and shallow-subsurface liquid water are recorded by Mars’s sedimentary rocks, including strata in the approximately 4-km-thick record at Gale Crater 2 . Those waters were intermittent, spatially patchy and discontinuous, and continued remarkably late in Mars’s history 3 —attributes that can be understood if, as on Earth, sedimentary-rock formation sequestered carbon dioxide as abundant carbonate (recently confirmed in situ at Gale 4 ). Here we show that a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation can explain the existence of intermittent Martian oases. In our model, increasing solar luminosity promoted the stability of liquid water, which in turn formed carbonate, reduced the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide and limited liquid water 5 . Chaotic orbital forcing modulated wet–dry cycles. The negative feedback restricted liquid water to oases and Mars self-regulated as a desert planet. We model snowmelt as the water source, but the feedback can also work with groundwater as the water source. Model output suggests that Gale faithfully records the expected primary episodes of liquid water stability in the surface and near-surface environment. Eventually, atmospheric thickness approaches water’s triple point, curtailing the sustained stability of liquid water and thus habitability in the surface environment. We assume that the carbonate content found at Gale is representative, and as a result we present a testable idea rather than definitive evidence.",

          "abstract": "Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range 1 . The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer–promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis -acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1 . The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh 2 . The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.",

          "abstract": "Methanogenic archaea are the main producers of the potent greenhouse gas methane 1,2 . In the methanogenic pathway from CO 2 and H 2 studied under laboratory conditions, low-potential electrons for CO 2 reduction are generated by a flavin-based electron-bifurcation reaction catalysed by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) complexed with the associated [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Mvh) 3–5 . F 420 -reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Frh) provides electrons to the methanogenic pathway through the electron carrier F 420 (ref. 6 ). Here we report that under strictly nickel-limited conditions, in which the nickel concentration is similar to those often observed in natural habitats 7–11 , the production of both [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Methanothermobacter marburgensis is strongly downregulated. The Frh reaction is substituted by a coupled reaction with [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd), and the role of Mvh is taken over by F 420 -dependent electron-donating proteins (Elp). Thus, Hmd provides all electrons for the reducing metabolism under these nickel-limited conditions. Biochemical and structural characterization of Elp–Hdr complexes confirms the electronic interaction between Elp and Hdr. The conservation of the genes encoding Elp and Hmd in CO 2 -reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggests that the Hmd system is an alternative pathway for electron flow in CO 2 -reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens under nickel-limited conditions.",

          "abstract": "Many worry that news on social media leaves people uninformed or even misinformed. Here we conducted a preregistered two-wave online field experiment in France and Germany ( N = 3,395) to estimate the effect of following the news on Instagram and WhatsApp. Participants were asked to follow two accounts for 2 weeks and activate the notifications. In the treatment condition, the accounts were those of news organizations, while in the control condition they covered cooking, cinema or art. The treatment enhanced current affairs knowledge, participants’ ability to discern true from false news stories and awareness of true news stories, as well as trust in the news. The treatment had no significant effects on feelings of being informed, political efficacy, affective polarization and interest in news or politics. These results suggest that, while some forms of social media use are harmful, others are beneficial and can be leveraged to foster a well-informed society.",

          "abstract": "Humans hate being monitored. Autonomy is prized—including by research scientists. Yet little is known about a fundamental issue in the modern world: What is happening to job autonomy in today’s workplaces as people move from youth on to middle age and then on to older ages? It would be natural to believe that individuals in the second half of their careers would be the senior ones with high autonomy. We provide evidence that such a belief is wrong. This study uses longitudinal data on hundreds of thousands of randomly sampled individuals, in three rich countries, who are followed through their working lives (n &gt; 400,000). Workers’ feelings of job autonomy trace out a smooth concave parabola, increasing up to midlife, until approximately the surprisingly early age of 40, and then collapsing over the ensuing twenty to 30 y of a person’s working life. This is apparently not an illusion. We show that objective measures of autonomy —signified by managerial and supervisory job titles, for example—behave in a matching, hump-shaped way. As a further check, consistent qualitative evidence is given: a survey we ran asking managers about their experiences. We believe this paper’s results represent a foundational, essentially unknown, and intrinsically cross-disciplinary puzzle.",

          "abstract": "In cognitive science, the term “executive function” (EF) refers to universal features of the mind. Yet, almost all results described as measuring EF may actually reflect culturally specific cognitive capacities. After all, typical EF measures require forms of decontextualized/arbitrary processing which decades of cross-cultural work indicate develop primarily in “schooled worlds”–industrialized societies with universal schooling. Here, we report comparisons of performance on typical EF tasks by children inside, and wholly outside schooled worlds. Namely, children ages 5 to 18 from a postindustrial context with universal schooling (UK) and their peers in a rural, nonindustrialized context with no exposure to schooling (Kunene region, Namibia/Angola), as well as two samples with intermediate exposure to schooled worlds. In line with extensive previous work on decontextualized/arbitrary processing across such groups, we find skills measured by typical EF tasks do not develop universally: Children from rural groups with limited or no formal schooling show profound, sometimes qualitative, differences in performance compared to their schooled peers and, especially, compared to a “typical” schooled-world sample. In sum, some form of latent cognitive control capacities are obviously crucial in all cultural contexts. However, typical EF tasks almost certainly reflect culturally specific forms of cognitive development. This suggests we must decide between using the term EF to describe 1) universal capacities or 2) the culturally specific skill set reflected in performance on typical tasks. Either option warrants revisiting how we understand what has been measured as EF to date, and what we wish to measure going forward.",

This has been apparent in studies of echo chambers and filter bubbles. Producing a more usable evidence base, we conclude, will require that scholars a) obtain access to proprietary data, b) reconceptualize information ecologies as social systems, c) avoid ceding core research tasks to platforms, d) address ethical issues, and e) grapple with the urgency of moving forward productively.",

Community-engaged science, which focuses on shared leadership and mutual benefit in scientific partnership with communities, has the potential to transform science, communities, and even society. Despite this promise, however, community-engaged science is not always transformative. Presentations and discussions at the 5th National Academies Science Communication Colloquium demonstrated the importance of creating structures, practices, and a culture of science engagement that prioritizes listening and learning from communities. Based on presentations at the colloquium, research publications, and our own experiences, we share a set of evidence-informed principles that are common to successful community-engaged science across many contexts: respect, humility, listening, reciprocity, mutuality, and reflexivity. We also offer steps the scientific community can take to advance and improve the transformative practice of community-engaged science as part of a productive ecosystem of scientific activities: evolving norms and culture, integrating community science into current systems, building incentives and structures to support community-engaged science, developing a workforce skilled in community engagement, and investing in a coordinated research-to-practice agenda.",

          "abstract": "Collective cooperation maintains the function of many natural and social systems, making understanding the evolution of cooperation a central question of modern science. Although human interactions involve complex contact networks, current explorations are limited to static networks, where social ties are permanent and do not change over time. In reality, human activities often involve temporal interactions, where links are impermanent, and understanding the evolution of cooperation on such temporal networks is an open problem. Here, we systematically analyze how cooperation spreads on arbitrary temporal networks, and we distill our results down to a concise condition, which integrates evolutionary game dynamics with both static and temporal interactions. We find that the emergence of cooperation is facilitated by a simple rule of thumb: Hubs (individuals with many social ties) should be temporally deprioritized in interactions. For empirical applications, we further provide a quantitative metric capturing the priority of hubs, which is validated on empirical datasets based on its effectiveness in orchestrating the ordering of interactions to best promote cooperation. Our findings unveil the fundamental advantages conferred by temporal interactions for promoting collective cooperation, transcending the specific insights gleaned from studying static networks.",

          "authors": "Mohsen Mosleh, Dean Eckles, David G. Rand",
          "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e., transitivity, clustering): network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to be directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se versus other processes such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These mechanisms are difficult to disentangle in many settings. On social media, however, they can be decomposed - and platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when they are followed by a target account that we control. We then examine whether the user reciprocates this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through multiple control conditions, we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and accordingly we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.",

          "abstract": "A stable caregiving environment early in life is essential for children’s development, and disruptions have the potential to impact biological processes. Using data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, we examined a developmental cascade model in which shifts in pubertal tempo following early caregiving disruptions come at an epigenetic cost. Among 115 individuals, all of whom experienced severe deprivation early in life, we tracked caregiving disruptions across childhood; assessed pubertal timing and tempo across adolescence; and quantified the pace of cellular aging via telomere erosion across the second decade of life. We demonstrate that a greater number of caregiving disruptions is associated with delayed pubertal timing and an acceleration of pubertal tempo. In turn, accelerations in pubertal tempo are associated with significantly greater telomere erosion across time. A formal mediation model indicated that greater caregiving disruptions during childhood predicted greater telomere erosion through an acceleration of pubertal tempo. By documenting the impact of caregiving disruptions on pubertal development and ultimately biological aging, these findings highlight the importance of the stability of the caregiving context and the critical need to ensure that organizations caring for vulnerable children establish programs and policies to minimize unnecessary disruptions.",

In this perspectives piece, we focus on the need for greater intellectual humility (i.e., willingness to revise one’s views and admit that one might be wrong) among social scientists, who are met with particularly high levels of skepticism from the public. We begin with an overview of research demonstrating that when scientists’ identities or ideologies align (or are perceived to align) with those of the public, trust in science increases. We then highlight intellectual humility as a potential tool for cultivating trust in the social sciences even when social scientists’ and the public’s identities or ideologies do not match. Specifically, intellectual humility among social scientists predicts less bias toward one another’s research and hence may increase the diversity of perspectives to which the public is exposed and shift public perceptions of social scientists. We conclude with a discussion of how to foster intellectual humility in science communication, broadly defined.",

One focuses on dissemination, often seeking to inform, reframe, or correct beliefs. Another emphasizes participation and engagement with the goal of improving public understanding of science and scientists’ understanding of the public’s concerns, needs, and values. We argue that participatory approaches better address contemporary challenges concerning scientific uncertainty, politicized science, artificial value neutrality, and a reactive science communication infrastructure. These approaches though need to move away from transactional partnerships toward more cocreation and coproduction of knowledge. They also need to focus more on less motivated and/or engaged populations. Investment in a participatory infrastructure is crucial given that even the most path-breaking science only matters if it can be adequately communicated to relevant stakeholders.",

          "abstract": "The ability of cells to overcome cell cycle arrest and adapt to the presence of unrepairable DNA damage is under the control of Polo-like kinases (PLKs) in eukaryotes. How DNA damage checkpoints are silenced or bypassed during the adaptation response is unknown, but the process requires enrichment of the Cdc5 PLK to microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), such as the yeast centrosomes or spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Here, we found that SPBs play an active role as supramolecular organizing centers that coordinate Cdc5 recruitment and signaling to downstream effectors during the adaptation response to DNA damage. We show that SPB components Nud1, Spc110, and Spc72 are key effectors of Cdc5 recruitment to SPBs in the presence of sustained DNA damage. Following recruitment, Cdc5 transduces a phospho-signal to key structural subunits of the SPB, including Cnm67 and Mps3. We demonstrate these phosphorylation events are required to bypass cell cycle checkpoint arrest and enable effective adaptation to DNA damage. This response is specific because it cannot be recapitulated by a generic inactivation of MTOC activity. Collectively, our results indicate that centrosomes can act as supramolecular platforms to coordinate dynamic recruitment and substrate selection of PLKs during the DNA damage response (DDR).",

          "abstract": "The endosomal–lysosomal network is a hub of organelles that orchestrate the dynamic sorting of hundreds of integral membrane proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. VPS29 is a central conductor of this network through its assembly into Retromer, Retriever, and Commander endosomal sorting complexes, and its role in regulating RAB GTPase activity. Two VPS29 isoforms have been described, VPS29A and VPS29B, that differ solely in their amino-terminal sequences. Here, we identify a third VPS29 isoform, which we term VPS29C, that harbors an extended amino-terminal sequence compared to VPS29A and VPS29B. Through a combination of AlphaFold predictive modeling, in vitro complex reconstitution, mass spectrometry, and molecular cell biology, we find that the amino-terminal VPS29C extension constitutes an autoinhibitory sequence that limits access to a hydrophobic groove necessary for effector protein recruitment to Retromer, and association with Retriever and Commander. VPS29C is therefore unique in its ability to uncouple Retromer-dependent cargo sorting from the broader roles of VPS29A and VPS29B in regulating the endosomal–lysosomal network through accessory protein recruitment. Our identification and characterization of VPS29C points to additional complexity in the differential subunit assembly of Retromer, an important consideration given the increasing interest in Retromer as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "The cerebellar cortex is organized into discrete regions populated by molecularly distinct Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole cortical output neurons. While studies in animal models have shown that PC subtypes differ in their vulnerability to disease, our understanding of human PC subtype and vulnerability remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that human cerebellar regions specialized for motor vs. cognitive functions (lobule HV vs. Crus I) contain distinct PC populations characterized by specific molecular and anatomical features, which show selective vulnerability in essential tremor (ET), a cerebellar degenerative disorder. Using a known PC subtype marker, neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH), we found that motor lobule HV contains PCs with high NEFH expression, while cognitive lobule Crus I contains PCs with low NEFH expression in postmortem samples from healthy controls. In the same cerebella, PC axons in lobule HV were 2.2-fold thicker than those in Crus I. Across lobules, axon caliber positively correlated with NEFH expression. In ET cerebella, we identified motor lobule-specific PC axon pathology with a 1.5-fold reduction in caliber and increased axon variability in lobule HV, while Crus I axons were unaffected. Tremor severity and duration in ET correlated with axon diameter variability selectively in lobule HV PCs. Given that axonal caliber is a major determinant of neural signaling capacity, our results 1) suggest that disrupted cerebellar corticonuclear signaling is occurring in ET, and 2) provide evidence of region-specific PC populations in the human cerebellum and offer insight into how different PC subpopulations may contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebellar degeneration.",

          "abstract": "The fossil record often creates an illusion of sudden evolutionary bursts, which may reflect preservation biases rather than actual biological events. The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) appears to mark the abrupt rise of diverse reef-building metazoans during the late Darriwilian (~460 Ma), seemingly contradicting gradual evolutionary models. Here, we demonstrate this apparent burst is largely an artifact of a global sea-level fall (~475 to 460 Ma) that produced widespread unconformities. Integrated stratigraphic and fossil occurrence data reveal early reef-builders likely appeared earlier than the late Middle Ordovician, but their record was erased by sea-level-driven erosion. During the peak of this sea-level fall (Dapingian Stage, 471 to 469 Ma), both carbonate deposition and fossil occurrences were minimal, with significant correlation between carbonate preservation and reef-builder occurrences. The subsequent transgression enabled these already-diversified organisms to recolonize shallow-water environments simultaneously across multiple regions, generating a misleading impression of sudden diversification. This “Sppil–Rongis effect” biased our understanding of the GOBE in reef ecosystems, illustrating how stratigraphic incompleteness can distort evolutionary patterns. Rather than a discrete evolutionary event, the GOBE reflects a continuous trajectory, interrupted and reshaped by sea-level fluctuations.",

One promising strategy is analyzing the spatial pattern of activity correlations across cell populations. In the primary auditory cortex (A1), cells respond to different sound features. On the large scale, there exists a tonotopic map, which is fractured at the small scale, raising the question of whether functional connections are spatially ordered or disordered. To test whether functional connectivity on a local and a global scale is also disordered, we first designed a robust statistical model to estimate parameters and test for the significance of the estimated correlation maps. We developed an inference method that allows efficient model fitting and statistical testing to project the correlation maps to 2D space. We then performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layer 2/3 of A1 with pure tones (PT) or a combination of two tones (TT; harmonically related or not). We found that the spatial patterns of signal correlations (SCs) depend on the type of sound stimuli that were presented. The functional 2D maps of PT-driven SCs are more restricted to local neurons than TT signal correlations which showed more global textures. 2D SC patterns for harmonic stimuli showed spatially distinct relationships. TT SCs revealed spatially precise functional connectivity between harmonically related neurons. Thus, even though the frequency preference of neighboring neurons in A1 is functionally diverse, the functional connection pattern of these neurons is functionally precise and harmonically related.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that causes life-threatening infections. Its cell envelope contains anionic polymers called teichoic acids that are required for cell viability. Teichoic acids come in two forms and are made by different biosynthetic pathways. One form, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored in the cell membrane; the other form, wall teichoic acid (WTA), is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan cell wall. Although the LTA and WTA biosynthetic pathways have been characterized, regulation of teichoic acid production is not well understood. Here, we identified SpbR ( SAOUHSC_00965 ), a polytopic membrane protein similar to a eukaryotic CAAX protease, as a factor that controls LTA levels in S. aureus cells. We show that loss of SpbR results in short LTAs and a synthetically sick phenotype when WTA biosynthesis is prevented, whereas overexpressing SpbR results in elongated LTAs. Mechanistically, we find that SpbR physically associates with the type I signal peptidase SpsB, which cleaves LtaS, the polymerase that assembles LTA on the extracellular side of the membrane, and we show that this physical interaction inhibits SpsB cleavage of LtaS both in vivo and in vitro. Although the phenotypes investigated here are dominated by SpbR’s effects on LtaS, it also inhibits cleavage of other SpsB substrates. Based on its role in regulating the activity of SpsB, we named this factor SpbR ( S ignal p eptidase b R egulator).",

While the bipartite version of quantum discord is experimentally well-studied, the multipartite version has never been convincingly measured. In this study, we experimentally investigate tripartite quantum discord using an NMR quantum information processor. Building on a theoretical framework for conditional projective measurements and quantum conditional mutual information, we quantify the tripartite quantum discord and its contributions in different three-qubit states such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and Werner (W) states as well as classical mixtures of biseparable Bell states, and classical mixtures of product states. The experiments employed full quantum state tomography and temporal averaging to prepare mixed states, achieving fidelities exceeding 95%. Our results confirm that quantum discord persists even in the absence of entanglement, highlighting its utility as a broader indicator of quantum correlations. Furthermore, we validate the nonconvexity of discord, confirming that classical mixtures of zero-discord states can exhibit nonzero discord. This experimentally confirms that quantum discord does not fit into the framework of resource theory. This work establishes a robust methodology for measuring quantum discord, illuminating the structure and distribution of quantum correlations in multipartite systems.",

On the other hand, the corresponding Breit–Rabi dependence on a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of experimental challenges. Here, we precisely measure the Stark shift of the 6 s 2 1 S 0 ↔ 6 s 6 p 1 P 1 transition of 171 Yb ( I = 1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field up to 120 kV/cm.

          "abstract": "Morphine is a µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and potent analgesic. However, it displays several side effects including respiratory depression and addiction. Here, we show that a single heavy atom replacement in the morphine core structure (O to CH 2 exchange in the E-ring) prepared through a 15-step total synthesis displays a different pharmacological profile. The total synthesis features an intramolecular inverse electron-demand Diels−Alder cycloaddition and a stereoselective Giese radical addition to construct a quaternary carbon center. Unlike morphine, where the (–)-morphine enantiomer binds the MOR, both enantiomers of this “carba” variant, which we have named carbamorphine, possess activity as agonists of the MOR. Cell-based functional assays show that (+)-carbamorphine shows reduced G-protein as well as β-arrestin efficacy at the MOR. In mouse behavioral assays, (+)-carbamorphine exhibits MOR-selective antinociception while showing reduced respiratory depression and a lack of conditioned place preference at supratherapeutic doses. Overall, through a net “single-atom” change (i.e., O to CH 2 ) in the morphine framework, different pharmacological profiles have been realized. This work provides a basis for additional syntheses and the study of morphine analogs that incorporate atom changes in the core framework.",

          "abstract": "Using time-variable gravity fields determined from satellite laser ranging (SLR) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), we derive three decades of barystatic sea level (BSL) change estimates since 1993, providing a long record of satellite gravimetry-based BSL estimates comparable in duration to satellite altimetry. Over the 1993–2022 altimetry era, the BSL change rate is 1.75 ± 0.59 mm/y (2σ) as observed by SLR. The rate increases to 2.16 ± 0.59 mm/y (SLR) and 2.13 ± 0.38 mm/y (GRACE/-FO) over 2003–2022, mainly due to accelerated ice loss in Greenland since the 2000s. The remarkable agreement between SLR and GRACE/-FO estimates over the joint period cross-validates each other, suggesting that both work well in monitoring BSL changes. We also compare our satellite gravimetry estimates with the sum of individual mass change components (ice sheets, glaciers, and land water storage) obtained from multisource datasets (in situ, remote sensing and geophysical modeling). The differences are within 0.2 mm/y over the three decades, highlighting the global consistency of different techniques for observing Earth’s surface mass changes. Moreover, we reconcile the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise budget using reprocessed altimetry data and updated thermosteric sea level ensembles. From 1993 to 2022, the sum of thermosteric and SLR-based barystatic contributions (3.16 ± 0.64 mm/y) agrees well with altimetry-observed GMSL rate (3.22 ± 0.28 mm/y), suggesting that the GMSL rise budget can be closed within uncertainties over the last three decades.",

This research aims to examine the independent and interactive between- and within-person associations of sleep duration and sleep onset timing on next-day PA duration in two large, longitudinal samples of adults under free-living conditions. In the primary study, participants (N = 19,963; 5,995,080 person-nights) wore a validated biometric device (WHOOP) for 1 y (01/09/2021 to 31/08/2022). Objective sleep and PA metrics were derived from the wrist-worn device. Generalized additive mixed models assessed between- and within-person associations between sleep and PA variables, adjusted for age, sex, Body Mass Index, weekday/weekend, seasonal effects, biometric feedback, and autocorrelated errors. Between participants, longer sleep duration and later sleep onset timing were associated with decreased moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and overall PA duration ( ps &lt; 0.001). Within participants, sleeping shorter-than-usual and falling asleep earlier-than-usual were associated with increased next-day MVPA and overall PA, whereas sleeping longer-than-usual, or falling asleep later-than-usual, showed the opposite relationship ( ps &lt; 0.001). Next-day MVPA duration was highest following earlier-than-usual sleep onset timing combined with one’s typical sleep duration. Results were consistent but smaller in magnitude in the external validation study (N = 5,898; 635,477 person-nights) using Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Individuals may sacrifice time in one health behavior for time in the other. Interventions promoting exercise and holistic public health messaging should consider the temporal dynamics between sleep and next-day PA outcomes.",

The approach comprises identifying hotspot sidechains in a functional protein–protein interaction and grafting these side chains onto much smaller structured peptide scaffolds of opposite chirality. The approach enables more facile design of D-peptides and its applicability is demonstrated by design of D-peptidic binders of influenza A virus hemagglutinin, resulting in identification of multiple D-peptide lead series. The X-ray structure of one of the leads at 2.38 Å resolution verifies the validity of the approach.

However, Mtb alters host RNA splicing to quench host antibacterial responses, the mechanism for which remains unknown. Here, we report a mechanism whereby a secreted Mtb protein interferes with the biogenesis of key spliceosomal components. A high-throughput yeast-2-hybrid screen identified several Mtb -secreted proteins interacting with the host RNA splicing factors (SFs). Through custom-designed in-cell assays, we show that one of those proteins, Rv1435c/hsr1 (host splicing regulator 1), targets specific exon-skipping events. The Mtb Rv14345c/hsr1 facilitates direct interaction between Mtb phagosomes and U5 snRNA and SNRPF, key components of the snRNPs. Genetic deletion of Rv1435c/hsr1 reverses the specific exon-skipping events caused by WT Mtb infection. The Δ hsr1 strain shows compromised growth during ex vivo infection in macrophages and in vivo infection in mice. Tissue sections from the WT Mtb or Δhsr1 -infected mice showed significant hsr1-dependent SNRPF staining, a phenomenon also noted in the human intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) biopsies. Thus, hsr1 is a virulence factor that disrupts host snRNP biogenesis for pathogenesis. The splicing regulators from the host and pathogen are novel targets for antituberculosis therapy.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how humans have altered coral reef food webs remains challenging due to the absence of prehistoric baselines. Here, we use fish remains preserved in fossil and archaeological deposits from Panamá and the Dominican Republic to explore how Caribbean reef fish mortality patterns have changed over millennia. By quantifying accumulation rates of shark dermal denticles (scales) and bony fish otoliths (ear stones) in reef sediments, we assess relative fish abundance, while otolith size serves as a proxy for body size at death. Comparisons of these death assemblages suggest a 75% decline in shark-derived material and a 22% reduction in the sizes of human-targeted fishes—consistent with historical exploitation. This evidence of decline in large-bodied, higher trophic level fish remains coincided with a doubling in prey fish otolith accumulation and a 17% increase in their reconstructed body sizes. These patterns in time-averaged death assemblages align with effects of release from predation, documenting an often assumed (but rarely shown) cascading effect. In contrast, otoliths of predator-sheltered cryptobenthic fishes showed no change in either accumulation or size, suggesting that ‘‘bottom–up”environmental factors were not responsible for the observed changes. Together, these data indicate that pre-exploitation predator communities strongly controlled exposed prey fishes, but this “top–down” effect diminishes rapidly toward the food chain base, especially in predator-resistant groups. Understanding trophic cascades on Caribbean reefs requires studying systems before predator depletion.",

Here, we found that beyond the regulation of mRNA transcript abundance, light regulates alternative splicing (AS) in the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans , Trichoderma guizhouense, and Neurospora crassa . Blue light-regulated AS was involved in ergothioneine biosynthesis and conidiation in T. guizhouense , which required the blue light receptor BLR1. Blue light activated the MAPK HOG (Sak) pathway which then transmitted the signal via the serine/threonine kinase SRK1 to the AS key regulator SRP1. SRK1 and SRP1 are important for light-induced conidiation. The light-activated HOG pathway led to an increase of the SRK1 protein level and its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylated SRK1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to interact with SRP1, thereby regulating AS efficiency. This study unravels another level of complexity of fungal environmental sensing and responses and also first describes the entire cascade from an environmental signal to the splicing machinery.",

Despite its pivotal role, Rubisco has a slow carboxylation rate ( k cat CO 2 ) and is competitively inhibited by oxygen (O 2 ). These traits impose limitations on photosynthetic efficiency, making Rubisco a compelling target for improvement. Interest in Form II Rubisco from Gallionellaceae bacteria, which comprise a dimer or hexamer of large subunits, arises from their nearly fivefold higher k cat CO 2 than the average Rubisco enzyme. As well as having a fast k cat CO 2 (25.8 s − 1 at 25 °C), we show that Gallionellaceae Rubisco (GWS1B) is extremely sensitive to O 2 inhibition, consistent with its evolution under semianaerobic environments. We therefore used an in vivo mutagenesis-mediated screening pipeline to evolve GWS1B over six rounds under oxygenic selection, identifying three catalytic point mutants with improved ambient carboxylation efficiency: Thr-29-Ala (T29A), Glu-40-Lys (E40K), and Arg-337-Cys (R337C). Full kinetic characterization showed that each substitution enhanced the CO 2 affinity of GWS1B under oxygenic conditions by subduing oxygen affinity, leading to 25% (E40K), 11% (T29A), and 8% (R337C) enhancements in carboxylation efficiency under ambient O 2 at 25 °C. By contrast, under the near anaerobic natural environment of Gallionellaceae , the carboxylation efficiency of each mutant was impaired ~16%. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of artificial directed evolution to access distinctive regions of catalytic space in Rubisco.",

CTP binding and hydrolysis enable ParB to slide along DNA and to bridge and condense DNA, thereby dictating the size and dynamics of the tripartite ParAB S complex. Several other evolutionarily distinct systems can also segregate DNA, although the full diversity of bacterial DNA partition systems remains unknown. Here, we identify a CTP-independent ParAB S system that maintains the conjugative plasmid SCP2 in the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor . We demonstrate that an SCP2 ParB-like protein, ParT, loads onto DNA at an 18-bp parS site and diffuses away to the adjacent DNA despite lacking an apparent CTPase domain and detectable NTPase activity. We further show that parS DNA facilitates ParT transition from loading to a diffusing state, allowing ParT to accumulate on DNA, and that ParT activates the ATPase activity of its cognate partner protein, ParA. Additionally, we identify numerous structural homologs of ParT, suggesting that CTP-independent diffusion on DNA might be more common than previously recognized. Overall, our findings reveal a CTP-independent DNA translocation as an alternative and unexpected mechanism for assembling a bacterial DNA segregation complex and suggest that CTP binding and hydrolysis are not universal features of ParAB S -like systems.",

In Escherichia coli , it was shown that 1) FtsZ recruits all essential divisome proteins to the septum, including the core sPG synthase complex, FtsWIQLB, and its activator, FtsN; 2) FtsWIQLB must complex with FtsN to be activated to synthesize sPG under the wildtype background; and 3) the Brownian ratcheting by treadmilling FtsZ polymers drives the directional movements of sPG synthase proteins along the septum circumference; and 4) FtsZ is essential for the early stage, but dispensable for the late stage of cell wall constriction. However, it remains unclear how FtsZ spatial–temporally organizes the divisome for robust cell wall constriction during cytokinesis. Combining theoretical modeling with experiments in E. coli , we show that at the early stage during cell division, the Brownian ratcheting by FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral FtsWIQLB and FtsN into close contacts for FtsWIQLB-FtsN complex formation and as a conveyor to maximally homogenize the septal distribution of sPG synthesis activities to avoid uneven cell wall constriction. When the septum constricts progressively, the FtsN septal density increases via binding to denuded sPG (dnG) and serves as the template to activate FtsWIQLB for continued sPG synthesis, rendering FtsZ dispensable. Our work suggests an overarching framework for how FtsZ spatial–temporally regulates septal cell wall constriction, in which different bacteria species may operate in various parameter regimes to meet their distinct functional requirements.",

          "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease with no current cure. Drug discovery and repurposing are essential to enhance treatment efficacy and safety. We utilized summary statistics for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of 2,004 plasma and 1,443 brain proteins, a genome-wide association study of MS susceptibility with 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls, both bulk and cell-type specific transcriptome data, and external pQTL data in blood and brain. Our integrative analysis included a proteome-wide association study to identify MS-associated proteins, followed by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to determine potential causal associations. We used the HEIDI test and Bayesian colocalization analysis to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. Proteins passing all analyses were prioritized as potential drug targets. We further conducted pathway annotations and protein–protein interaction network analysis (PPI) and verified our findings at mRNA and protein levels. We tested hundreds of MS-associated proteins and confirmed 18 potential causal proteins (nine in plasma and nine in brain). Among these, we found 78 annotated pathways and 16 existing non-MS drugs targeting six proteins. We also identified intricateAQ PPIs among seven potential drug targets and 19 existing MS drug targets, as well as PPIs of four targets across plasma and brain. We identified two targets using bulk mRNA expression data and four targets expressed in MS-related cell types. We finally verified 10 targets using external pQTL data. We prioritized 18 potential drug targets in plasma and brain, elucidating the underlying pathology and providing evidence for potential drug discovery and repurposing in MS.",

          "abstract": "For decades, the surface of the polar Southern Ocean (south of 50°S) has been freshening—an expected response to a warming climate. This freshening enhanced upper-ocean stratification, reducing the upward transport of subsurface heat and possibly contributing to sea ice expansion. It also limited the formation of open-ocean polynyas. Using satellite observations, we reveal a marked increase in surface salinity across the circumpolar Southern Ocean since 2015. This shift has weakened upper-ocean stratification, coinciding with a dramatic decline in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Additionally, rising salinity facilitated the reemergence of the Maud Rise polynya in the Weddell Sea, a phenomenon last observed in the mid-1970s. Crucially, we demonstrate that satellites can now monitor these changes in real time, providing essential evidence of the Southern Ocean’s potential transition toward persistently reduced sea ice coverage.",

          "abstract": "Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with over half the world’s population at risk. Infection with any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes is most often self-limiting, but a significant number of cases present with severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage that may be fatal. African ancestry is associated with protection against severe dengue, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using skin explants from genetically defined donors, we show that European ancestry skin has a much stronger inflammatory response to DENV than African ancestry skin, eliciting markedly increased infiltration, infection and migration of resident Langerhans cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The effect was seen with all dengue serotypes and Zika virus and in the presence of heterotypic immune serum. Genetic pathways associated with inflammation, interferon (IFN)-α, and inflammatory cytokine signaling were enriched in European relative to African ancestry skin following infection. Infiltration and infection of macrophages in African ancestry skin increased to that of European skin after blocking IFN-α and providing interleukin-1β. Polymorphic variants in RXRA , OAS1-3, and TGFB1 genes that were more frequent in European donors were associated with increased virus replication. Paradoxically, European ancestry skin cells had increased expression of OAS3 in response to virus and type I IFN. Thus, the limited inflammatory response of African ancestry skin to infection restricts replication and spread of dengue and other flaviviruses. Genetic ancestry should be considered when predicting a patient’s likelihood of severe dengue, and when assessing efficacy and adverse events associated with dengue vaccines.",

          "abstract": "Transcytosis across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), is tightly controlled to prevent the entry of macromolecules, microorganisms, and toxins into the brain. Transferrin receptor (TfR) transcytosis, one of the few active transcytosis pathways in HBMECs, is extensively utilized for drug transport across the BBB and employed by meningitis-causing bacteria to penetrate into the brain. However, the molecular mechanism facilitating the fusion of TfR vesicles with the basolateral membrane of HBMECs, the final step of transcytosis, has not been experimentally studied. Here, we found that the interaction between the v-SNARE protein VAMP3 on TfR vesicles and the t-SNARE protein syntaxin 4 that is limited to the basolateral membrane in HBMECs mediates the fusion. We also provided evidence that this step is critical for the efficiency of TfR transcytosis. Furthermore, we showed that neonatal meningitis Escherichia coli (NMEC) infection significantly boosts the efficiency of this transcytosis by enhancing the expression of VAMP3 and syntaxin 4 through the TLR4-TRAM-TRIF-TRAF3-IKK-IRF3 signaling pathway in HBMECs. Silence or overexpression of VAMP3 and syntaxin 4 reduces or enhances the transcytosis of transferrin and NMEC in a human BBB model in vitro . Consistently, the penetration of transferrin and NMEC into the brain was significantly inhibited in VAMP3-deficient mice. These findings provide insights for improving strategies to deliver drugs into the brain and developing effective therapy for meningitis caused by NMEC.",

Presently with a 2.4 Myr period, the Mars–Earth beat cycle of orbital perihelion frequencies is particularly sensitive to chaotic diffusion, potentially varying by more than a million years. Early Mesozoic (252 to 145 Ma) strata provide some constraints on this cycle, with evidence of a swing through most of the solution space from 1.8 Myr at 210 Ma to 2.5 Myr at 190 Ma and back to 1.6 Myr at 180 Ma. However, only the 1.8 Myr cycle is corroborated by geochronologic data and the 1.6 Myr period is disputed. Here, we show that variations in land-plant-dominated stable carbon isotopic ratios (δ 13 C org ) from the lacustrine, paleo-high-latitude Sangonghe Formation (Junggar Basin, northwestern China), reveal at least three 1.6 Myr Mars–Earth beat cycles centered at 183 Ma, tracking atmospheric CO 2 isotopic composition in Earth’s exchangeable carbon reservoirs. Furthermore, the middle cycle includes the famous Jenkyns Event, expressed here by poleward migration of cheirolepidaceous conifers driven by CO 2 warming from the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province (LIP). Our data do not, however, support major, LIP-triggered input of isotopically light carbon and instead support CO 2 amplification of local processes via warming and ecosystem change. Although requiring additional independent geochronological support, Sangonghe data help provide empirical constraints for filtering orbital solutions, tightening initial conditions, and testing gravitational models, as well as showing how extrinsic cyclical processes interact with a tectonic event, the Karoo-Ferrar LIP.",

We use herbarium specimens to explore climate niche evolution across 14 annual species of the Streptanthus ( s.l. ) clade (Brassicaceae), which originated in deserts and diversified into cooler, moister areas. To understand how climate niches evolved, we used historical climate records to estimate each species’ 1) classic annual climate niche, averaged over specimen collection sites; 2) growing season niche, from estimated specimen germination date to collection date, averaged across specimens (specimen-specific niche); and 3) standardized seasonal niche based on average growing seasons of all species (clade-seasonal niche). In addition to estimating how phenological variation maps onto climate niche evolution, we explored how spatial refugia shape the climate experienced by species by 1) analyzing how field soil texture changes relative to the climate space that species occupy and 2) comparing soil water holding capacity from each specimen locality to that of surrounding areas. Specimen-specific niches exhibited less clade-wide variation in climatic water deficit (CWD) than did annual or clade-seasonal niches, and specimen-specific temperature niches showed no phylogenetic signal, in contrast to annual and clade-seasonal temperature niches. Species occupying cooler regions tracked hotter and drier climates by growing later into the summer, and by inhabiting refugia on drought-prone soils. These results underscore how phenological shifts, spatial refugia, and germination timing shape “lived” climate. Despite occupying a large range of annual climates, we found these species are constrained in the conditions under which they thrive.",

In this study, we present cryogenic electron microscopy structures of both mouse and human TAUT in various conformational states. The taurine-bound, occluded forms of mouse and human TAUT reveal the substrate binding pocket and the ion binding sites. The amino group of taurine interacts with Glu406 at the binding site, constituting a key structural feature determining substrate preference. While both imidazole acetic acid and guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES) inhibit TAUT by competing with taurine for the binding site, GES also functions as a substrate of TAUT. Moreover, mouse TAUT is captured in an inward-open apo conformation, where the tilted movement of transmembrane helix (TM) 1a opens the intracellular gate. Notably, TM6 exhibits two distinct conformational states: the canonical form consisting of two half-helices and a continuous straight helix. In the latter conformation, TM6 partially occupies the substrate binding site, likely promoting taurine release. Together, our findings provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TAUT recognizes and transports taurine.",

This work explores the potential of using shape memory particles to dynamically regulate suspension fluid flow through controllable shape transformations. First, we synthesize shape-memory particles with programmable anisotropy from liquid crystal elastomers, such that the stiffness and shapes of the particles can be tuned by manipulating temperature. Our findings reveal that suspensions from such particles exhibit significant tunability in shear thickening behavior, transitioning from discontinuous shear thickening to a Newtonian-like response within a narrow temperature range of 60 ° C. This capability to modulate rheological responses in situ presents an approach for addressing processing challenges in many applications where control over flow behavior is paramount. Furthermore, we also show that suspensions composed of these anisotropic particles can undergo physical aging, and evolve into a glassy state. This state can be escaped upon activation of the shape memory effect. This reversibility underscores the potential for using such materials to engineer systems that can enter or come out of kinetic arrest by leveraging internal mechanical responses to external stimuli. The insights gained here not only broaden our understanding of the interplay between particle geometry and suspension dynamics but also pave the way for leveraging ensembles of stimuli-responsive objects to precisely control collective behaviors in many-body systems.",

Microbial cell factory is a promising approach for the green and sustainable production of hemoproteins. However, current microbial hosts face the challenges of safety and insufficient heme supply. Here, we report a global regulation strategy, “push–restrain–pull–block,” to enhance heme supply for producing various active Hb and Mb in food-grade Bacillus subtilis . Initially, the insufficient supply of the precursor 5-aminolevulinate was overcome by relieving feedback inhibition and mitigating the negative effects of HemX on HemA. Next, HemD was identified as the primary uroporphyrinogen III synthase and self-assembled with HemC to minimize the formation of the uroporphyrinogen I by-product. Additionally, the coproporphyrin-dependent pathway was selected as the superior downstream route for heme synthesis, and crucial rate-limiting steps were subsequently enhanced. Moreover, heme consumption was blocked by eliminating protoheme IX farnesyltransferase. Finally, through the combination and fine-tuned expression of key genes, a 221-fold improvement of heme supply was achieved in the engineered strain. Using this stable prokaryotic chassis, we achieved production of 0.81, 0.82, 1.11, and 1.01 g L −1 of soybean Hb, clover Hb (C-Hb), bovine Mb (B-Mb), and porcine Mb, respectively, through fermentation, marking the highest reported titers in prokaryotic systems. These hemoproteins exhibit properties similar to natural standards. Furthermore, the synthesized C-Hb and B-Mb demonstrated superior effects for preparing plant-based meat analogs as colorants and flavoring agents. This work provides a universal platform for producing other high-value hemoproteins, promising future advancements in food processing and biocatalysis.",

NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a Ras guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 mutation accordingly leads to Ras misactivation and downstream activation of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, leading to the approval of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF-1 associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors. However, how NF1 loss modifies response to selumetinib and the utility of targeting additional upstream inputs or downstream outputs of Ras these tumors remain unclear. Here, we perform RNA-sequencing, phosphoproteomic, pharmacologic, and proximal proteomic analysis across a panel of CRISPR interference immortalized peripheral nerve (iPN) cells to systematically dissect the function of neurofibromin loss. Small guide NF1 (sg NF1 ) repression is sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels and alter gene expression to promote cell proliferation and dedifferentiation, with sg NF1 iPNs showing decreased sensitivity to selumetinib due to altered feedback regulation to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK. Upstream small guide PTPN11 (sg PTPN11 ) repression leads to the inverse gene expression signature, decreasing cell proliferation and promoting differentiation, and sg PTPN11 iPNs are more sensitive to selumetinib. However, upstream sonof sevenless 1 inhibition shows limited efficacy in iPNs due to compensation by SOS2. Finally, proximal proteomics reveals Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), but not Harvey rat sarcoma virus (HRAS) or neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), associates with neurofibromin in iPN cells, and pan-KRAS inhibition is sufficient to block ERK activation and CDK1/2 activation in NF1 mutant cells, suggesting blocking KRAS may be a therapeutic approach for NF1 mutant PNS tumors.",

Moreover, the presence of ancient or contemporary gene flow between both species is largely untested. The Norwegian lemming displays characteristic phenotypic and behavioral adaptations (e.g., coat color, aggression) that are not present in other Lemmus species. We generated a de novo genome assembly for the Norwegian lemming and resequenced nine modern and two ancient Lemmus spp. genomes. We show that all Lemmus species form distinct monophyletic clades, with concordant topology between the mitochondrial and nuclear genome phylogenies. The Siberian lemming is divided into two distinct but paraphyletic clades, one in the east and one in the west, where the western clade represents a sister taxon to the Norwegian lemming. We estimate that the Norwegian and western Siberian lemming diverged shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum, making the Norwegian lemming one of the youngest known mammalian species. We did not find any indication of gene flow between L. lemmus and L. sibiricus , suggesting postglacial isolation of L. lemmus . Furthermore, we identify species-specific genomic differences in genes related to coat color and fat transport, which are likely associated with the distinctive coloration and overwintering behavior observed in the Norwegian lemming.",

Most of the world’s lakes seasonally freeze, often resulting in oxygen depletion as ice cover inhibits water column ventilation and snow cover limits photosynthesis while respiration continues. Widespread shortening of ice-cover duration in a warmer world might improve winter oxygenation, but this hypothesis remains untested. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of 6.6 million physical and chemical observations from 19,645 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere during 1960 to 2022. Contrary to expectations, under-ice DO trends ranged from significantly negative in small lakes (A surf &lt;10 ha) (−0.14 ± 0.05 mg L −1 decade −1 ) to significantly positive in large lakes (≥10 4 ha) (0.11 ± 0.03 mg L −1 decade −1 ). This morphometric scaling emerged partly because ice-cover periods have shortened 2.2 times faster in large lakes compared to small lakes. Hierarchical modeling revealed that in smaller lakes, increasingly oxygen-depleted conditions in summer carried over to the ice-cover season, because fetch size limited wind-driven aeration in fall. As a result of this cross-seasonal ecological memory, under-ice hypoxic zones have expanded. Oxygen trended most negative in small eutrophic and humic lakes with high seasonal oxygen depletion rates. In larger lakes (≥10 3 ha), negligible summer deoxygenation, prolonged ventilation in fall, and shortening of the oxygen drawdown period in winter explained positive DO trends. However, in the vast majority of seasonally ice-covered lakes, which are small, continued climate warming is likely to exacerbate deoxygenation.",

          "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) is a morphogen that contributes to inner ear development. Gain and loss of function experiments have indicated retinoic acid’s critical role in cochlear hair cell development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we hypothesized that RA receptor alpha (RARA) has a dual role in cochlear organogenesis: First, during embryonic development, in the presence of RA, RARA functions as a transcriptional activator that induces prosensory gene expression in progenitor cells and supports differentiation of the organ of Corti; later during postnatal development, when RA is absent, the function of RARA switches, thereby repressing prosensory genes in postnatal hair cells and hindering trans-differentiation into supporting cells. This hypothesis was supported by demonstration that RARA forms a complex with either the coactivator NCOA1 or the corepressor NCOR1 depending on the developmental stage. In addition, modulation of RA levels was found to govern recruitment of the coactivator and corepressor to the RARA complex, and the expression of prosensory genes was validated to depend on RARA complex composition. Together, our results provide insights supporting the potential of harnessing RA signaling to induce prosensory progenitors in stem cell–based strategies for hearing loss.",

          "abstract": "The origin and evolution of protein folds are among the most challenging, long-standing problems in biology. We developed Protein Fold Evolution Simulator (PFES), a computational approach that simulates evolution of globular folds from random amino acid sequences with atomistic details. PFES introduces random mutations in a population of protein sequences, evaluates the effect of mutations on protein structure, and selects a new set of proteins for further evolution. Iteration of this process allows tracking the evolutionary trajectory of a changing protein fold that evolves under selective pressure for protein fold stability, interaction with other proteins, or other features shaping the fitness landscape. We employed PFES to show how stable, globular protein folds could evolve from random amino acid sequences as monomers or in complexes with other proteins. The simulations reproduce the evolution of many simple folds of natural proteins as well as emergence of distinct folds not known to exist in nature. We show that evolution of small globular protein folds from random sequences, on average, takes 1.15 to 3 amino acid replacements per site, depending on the population size, with some simulations yielding stable folds after as few as 0.2 replacements per site. These values are lower than the characteristic numbers of replacements in conserved proteins during the time since the Last Universal Common Ancestor, suggesting that simple protein folds can evolve from random sequences relatively easily and quickly. PFES tracks the complete evolutionary history from simulations and can be used to test hypotheses on protein fold evolution.",

Based on animal and human data, we have proposed that AMN supports the brain’s action mode by controlling functions required for successful goal-directed behavior. However, task fMRI averaged across groups has associated AMN regions with a variety of behaviors, contributing to uncertainty about AMN function. Here, we investigated the AMN using an inside-out approach, in which the network architecture of the AMN is first precisely mapped within individuals and then associated with behavioral functions. Individual-specific precision functional mapping with &gt;5 h of RSFC and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a replicable AMN subnetwork structure. AMN subnetworks were characterized and annotated by combining a meta-analytic network association method with RSFC, intrinsic timing, and task activation profiling. We demonstrate the existence of AMN-Decision, -Action, and -Feedback subnetworks that are distributed across lobes, forming a temporally sequential within-network processing stream by which the brain adjudicates between possible goals, sets action plans, and modifies those plans in response to feedback such as pain. A subnetwork in the pars marginalis of the cingulate was distinct from the Decision, Action, and Feedback subnetworks and may be important for the construction of the bodily self.",

However, their practical application has long been limited because pure Os exhibits excessively strong adsorption of intermediates and suffers from stability issues. Herein, we report the development of a highly stable catalyst achieved by implanting the sulfur (S) atom into the matrix, facilitating the transformation of Os nanocrystals into Os single atoms. The prepared atomically dispersed Os catalyst (Os-SA@SNC) demonstrates outstanding catalytic activity, requiring only a 13 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, as well as the excellent durability. This performance surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and outperforms most of the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Theoretical simulations clarify the important role of S atoms in promoting the dispersion and diffusion of Os atoms. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that S atoms adjust the local electronic structure of Os active sites, further facilitating the adsorption/dissociation of H 2 O and optimizing the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG *H ), thereby accelerating the kinetics of both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps in alkaline HER. This work revitalizes Os-based catalysts for energy conversion and paves the way for innovative HER catalyst design and application to contaminated soil/water remediation.",

We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoiré-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoiré lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near ν = − 2 , possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoiré lattices as a tunable parameter for designing quantum phases and an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moiré materials.",

Both science and industry have been driven by a shared romantic vision of exploring the Universe, whether by studying distant galaxies or by humanity stepping out into space. All of this was suddenly disrupted in 2019 by a rude awakening. Starlink communication satellites began to photo-bomb astronomers’ images as they streaked across the sky.

In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor ν = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics.

We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice.

The distribution of these sites along chromosome arms constitutes the human “centeny map.” By using a custom Genomic Centromere Profiling (GCP) pipeline, we leveraged the motif’s position, orientation, and organization to construct structural models that enable reclassification of human chromosomal clusters, detection of centromere expansion, and identification of structural variants and misassembled regions. The high-resolution maps derived from this pattern not only provide a framework for comparative analysis of centromeres across evolution and disease but also offer a new dimension for chromosome annotation, assembly, and characterization.",

          "abstract": "Ferroelectric materials have been widely used in various electromechanical devices, from ultrasonic transducers and actuators to mechanical energy harvesters. The key performance metrics of these devices, such as sensitivity, efficiency, and bandwidth of ultrasonic transducers, are largely determined by the piezoelectric properties. This Review highlights recent research progress in improving the piezoelectricity of ferroelectric materials and offers potential strategies for further enhancement to meet the ever-increasing demands for high-performance piezoelectric devices and systems. It provides insights into the future development of ferroelectrics to address the increasing demands of emerging applications, including photoacoustic imaging and piezoelectric fans and motors in integrated circuit–enabled electronic devices. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to consider environmental impacts across the entire life cycle of ferroelectrics, from sourcing and manufacturing to usage and disposal.",

          "abstract": "Current research on ferroelectric polymers centers predominantly on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)–based fluoropolymers because of their superior performance. However, they are considered “forever chemicals” with environmental concerns. We describe a family of rationally designed fluorine-free ferroelectric polymers, featuring a polyoxypropylene main chain and disulfonyl alkyl side chains with a C3 spacer: −SO 2 CH 2 CHRCH 2 SO 2 − (R = −H or −CH 3 ). Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that strong dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring disulfonyl groups induce ferroelectric ordering in the condensed state, which can be tailored by changing the R group: ferroelectric for R = −H or relaxor ferroelectric for R = −CH 3 . At low electric fields, the relaxor polymer exhibits electroactuation and electrocaloric performance comparable with those of state-of-the-art PVDF-based tetrapolymers.",

We argue that such inconsistencies result from confounding geographical influences that mask the true relationship between species richness and energy-related factors. Here, by comparing species richness across different climate conditions, we disentangle the direct effects of temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity from the confounding impacts of the area and isolation of various climates. Using a global analysis of terrestrial vertebrates, we reveal clear and consistent relationships between energy-related factors and species richness. Our findings clarify existing ecological theory and illustrate how adopting a climate space perspective advances biodiversity research, providing critical insights into biodiversity patterns and their responses to environmental change.",

In this study, we identified Zincore, a protein complex consisting of QRICH1 and SEPHS1, as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for embryonic development in mice and associated with developmental syndromes in humans. We also identified ZFP91 as a representative Zincore client, binding the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR. Cryo–electron microscopy of a Zincore-ZFP91-DNA complex revealed a SEPHS1 arginine clamp to recognize the DNA-bound zinc finger domains. This mode of binding explains recognition of different ZNFs and stabilizes ZFP91 onto its cognate DNA motif. Thus, our study identified Zincore as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for development, involving a distinctive mechanism that locks ZNFs onto DNA and regulates transcription.",

However, existing protocols for generating random unitaries require long evolution times and deep circuits. In this work, we prove that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in extremely low depth on any geometry. These shallow circuits have low complexity and create only short-range correlations, yet are indistinguishable from random unitaries with exponential complexity. This finding contrasts sharply with classical systems, in which a long evolution time is required to appear random. Our results have widespread applications across quantum science, from device benchmarking to quantum advantages. Moreover, they reveal that fundamental physical properties—including evolution time, causal structure, and phases of matter—are provably hard to learn.",

The wooden implements include digging sticks and small, complete, hand-held pointed tools. The sophistication of many of these tools offsets the seemingly “primitive” aspects of stone tool assemblages in the East Asian Early Paleolithic. This discovery suggests that wooden implements might have played an important role in hominin survival and adaptation in Middle Pleistocene East Asia.",

Numerous gatekeepers determine which research manuscripts complete this dissemination pathway, and the resulting media landscape influences public understandings of scientific fields. Here, we compare scientific and popular publishing of archaeology about different geographic regions. Of 1155 archaeology papers in one specialist and six general science journals across 6 years, 32% were reported by at least one of 15 US news sources. Mixed-effects logistic regression models revealed variation across news sources, but overall papers about archaeology in United Kingdom, Israel/Palestine, and Australia were significantly more likely to receive coverage, compared to China/Taiwan. This disparity raises concerns as archaeology influences notions of identity and cultural achievement, and has been misappropriated by racist, nationalist ideologies. We recommend ways for actors in research dissemination to diversify archaeology coverage.",

Lipids are a crucial resource for hunter-gatherers, especially for foragers whose diet is based heavily on animal foods. Recent foragers have expended substantial amounts of energy to obtain this resource, including time-consuming production of bone grease, a resource intensification practice thus far only documented for Upper Paleolithic populations. We present archaeological data from the lake landscape of Neumark-Nord (Germany), where Last Interglacial Neanderthals processed at least 172 large mammals at a water’s edge site. Their (partial) carcasses were transported to this location for the extraction of within-bone nutrients, particularly bone grease. This “fat factory” constitutes a well-documented case of grease rendering predating the Upper Paleolithic, with the special task location devoted to extraction of nutritionally important lipids forming an important addition to our knowledge of Neanderthal adaptations.",

However, while exceptional plasticity was recently discovered in a series of low-symmetry semiconductors, their deformation mechanism remains mysterious. Here, taking monoclinic Ag 4 SSe as a case study, we show that the inherent high-symmetry anion sublattice with a quasi–body-centered cubic (bcc) structure is embedded in the monoclinic matrix. This, coupled with the highly diffuse cations, results in multiple slip systems and is responsible for the superior plasticity as normally unexpected in low-symmetry structures. We observe typical slip systems conforming with those of the bcc structure by experiment. This finding clarifies the deformation mechanism of Ag 2 S-based low-symmetry semiconductors and sheds light on future exploration of ductile inorganic semiconductors.",

          "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) is remarkable for its immense global disease burden and low mutation rate. Despite strong selective pressure, M.tb shows frequent deletions at the PPE71 – 38 locus, most notably in hypervirulent L2 Beijing strains. Here, we show that loss of the PPE71 – 38 locus causes increased stress response gene expression and increased triglyceride levels. In addition, we demonstrate that reintroduction of PPE71 into the L2 strain HN878 suppresses the baseline elevation of these transcripts, while overexpression of PPE71 increases the localization of PE_PGRS proteins and lipoproteins to the M.tb outer mycomembrane. Mouse infection confirmed the hypervirulence of the PPE71 – 38 deletion strain and conversely showed that PPE71 overexpression attenuates M.tb . Our results indicate that loss of PPE71 – 38 is sufficient to drive an adaptive transcriptional response seen in M.tb L2 strains that likely contributes to the hypervirulence of this lineage.",

          "abstract": "Membrane proteins fold and function in a lipid bilayer constituting cell membranes. Nonetheless, their structure and function can be recapitulated in diverse amphiphilic assemblies whose compositions deviate from native membranes. It remains unclear how various hydrophobic environments stabilize membrane proteins and whether lipids play any unique role in protein stability compared to other types of amphiphiles. Here, using the evolutionarily unrelated α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins from Escherichia coli , we find that the hydrophobic thickness and the strength of amphiphile-amphiphile packing in amphiphilic assemblies are critical determinants of protein stability. Lipid solvation enhances protein stability by facilitating residue burial in the protein interior, reminiscent of the lipophobic effect. This lipid-mediated mechanism also strengthens the cooperative residue-interaction network, promoting the propagation of local structural perturbations throughout the protein. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of lipid solvation in modulating the stability of membrane proteins and their responses to external stimuli.",

Crucial for understanding their behavior, the characterization of the scale-to-scale energy transfer resulting from the interplay of turbulent motions, propagating waves, and instabilities is a key scope of major space missions. Here, we show how simultaneous upscale and downscale energy transfers occur in solar wind, leading statistically to equipartition of the turbulent energy flux. Our study sheds light on the paradigm of the existence of dual energy cascades in astrophysical plasmas, identifying the scales at which energy sources act in the magnetohydrodynamic regime driving turbulent dynamics in solar wind. These findings suggest that a significant fraction of the energy injected into stellar winds at scales much smaller than those of galaxies could be transferred to larger scales through turbulence, potentially influencing star formation processes.",

We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from networks with different architectures, tasks, and training data. We found that diverse networks learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite having highly distinct designs. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network’s specific characteristics. Each network can be reduced to fewer than 10 of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.",

Optical sectioning (OS) opens the avenue to three-dimensional (3D) microscopy, but nonoptical approaches, including sample adhesion and mechanical scanning, have always been required in this technique, rendering it impossible to image suspended cells. Here, we develop optical tweeze-sectioning microscopy by coupling structured illumination microscopy (SIM) with holographic optical tweezers (HOTs). By sculpting light in HOTs, we demonstrate that the position fluctuations of suspended yeast cells can be optically squeezed to tens of nanometers, which is sufficient for the implementation of OS with SIM. Sample scanning is achieved through optical delivery of the cells, instead of translation stages as in the conventional way. Our work presents an all-optical solution for OS, broadening its application to nonadherent, suspended cells. It further furnishes the original technique that enables both SIM-based 3D imaging and optical manipulation.",

Recently, postgrowth annealing has been proposed to tune the CDW order from long-range to complete suppression, offering a tuning knob for the CDW order. Here, by comparing the electronic structures of FeGe subjected to different annealing conditions and distinct CDW properties, we report spectral evolution associated with the lattice and spin degrees of freedom. We find band evolution linked to a spin density wave (SDW) order present in both samples with and without CDW order, and another evolution connected to the lattice distortions that onset with the long-range CDW order and revert with the SDW order.

By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI allows simultaneous imaging of PA/PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65-megahertz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9-pascal noise equivalent pressure. First, the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter and the subsequent wave interaction with a mouse skull and brain slices are demonstrated. Then, using water as the absorber, a wavelength-dependent PA/PT generation, evanescent wave–generated PA, and a back-propagated acoustic Mach cone with a tapered fiber are recorded.

We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in human epithelial cells to identify modulators of SFA toxicity. The screen revealed peroxisomal proteins, especially those that affect ether lipid synthesis, as important regulators of lipotoxicity. We identified Fas-associated factor family member 2 (FAF2) as a critical bifunctional coregulator of peroxisomal and fatty acid biology. We further demonstrated the requirement of the ubiquitin-regulatory X (UBX) and UAS thioredoxin-like domains of FAF2 for peroxisomal protein abundance and SFA-induced cellular stress.

Our findings show increased magmatic oxidation states linked to the enrichment of terrigenous sediments from Neo-Tethys subduction to postcollision, as evidenced by distinctive mass-independent Hg isotope fractionation in postcollisional porphyries (Δ 199 Hg = −0.25 to 0.22‰) and mantle-derived ultrapotassic rocks (Δ 199 Hg = −0.54 to 0.25‰) and negative δ 26 Mg values in ultrapotassic rocks (δ 26 Mg = −0.51 to −0.04‰). These results suggest that oxidation of postcollisional magmas was driven by the subduction of carbonates and/or sulfates from the Indian plate, enhancing metal enrichment.

We developed a soft ventricle prototype using thin-walled pouch actuators that achieve transmission ratios above one via circumferential shrinkage.

Experimental results showed high energy transfer efficiency (82 to 91%), and in vitro tests demonstrated promising cardiac outputs of 5.9 liters per minute against aortic pressure and 7.6 liters per minute against pulmonary pressure.

We propose a reconstructed sodium metal anode (RSMA) by implanting an activatable ion-conductive network to the bulk. NaPF 6 will be activated with an electrolyte to conduct ions and form an anion-derived SEI. Conductive polymers become the supporting skeleton; thus, the RSMA has a metal-bulk storage matrix and an expanded three-dimensional plating/stripping mechanism and permits the homogeneous deposition/dissolution of Na + in high dimensions.

          "abstract": "By adulthood, humans rapidly identify objects from sparse visual displays and across large disruptions to their appearance. What are the minimal conditions needed to achieve robust recognition abilities and when might these abilities develop? To answer these questions, we investigated the upper limits of children’s object recognition abilities. We found that children as young as 3 years successfully identified objects at speeds of 100 milliseconds (both forward and backward masked) under sparse and disrupted viewing conditions. By contrast, a range of computational models implemented with biologically informed properties or optimized for visual recognition did not reach child-level performance. Models only matched children if they received more object examples than children are capable of experiencing. These findings highlight the robustness of the human visual system in the absence of extensive experience and identify important developmental constraints for building biologically plausible machines.",

However, the short signal lifetime of hyperpolarized 13 C-labeled compounds commonly used in HypMRI studies restricts investigations to fast molecular reactions and rapid distributions. Here, we introduce hyperpolarized 15 N,d 9 -betaine (trimethyl- 2 H 9 - 15 N-glycine) as an endogenous MRI contrast agent with a long-lived signal suited for comprehensive molecular tracking. With in vivo detectability exceeding 14 minutes and high polarization efficiency, 15 N,d 9 -betaine supports both real-time and delayed-phase MRI from a single dose, enabling flexible, multistage imaging. In preclinical models, renal 15 N,d 9 -betaine images were acquired with strong signal-to-noise ratios across resolutions. This extended imaging window facilitates tracking molecular distribution, assessing tissue perfusion, and monitoring cellular uptake relevant to betaine’s roles in cellular protection. By extending MRI capabilities across timescales, hyperpolarized 15 N,d 9 -betaine holds promise for applications like organ function assessment, disease monitoring, and real-time evaluation of therapeutic interventions, advancing noninvasive molecular imaging.",

Using density functional theory and machine learning, we unveil a universal rule for creating stable two-dimensional counterparts of traditional high-performance III-V semiconductors, i.e., the versatile assembly of building blocks originating from orbital hybridization and electron transfers adhering to the electron counting rule. Akin to LEGO construction, the various building blocks are arranged in different configurations, introducing diverse two-dimensional structures with higher energetic stability than previous structures. Regression analysis reveals the energies of these structures as a linear superposition of the energies of their building blocks, further confirming the LEGO concept. Notably, the predicted two-dimensional GaSb exhibits a hole mobility (~10 8 square centimeters per volt per second) that far surpasses that of graphene (2 × 10 5 square centimeters per volt per second). This study highlights the expansion of nonlayered materials into two dimensions and the potential of two-dimensional confinement in traditional materials.",

However, enhancing resolution is typically accompanied by increasing the density of sensing nodes, large numbers of interconnecting wires, and complex signal processing modules. This work presents super-resolution (SR) tactile sensor arrays with sparsely distributed taxels powered by a universal intelligent framework. Such smart sensor systems involve a general topological optimization strategy for taxel layout design and a deep learning model called self-attention–assisted tactile SR. Driven by the proposed model, they can dynamically distinguish high-density pressure stimuli by generating 2700 virtual taxels from only 23 physical taxels. An SR scale factor of more than 115 and an average localization error of 0.73 millimeters are achieved, approximating human fingertip accuracy and surpassing current state-of-the-art solutions. This framework enhances flexible sensors with SR capabilities in a facile and energy-efficient manner, illustrating the potential to equip robots with embodied tactile perceptions.",

Here, we demonstrate efficient and tunable SHG within the green spectrum using a high- Q Si 3 N 4 microresonator. On-chip green power as high as 5.3 milliwatts is generated with a conversion efficiency of 141% per watt (absolute 7.9%). A space-charge grating induced by the photogalvanic effect realizes reconfigurable grating numbers and flexible wavelength tuning over a range of 2.6 terahertz. In addition, grating formation dynamics and competition are observed. These findings underscore the potential of Si 3 N 4 as a robust, integrative platform for on-chip, tunable green light sources.",

New geochemical and mineralogical data from multiple instruments aboard the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover record serpentinization and associated H 2 production in ancient igneous rocks of the Máaz formation, exposed on the Jezero crater floor. These data, combined with petrogenetic constraints, indicate that serpentinization may have been driven by devolatilization of magmatic H 2 O, highlighting a potential link between H 2 production and the style and tempo of magmatism within the ancient martian crust.",

Using complementary analyses, we provide quantitative estimates of ecologically relevant dispersal and evolutionarily important gene flow in co-distributed coral species on the Great Barrier Reef. We find dispersal distances across meters (23 to 102 meters) in the brooding Stylophora pistillata and across kilometers (21 to 52 kilometers) in the broadcast spawning Pocillopora verrucosa , consistent with expectations based on their reproductive modes. Similarly, while gene flow rates averaged over the past ~400,000 generations are very low among S. pistillata populations, P. verrucosa populations are well connected. As a result, estimates of genetic diversity across multiple metrics and population sizes are smaller in S. pistillata compared to P. verrucosa . These results highlight the importance of spatial scales and reproductive modes in predicting coral adaptive responses and underscore the value of considering spatial connections between target populations in conservation and restoration.",

The transcription factor LIM Homeodomain 2 ( Lhx2 ), a key regulator of cortical development, is expressed in postmitotic layer II/III neurons and their progenitors. Loss of Lhx2 in either population caused similar but distinct phenotypes: reduced dendritic arbors, altered spine morphology, and changed electrophysiological properties. Morphometric defects were more severe when Lhx2 was disrupted in progenitors and were recapitulated by its specific loss in basal progenitors. Lhx2 loss in progenitors aberrantly up-regulated Neurog2 in postmitotic neurons, and Neurog2 knockdown partially rescued the phenotype. Loss of Lhx2 at either stage also up-regulated Wnt signaling pathway genes. The mutant phenotype was mimicked by constitutive activation of β-CATENIN in postmitotic neurons. Our findings reveal previously unidentified LHX2-dependent mechanisms of dendritic morphogenesis, highlighting its temporally dynamic and diverse roles in neocortical development.",

In this study, we used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced chorioamnionitis model in pregnant nonhuman primates to explore the therapeutic potential and mode of action of srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs). Intraamniotic injection of LPS induced infiltration of BCL2A1-positive neutrophils and CD68-positive macrophages in the extraplacental membranes, causing fetal lung injury. Conversely, administration of Exo-srIκB via intraamniotic and intravenous routes (6.9 × 10 10 and 4 × 10 11 particle numbers, respectively) ameliorated these effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the decidua and bulk RNA sequencing of the choriodecidua highlighted that Exo-srIκB treatment mitigated LPS-induced inflammatory pathways, particularly in macrophages, leading to a cascade effect on neutrophils through NF-κB signaling inhibition. These findings underscore the potential of Exo-srIκB as a therapeutic strategy for chorioamnionitis.",

We use recently developed methods for identifying temporal patterns in behavior to show that monkeys change their motivation depending on the availability of rewards in the environment. Distinctive patterns of DRN activity occur when monkeys transition between a high-motivation state occupied when rewards are abundant, to a low-motivation state engendered by reward scarcity. Disrupting DRN diminishes sensitivity to the reward environment and perturbs transitions in motivational states.",

Although these processes likely demand higher cognitive functions, the prefrontal areas that regulate limbic parental programs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) excitatory projection neurons promote alloparental caregiving behaviors in female mice. By chronic microendoscopy, we observed robust yet adaptable representations of pup-directed anticipatory and motor-related activities within the OFC. Some of these plastic responses were significantly overlapped with those related to nonsocial reward signals. The inactivation of OFC output reduced the phasic activities of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons specifically tied to pup retrieval and impaired the modulation of DA release to the ventral striatum during the acquisition of alloparental behaviors. These findings suggest that the OFC transiently boosts DA activity during the acquisition phase, thereby facilitating the manifestation of alloparental behaviors.",

We found the largest positive δ 138 Ba shifts recorded in geological history, indicating increased marine export productivity in the Antler foreland basin, followed by the productivity-driven expansion of anoxia. The nearly identical stratigraphic trends, along with different absolute values in δ 138 Ba between the two sites, suggest spatial differences in marine biological pump intensity during the Early Mississippian. Earth system model simulations indicate that a global increase of 30% in marine export productivity is needed to explain observed changes. Our findings support the idea that an enhanced marine biological pump contributed to elevated organic carbon burial and the transition from a greenhouse climate to the LPIA.",

We have applied this formalism to rapid mapping of a temperature-composition phase diagram. Experimental determination of phase boundaries in thin films is autonomously interspersed with real-time updating of phase diagram prediction using CALPHAD. AMASE was able to accurately determine the eutectic phase diagram of the Sn-Bi thin-film system from a self-guided campaign covering just a small fraction of the phase space, translating to a sixfold reduction in the number of experiments.

However, like in other industries, FIRE revenues are distributed unevenly between different classes of workers. I examine the implications of these distributive patterns for individual attitudes toward government spending, inflation, income inequality, and taxes. Using large-scale survey data from the UK, I find that employees in the FIRE sector are more likely to support policies that, in principle, protect the unique sources of financial revenues than are employees in non-FIRE sectors, even after accounting for personal income levels. I also find that an employee’s class position—defined in terms of their workplace authority and professional credentials—significantly moderates these sectoral differences in attitudes. Specifically, differences are larger among managers and professional workers than among non-professional workers. I conclude by discussing how these differences may affect class political alignments in financialized economies.",
