          "authors": "Amanda Hollis-Brusky",
          "abstract": "Donald Trump and Trumpism have transformed the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, two institutions at the heart of the conservative legal movement. In this article, I use the conservative philosophy of fusionism as a lens for understanding the causes and consequences of the transformation. The original fusionism of William F. Buckley and Frank S. Meyer brought disparate factions of conservatives together under the mantle of libertarian means to conservative ends. Here, I show that Trump and Trumpism have transmogrified that original concept into a “new fusionism” of authoritarian means to Christian nationalist ends . I investigate the extent to which this “new fusionism” has been embraced or endorsed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society and what the consequences might be for the respectability and efficacy of the conservative legal movement after Trump.",

          "abstract": "I examine the tension between Donald Trump’s perception of the judiciary—marked by a form of legal realism—and the Supreme Court’s stated commitment to judicial bipartisanship and independence. I analyze Trump’s public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to highlight how the court’s claim of independence is complicated by political science data showing that judges often align with the ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary’s stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly polarized environment.",

          "authors": "Jonathan H. Adler",
          "abstract": "The Roberts court has long been characterized as a “probusiness” court, given the ostensible orientation of the court’s Republican-appointed majority and assumptions that President Trump’s appointments have magnified that orientation. But there are reasons to question this characterization. Quantitative analyses often fail to account for the relative importance of individual decisions, the broader legal context in which the court’s decisions are made, or the ways in which decisions can alter or depart from preexisting legal baselines. I show that President Trump’s appointments to the court have fairly consistently voted to restrain the power of administrative agencies, but they have not consistently supported outcomes that are beneficial to business. In cases involving state laws that may fragment or burden national markets, the Roberts court may actually be less sympathetic to business interests than it was prior to Trump’s appointments.",

          "abstract": "The articles in this volume, written by leading law professors, political scientists, and journalists, center on the impact of President Donald Trump on the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact of the court on the second Trump administration and on all Americans. President Trump has already appointed a third of the current court and may appoint more than half. Considering that the second Trump administration has sought to “flood the zone” with executive actions during its first 100 days, the court’s rulings have become massively significant for American governance and for the lives of people in our nation and around the world. The four sections of the volume consider the rise of the “Trump court,” the court’s recent rulings on judicial and executive power and on a range of basic rights, its standing in the public’s eyes, and how it stacks up against high courts in other democracies.",

          "abstract": "The politics of appointments have transformed the U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. We examine why and how the current conservative supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court’s collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the culmination of a “partisan sort” in appointments—a strict correlation between party and ideology—that began a few decades ago but did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court for several decades.",

Harvard realizes conceptions about race and the post–Civil War amendments present in the Roberts court’s jurisprudence for several years including, notably, deep skepticism about the continuing need for civil rights remedies and a reading of colorblindness as the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conservative litigation groups and the Trump administration are now using the SFFA decision to challenge race-conscious affirmative action programs and fundamental racial justice and civil rights laws and policies. While the Supreme Court has so far declined to adopt the farthest-reaching colorblindness arguments and has even expanded the reach of civil rights statutes in certain contexts, the next few years will likely be consequential for racial justice and antidiscrimination law. The court will almost certainly take up cases challenging the constitutionality of long-standing civil rights laws and recent racially reparative efforts.",

          "abstract": "The current Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on issues of executive power differs markedly depending on the precise type of executive power in question. Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most important sources of authority. But the court’s approach is more coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court’s decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political branches.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a shock to the political and legal systems—and, based on the justices’ first encounters with the post- Dobbs world during the 2023–2024 term, it was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is unavailable after Dobbs , concerns for pregnant women and their fate dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.",

          "abstract": "How a country’s apex court functions and how its justices decide cases is shaped by its institutional design and history and by the political and cultural context in which it sits. I compare the apex courts of 38 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, finding that the power and role of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) makes it unique among them. SCOTUS’s appointment process, lifelong judicial terms, agenda-setting powers, consensus norms, and constitutional framework make it an exceptionally powerful and exceptionally partisan court. Further, several factors that encourage a tendency toward the protection of rights in other apex courts are less relevant to SCOTUS. This comparison highlights that SCOTUS is the most partisan of the OECD apex courts, among the most powerful, and relatively less likely than other courts to uphold core democratic principles.",

          "abstract": "Chief Justice John Roberts is often called an “institutionalist,” indicating that he places the good of the Supreme Court as a governing institution over his own political preferences. This description is true only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis presented here shows that Roberts’s priority is to advance his version of the modern conservative legal movement’s vision of the Constitution, and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice’s disposition, both for the court and for the nation’s evolving conception of constitutionalism.",

          "abstract": "Over the past half century, Republican leaders have had considerable success enlisting courts in their campaign to boost the party’s electoral prospects through the suppression of voting and the manipulation of election rules. Donald Trump has embraced this mission and escalated the assault on America’s electoral processes in new and dangerous ways. Has the Supreme Court supported or opposed this contemptible project? Its recent election law decisions offer a mixed verdict, though its performance mostly leans in an antidemocratic direction. The court’s decisions safeguarding democracy are fewer than those that undermine voting rights and elections, are typically handed down over the objections of Trump’s appointees, and often include doctrinal provisions that enable it to restrict democratic participation in the future. Whether the Supreme Court will abet or discourage the erosion of American democracy in the future is an open question.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s embrace of originalism, and particularly the “history and tradition” method of interpreting constitutional text, is often justified by its defenders as constraining judges from making up the law to match their preferences. This is a testable hypothesis. With the Bruen case in 2022, the Supreme Court moved away from a contemporary means-ends method of interpreting the Second Amendment to an originalist, “history and tradition” one. In this article, we analyze data on gun rights decisions handed down by lower federal courts from 2000 to 2023, finding that the Supreme Court’s switch to an originalist jurisprudence did not, in fact, constrain judges—rather, it corresponds with an increase in judicial discretion. Personal factors like partisan identity, gender, race, and careerist considerations shape judicial behavior in the post- Bruen era in ways they did not under the prior regime.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling abrogating women’s long-established right to abortion affords an opportunity to better understand how people update their attitudes toward the court. The data analyzed here reinforce evidence from earlier studies that the Dobbs ruling produced a substantial hit to the court’s institutional legitimacy. Why and how did this occur? A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term evaluations of the court’s performance are informed by individual rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs . But, as I show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can undermine institutional loyalty.",

It argues that these justices have failed to articulate a persuasive rationale as to why exactly the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings and that they have failed to adequately show that history supports their “no-coercion” construction of what constitutes a prohibited establishment. Concerning the Free Exercise Clause, the court’s conservatives have dismissed history by disregarding historical practices that do not conform to their approach to the text. The court’s use, misuse, and nonuse of history cannot help but give the impression that policy preferences—more than history or the actual original understanding of the First Amendment—have determined recent church-state decisions.",

          "abstract": "The Roberts court’s immigration jurisprudence has reinforced the discretionary powers of the government and sharply limited constitutional constraints on the exercise of those powers. As a result, the protection of immigrants’ rights increasingly has become a matter of executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants themselves.",

          "abstract": "All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka) 1–9 . By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa 10–15 . These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.",

At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator 3–5 , we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth’s known magnetic sense 4 ), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth’s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth’s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.",

          "abstract": "Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes 1 . Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses ( Rosa sect. Caninae ; 2 n = 5 x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents 2,3 . Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa . Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.",

          "abstract": "Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction. In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity 1–13 , but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.",

          "abstract": "Modern colour image sensors face challenges in further improving sensitivity and image quality because of inherent limitations in light utilization efficiency 1 . A major factor contributing to these limitations is the use of passive optical filters, which absorb and dissipate a substantial amount of light, thereby reducing the efficiency of light capture 2 . On the contrary, active optical filtering in Foveon-type vertically stacked architectures still struggles to deliver optimal performance owing to their lack of colour selectivity, making them inefficient for precise colour imaging 3 . Here we introduce an innovative architecture for colour sensor arrays that uses multilayer monolithically stacked lead halide perovskite thin-film photodetectors. Perovskite bandgap tunability 4 is utilized to selectively absorb the visible light spectrum’s red, green and blue regions, eliminating the need for colour filters. External quantum efficiencies of 50%, 47% and 53% are demonstrated for the red, green and blue channels, respectively, as well as a colour accuracy of 3.8% in Δ E Lab outperforming the state-of-the-art colour-filter array and Foveon-type photosensors. The image sensor design improves light utilization in colour sensors and paves the way for the next generation of highly sensitive, artefact-free images with enhanced colour fidelity.",

          "abstract": "Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems 1–3 . Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development 4 . We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization.",

          "abstract": "Australia’s Eastern Highlands have traditionally been viewed as a cold-climate barrier to Late Pleistocene (~35,000–11,700 years ago) mobility, with older evidence restricted to elevations below the periglacial zone. However, this model has not been adequately tested with regionally specific, high-resolution archaeological data. Here we report excavation results from a high-altitude (1,073 m) cave, Dargan Shelter, in the upper Blue Mountains, which indicate that occupation first occurred ~20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, making this the highest elevation Pleistocene site identified in Australia so far. Findings include multiple in situ hearths and 693 stone artefacts, several of which were sourced from sites along the mountain range, providing evidence for previously undetected interactions to the north and south and the repeated use of this cold-climate landscape during the Late Pleistocene. Our results align the Australian continent with global sequences, which indicate that cold climates were not necessarily natural barriers to human mobility and occupation.",

          "authors": "Michael Ganslmeier, Tim Vlandas",
          "abstract": "Assessing model uncertainty is crucial to quantitative political science. Yet, most available sensitivity analyses focus only on a few modeling choices, most notably the covariate space, while neglecting to jointly consider several equally important modeling choices simultaneously. In this article, we combine the exhaustive and systematic method of the Extreme Bounds Analysis with the more multidimensional logic underpinning the multiverse approach to develop an approach to sensitivity analyses. This allows us to systematically assess the degree and sources of model uncertainty across multiple dimensions, including the control set, fixed effect structures, SE types, sample selection, and dependent variable operationalization. We then apply this method to four prominent topics in political science: democratization, institutional trust, public good provision, and welfare state generosity. Results from over 3.6 bn estimates reveal widespread model uncertainty, not just in terms of the statistical significance of the effects, but also their direction, with most independent variables yielding a substantive share of statistically significant positive and negative coefficients depending on model specification. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of three distinct approaches to estimating the relative importance of different model specification choices: nearest 1-neighbor; logistic; and deep learning. All three approaches reveal that the impact of the covariate space is relatively modest compared to the impact of sample selection and dependent variable operationalization. We conclude that model uncertainty stems more from sampling and measurement than conditioning and discuss the methodological implications for how to assess model uncertainty in the social sciences.",

          "authors": "Xiaoyu Ge, Yubo Hou",
          "abstract": "Regional collectivism has been observed to contribute to better coping with public crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study poses a reverse question: Does the eruption of public crises increase people’s conformity to the collective? To answer this question, we analyzed real-world transactions on Taobao (the largest e-commerce platform in China), each with a purchase decision and a list of candidates considered before purchasing. Conformity to the collective was measured using two indicators: whether the decision-maker opted for the A) most-sold and B) best-rated options within the candidate option set. The results reveal that both conformity variables were significantly higher in the 10 wk subsequent to January 19, 2020 (when the nationwide COVID-19 crisis erupted in China), than in the 8 wk prior. These shifts were common across subpopulations, regions, and product categories and remained significant after strictly matching across weeks and after using a within-person, longitudinal sample. These shifts were more confidently attributed to the pandemic by further conducting difference-in-differences analyses to compare pandemic-affected regions with their unaffected, comparable counterparts using data from six subsequent regional waves in China. Furthermore, regions with larger increases in conformity during the early stage of the pandemic achieved better antipandemic outcomes. These findings provide real-world evidence for previous theories on behavioral immune systems, terror management, and compensatory control. Additionally, cross-regional comparisons of effect sizes offer exploratory insights into cultural psychology. In summary, these findings capture how human societies dynamically adjust their values to better adapt to unanticipated survival challenges.",

          "abstract": "Evolution of complexity in human languages has been vigorously debated, including the proposal that complexity can build in small, isolated populations but is often lost in situations of language contact. If it is generally true that small, isolated languages can build morphological complexity over time, but complexity tends to be lost in situations of language contact, then we should find that forms of language complexity that have evolved multiple times will tend to be associated with population size, isolation, and language age. We test this hypothesis by focusing on one particular form of morphological complexity, polysynthesis, where words built from many parts embody complex phrases. By assembling a global database of polysynthetic languages and conducting phylospatial analyses, we show that languages with highly complex word morphology are more likely to have small population sizes, less likely to occur with many other languages in direct contact, and have a greater tendency to be on long phylogenetically isolated lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that languages that evolve in isolation for long periods may be more likely to accrue morphological complexity. Polysynthetic languages also tend to have higher levels of endangerment. Our results provide phylogenetically informed evidence that one particular form of complex language morphology is more likely to occur in small, isolated languages and is prone to loss in contact.",

          "abstract": "We use crowd-sourced assessments from X’s Community Notes program to examine whether there are partisan differences in the sharing of misleading information. Unlike previous studies, misleadingness here is determined by agreement across a diverse community of platform users, rather than by fact-checkers. We find that 2.3 times more posts by Republicans are flagged as misleading compared to posts by Democrats. These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful overrepresentation of Republicans among X users. Our findings provide strong evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing which cannot be attributed to political bias on the part of raters, and indicate that Republicans will be sanctioned more than Democrats even if platforms transition from professional fact-checking to Community Notes.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can generate human-like responses, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. The causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, safeguarding, and more. These results warrant caution in using LLMs as surrogates or for simulating human behavior in research.",

          "authors": "Inês Terrucha, Elias Fernández Domingos, Rémi Suchon, Francisco C. Santos, Pieter Simoens, Tom Lenaerts",
          "abstract": "In an era increasingly influenced by autonomous machines, it is only a matter of time before strategic individual decisions that impact collective goods will also be made virtually through the use of artificial delegates. Through a series of behavioral experiments that combine delegation to autonomous agents and different choice architectures, we pinpoint what may get lost in translation when humans delegate to algorithms. We focus on the collective-risk dilemma, a game where participants must decide whether or not to contribute to a public good, where the latter must reach a target in order for them to keep their personal endowments. To test the effect of delegation beyond its functionality as a commitment device, participants are asked to play the game a second time, with the same group, where they are given the chance to reprogram their agents. As our main result we find that, when the action space is constrained, people who delegate contribute more to the public good, even if they have experienced more failure and inequality than people who do not delegate. However, they are not more successful. Failing to reach the target, after getting close to it, can be attributed to precision errors in the agent’s algorithm that cannot be corrected amid the game. Thus, with the digitization and subsequent limitation of our interactions, artificial delegates appear to be a solution to help preserving public goods over many iterations of risky situations. But actual success can only be achieved if humans learn to adjust their agents’ algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Protein structure–function relationships are critical for understanding molecular mechanisms and the impacts of genetic variation. Mutational scanning approaches can deliver scalable analysis, usually through the study of loss-of-function variants. Rarer dominant negative and gain-of-function variants can be more information rich, as they retain a stable proteoform and can be used to dissect molecular function while retaining biological context. Dominant variant proteoforms can still engage substrates and interact with binding partners. Here, we probe the structure–function relationships of the Mus81 endonuclease by ectopic expression of deep mutational scanning libraries to find amino acid variants that confer dominant sensitivity to genotoxic stress and dominant synthetic lethality. Screening more than 2,200 MUS81 variants at 100 positions identified 13 amino acids that can be altered to elicit a dominant phenotype. The dominant phenotype of these variants required the presence of the obligate Mus81 binding protein, Mms4. The dominant variants affect amino acids in a contiguous surface on Mus81 and fall into two distinct classes: residues that bind the catalytic magnesium atoms and residues that form the hydrophobic wedge. Most of the variant amino acids were conserved across species and cognate variants expressed in human cell lines resulted in dominant sensitivity to replication stress and synthetic growth defects in cells lacking BLM helicase. The dominant variants in both yeast and human MUS81 resulted in phenotypes distinct from a MUS81 knockout. These data demonstrate the utility of dominant genetics using ectopic expression of amino acid site saturation variant libraries to link function to protein structure providing insight into molecular mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Intermediate filaments are key regulators of cell mechanics. Vimentin, a type of intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells and involved in migration, forms a dense network in the cytoplasm that is constantly remodeling through filament transport, elongation/shortening, and subunit exchange. While it is known that filament elongation involves end-to-end annealing, the reverse process of filament shortening by fragmentation remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of in vitro reconstitution, probed by fluorescence imaging and atomic force microscopy, with theoretical modeling to uncover the molecular mechanism involved in filament breakage. We first show that vimentin filaments are composed of two populations of subunits, half of which are exchangeable and half immobile. We also show that the exchangeable subunits are tetramers. Furthermore, we reveal a mechanism of continuous filament self-repair, where a soluble pool of vimentin tetramers in equilibrium with the filaments is essential to maintain filament integrity. Filaments break due to local fluctuations in the number of tetramers per cross-section, induced by the constant subunit exchange. We determine that a filament tends to break if approximately four tetramers are removed from the same filament cross-section. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of association/dissociation and fragmentation to estimate the binding energy of a tetramer to a complete versus a partially disassembled filament. Our results provide a comprehensive description of vimentin turnover and reveal the link between subunit exchange and fragmentation.",

S-layers are thought to play an important role in chemically and physically insulating cells from the external environment. Here, we show that the integrity of the S-layer in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is maintained as cells grow via a process of self-assembly as SlaA monomers fill gaps in the lattice. Although this lattice which is physically tethered to the membrane might be expected to hinder cell division, we show that the S-layer flattens the membrane at cytokinesis to accelerate ESCRT-III-dependent cell division—and is important for robust, successful cell divisions under conditions of mechanical stress. Taken together, these results define the rules governing S-layer self-assembly and show how a flexible lattice coat that is coupled to the underlying membrane can both provide a cell with mechanical support and help to drive rapid and functionally important changes in cell shape.",

Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the ADAM17 zymogen bound to iRhom2. Our findings elucidate the interactions within the ADAM17–iRhom2 complex, the inhibitory mechanisms of the therapeutic MEDI3622 antibody and ADAM17 prodomain, and the previously unknown role of a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic reentry loop of iRhom2 involved in the mechanism of activation.

          "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses are important pathogens of humans and plants. These viruses built viral replication organelles (VROs) with the help of co-opted host proteins and intracellular membranes to support robust virus replication in infected cells. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a model (+)RNA virus, assembles membranous VROs, which are associated with vir-condensate substructures driven by TBSV p33 replication-associated protein. In this work, we provide evidence that the peroxisome-associated TBSV and the mitochondria-associated carnation Italian ringspot virus hijack the host small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) machinery in yeast model host and plants. Based on knockdown of components of the SUMO pathway, we show that SUMO machinery acts as a cellular proviral dependency factor during TBSV replication. The sumoylation machinery was found to be partially retargeted from the nucleus into vir-condensate associated with membranous VROs through direct interactions with TBSV p33. We developed a yeast-based sumoylation assay that demonstrated p33 sumoylation. Absence of sumoylation or mutations in SIM SUMO-interacting motif in p33 replication protein reduced the ability of p33 to form droplets in vitro via phase separation. We demonstrate that p33 sumoylation and its intrinsically disordered region play noncomplementary roles in droplet formation. Mutations in p33 sumoylation sites and p33-SIM sequence resulted in reduced-sized VROs, which showed diminished protection of TBSV p33 and the viral RNA from degradation and also reduced viral RNA recombination. Altogether, the co-opted host sumoylation machinery promotes viral replication and RNA recombination. This finding could provide opportunities for antiviral interventions via targeting protein posttranslational modifications.",

          "abstract": "Plague continues to pose a public health problem in multiple regions of the world, including Madagascar, where it is characterized by a pronounced seasonal pattern. The drivers of plague seasonality remain poorly understood. Using a deterministic compartmental model, calibrated to rat and flea capture data, serological data collected in active rural foci, and human plague surveillance data, we analyzed the effects of seasonal rat and flea population dynamics on plague transmission. The models that incorporated seasonal fluctuations in rat and flea populations provided better predictive performances than those that did not. We found that a simpler mass-action model also performed well. Driven by these seasonal changes, the effective reproduction number (R e ) between rats peaks at 1.45 [95% credible interval (CI): 1.41, 1.48] in October and falls to 0.6 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.63) in March. We estimated that 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2%, 0.9%) of rats are infected annually, indicating that plague is not the main driver of rat population changes. Using our model, we evaluated intervention strategies and found that targeting both rats and their fleas at the start of the epidemic season (July–September) was the most effective approach for reducing human plague cases. Such an approach contrasts with the reactive strategy currently employed in Madagascar. Our findings highlight the role of flea and rat populations in plague seasonality and identify strategies that could be deployed in Madagascar to better control plague epidemics.",

          "abstract": "Cancer therapy is limited by resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic and/or by treatment-associated toxicity. Identifying molecular mechanisms that modulate cellular toxicity is crucial for enhancing treatment efficacy. We characterize CDADC1, a vertebrate-specific orphan enzyme, as an unprecedented eukaryotic dCTP deaminase. CDADC1 catalyzes the conversion of dCTP into dUTP. While bacteria use this activity to sustain proliferation, CDADC1 evolved independently and is not required for mammalian cell proliferation, as demonstrated in cell lines and by the normal growth and standard lifespan of Cdadc1-deficient mice. However, we uncover a role of CDADC1 in metabolizing nucleotide analogs gemcitabine and decitabine. Gain- and loss-of-function assays in cancer cell lines, along with ectopic mouse models of pancreatic cancer, show that CDADC1 reduces these drugs’ efficacy. By the same token, Cdadc1 −/− mice are hypersensitive to gemcitabine. Mechanistically, CDADC1 deaminates the active triphosphate form of gemcitabine and decitabine, rendering them susceptible to inactivation by deoxyuridine triphosphatase. In contrast, the dCMP deaminase DCTD contributes to cell proliferation and promotes gemcitabine and decitabine toxicity. Thus, CDADC1 underpins a previously unrecognized mechanism of intrinsic chemoresistance in cancer cells and has a nonredundant role in protecting from gemcitabine toxicity. CDADC1 reveals a clinically relevant metabolic pathway that might be exploited to enhance the efficacy of deoxycytidine analogs but calls for assessing CDADC1 status to avoid lethal toxicities.",

          "abstract": "Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.",

Using high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy, we determined the structures of Sus scrofa and Xenopus laevis GnRHRs bound to mammal GnRH, uncovering conserved and species-specific mechanisms of receptor activation and G protein coupling. The conserved “U”-shaped GnRH conformation mediates high-affinity binding through key interactions with residues such as K 3.32 , Y 6.51 , and Y 6.52 . Species-specific variations in extracellular loops and receptor–ligand contacts fine-tune receptor function, while ligand binding induces structural rearrangements, including N terminus displacement and TM6 rotation, critical for signaling. Structure–activity relationship analysis demonstrates how D-amino acid substitutions in GnRH analogs enhance stability and receptor affinity. Distinct binding modes of agonists and antagonists elucidate mechanisms of ligand-dependent activation and inactivation. These insights lay the groundwork for designing next-generation GnRHR therapeutics with enhanced specificity and efficacy for conditions like endometriosis, prostate cancer, and infertility.",

We identify 1,733 splice-disrupting mutations, with the most extreme variants likely being deleterious. We report that these variants are not distributed evenly across exons but are mostly concentrated in the ~8% of exons that are most susceptible to splicing mutations (i.e., hotspot exons). We demonstrate how multiple, splice-disrupting mutations in these exons can be reverted by the same ASOs targeting the splice sites of either their upstream or downstream flanking exons.

Although CD18 (LFA-1) has been implicated as a receptor on myeloid cells, the mechanisms underlying HlyA cytotoxicity to epithelial cells are poorly defined. Here, we show that HlyA secretion by UPEC markedly intensifies renal tubular epithelial injury in a murine model of ascending pyelonephritis. A CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in renal collecting duct cells revealed an unexpected requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in HlyA-induced cytotoxicity. Following internalization, HlyA triggered lysosomal permeabilization, resulting in protease leakage, cytoplasmic acidification, and mitochondrial impairment, culminating in rapid epithelial cell death—a pathway distinct from canonical membrane-disrupting mechanisms of other PFTs. Moreover, we identify the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as a critical epithelial receptor for HlyA; genetic ablation or competitive inhibition of the HlyA–LDLR interaction fully abrogated cytotoxicity. Our findings detail a paradigm for HlyA function in which epithelial toxicity relies on LDLR-mediated endocytic uptake rather than plasma membrane poration. These mechanistic insights illuminate potential therapeutic strategies to attenuate HlyA-mediated tissue damage during UPEC infections.",

We find that Earth’s present-day convecting upper mantle has variable δ 13 C value from ~−10 to −4‰, significantly different from the δ 13 C value of peridotitic diamonds and with the highest values being restricted to the Atlantic. Evidence for significant mantle heterogeneity contrasts with previous assumptions and its origin remains puzzling being uncorrelated with geochemical markers associated with either subduction and surficial recycling processes or lower mantle contributions.

Here, we report that damage to soybean leaves by wounding or burning triggered a burst of isoprene emission from the undamaged part of the leaves. In silico analysis identified intact ISPS genes in the soybean genome, with features similar to known ISPSs. Protein made from these gene sequences catalyzed isoprene production in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate. Isoprene emission in soybeans was linked to reduced photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance.

          "abstract": "Theories on group-bias often posit an internal preparedness to bias one’s cognition to favor the in-group (often envisioned as a product of evolution). In contrast, other theories suggest that group-biases can emerge from nonspecialized cognitive processes. These perspectives have historically been difficult to disambiguate given that observed behavior can often be attributed to innate processes, even when groups are experimentally assigned. Here, we use modern techniques from the field of AI that allow us to ask what group biases can be expected from a learning agent that is a pure blank slate without any intrinsic social biases, and whose lifetime of experiences can be tightly controlled. This is possible because deep reinforcement-learning agents learn to convert raw sensory input (i.e. pixels) to reward-driven action, a unique feature among cognitive models. We find that blank slate agents do develop group biases based on arbitrary group differences (i.e. color). We show that the bias develops as a result of familiarity of experience and depends on the visual patterns becoming associated with reward through interaction. The bias artificial agents display is not a static reflection of the bias in their stream of experiences. In this minimal environment, the bias can be overcome given enough positive experiences, although unlearning the bias takes longer than acquiring it. Further, we show how this style of tabula rasa group behavior model can be used to test fine-grained predictions of psychological theories.",

These congestion games, a well-studied class of potential games, are characterized by individual agents having negligible effects on system performance, strongly aligned incentives, and well-understood advantageous properties of Nash equilibria. Despite the presence of static Nash equilibria, we demonstrate that MARL dynamics with heterogeneous learning rates can deviate from these equilibria, exhibiting instability and even chaotic behavior and resulting in increased social costs. Remarkably, even within these chaotic regimes, we show that the time-averaged macroscopic behavior converges to exact Nash equilibria, thus linking the microscopic dynamic complexity with traditional equilibrium concepts. By employing dynamical systems techniques, we analyze the interaction between individual-level adaptation and population-level outcomes, paving the way for studying heterogeneous learning dynamics in discrete time across more complex game scenarios.",

The most prominent theories of reciprocity, such as tit-for-tat or win-stay-lose-shift, are inflexible automata that lack a theory of mind—the human ability to infer the hidden mental states in others’ minds. Here, we develop a model of reciprocity with a theory of mind, the Bayesian Reciprocator. When making decisions, this model does not simply seek to maximize its own payoff. Instead, it also values the payoffs of others—but only to the extent it believes that those others are also cooperating in the same way. To compute its beliefs about others, the Bayesian Reciprocator uses a probabilistic and generative approach to infer the latent preferences, beliefs, and strategies of others through interaction and observation. We evaluate the Bayesian Reciprocator using a generator over games where every interaction is unique, as well as in classic environments such as the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. The Bayesian Reciprocator enables the emergence of both direct-reciprocity when games are repeated and indirect-reciprocity when interactions are one-shot but observable to others. In an evolutionary competition, the Bayesian Reciprocator outcompetes existing automata strategies and sustains cooperation across a larger range of environments and noise settings than prior approaches. This work quantifies the advantage of a theory of mind for cooperation in an evolutionary game theoretic framework and suggests avenues for building artificially intelligent agents with more human-like learning mechanisms that can cooperate across many environments.",

In this study, drawing inspiration from synchrotrons that resonate to accelerate ions along a closed path, we introduce a synchrowave: a waveguide designed to generate and sustain traveling water waves within an annular channel. In analogy to unavoidable energy losses in conventional particle accelerators due to electromagnetic radiation and inelastic collisions, the system displays undesired water-wave dampening, which we address through the synchronized action of underwater wavemakers. Our analogies extend the resonance mechanisms of synchrotrons to generate and sustain gravity waves in closed waveguides efficiently.

Besides quantifying the performance of wave generation, our findings offer a framework for both industrial and computational applications, opening up unexplored possibilities in hydraulics, coastal science, and engineering.

          "abstract": "Biological microswimmers exhibit intricate taxis behaviors in response to environmental stimuli and swim in complex trajectories to navigate their environment. How microswimmers respond to stimulus instantaneously, and how adaptation to stimulus influences their long-term behavioral changes, remains largely unclear. Here, we report an oscillatory phototaxis observed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at intermediate light intensities, where cells swim back-and-forth under a constant, unidirectional light stimulus due to alternation between positive and negative phototaxis. The phototaxis switching can be captured by the change in phase relationship between eyespot and helical swimming. Oscillatory phototaxis of individual cells leads to a global pattern of millimeter-scale propagating density bands that persists for ∼ 30 min. High-speed imaging and long-time tracking experiments at single-cell level verify a unified phototaxis mechanism that couples light detection, light adaptation, flagella responses, and behavioral switching. By experimentally tracking steady swimming and transient turning states, we verify that phototaxis transition is achieved via the modulation of flagella waveforms and flagella phase difference, which can be captured by a hydrodynamic model accounting for photoresponses. Adaptation acts effectively as an oscillator damper to mediate multipurpose tasking across multiple system levels (subcellular flagella beats, oscillatory phototaxis, colonial pattern formation) and timescales (from milliseconds to over 30 min). This adaptive phototaxis mechanism provides a comprehensive understanding of how microswimmers achieve complex behavioral changes across multiple temporal scales with a single sensor–actuator circuit featuring relatively simple adaptive feedback responses.",

Live animal incubations with 13 C-labeled methane and methanol, followed by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, confirmed that carbon derived from both compounds was actively incorporated into the tissues within five days. Methano- and methylotrophs of the bacterial families Methylomonadaceae, Methylophagaceae and Methylophilaceae were abundant, based on environmental metagenomics and 16S rRNA sequencing, and fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed dense epibiont aggregations on the sea spider exoskeleton. Egg sacs carried by the males hosted identical microbes suggesting vertical transmission. We propose that these sea spiders farm and feed on methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria, expanding the realm of animals known to harness C1 compounds as a carbon source.

          "abstract": "Adaptation to novel environments requires genetic variation, but whether adaptation typically acts upon preexisting genetic variation or must wait for new mutations remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. For each of the causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1 ( teosinte glume architecture1 ), which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1 . We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 42,000 to 49,000 y ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating that the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.",

Although ADPKD is a common monogenetic disorder, there is no drug cure or available therapeutics which address the underlying channel dysregulation. Furthermore, the structural and mechanistic impacts of most disease-causing variants are uncharacterized. Using direct cilia electrophysiology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and superresolution imaging, we have found mechanistic differences in channel dysregulation caused by three germline missense variants located in PKD2’s pore helix 1. Variant C632R reduces protein thermal stability, resulting in impaired channel assembly and abolishes primary cilia trafficking. In contrast, variants F629S and R638C retain native cilia trafficking but exhibit gating defects. Cryo-EM structures (2.7 to 2.8 Å resolution) indicate loss of critical pore helix interactions which precipitate allosteric collapse of the channels inner gate. Results demonstrate how ADPKD-causing mutations cause mechanistically divergent and ranging impacts on PKD2 function, despite their shared structural proximity. These unexpected findings highlight the need for structural and biophysical characterization of polycystin variants, which will guide rational drug development of ADPKD therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary adaptation to new environments likely results from a combination of selective sweeps and polygenic shifts, depending on the genetic architecture of traits under selection. While selective sweeps have been widely studied, polygenic responses are thought to be more prevalent but remain challenging to quantify. The infinitesimal model makes explicit the hypothesis about the dynamics of changes in allele frequencies under selection, where only allelic effect sizes, frequencies, linkage, and gametic disequilibrium matter. Departures from this, like long-range correlations of allele frequency changes, could be a signal of epistasis in polygenic response. We performed an Evolve &amp; Resequence experiment in Drosophila melanogaster exposing flies to a high-sugar diet for over 100 generations. We tracked allele frequency changes in &gt;3000 individually sequenced flies and population pools and searched for loci under selection by identifying sites with allele frequency trajectories that differentiated selection regimes consistently across replicates. We estimate that at least 4% of the genome was under positive selection, indicating a highly polygenic response. The response was dominated by small, consistent allele frequency changes, with few loci exhibiting large shifts. We then searched for signatures of selection on pairwise combinations of alleles in the new environment and found several strong signals of putative epistatic interactions across unlinked loci that were consistent across selected populations. Finally, we measured differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across treatments and show that DEGs are enriched for selected SNPs. Our results suggest that epistatic contributions to polygenic selective response are common and lead to detectable signatures.",

In ecology, predicting the regime of population fluctuations under unobserved levels of an environmental driver has remained an unsolved challenge with important implications for conservation and management. Here, we show that integrating time-series data and information on a putative driver into a Gaussian Process regression model for the system’s dynamics allows us to predict dynamical regimes without the need to specify the equations of motion of the system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict fixed-point, cyclic, or chaotic dynamics under unseen levels of a control parameter for a range of simulated population dynamics models. For a model with an abrupt population collapse, we show that our approach goes beyond an early warning signal by characterizing the regime that follows the tipping point. We then apply our approach to data from an experimental microbial food web and from a lake planktonic food web. We find that we can reconstruct transitions away from chaos in the microbial food web and anticipate the dynamics of the oligotrophic regime in the planktonic food web. These results lay the groundwork for making rational decisions about preventing, or preparing for, regime shifts in natural ecosystems and other dynamical systems.",

Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are biased—shortcomings that may reflect LLMs’ inherent limitations and thus may not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is therefore problematic. Here, we present a hybrid collective intelligence system that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133 text-based medical case vignettes. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties and professional experience and can be attributed to humans’ and LLMs’ complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors.

Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 y from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pregnancy and birth variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, low birth weight and prematurity, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed-effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and low birth weight and prematurity were associated with smaller global SA. Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity was associated with complex regional cortical patterns reflecting bidirectional variations in both SA and CT. Newborn birth complications showed multivariate patterns reflecting smaller occipital- and larger temporal area, bidirectional frontal area variations, and reduced CT across the cortex. Maternal substance use showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal size and prematurity to global SA and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.",

          "abstract": "Herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) – a human oncogenic virus and essential trigger of multiple sclerosis – must bypass host DNA-sensing mechanisms to establish lifelong, latent infection. Therefore, herpesviruses encode viral proteins to disrupt key host factors involved in DNA sensing and viral restriction. The first viral latency protein expressed, EBNA-LP, is essential for transformation of naïve B cells and establishment of viral gene expression, yet its role in evading host defenses remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of EBNA-LP Knockout (LPKO)-infected B cells, we reveal an antiviral response landscape implicating the “speckled proteins” as key cellular restriction factors countered by EBNA-LP. Specifically, loss of Sp100 or the primate-specific Sp140L reverses the restriction of LPKO, suppresses a subset of canonically interferon-stimulated genes, and restores transcription of essential latent viral genes and cellular proliferation. Notably, we also identify Sp140L as a restriction target of the herpesvirus saimiri ORF3 protein, implying a role for Sp140L in immunity to other diverse DNA viruses. This study reveals Sp140L as a restriction factor that we propose links sensing and transcriptional suppression of viral DNA to an Interferon-independent innate immune response, likely relevant to all nuclear DNA viruses.",

Similar pathologies have been observed in the mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This study hypothesized that inflammatory demyelination of the cerebellum alters overall mitochondrial function and is a contributor to axon degeneration and PC loss. Postmortem cerebellar tissue from MS patients, particularly those with secondary progressive MS, showed decreased mitochondrial complex IV (COXIV) activity and significant PC loss. Inflammation, PC axon demyelination, axon degeneration, and parallel fiber loss were also evident. These findings were mirrored in late-stage EAE mice, which also showed increased inflammation and demyelination, reduced PC COXIV activity, and overall PC loss. Further analysis of EAE mice revealed altered mitochondrial structure, modified mitochondrial respiration, and reduced levels of mitochondrial genes involved in energy production. These findings indicate that both human MS and mouse EAE share similar cerebellar changes linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, late-stage EAE is a valuable model for studying MS-related cerebellar pathology, and mitochondria may be a potential therapeutic target for MS treatment.",

During reflection and refraction, the directrons maintain nearly constant structure and velocity, ensuring energy conservation and information integrity. Microscopic analyses of the director field and macroscopic evaluations of effective potential are employed to elucidate the dependence of reflection and refraction probabilities on the directron’s incident angle and the orientation difference across the interface.

This malignancy usually develops resistance to conventional chemotherapy, underscoring the need for robust preclinical models to guide the development of novel therapies. Here, we introduce an HGSC mouse model generated via Ovgp1 -driven Cre recombinase effecting CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Trp53, Rb1 , and Nf1 tumor suppressors in mouse oviductal epithelium ( m-sgPRN model). Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) inactivation—frequently observed in human HGSC—is associated with poorer outcomes, DNA damage accumulation (including tandem duplications), and increased tumor immunogenicity. In our system, coablation of Cdk12 ( m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO ) recapitulated hallmark features of HGSC, while accelerating tumor progression and reducing survival. In a conventional (Cre-lox-mediated) Trp53/Nf1/Rb1 triple knockout model with concurrent Cdk12 ablation ( PRN ; Cdk12KO mice), we observed T cell–rich immune infiltrates mirroring those seen clinically. We established both models as subcutaneous or intraperitoneal syngeneic allografts of CDK12 -inactivated HGSC that exhibited sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic lethality screen in PRN;Cdk12KO -derived cell lines identified CDK13—an essential paralog of CDK12—as the most depleted candidate, confirming a previously reported synthetic lethal interaction. Pharmacologic CDK13/12 degradation (employing YJ1206) demonstrated enhanced efficacy in cell lines derived from both m-sgPRN;Cdk12KO and PRN ; Cdk12KO models. Our results define CDK12 as a key tumor suppressor in tubo-ovarian HGSC and highlight CDK13 targeting as a promising therapeutic approach in CDK12 -inactive disease. Additionally, we have established valuable in vivo resources to facilitate further investigation and drug development in this challenging malignancy.",

We use one of these models, the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model, to investigate how transient calibration impacts historical and projection simulations. Transient calibration is an emerging capability in ice flow models; it uses time series of surface observations and time-dependent physics to constrain uncertain model parameters—in this case, the basal friction coefficient in the sliding law. With more constraints than the common snapshot inversion method, transient calibration has been shown to better capture trends in ice dynamics. Here, we apply both methods to northwestern Greenland, a region undergoing rapid changes. For simulations initialized with the snapshot inversion, we find that subsequent modeled velocities are generally too slow, leading to an underestimation of the mass loss. With transient calibration, however, our simulation better matches a time series of observed velocities, bringing it within observational error for mass loss; however, the fit to observed surface elevation is slightly reduced. Together with the ISMIP results, our simulations show that reproducing the high rates of historical mass loss leads to greater projected sea-level contribution from this region over the coming century. Finally, we suggest a path forward for making transient calibration scalable to the entire Greenland Ice Sheet.",

The infant skull of the first African early hominin discovered at Taungs by Raymond Dart included a natural brain endocast. Natural endocasts as well-preserved as that of the Taungs infant are rare, but Holloway reasoned that if a way could be found to reproduce the endocranial morphology of early hominin crania then he would be able to track brain evolution within the human clade. Holloway realized that if liquid latex was introduced into the cranial cavity and left to cure, it could be extracted via the foramen magnum and then be used to make a facsimile of that individual’s brain.

          "abstract": "A brief global warming event known as the Pre-Onset Excursion (POE) occurred just before the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Mya). The deconvolution of the evolutionary consequences of these two hyperthermal events is puzzling because of their close temporal proximity and the lack of comprehensive, well-calibrated paleontological records, especially in terrestrial environments. As a consequence, the impact of the POE on mammalian evolution and its role in shaping PETM faunas remains unclear. Here, we report from France a mammalian fauna, named Albas, which is interpreted to postdate the POE and predate the PETM. The absence of artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and euprimates at Albas lends support to the controversial hypothesis that these “modern” mammal groups appeared in the European fossil record during the PETM. In contrast, Albas yielded the European first definitive Paleocene record of metatherians, paromomyid primates, “creodonts,” and rodents, challenging the assumption that these groups migrated into Europe during the PETM. Because the majority of them originated from North American pre-POE species, we tentatively suggest that these “precursor” dispersers entered Europe during the POE. Similar to the modern orders during the PETM, these “precursor” dispersers likely entered Europe through corridors in the continuous evergreen forest belt at high latitudes. Our findings highlight how a brief warming event in the Arctic during the latest Paleocene, such as the POE (which could result in a release of carbon into the atmosphere similar to cumulative ongoing anthropogenic emissions), significantly influenced the evolutionary dynamics of European mammals.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory (EGT) has been pivotal in the study of cooperation, offering formal models that account for how cooperation may arise in groups of selfish, but simple agents. This is done by inspecting the complex dynamics arising from simple interactions between a few strategies in a large population. As such, the strategies at stake are typically hand-picked by the modeler, resulting in a system with many more individuals in the population than strategies available to them. In the presence of noise and with multiple equilibria, the choice of strategies can considerably alter the emergent dynamics. As a result, model outcomes may not be robust to how the strategy set is chosen, sometimes misrepresenting the conditions required for cooperation to emerge. We propose three principles that can lead to a more systematic choice of the strategies in EGT models of cooperation. These are the inclusion of all computationally equivalent strategies; explicit microeconomic models of interactions, and a connection between stylized facts and model assumptions. Further, we argue that new methods arising in AI may offer a promising path toward richer models. These richer models can push the field of cooperation forward together with the principles described above. At the same time, AI may benefit from connecting to the more abstract models of EGT. We provide and discuss examples to substantiate these claims.",

Recent advancements in evolutionary game theory have identified a class of “zero-determinant” strategies, which confer an agent with significant unilateral control over outcomes in repeated games. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive generalization of zero-determinant strategies to stochastic games, encompassing dynamic environments. We propose an algorithm that allows an agent to discover strategies enforcing predetermined linear (or approximately linear) payoff relationships. Of particular interest is the relationship in which both payoffs are equal, which serves as a proxy for fairness in symmetric games. We demonstrate that an agent can discover strategies enforcing such relationships through experience alone, without coordinating with an opponent. In finding and using such a strategy, an agent (“enforcer”) can incentivize optimal and equitable outcomes, circumventing potential exploitation. In particular, from the opponent’s viewpoint, the enforcer transforms a mixed-motivation problem into a cooperative problem, paving the way for more collaboration and fairness in multiagent systems.",

          "abstract": "Mass-independent isotope fractionation (MIF) enables powerful geochemical tracers for various geological and planetary problems, yet the mechanisms driving MIF for tin (Sn) remain ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that distinct Sn isotope fractionation signatures were produced during photolysis of organic Sn species (i.e., methyltin) under laboratory UV irradiation and natural sunlight. UV irradiation of methyltin induced pronounced Sn-MIF in all odd Sn isotopes (Δ 115 Sn up to 21.82‰, Δ 117 Sn up to 23.16‰, Δ 119 Sn up to 24.01‰), with their ratios (Δ 117 Sn/Δ 115 Sn = 1.069; Δ 119 Sn/Δ 115 Sn = 1.099; Δ 119 Sn/Δ 117 Sn = 1.028) strongly correlating with nuclear magnetic moments. This unambiguously identifies the magnetic isotope effect (MIE) as the driving mechanism, ruling out other causes such as the nuclear volume effect (NVE). Methyl radicals (•CH 3 ) were detectable during the methyltin photolysis experiments, and the magnitude of MIF for Sn was suppressed by the presence of electron spin trapping agent (DMPO) for radicals, supporting that the pronounced Sn-MIF originated from radical-mediated singlet-triplet state transitions of Sn species. Furthermore, the magnitude of Sn-MIF depended nonmonotonically on external magnetic fields (peak suppression at 100 to 180 G), implying competition between hyperfine coupling and Zeeman interactions. Notably, Sn-MIF was absent during photolysis of methyltin by natural sunlight despite significant mass-dependent Sn isotope fractionation (e.g., &gt;3‰ in δ 122/116 Sn), attributed to atmospheric ozone shielding of short-wavelength UV (&lt;290 nm) required for radical generation. Our results register Sn-MIF as a sensitive tracer of UV-driven photochemistry in low-oxygen environments, underlining the potential of Sn isotopes in studies of early Earth’s atmosphere and planetary environments.",

          "abstract": "Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is an abnormal condition characterized by elevated cortisol levels, often resulting from genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA-C). The most common CS mutation, L205R, lies at the P + 1 loop. Understanding how this mutation alters the internal allosteric network within PKA-C and changes nucleotide and substrate cooperativity is a major goal. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and protein residue networks based on local spatial pattern (LSP) method, we compare crystal structures of wild-type PKA-C and L205R. Our findings indicate that L205R not only locally disrupts the P + 1 hydrophobic pocket, leading to the displacement of the P + 1-residue and altered substrate specificity, but also has long-range effects in the linker connecting the A helix to β strand 1. The MD simulations and LSP analyses also reveal critical changes at the phosphoryl transfer site. Some of these changes are captured in the L205R crystal structure while others are not. With this strategy, we also show how the dynamics of local and distal allosteric networks are differentially influenced by backbone and side-chain dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Choosing social partners is a potentially demanding task which involves paying attention to the right information while disregarding salient but possibly irrelevant features. The resultant trade-off between cost of evaluation and quality of decisions can lead to undesired bias. Information-processing abilities mediate this trade-off, where individuals with higher ability choose better partners leading to higher performance. By altering the salience of features, technology can modulate the effect of information-processing limits, potentially increasing or decreasing undesired biases. Here, we use game theory and multiagent reinforcement learning to investigate how undesired biases emerge, and how a technological layer (in the form of a perceptual intervention) between individuals and their environment can ameliorate such biases. Our results show that a perceptual intervention designed to increase the salience of outcome-relevant features can reduce bias in agents making partner choice decisions. Individuals learning with a perceptual intervention showed less bias due to decreased reliance on features that only spuriously correlate with behavior. Mechanistically, the perceptual intervention effectively increased the information-processing abilities of the individuals. Our results highlight the benefit of using multiagent reinforcement learning to model theoretically grounded social behaviors, particularly when real-world complexity prohibits fully analytical approaches.",

          "abstract": "The utility of a pure population of highly regenerative satellite stem cells (SSCs) is a prerequisite for successful cell-based muscle therapies. Previous works have reported several methods for the SSC isolation. However, the majority of cells isolated using previous methods are fibroblasts and other nonmyogenic cell types, necessitating further expensive and time-consuming purification steps often affecting the regenerative quality of the isolated SSCs. Here, we describe a simple, time-effective, and robust protocol for the isolation of a pure population of SSCs in a single direct step, eliminating the need for further purification steps. By separating the muscle fascicles from the adjacent connective tissues (i.e., epimysium and perimysium) and utilizing a defined dissociation medium, a cell pool enriched in SSCs was successfully obtained. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the stemness and the myogenic purity of the isolated cells (~97%). Upon myogenic induction, SSCs gave rise to multinucleated myofibers that exhibited spontaneous contraction in the culture dish for up to 21 d. Efforts to optimize the culture conditions revealed that tissue culture plates (TCPs) coated with a tissue-specific extract significantly enhanced SSCs’ attachment, growth, and differentiation compared to collagen I, Matrigel-coated TCPs, or noncoated TCPs. Further studies confirmed the robust myogenic regenerative capacity of the isolated cells, as evidenced by their ability to display key regenerative characteristics, demonstrating the mild effects of our isolation protocol on their regenerative capacity. The isolation protocol presented herein can potentially be used to obtain SSCs with high myogenic purity for skeletal muscle regenerative engineering and clinical indications.",

          "abstract": "Antarctic krill is a keystone species in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and the target of a growing fishery. Given the ecological importance of krill, concerns have been raised about potential negative impacts of fishing on the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Resource-efficient approaches to fisheries monitoring are particularly valuable in this context due to the high costs associated with data collection in Antarctica. In this study, we trained a segmentation model (U-Net) to extract dives of air-breathing krill predators from more than 30,000 h of active acoustic data collected by three krill fishing vessels over six years. We were able to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of predator-vessel co-occurrences, which aligned well with the findings from more costly tracking studies. For example, we found that encounters with whales consistently peaked in autumn around the Antarctic Peninsula, when whales are building up fat reserves for their migration to breeding grounds. We also demonstrated that protection measures, introduced to protect breeding penguins at the Antarctic Peninsula, have simply shifted penguin-vessel encounters to the South Orkney Islands, where the affected colonies are not currently monitored. Our approach, results, and application example demonstrate how acoustic data from fishing vessels can provide important information to support fisheries management. As a by-product of fishing operations, these data are cost-effective, offering unique temporal and spatial coverage and providing a useful basis for rapid, low-level assessments of the fishery’s interaction with the wider ecosystem. This is particularly important given the unpredictable dynamics of krill fishery management decision-making.",

Caffeine, a xanthine derivative, has been known for decades to increase muscle contraction and enhance activation of RyRs by increasing the sensitivity to Ca 2+ .

Most xanthine derivatives and analogs are safe and widely prescribed, with the most popular being the xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor allopurinol (~15M yearly prescriptions in USA). We propose that xanthine derivatives and analogs that enhance RyRs activity could be used for lead optimization and eventually for the treatment of the diseases that exhibit decreased muscle contraction and reduced RyRs activity, such as RyR1-related diseases, sarcopenia, and heart failure. Here, we show by cryo-EM that xanthine derivatives, analogs, and other related compounds bind to the xanthine/caffeine binding site and activate RyR1, and identify 4-oxopyrimidine as the minimal motif necessary for such interaction.",

However, the mechanism of lipoprotein retention in BrM is unknown. Given the established role of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in binding lipoproteins, our laboratory sought to determine the role of GAGs in AMD BrM. In this study, BrM GAG content in AMD pathobiology was analyzed in human postmortem tissue. Strikingly, increased levels of highly sulfated heparan sulfate were present in AMD Bruch’s membrane as compared to non-AMD samples. In addition, using scanning electron microscopy of postmortem AMD tissue, we show aggregates of lipoprotein-like particles on the retinal pigmented epithelium side of Bruch’s membrane adjacent to heparan sulfate. We also show that heparin displaces lipoproteins rich in apolipoprotein A1 from human BrM, suggesting their identity as high-density lipoproteins. Using human BrM immobilized to quartz crystal microbalance biosensor (QCM) chips, we show that heparan sulfate is required for lipoprotein binding to BrM and soluble heparan sulfate can remove lipoproteins bound to BrM. Thus, our data establish that heparan sulfate regulates lipoprotein deposition in AMD BrM. These findings provide a foundation for targeted therapies capable of either preventing lipoprotein accumulation or removing drusen in the early and intermediate stages of AMD prior to vision loss.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and the unraveling of its molecular mechanisms are currently solving previously puzzling challenges that Mendelian genetics based solely on DNA could not explain, leading to significant paradigm shifts across various fields of biology. There has been a long-standing controversy over the factors determining the caste fate of individuals in social insects. Increasing evidence supports heritable influences on division of labor. Here, we provide evidence that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance influences caste determination in a termite. We demonstrate that the age of the king influences the caste fate of offspring, with young kings’ progeny showing a higher tendency for reproductive differentiation compared to offspring from older kings (under controlled conditions). Then, we conducted a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for the Japanese subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus . Genome-wide methylome analysis of kings’ sperm reveals a drastic change in DNA methylation patterns with aging. Among 39,399,411 CpG sites, 21,611 sites showed significant age differences in methylation levels. We identified 13 genes whose methylation levels are significantly different between young and old kings and suggestively correlated with the offspring’s differentiation into the reproductive pathway. Our results suggest that sperm DNA methylation, which changes with the age of kings, is a potential transgenerational epigenetic factor involved in offspring caste differentiation in a termite. These findings may have broad applicability to caste differentiation in social insects and to phenotypic plasticity more generally.",

Previous studies mainly focus on physiochemically heterogeneous but electrically homogeneous surfaces, on which the presence of vapor pressure gradient between droplets is the predominant mechanism for interdroplet freezing bridging, propagation, and eventual frosting across the entire surface. An interesting yet unanswered question is whether electrostatic charge on surfaces affects freezing dynamics. Here, we find an interdroplet freezing relay (IFR) phenomenon on electrically heterogeneous surfaces that exhibits a three-dimensional, in-air freezing propagation pathway and an accelerated freezing rate. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that this phenomenon originates from the presence of surface charge gradient established between the frozen droplet and neighboring water droplet, which leads to a spontaneous shooting of desublimated ice needles from the frozen droplet and then triggers the freezing of neighboring water droplet in in-air manner. We further demonstrate its generality across various dielectric substrates, liquids, and droplet configurations. Our work enriches conventional perspectives on droplet freezing dynamics and emphasizes the pivotal role of electrostatics in designing passive anti-icing and antifrosting materials.",

We further show how this partitioning of the statistical moments of the resource distribution provides a unified framework for explaining coexistence in variable resource environments.

Here, we compare human behavioral annotations, functional MRI (fMRI) measurements, and deep neural network (DNN) activations to both indoor and outdoor real-world images to demonstrate that the human visual cortex represents locomotive action affordances in complex visual scenes. Hierarchical clustering of behavioral annotations of six possible locomotive actions show that humans group environments into distinct affordance clusters using at least three separate dimensions. Representational similarity analysis of multivoxel fMRI responses in the scene-selective visual cortex shows that perceived locomotive affordances are represented independently from other scene properties such as objects, surface materials, scene category, or global properties and independent of the task performed in the scanner. Visual feature activations from DNNs trained on object or scene classification as well as a range of other visual understanding tasks correlate comparatively lower with behavioral and neural representations of locomotive affordances than with object representations. Training DNNs directly on affordance labels or using affordance-centered language embeddings increases alignment with human behavior, but none of the tested models fully captures locomotive action affordance perception.

The lac insect Kerria lacca (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) is a phloem-feeding scale insect that is brightly colored due to the presence of natural polyhydroxy-anthraquinone pigments called laccaic acids. The deep red pigments possibly provide defense against pathogens and predators and are commercially important as dyes in textiles, lacquerware, and cosmetics. Laccaic acids are categorized as polyketides comprising an anthraquinone backbone decorated with tyrosine or its derivatives. However, the genetic basis of these pigments remains unknown, as insects are not known to produce aromatic polyketides or tyrosine de novo. Here, we sequence the genome of the lac insect and its two endosymbionts— Wolbachia and a hitherto unidentified, transovarially transmitted yeast-like symbiont (YLS). We found no evidence for the host or Wolbachia to be able to synthesize the pigments. The pigments and their precursors were also not detected in the host plant. Genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses combined with fluorescence microscopy identified and characterized YLS as the sole producer of the pigment’s polyketide backbone and tyrosine moiety, demonstrating an endosymbiotic origin of the lac pigments. A nonreducing polyketide synthase gene cluster encoding the laccaic acid backbone was identified. Furthermore, the YLS genome encoded essential amino acids and vitamins that are deficient in the insect’s phloem diet. Experimental fungicide-treated insects exhibited reduced concentrations of laccaic acids and tyrosine, along with decreased body size and weight, indicating a mutualistic association between the lac insect and its YLS.",

Bulk RNA-sequencing indicates a considerable loss of AM identity, impaired PPAR signaling, but a largely unchanged Pparg messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the absence of RACK1. Indeed, myeloid deletion of Rack1 halts AM differentiation in vivo and blocks the ability of PPARγ agonist to induce AM-like cells in vitro. Mechanistically, RACK1 directly binds to and stabilizes PPARγ by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, myeloid RACK1 deficiency renders mice susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous childhood cancer, characterized by the amplification of the MYCN oncogene in 40% of the high-risk cases. Our previous work demonstrated that MYCN drives metabolic reprogramming in NB, including upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Here, we identify peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) as a promising therapeutic target in NB. Pharmacological inhibition of PRDX6 reduces MYCN levels, induces apoptosis, and promotes neuronal differentiation accompanied by lipid droplet accumulation, essential for the phenotypic reprogramming. Moreover, combined inhibition of PRDX6 and glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1), a key antioxidant enzyme needed for PRDX6 activation, demonstrated synergistic effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy results in neuronal maturation as well as activity and initiates downstream pathways distinct from the ones triggered by retinoic acid, the differentiation-inducing agent currently used in clinical practice for NB. Notably, both PRDX6 and GSTP1 are highly expressed in the developing murine adrenal gland, as well as in high-risk, MYCN -amplified NB, correlating with an undifferentiated state and poor prognosis. Together, our results provide insights into the potential of PRDX6 and GSTP1 as therapeutic targets for differentiation induction for children with NB.",

In many molecules, fluorine is incorporated to enhance the half-life and improve bioavailability. Fluorinated compounds enter the human body through food, water, and xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals, exposing gut microbes to these substances. The human gut microbiota is known for its xenobiotic biotransformation capabilities, but it was not previously known whether gut microbial enzymes could break carbon–fluorine bonds, potentially altering the toxicity of these compounds. Here, through the development of a rapid, miniaturized fluoride detection assay for whole-cell screening, we identified active gut microbial defluorinases. We biochemically characterized enzymes from diverse human gut microbial classes including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, with the capacity to hydrolyze (di)fluorinated organic acids and a fluorinated amino acid. Whole-protein alanine scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chimeric protein design enabled the identification of a disordered C-terminal protein segment involved in defluorination activity. Domain swapping exclusively of the C-terminus conferred defluorination activity to a nondefluorinating dehalogenase. To advance our understanding of the structural and sequence differences between defluorinating and nondefluorinating dehalogenases, we trained machine learning models which identified protein termini as important features. Models trained on 41-amino acid segments from protein C termini alone predicted defluorination activity with 83% accuracy (compared to 95% accuracy based on full-length protein features). This work is relevant for therapeutic interventions and environmental and human health by uncovering specificity-determining signatures of fluorine biochemistry from the gut microbiome.",

Through the cascading effects of their ecological role, scavengers can also alleviate the burden of zoonotic diseases on people. This importance to human health fuels a growing need to understand how vertebrate scavengers and their ecosystem services are faring globally in the Anthropocene. We reviewed the conservation status of 1,376 vertebrate scavenging species and examined the implications for human health. We uncovered that 36% of these species are threatened or decreasing in population abundance and that apex (large-bodied or obligate) scavengers are disproportionately imperiled. In contrast, mesoscavengers (small-bodied or facultative) are thriving from anthropogenic food subsidies and ecological release. We posit that this global shift in scavenger community structure increases carrion persistence enabling zoonotic pathogens to propagate. Our analysis also indicates that the release of mesoscavengers is associated with reservoir host proliferation, potentially further exacerbating human disease burdens. Urgently tackling the key threats to scavengers—intensive livestock production, land use change, wildlife trade, and the interactions among them—is critical to securing the long-term public health benefits of the world’s diverse scavenger communities.",

Comparatively less is known about pathogen interactions within the tick. Here, we report that Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with either Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causative agent of anaplasmosis) or Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) show activation of the ATF6 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Disabling ATF6 functionally restricts pathogen survival in ticks. When stimulated, ATF6 functions as a transcription factor, but is the least understood out of the three UPR pathways. To interrogate the Ixodes ATF6 transcriptional network, we developed a custom R script to query tick promoter sequences. This revealed stomatin as a potential gene target, which has roles in lipid homeostasis and vesical transport. Ixodes stomatin was experimentally validated as a bona fide ATF6-regulated gene through luciferase reporter assays, pharmacological activators, RNA interference transcriptional repression, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencing stomatin decreased A. phagocytophilum colonization in Ixodes and disrupted cholesterol dynamics in tick cells. Furthermore, blocking stomatin restricted cholesterol availability to the bacterium, thereby inhibiting growth and survival. Taken together, we have identified the Ixodes ATF6 pathway as a contributor to vector competence through Stomatin-regulated cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, our custom, web-based transcription factor binding site search tool “ArthroQuest” revealed that the ATF6-regulated nature of stomatin is unique to blood-feeding arthropods.

However, investigating PPIs involving membrane proteins is challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of glycosylation. To tackle this challenge, we developed an approach termed glycan-dependent affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (GAP–MS), specifically designed to characterize changes in glycoprotein PPIs under varying glycosylation conditions. GAP–MS integrates metabolic control of glycan profiles in cultured cells using small molecules referred to as glycan modifiers with affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis (AP–MS). Here, GAP–MS was applied to characterize and compare the interaction networks under five different glycosylation states for four bait glycoproteins: BSG, CD44, EGFR, and SLC3A2. This analysis identified a network comprising 156 interactions, of which 131 were determined to be glycan dependent. Notably, the GAP–MS analysis of BSG provided distinct information regarding glycosylation-influenced interactions compared to the commonly used glycosylation site mutagenesis approach combined with AP–MS, emphasizing the unique advantages of GAP–MS. Collectively, GAP–MS presents distinct insights over existing methods in elucidating how specific glycosylation forms impact glycoprotein interactions. Additionally, the glycan-dependent interaction networks generated for these four glycoproteins serve as a valuable resource for guiding future functional investigations and therapeutic developments targeting the glycoproteins discussed in this study.",

          "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are essential tools for estimating individual susceptibility to complex diseases by aggregating the effects of many genetic variants. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), rare and de novo variants can now be detected at scale, presenting new opportunities to enhance PRS performance. Additionally, regulatory mechanisms that govern gene expression play a critical role in disease manifestation, suggesting further potential for improvement. However, most existing PRS methods are not well-equipped to incorporate nonlinear variant effects, rare variant contributions, or regulatory context. To address these limitations, we developed Epi-PRS, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to impute cell-type-specific epigenomic signals from personal diploid genotypes. These imputed signals act as informative intermediates between genotype and phenotype, allowing for more accurate modeling of variant impact. Our simulation studies demonstrate that Epi-PRS improves predictive accuracy by incorporating nonlinear relationships, rare variant effects, and regulatory information across large genomic regions. When applied to real data from the UK Biobank, Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS approaches in predicting risk for both breast cancer and type 2 diabetes. These results underscore the advantages of integrating WGS data, epigenomic context, and advanced LLMs framework to enhance both the predictive power and interpretability of PRS. Overall, Epi-PRS represents a promising step toward more precise and biologically informed disease risk prediction, with broad implications for advancing personalized medicine and understanding complex genetic architectures.",

Following cellular uptake, Q is incorporated at the wobble base (position 34) of tRNAs that decode histidine, tyrosine, aspartate, and asparagine codons, which is important for efficient translation. Early studies suggested that cytosolic uptake of queuine is mediated by a selective transporter that is regulated by mitogenic signals, but the identity of this transporter has remained elusive. Here, through a cross-species bioinformatic search and genetic validation, we have identified the solute carrier family member SLC35F2 as a unique transporter for both queuine and queuosine in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Trypanosoma brucei . Furthermore, gene disruption in human HeLa cells revealed that SLC35F2 is the sole transporter for queuosine (K m 174 nM) and a high-affinity transporter for the queuine nucleobase (K m 67 nM), with the additional presence of second low-affinity queuine transporter (K m 259 nM). Ectopic expression of labeled SLC35F2 reveals localization to the cell membrane and Golgi apparatus via immunofluorescence. Competition uptake studies show that SLC35F2 is not a general transporter for other canonical ribonucleobases or ribonucleosides but selectively imports q and Q. The identification of SLC35F2, an oncogene, as the transporter of both q and Q advances our understanding of how intracellular levels of queuine and queuosine are regulated and how their deficiency contributes to a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between genotype and phenotype remains an outstanding question for organism-level traits because these traits are generally complex . The challenge arises from complex traits being determined by a combination of multiple genes (or loci), which leads to an explosion of possible genotype–phenotype mappings. The primary techniques to resolve these mappings are genome/transcriptome-wide association studies, which are limited by their lack of causal inference and statistical power. Here, we develop an approach that combines transcriptional data endowed with causal information and a generative machine learning model designed to strengthen statistical power. Our implementation of the approach—dubbed transcriptome-wide conditional variational autoencoder (TWAVE)—includes a variational autoencoder trained on human transcriptional data, which is incorporated into an optimization framework. Given a trait phenotype, TWAVE generates expression profiles, which we dimensionally reduce by identifying independently varying generalized pathways (eigengenes). We then conduct constrained optimization to find causal gene sets that are the gene perturbations whose measured transcriptomic responses best explain trait phenotype differences. By considering several complex traits, we show that the approach identifies causal genes that cannot be detected by the primary existing techniques. Moreover, the approach identifies complex diseases caused by distinct sets of genes, meaning that the disease is polygenic and exhibits distinct subtypes driven by different genotype–phenotype mappings. We suggest that the approach will enable the design of tailored experiments to identify multigenic targets to address complex diseases.",

Existing behavioral epidemic models often lack real-world data calibration and cross-model performance evaluation in both retrospective analysis and forecasting. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of three mechanistic behavioral epidemic models across nine geographies and two modeling tasks during the first wave of COVID-19, using various metrics. The first model, a Data-Driven Behavioral Feedback Model, incorporates behavioral changes by leveraging mobility data to capture variations in contact patterns. The second and third models are Analytical Behavioral Feedback Models, which simulate the feedback loop either through the explicit representation of different behavioral compartments within the population or by utilizing an effective nonlinear force of infection. Our results do not identify a single best model overall, as performance varies based on factors such as data availability, data quality, and the choice of performance metrics. While the Data-Driven Behavioral Feedback Model incorporates substantial real-time behavioral information, the Analytical Compartmental Behavioral Feedback Model often demonstrates superior or equivalent performance in both retrospective fitting and out-of-sample forecasts.

Synthesis of the FeMoco model cluster ([MoFe 7 S 9 C]) is essential to understanding its function in dinitrogen binding, activation, and conversion. However, the complex framework of the FeMoco cluster, which features a unique trigonal prismatic [Fe 6 C] moiety comprising a µ 6 -bridging carbide, has made the synthesis of the cluster a persistent challenge. In this work, two analogous mimics of FeMoco have been synthesized, using a cluster-coupling synthetic strategy facilitated by the fabrication of unsaturated ligand/metal coordination. The incorporation of a µ 6 -X (X = C 4− or N 3− ) to construct the characteristic triangular prismatic [Fe 6 ( µ 6 -X)] moiety, replicating that in FeMoco, has been achieved synthetically. The two mimics have similar key structural parameters to FeMoco in natural nitrogenase, but differ from the FeMoco structure in two major aspects: the µ 2 -bridging ligands and the metal atoms capping the [Fe 6 S 9 C] cores (Mo/Fe in FeMoco vs. Mo/Mo or W/W in the synthetic models). Quantum chemical studies indicate that the electronic ground states of these clusters resemble those observed for FeMoco, with maximized antiferromagnetic coupling among the iron centers. A future systematic study on the physical and chemical properties of a family of mimics with programmed variations of key structural elements can provide a valuable comparison and facilitate a better understanding of the structure and function of FeMoco.",

Here, we show that internal nutrient storage connects past thermal experience to current growth in phytoplankton. We develop a mechanistic model showing that delays in the response of nutrient stores to changing temperatures produces phenotypic memory. By testing this model against experimental data of phytoplankton growth rates following temperature perturbations, we find general patterns in the population consequences of phenotypic memory: Prior exposure to warm temperatures depletes nutrient stores, and, in doing so, slows growth during subsequent temperature exposure and restricts the breadth of the thermal niche (i.e., the range of acute temperature exposures yielding a positive growth rate). Our model reveals how phenotypic memory produces temporal variation in critical thermal minima and maxima and predicts that the thermal niche is constricted by long-term exposure to warm temperatures (e.g., during summer months), but that high frequency temperature fluctuations can expand a population’s thermal niche. This work provides a mechanistic framework for considering the ecological implications of phenotypic memory.",

          "abstract": "Many eukaryotic species undergo programmed elimination of specific chromosomes during embryogenesis, typically retaining these chromosomes only in their germ cells. In some species, programmatic elimination of GRCs, or sex chromosomes, also occurs in a sex-specific manner, with specific chromosomes being transmitted or eliminated by only one sex. As such, these chromosomes provide a unique perspective on the evolution of gene functions that are advantageous to the germline and genetic tradeoffs between somatic vs germline or oocyte vs sperm biology. While GRCs have been extensively characterized in male sea lampreys ( Petromyzon marinus ), the status of GRCs in females has not yet been resolved, though it has been hypothesized that male-specific expression/transmission of these chromosomes might provide a solution to resolving the long-standing mystery of lamprey sex determining mechanisms. To gain insight into the roles of GRCs in female lampreys, we performed several karyological, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses, which demonstrate that GRCs are present in the female lamprey germline, transmitted by oocytes and somatically eliminated in both sexes. These analyses also show that GRCs play important roles in the maintenance and development of female germline but provide no evidence for sex-specific variation in the elimination and transmission of lamprey GRCs. These findings underscore the diversity of germline functions that are carried out by GRCs in both male and female lampreys and highlight the fact that sex-specific transmission/retention of GRCs likely follows no universal rules across the diverse lineages that have independently evolved to undergo developmentally programmed DNA elimination.",

Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of HBx in complex with DDB1, which is an essential complex for cccDNA transcription. In this structure, hydrophobic interactions within HBx were identified, and mutational analysis highlighted their importance in the HBV life cycle. Our biochemical analysis revealed that the HBx–DDB1 complex directly interacts simultaneously with NSE3, which is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, and Spindlin1.

          "abstract": "Removing CO 2 from the atmosphere is emerging as a viable strategy to mitigate global warming, yet the responses of the climate system to CO 2 reduction remain uncertain. One of the most uncertain aspects of El Niño behavior is the change in periodicity in response to CO 2 forcing [O. Alizadeh, Earth-Sci. Rev. 235 , 104246 (2022)]. In this study, we show that climate models consistently project an abrupt shortening of El Niño periodicity once CO 2 reductions commence in ramp-up and ramp-down CO 2 experiments. Besides the contribution of slow mean state changes, this phenomenon is shown to be driven by a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [J.-S. Kug, et al. , Nat. Clim. Chang. 12 , 47–53 (2022)] and the consequent narrowing of El Niño’s spatial pattern, which enhances the effectiveness of ocean heat recharge/discharge processes, thereby shortening its periodicity. This suggests that the abrupt shift in El Niño periodicity results from a cascading reaction involving ITCZ dynamics and El Niño’s spatial configuration. These findings highlight the critical role of the global energy balance in shaping El Niño characteristics.",

In the visual system, this process is regulated by corticothalamic feedback during the experience-dependent phase of development. Yet the cortical circuits modulating this feedback remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate opposing roles for cortical somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in shaping retinogeniculate connectivity during the thalamic sensitive period (P20-30). Early in the refinement process, SST interneurons promote the strengthening and pruning of retinal inputs in the thalamus, as evidenced by disrupted synaptic refinement following their ablation. In contrast, PV interneurons, which mature later, act as a brake on this refinement, with their ablation leading to enhanced pruning of retinogeniculate connections. Notably, manipulating the relative balance between these inhibitory circuits can regulate sensory deprivation-induced retinogeniculate remodeling. Taken together, our findings show that cortical SST and PV interneuron circuits drive experience-dependent reciprocal antagonism that gates cortical feedback regulation of feedforward thalamic refinement.",

Yet, we do not know whether the consistent phenotypic changes that are associated with polyploidization translate into predictable changes in ecological preferences. Niche modeling studies in mixed-ploidy species provide an opportunity to compare recently originated polyploids with their lower-ploidy ancestors. However, the available isolated studies provide contrasting results and the diverse methodologies used limit generalization. Based on 25,857 georeferenced ploidy-verified occurrence data for 129 mixed-ploidy flowering plant species, we tested in a unified statistical framework whether WGD is associated with consistent changes in climatic niche and in past, current, and predicted future range size. We found that 74% of species exhibited significant niche shifts associated with ploidy transition. However, there was no consistent environmental parameter underlying ploidy differentiation across species, nor was there consistent support for polyploid range or niche expansion in a subset of 75 densely sampled species with sufficient data for modeling. Our results demonstrate that polyploidization is an important factor affecting niche evolution of a species, but the environmental parameters underlying the ploidy-related niche shifts vary from species to species, demonstrating limited predictability of the outcomes of WGD in ecological space.",

          "abstract": "The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO 2 were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO 2 levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. We assume that the capability to make accurate measurements of atmospheric temperature changes existed in 1860, and then apply a standard “fingerprint” method to determine the time at which a human-caused climate change signal was first detectable. Pronounced cooling of the mid- to upper stratosphere, mainly driven by anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide, would have been identifiable with high confidence by approximately 1885, before the advent of gas-powered cars. These results arise from the favorable signal-to-noise characteristics of the mid- to upper stratosphere, where the signal of human-caused cooling is large and the pattern of this cooling differs markedly from patterns of intrinsic variability. Even if our monitoring capability in 1860 had not been global, and high-quality stratospheric temperature measurements existed for Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes only, it still would have been feasible to detect human-caused stratospheric cooling by 1894, only 34 y after the assumed start of climate monitoring. Our study provides strong evidence that a discernible human influence on atmospheric temperature has likely existed for over 130 y.",

          "abstract": "The host–microbiome interface is rich in metabolite exchanges and exquisitely sensitive to diet. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is present at high concentrations at this interface and is a product of both microbial and host metabolism. The mitochondrial enzyme, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), couples H 2 S detoxification to oxidative phosphorylation; its inherited deficiency presents as Leigh disease. Since an estimated two-thirds of systemic H 2 S metabolism originates in the gut, it raises questions as to whether impaired sulfide clearance in this compartment contributes to disease and whether it can be modulated by dietary sulfur content. In this study, we report that SQOR deficiency confined to murine intestinal epithelial cells perturbs colon bioenergetics that is reversed by antibiotics, revealing a significant local contribution of microbial H 2 S to host physiology. We also find that a 2.5-fold higher methionine intake, mimicking the difference between animal and plant proteins, synergizes with intestinal SQOR deficiency to adversely impact colon architecture and alter microbiome composition. In serum, increased thiosulfate, a biomarker of H 2 S oxidation, reveals that intestinal SQOR deficiency combined with higher dietary methionine affects sulfide metabolism globally and perturbs energy metabolism as indicated by higher ketone bodies. The mice exhibit lower exploratory locomotor activity while brain MRI reveals an atypical reduction in ventricular volume, which is associated with lower aquaporin 1 that is important for cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Our study reveals the dynamic interaction between dietary sulfur intake and sulfide metabolism at the host–microbe interface, impacting gut health, and the potential for lower dietary methionine intake to modulate pathology.",

          "abstract": "The evolutionary histories of many polyploid plant species are difficult to resolve due to a complex interplay of hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, and missing diploid progenitors. In the case of octoploid strawberry with four subgenomes designated ABCD, the identities of the diploid progenitors for subgenomes C and D have been subject to much debate. By integrating new sequencing data from North American diploids with reticulate phylogeny and admixture analyses, we uncovered introgression from an extinct or unsampled species in the clade of Fragaria viridis , Fragaria nipponica , and Fragaria nilgerrensis into the donor of subgenome A of octoploid Fragaria prior to its divergence from F. vesca subsp . bracteata . We also detected an introgression event from F. iinumae into an ancestor of F. nipponica and F. nilgerrensis. Using an LTR-age-distribution-based approach, we estimate that the octoploid and its intermediate hexaploid and tetraploid ancestors emerged approximately 0.8, 2, and 3 million years ago, respectively. These results provide an explanation for previous reports of F. viridis and F. nipponica as donors of the C and D subgenomes and suggest a greater role than previously thought for homoploid hybridization in the diploid progenitors of octoploid strawberry. The integrated set of approaches used here can help advance polyploid genome analysis in other species where hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting obscure evolutionary relationships.",

We provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) enhances viral virulence by suppressing the production of viral double-stranded (dsRNA), a potent inducer of antiviral signaling. The viral variants lacking nsp15 endoribonuclease activity elicited higher innate immune responses and exhibited reduced replication in human stem cell–derived lung alveolar type II epithelial cells, as well as in the lungs of infected hamsters. Consistently, these variants caused significantly less weight loss and mortality compared to wild-type (WT) virus in K18-hACE2 mice. Mechanistically, the cells infected with nsp15 mutants accumulated more viral dsRNA, causing enhanced stimulation of the interferon pathway. Chemical inhibition of interferon signaling dampened immune responses to nsp15 mutants and restored their replication to levels similar to the WT virus. These findings indicate that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 contributes to viral virulence by limiting the accumulation of viral dsRNA, thereby allowing robust replication with reduced activation of the host innate immune response.",

However, achieving controllable locomotion of such robots on terrestrial surfaces remains challenging because fluctuating adhesion on nonideal surfaces disrupts the necessary asymmetry for propulsion. Here, we present a microscopic robot composed of three-dimensional nanomembranes, which navigate diverse terrestrial surfaces with omnidirectional motion. We propose a general mechanism employing nonreciprocal shape morphing to generate stable asymmetric forces on surfaces. This nonreciprocal shape morphing is realized through a laser-actuated vanadium dioxide nanomembrane, leveraging the material's inherent hysteresis properties. We demonstrate that these robots can be fabricated in various shapes, ranging from simple square structures to bioinspired \"bipedal\" helical designs, enabling them to directionally navigate challenging surfaces such as paper, leaves, sand, and vertical walls. Furthermore, their omnidirectional motion facilitates applications in microassembly and microelectronic circuit integration. Additionally, we developed an artificial intelligence control algorithm based on reinforcement learning, enabling these robots to autonomously follow complex trajectories, such as tracing the phrase \"hello world\".

Since the impact of anthropogenic warming on quasi-resonant amplification is not well captured by current-generation climate models, it is likely that models are underpredicting the potential increase, indicating even greater risk of persistent extreme summer weather events with ongoing warming.",

To reach the tumor microenvironment, monocytes must first extravasate and migrate through the type-1 collagen rich stromal matrix. The viscoelastic stromal matrix around tumors not only stiffens relative to normal stromal matrix, but often exhibits enhanced viscous characteristics, as indicated by a higher loss tangent or faster stress relaxation rate. Here, we studied how changes in matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity impact the three-dimensional (3D) migration of monocytes through stromal-like matrices. Interpenetrating networks of type-1 collagen and alginate, which enable independent tunability of stiffness and stress relaxation over physiologically relevant ranges, were used as confining matrices for 3D culture of monocytes. Increased stiffness and faster stress relaxation independently enhanced the 3D migration of monocytes. Migrating monocytes have an ellipsoidal or rounded wedge-like morphology, reminiscent of amoeboid migration, with accumulation of actin at the trailing edge. Matrix adhesions were dispensable for monocyte migration in 3D, but migration did require actin polymerization and myosin contractility. Mechanistic studies indicate that actin polymerization at the leading edge generates protrusive forces that open a path for the monocytes to migrate through in the confining viscoelastic matrices. Taken together, our findings implicate matrix stiffness and stress relaxation as key mediators of monocyte migration and reveal how monocytes use pushing forces at the leading edge mediated by actin polymerization to generate migration paths in confining viscoelastic matrices.",

Public genome databases revealed high UBR4 expression in LUAD patients, associated with a dysregulated cell cycle and impaired mitochondrial homeostasis. UBR4 knockout (ΔUBR4) in A549 lung cancer cells induced cellular senescence with defective mitochondria. Restoration of UBR4 or antioxidant treatment reversed the ΔUBR4 phenotypes caused by impaired mitophagy. Mitochondrial stress exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in ΔUBR4 cells, contributing to diverse cellular phenotypes. Additionally, ΔUBR4 cells exhibited substantially slow tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. In LUAD patients, UBR4 levels correlated with tumor stage, mitophagy markers, and poor survival. These findings suggest a tumor-promoting function of UBR4 in LUAD by regulating mitochondrial quality control. Further research into the pharmacological inhibition of UBR4 could open promising avenues for developing effective antitumor therapies targeting LUAD.",

The facultative symbiont Hamiltonella in bacteriocyte induces female-biased sex ratio of whiteflies. Here, we demonstrate that a maternal gene tudor ( tud ) and its encoded protein have lower expression levels in ovaries of Hamiltonella- cured whiteflies. Tud family proteins can interlink the various stages of biosynthesis of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), a class of small noncoding RNAs. We find that Hamiltonella affects the abundance of a piRNA through the maternal gene tud , thereby regulating the expression of the vacuolar ( H+ ) -ATPase H subunit ( VATPH ), which is the switch of activity of the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase that plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of intracellular energy and supporting mitochondrial respiration. This regulation adjusts the ATP level in ovaries of whiteflies. The ATP level shapes the F-actin pattern in ovaries and eggs of whiteflies, ultimately manipulating whitefly fertilization. Silencing tud inhibited whitefly fertilization by impairing ATP levels and F-actin patterns in ovaries and eggs.

Stem cells located in the antlerogenic periosteum (AP), a tissue overlaying the frontal crest of both male and female deer, play a crucial role in antlerogenesis. Nonetheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms as to how antlerogenesis is regulated by androgens remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that androgens regulate antler growth via macrophages. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a significant enrichment of immune-related factors in the androgen-activated antlerogenic periosteum (AAP), and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a cluster of AAP cells overexpressing macrophage chemokine CCL2. Additionally, the presence of a substantial number of monocytes/macrophages was detected in the skin overlying the AAP. Histological examination confirmed macrophage accumulation in the AAP. Removal of macrophages with clodronate effectively inhibited antler generation in male sika deer as well as in nude mice engrafted with the AP. Furthermore, testosterone up-regulated CCL2 expression in the AP cells (APCs), thus enhancing their chemotactic effect on recruitment of macrophages. Remarkably, female sika deer developed antlers following local injection of CCL2, autologous macrophages, or even immune response inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

          "abstract": "Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) remains a critical scientific challenge in building reliable infrastructure for a carbon-free hydrogen economy. Predictive models for hydrogen-induced material failure are still lacking, largely due to an incomplete understanding of hydrogen’s effects on deformation behavior, especially in multiphase alloys with complex compositions and microstructures. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic hydrogen embrittlement (SHE) phenomenon in high-strength martensitic steels, where hydrogen interacts with carbon in solution to activate hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). Microcantilever bending tests revealed greater hydrogen susceptibility with higher carbon content, evidenced by a significant reduction in work-hardening capacity, promoting slip localization and reduced ductility. First-principles calculations and theoretical modeling revealed that carbon intensifies hydrogen–dislocation interactions and amplifies hydrogen redistribution around screw dislocations, inhibiting cross-slip. This work integrates experimental and modeling approaches to elucidate the synergistic interactions between hydrogen and solute elements, providing critical insights for designing high-strength, hydrogen-tolerant structural materials.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation at scale is critical for achieving a sustainable future for humanity. However, achieving collective, cooperative behavior—in which intelligent actors in complex environments jointly improve their well-being—remains poorly understood. Complex systems science (CSS) provides a rich understanding of collective phenomena, the evolution of cooperation, and the institutions that can sustain both. Yet, much of the theory in this area fails to fully consider individual-level complexity and environmental context—largely for the sake of tractability and because it has not been clear how to do so rigorously. These elements are well captured in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), which has recently put focus on cooperative (artificial) intelligence. However, typical MARL simulations can be computationally expensive and challenging to interpret. In this perspective, we propose that bridging CSS and MARL affords new directions forward. Both fields can complement each other in their goals, methods, and scope. MARL offers CSS concrete ways to formalize cognitive processes in dynamic environments. CSS offers MARL improved qualitative insight into emergent collective phenomena. We see this approach as providing the necessary foundations for a proper science of collective, cooperative intelligence. We highlight work that is already heading in this direction and discuss concrete steps for future research.",

          "authors": "Kaushik Mitra, Lauren A. Malesky, Michael T. Thorpe, Ana Stevanovic",
          "abstract": "Pure siderite [Fe II CO 3 ] was recently discovered in abundant quantities (4.8 to 10.5 wt.%) by the Curiosity rover at Gale crater, Mars. Diagenetic alteration of siderite likely caused the carbonate-sequestered CO 2 to be released back into the atmosphere and consequently produced ferric [Fe(III)] oxyhydr(oxide) minerals. Here, using laboratory experimentation, we demonstrate that while closed system acid diagenesis—as proposed for Gale crater—is incapable of effective siderite alteration in Mars-relevant fluids, oxyhalogen compounds (chlorate and bromate) can weather siderite not only at acidic pH but also in near-neutral Mars-relevant solutions. The ferric oxyhydroxide minerals produced as a consequence are controlled by the diagenetic fluid composition. While photooxidation is possible, the mutually exclusive products of alteration—magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) during ultraviolet irradiation and ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) by oxyhalogens—demonstrate that siderite at Gale crater underwent chemical weathering by chlorate and bromate brines owing to the complete absence of magnetite in drill samples containing siderite. We propose a top–down oxyhalogen brine percolation model to explain the iron mineralogy of the sulfate-rich unit at Gale crater. We conclude that siderite alteration by acidic fluids alone cannot explain the redox disequilibrium witnessed in Gale crater sediments as promulgated before and siderite weathering by oxyhalogen brines is the most likely explanation. It is highly likely that the halogen cycle on Mars is interlinked to the iron and the carbon cycle on early and current Mars.",

          "abstract": "On shallow rocky and coral reefs, cultural and recreational values, like aesthetics, are critical aspects of Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) that support human well-being and provide billions of dollars in tourism revenue. Quantifying the aesthetic value of reef ecosystems and uncovering the conditions that enhance it could support NCP-based management. Here, we combine a global dataset of reef fish surveys, species-level aesthetic values, and causal modeling to assess the global status and drivers of reef fish assemblage aesthetic value. We find that aesthetic value is inherently linked to species richness, displaying a latitudinal gradient with peaks in the tropics, but varies strongly with the presence of exceptionally beautiful or less-beautiful species. Sea surface temperature, primary productivity, human gravity, and protection status are the strongest drivers of assemblage-level aesthetic value. Protection against human impacts consistently enhances aesthetic value by boosting taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, and this effect is greatest in species-rich, tropical ecoregions. Economic development has little influence, indicating that low-income countries are not constrained from maintaining beautiful fish assemblages. Our results therefore suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) can support multiple NCPs simultaneously, particularly in developing tropical countries. While we highlight the effectiveness of MPAs, given the low level of marine protection globally and the sensitivity of aesthetic value to environmental conditions, the beauty of the world’s reefs appears severely threatened. Aesthetic value should be immediately integrated into reef conservation and management plans.",

We give examples of scaling up from molecular- and leaf-scale data and processes, which are modified by homeostatic and buffering mechanisms at whole plant and ecosystem scales.

A Ts-S-Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur.

Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes.

It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response to Plasmodium spp. infection. We found that asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibited P. falciparum proliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole.

          "abstract": "The nature and spectrum of elementary excitations are defining features of a many-body system. Here, we use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the anti-ferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.",

          "abstract": "Retrons are antiphage defense systems that produce multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) and hold promises for genome engineering. However, the mechanisms of defense remain unclear. The Retron-Septu system uniquely integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase (RT), msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA-binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This “arrest-and-release” mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies.",

We found viral peptides originating from detected noncanonical ORFs presented on class-I human leukocyte antigen in infected cells and hundreds of upstream ORFs that likely modulate translation initiation of viral proteins. The discovery of viral ORFs across a wide range of viral families—including highly pathogenic viruses—expands the repertoire of vaccine targets and reveals potential cis-regulatory sequences.",

This Earth energy imbalance has strengthened over the period 2001 to 2023 with satellite data. Here, we show that low climate sensitivity models fail to reproduce the trend in Earth energy imbalance, particularly in the individual longwave and shortwave contributions to the imbalance trend. The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin. The negative longwave contribution to Earth energy imbalance is driven by surface temperature increases and is therefore most pronounced in high climate sensitivity models, whereas the shortwave contribution is generally positive and amplified by greater surface warming.",

A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li 2 Co 3 (SeO 3 ) 4 , which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids.",

          "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent DNA structures that regulate transcription but also threaten genome stability. How G4 dynamics are controlled remains poorly understood. Here, we report that RNA transcripts govern G4 landscapes through coordinated G-loop assembly and disassembly. G-loop assembly involves activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, followed by homology-directed invasion of RNA opposite the G4 strand mediated by BRCA2 and RAD51. Disassembly of the G-loop resolves the G4 structure through DHX36-FANCJ–mediated G4 unwinding, which triggers nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal by DNA synthesis. Inhibition of G-loop disassembly causes global G4 and R-loop accumulation, leading to transcriptome dysregulation, replication stress, and genome instability. These findings establish an intricate G-loop assembly-disassembly mechanism that controls G4 landscapes and is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival.",

          "abstract": "Continued greenhouse gas emissions will accelerate global warming and intensity of heat waves, which already harm crop productivity. From the stability of key enzymes to canopy processes, photosynthesis is affected by temperature. All crops suffer declines in photosynthetic rate when temperatures cross critical thresholds, with irreversible losses typically occurring above 40° to 45°C. Protective measures within plants can be induced by growth at elevated temperatures but not from the sudden temperature elevation of heat waves. Strategies to improve the heat resilience of photosynthesis include modifying surface energy balance, optimizing canopy architecture, improving enzymatic heat tolerance, and (re)engineering key metabolic pathways for greater efficiency or to remove bottlenecks. This Review summarizes present knowledge on the major mechanisms that underlie high-temperature inhibition of photosynthesis and explores opportunities for breeding and biotechnological interventions to overcome them.",

Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we found that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions developed from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multisite sequencing in human patients confirmed the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions. Our work identifies a transition in basal cell clonal dynamics, and an associated shift in basal cell fate, as drivers of field cancerization in the lung.",

          "abstract": "Competition among news sources over public opinion can incentivize them to resort to misinformation. Sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement but ultimately damages the credibility of the source, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind news sources sharing misinformation, we model the competition between sources as a zero-sum sequential game, where news sources decide whether to share factual information or misinformation. Each source influences individuals based on their credibility, the veracity of the article, and the individual’s characteristics. We analyze this game through the concept of quantal response equilibrium, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making. The analysis shows that the resulting equilibria reproduce the credibility-opinion distribution of real-world news sources, with hyperpartisan sources spreading the majority of misinformation. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to mitigate the spread of misinformation and promote a more factual information landscape.",

Each of these scenarios has different implications for polar ice sheet behavior in a warming world. Here, we present a suite of 230 Th ages for fossil corals in the Seychelles within a detailed sedimentary and stratigraphic context to evaluate the evolution of sea level during this past warm period. The rise to peak sea level at ~122 to 123 ka was punctuated by two abrupt stratigraphic discontinuities, defining three distinct generations of reef growth. We attribute the evidence of episodic reef growth and ephemeral sea-level fall to the competing influence of Northern Hemisphere ice melt and Antarctic ice regrowth. Asynchronous ice sheet contributions would mask the full extent of retreat for individual ice sheets during the LIG and imply greater temperature sensitivity of ice sheets than previously inferred.",

In the ear, the receptor potential of presynaptic inner hair cells (IHCs) covers the entire intensity range, while postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) tile the range with their firing rate codes. IHCs vary the voltage dependence of Ca 2+ channel activation among their active zones (AZs), potentially diversifying SGN firing. Here, we tested this hypothesis in mice modeling the human Ca V 1.3 A749G mutation that causes low-voltage Ca 2+ channel activation. We demonstrate activation of Ca 2+ influx and glutamate release of IHC AZs at lower voltages, increased spontaneous firing in SGNs, and lower sound threshold of Ca V 1.3 A749G/A749G mice. Loss of synaptic ribbons in IHCs at ambient sound levels of mouse husbandry indicates that low-voltage Ca 2+ channel activation poses a risk for noise-induced synaptic damage. We propose that the heterogeneous voltage dependence of Ca V 1.3 activation among presynaptic IHC AZs contributes to the diversity of firing among the postsynaptic SGNs.",

This evolution was attributed to cuticle thickening in resistant female mites. Cuticle protein CPR25 was identified as a critical gene mediating cuticle thickening. CPR25 regulated its own overexpression by producing a circular RNA, named circCPR25 , which acted as a decoy to selectively sequester and bind to the miR-34~317 cluster.

The study reveals that the autophagy-regulating gene PLAC8 (placenta-specific 8) is significantly involved in Cd-induced prostate carcinogenesis, and NF-κB acts as the upstream transcriptional activator of PLAC8, which then selectively up-regulates BCL-xL, providing a survival advantage to Cd-transformed cells. NF-κB activation stabilizes PLAC8 in the cytosol, disrupting autophagy by allowing PLAC8 to colocalize with LC3B instead of LAMP1. Silencing NF-κB down-regulates PLAC8 and its survival function while inhibiting NF-κB or PLAC8, which restores autophagy and decreases tumor growth in xenograft models. In addition, targeting BCL-xL confirmed this signaling pathway. The findings suggest that sustained NF-κB activation regulates PLAC8 and highlights the NF-κB–PLAC8–BCL-xL axis as a potential target for early detection and therapies in metal-induced prostate cancer.",

By comprehensively designing the chemical and sequence structures of blocks, coordinating weak/strong hydrogen bonds, and achieving rational microphase separation and crystallization, an elastomer was obtained with an exceptional true tensile strength of 1.42 gigapascal, a high fracture energy of 384.7 ± 18.9 kJ/m 2 , and a skin-like nonlinear mechanoresponse. The coordination of crystallization and physical cross-linking also guaranteed excellent body-temperature shape memory properties, which are applicable in 4D printing.

Combined with atomic column displacement measurements, the spatial distribution of polarization bound charges and screening charges across the domain walls can be disentangled.

Controlling for surface and volume, we identified 80 unique variants influencing the shapes of one or several structures, with the highest yield (37 variants) for brain stem. The previously known influence of several of these loci on basic morphology, such as volume, is thus shown to also influence complex shape. Known associations of observed loci with blood pressure, neurodegeneration, alcohol consumption, and mental disorders hint at preclinical stages of these conditions potentially mediating the genetic effect on brain morphology.

Spatially dispersed delocalized singlet excitons (DSEs) in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) provide an alternative channel to promote charge generation without interfacial CT state. Here, we manipulate intermolecular interactions, carrier dynamics, and photovoltaic properties through selective asymmetric fluorination. Two asymmetric molecules, Z12 and Z13, were synthesized by substituting the terminal group with different fluorine atoms compared with the symmetrical molecule, Z11. Z12 showed enhanced molecular interactions, promoting to more compact and ordered stacking, which in turn promotes the DSE formation, benefiting the synergistic enhancement of V OC and J SC . The D18:Z12-based device achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.5%, notably outperforming the other two devices. Our study indicates that controlling the molecular configuration by selective fluorination to enhance the DSE formation in NFAs is an effective strategy to achieve efficient OSCs.",

Our approach uses an enantioselective crystallization of racemic catalysts on a FM surface, using a small-scale crystallization vial connected to a bulk racemic solution. Racemic catalysts controllably crystallize into their respective enantiopure forms and are directly used in asymmetric reactions.

An optimized chemical synthesis enabled preparation of diverse IAPP glycoforms with complex glycan structures, allowing systematic evaluation of their effects on aggregation, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Sialylated glycans at Thr 30 completely inhibited IAPP aggregation, eliminated cytotoxicity toward pancreatic β cells, and enhanced solubility by up to 280-fold. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations revealed that glycosylation impedes adoption of a four-stranded β-sheet conformation in IAPP dimers. These findings advance the understanding of the role of natural glycosylation in aggregation and highlight its potential as an evolutionarily inspired strategy to enhance the therapeutic utility of IAPP.",

However, a key limitation for terahertz-scale integrated VPC-based devices has been the absence of arbitrary bend interconnects, as traditional VPC-designs restricted to principal lattice axes (i.e., only 0°, 60°, or 120°) due to crystalline symmetry. Here, we present an on-chip, all-silicon implementation of deformed VPCs that enable robust transmission along arbitrary shapes and bends. Although the lattice is amorphous and lacks long-range periodicity, the topological protection is sustained by short-range order. Furthermore, we show an amorphous lattice functioning as a frequency-dependent router, splitting input signals into two perpendicular output ports. We also demonstrate on-chip terahertz communication, achieving data rates of up to 72 Gbps.

The residues Cys 26 , Asn 38 , and Cys 39 were critical for ATP binding with CfEC92, and mutations at these sites impaired the ability to suppress host immunity. CfEC92 interacted with MdNDPK2, a negative immune regulator in apple. The CfEC92-ATP complex altered the conformation of MdNDPK2, enhancing its affinity for ATP, and further increasing its autophosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated MdNDPK2 phosphorylated MdMPK3 to suppress host immunity. Homology and functional tests showed that the Cx 11 NC motif was highly conserved among Colletotrichum species, suggesting that CNC effectors represent a class of broad-spectrum virulence factors. Our findings revealed a mechanism by which Colletotrichum effectors cooperate with helper ATP to promote target protein phosphorylation and suppress host immunity.",

Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu 2 Ir 2 O 7 and spin ice Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 . Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a sixfold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice’s field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal’s topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a twofold anisotropic response indicative of the emergence of a symmetry-broken many-body state.

Our approach is evaluated using both a rigorously controlled dataset and a realistic high-throughput dataset comprising extensive reaction screenings across diverse catalysts sets and experimental conditions. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance by leveraging information from as few as 20 positive data points in the controlled dataset, supported by a negative dataset at least 40 times larger.

These kinases interact with clathrin light chain 2 (CLC2), facilitating its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in response to Zeocin and ABA treatment.

However, the conformational cycle and inhibitor mechanism of ABCB transporters remain elusive. We reconstituted ABCB19 into lipid nanodiscs, where activity was drastically higher than in detergents, and determined its cryo–electron microscopy structures in substrate-free, substrate-bound, vanadate-trapped, and inhibitor-bound states. Inward-facing ABCB19 moved inward upon substrate binding and fully closed with vanadate trapping, unexpectedly temperature dependent. Two inhibitor molecules locked ABCB19 in the inward-facing conformation. Mutagenesis identified key residues for substrate and inhibitor binding, revealing differential contributions to transporter function and inhibition. These results deepen knowledge of plant ABCB transporters, laying a foundation for targeted manipulation to enhance plant resilience and productivity.",

Thus, characteristic emergent rules of collective migration can arise from cell-cell contacts locally tweaking architecture, orchestrating self-regulation during development, wound healing, and cancer progression. The Drosophila testis-nascent-myotube system allows dissection of contact-dependent migration in vivo at high resolution. Here, we describe a role for the axon guidance factor Plexin A in collective cell migration: maintaining cell-cell interfaces at a precise point on the mesenchymal-to-epithelial continuum. This is crucial for testis myotubes to migrate as a continuous sheet, allowing normal sculpting-morphogenesis. Cells must maintain filopodial N-cadherin–based junctions and remain ECM-tethered near cell-cell contacts to spread while collectively moving. Our data further suggest Semaphorin 1b is a Plexin A antagonist, fine-tuning activation. This reveals a contact-dependent mechanism to maintain sheet integrity during migration, driving organ morphogenesis. This is relevant for mesenchymal organ sculpting in other migratory contexts such as angiogenesis.",

Although the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate ROS production and scavenging genes have been studied, the regulation of these TFs to control ROS accumulation remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that during N nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat–mediated immunity, Alfin-like 7 (AL7) is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 7 (UBR7). UBR7 interacts with AL7 and acts as a molecular brake to mediate the ubiquitination of AL7 at lysine-20, leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation. UBR7 functions upstream of AL7 to reduce AL7-induced ROS accumulation during N -mediated defense. The phosphorylation of AL7 at serine-174 enhances its interaction with UBR7, thereby increasing AL7 ubiquitination and reducing AL7 stability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which ROS accumulation is regulated through the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of a TF during the immune response. This ensures precise switching of ROS signaling to prevent excessive defense responses.",

Here, we address these challenges using an orthogonal two-color (OTC) scheme, which combines different photon energies and polarizations of the laser fields to produce characteristic photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) that vary with the laser phase. By analyzing the phase-dependent PADs, the partial waves, including their individual amplitudes and phases, involved in the nondissociative and dissociative single ionization of H 2 are unambiguously resolved. In addition, the interaction phases accumulated during the absorption of multiple photons of different polarizations are revealed.

We identify spermidine as a key polyamine for Babesia duncani and Plasmodium falciparum for intraerythrocytic development. We demonstrate that spermidine is indispensable for regulating protein translation through hypusination of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A, and its depletion leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species. Disruption of spermidine biosynthesis or its conversion from spermine results in parasite death. We also show that B. duncani and other Babesia species use an ancestral spermidine synthase–like enzyme, highlighting a distinct evolutionary adaptation from P. falciparum .

However, Nematostella Chordin might be a local inhibitor of BMP rather than a shuttle. To choose between these options, we tested whether extracellular mobility of Chordin, a hallmark of shuttling but dispensable for local inhibition, is required for patterning in Nematostella . By generating localized Chordin sources in the Chordin morphant background, we showed that mobile Chordin is necessary and sufficient to establish a peak of BMP signaling opposite to Chordin source.

          "abstract": "Josephson junctions (JJs) are key to superconducting quantum technologies and the search for self-conjugate quasiparticles potentially useful for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In topological insulator (TI)–based JJs, measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) can reveal unconventional effects such as Majorana bound states (MBS) and nonreciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field has not been attempted. Here, we present a platform for field-dependent CPR measurements in planar JJs made of NbSe 2 and few-layer Bi 2 Se 3 . When a flux quantum Φ 0 threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip CPR structure and nonreciprocal supercurrent flow. We show that these arise from a nonuniform supercurrent distribution that also leads to a robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. Furthermore, despite numerous previous studies, we find no evidence of MBS. Our results establish magnetic field–dependent CPR as a powerful probe of TI-based superconducting devices and offer design strategies for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.",

Although current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and a large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N 2 and the ground state properties of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wave functions.

It has been hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) in contrast to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can reduce tree species diversity in local communities, which remains to be tested at the global scale. To address this gap, we analyzed global forest inventory data and revealed that the relationship between tree species richness and EcM tree proportion varied along environmental gradients. Specifically, the relationship is more negative at low latitudes and in moist conditions but is unimodal at high latitudes and in arid conditions. The negative association of EcM tree proportion on species diversity at low latitudes and in humid conditions is likely due to more negative plant-soil microbial interactions in these regions. These findings extend our knowledge on the mechanisms shaping global patterns in plant species diversity from a belowground view.",

To overcome these challenges, we use interfacial molecular forces, such as charge and hydrogen bonds, between nucleic acid variants and a positively charged synthetic microporous membrane to purify ss-mRNA, a desirable therapeutic, from an undesirable impurity, immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Membranes achieved high binding capacities (1.28 mg/m 2 ) and up to 100% ss-mRNA recovery at ~pH 9.0, with optimized surface density (4000 to 10,000 nmol/m 2 ).

Forces act on the channels by causing their curved blades to flatten and decompact, leading to an activated state, but it is unclear how this is regulated to enable the channels to adapt to different contexts. To identify potential mechanisms, we performed coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on human PIEZO1. We observed an interblade handshake interaction mediated by basic amino acid residues in two flexible helices coordinated with regulated anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The interaction determined the resting configuration of the channel, blade curvature, compactness, and ion pore structure. In experiments, disruption of the handshake by neutralization of helix amino acids or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion increased the channel’s sensitivity to membrane tension. Structural and amino acid sequence analysis for multiple PIEZOs predicted helix amino acid arrangements for varied handshaking intensity. We suggest a dynamic interaction in PIEZO channels that regulates force sensitivity.",

Here, we apply ultrafast infrared nanospectroscopic imaging to probe local electron-hole dynamics in both isolated and bundled carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition. This approach unravels heterogeneity in electron-hole pair creation and annihilation, arising from disordered stress within a tube and/or interactions with neighboring tubes.

Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FTO in ccRCC cells impaired glutamine-derived reductive carboxylation, depleted pyrimidines, and increased reactive oxygen species. This led to increased DNA damage and reduced survival, which could be rescued by pyrimidine nucleobases or the antioxidant N -acetylcysteine. Mechanistically, FTO demethylates the glutamine transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) messenger RNA to promote its expression. Restoration of SLC1A5 expression in FTO-knockdown cells rescued metabolic and survival defects. FTO inhibition reduced ccRCC tumor xenograft and PDX growth under the renal capsule.

Furthermore, PXN serves as a platform for recruiting other proteins that together control the dynamic changes needed for cell migration and survival. Here, we show that the PXN N-domain undergoes significant compaction upon FAT binding, forming a 48-kilodalton multimodal complex with four major interconverting states. Although the complex is flexible, each state has unique sets of contacts involving disordered regions that are both highly represented in ensembles and conserved.

Closed cpSRP43 is dedicated to the biogenesis of LHCPs, whereas open cpSRP43 protects multiple Chl biosynthesis enzymes from heat-induced destabilization. Rising temperature shifts cpSRP43 to the open state, enabling it to protect heat-destabilized Chl biosynthesis enzymes.

Here, we reported a straightforward strategy to achieving visible-to-infrared photoabsorption covering 630 to 2000 nanometers in inorganic perovskites by incorporating supramolecular crown ethers. Crown ethers enable supramolecular host-guest complexation and the formation of self-organizing Turing structures composed of original perovskites and supramolecular hybrid crystals. The visible-to-infrared photoabsorption is attributed to the interphase electron transitions in the Turing-structured perovskite hybrid matter system.

These microscopic processes enable the fibers to transmit high tension over a long distance. Using two types of experiments, we measure the bridging traction as a function of crack separation, σ(δ). The peak traction is σ 0  ~ 60 megapascals. The maximum separation is δ 0  ~ 6 millimeters, two to four orders of magnitude higher than that of hard tissues.

With the two features as the addressing indexes, the physical separation of subsets from a diverse pool of DNA files is achieved, thereby facilitating the selective retrieval of stored data. The interconnected nanopore arrays and uniformly distributed positive charges within the microspheres enhance DNA enrichment, achieving a storage density of up to 22.6 exabytes per gram, far exceeding that of previous random access storage methods. This work outlines a simple and scalable method for creating nonfading photonic indexes, enabling long-term random access while maintaining high storage capacity.",

          "abstract": "The origin and function of chirality in DNA, proteins, and other building blocks of life represent a central question in biology. Observations of spin polarization and magnetization associated with electron transport through chiral molecules, known collectively as the chiral induced spin selectivity effect, suggest that chirality improves electron transfer. Using reconfigurable nanoscale control over conductivity at the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface, we create chiral electron potentials that explicitly lack mirror symmetry. Quantum transport measurements on these chiral nanowires reveal enhanced electron pairing persisting to high magnetic fields (up to 18 tesla) and oscillatory transmission resonances as functions of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region. The ability to create one-dimensional electron waveguides with this specificity creates opportunities to test, via analog quantum simulation, theories about chirality and spin-polarized electron transport in one-dimensional geometries.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory T cell (T reg cell) therapy has been transformed through the use of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). We previously found that human T reg cells minimally produce IL-10 and have a limited capacity to control innate immunity compared to type 1 regulatory T cells (T r 1 cells). To create “hybrid” CAR T reg cells with T r 1 cell-like properties, we examined whether the PDCD1 locus could be exploited to endow T reg cells with CAR-regulated IL-10 expression. CRISPR-mediated PD1 deletion increased CAR T reg cell activation, and knock-in of IL10 under control of the PD1 promoter resulted in CAR-induced IL-10 secretion. IL10 knock-in improved CAR T reg cell function, as determined by increased suppression of dendritic cells and alloantigen- and islet autoantigen–specific T cells. In vivo, IL10 knock-in CAR T reg cells were stable, safe, and suppressed dendritic cells and xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. CRISPR-mediated engineering to simultaneously remove an inhibitory signal and enhance a suppressive mechanism is a previously unexplored approach to improve CAR T reg cell potency.",

Traditional methods suffer from large area requirements, high costs, and incomplete isolation. We design a water wave isolation device using periodic gear arrays (PGAs), which overcomes these drawbacks and achieves perfect water wave isolation across a wide frequency band. Water wave isolation occurs by effectively creating a negative water depth, which fills a major gap in the field of manipulating water waves using metamaterial concept. We demonstrate the water wave isolation of PGAs through analytical methods, simulations, and experiments, proving that effective negative water depth is key to achieving the isolation of water waves. The PGAs perform well across a wide frequency band, with potential applications in port and ocean wave isolation. This discovery enriches water wave manipulation techniques and advances the development of water wave metamaterials.",

          "abstract": "Bioinspired piezoelectricity is extensively explored for diverse bio-machine interface and biomedical engineering applications. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art bio-piezoelectricity mainly focuses on crystallization. Yet, crystalized structures exhibit several shortcomings, including limited biocompatibility or biodegradability along with intrinsic non-stretchability. Herein, peptides fibrillization is reported to present inherent bio-piezoelectricity. Upon forming double-network framework with silk fibroin, fibrous peptide piezogels of innate biocompatibility and biodegradability are achieved, showing a programmable piezoelectricity. In particular, the bioinspired supramolecular piezogel can linearly respond to external compression and stretching in large force regions, extensively expanding the application potential bio-piezoelectricity. Upon designing a “W”-shaped structural conformation, a peptide fibrous piezogel–based piezoelectric sensor is shown to be used for detection of limb movements and subcutaneous implantation of the bioinspired piezoelectric electronics, realizing in situ and real-time monitoring of stimuli responses. The findings suggest the promising potential of peptide fibrillization–based bio-piezoelectricity for diverse bio-machine interface and biomedical engineering applications.",

In this study, we demonstrate an effective orbital gating of prototypical alkanethiol–based molecules with deeper orbital levels in vertical large-area mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) configuration that offers enhanced electrical bias stability and gating efficiency. By using ion gel gating in Au-molecule-graphene junction, the channel conductance could be modulated notably according to a clear transition from direct tunneling to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regime. The mixed SAM molecular transistors also showed a superior gating efficiency due to the suppressed field screening effect by the net molecular dipole. This work is expected to contribute toward developing reliable three-terminal molecular device platform extended to molecules with deep orbital levels.",

          "abstract": "The cellular networks that maintain genome stability encompass numerous pathways involved in all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified the Zinc Finger CCCH-Type Containing 4 protein (ZC3H4), a suppressor of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) production, as a pivotal player in this system. Experimentally, ZC3H4 deficiency led to increased DNA damage, abnormal mitosis, and cellular senescence. Biochemical analysis and super-resolution microscopy revealed that the loss of ZC3H4 increased replication stress (RS)—a major driver of genome instability—by inducing a hypertranscription state that promoted R loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), both of which drive RS. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that ZC3H4 preferentially binds to genomic regions prone to TRCs and R loops, where it suppresses ncRNA bursts, functioning as part of the Restrictor complex. Our findings identify ZC3H4 as a crucial factor in maintaining genome integrity, strategically positioned at the critical intersection of DNA and RNA synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) is the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon, yet controls on its formation remain unresolved. Existing MAOC is thought to preclude additional C storage on minerals, but this perspective is difficult to reconcile with observations that MAOC stacks in multilayers, suggesting that existing MAOC could promote greater C retention. Here, in a manipulative experiment using 118 soils from 15 agricultural sites across the United States, we show that MAOC formation is promoted by both existing MAOC and its counterpart—MAOC saturation deficit. The positive effect of existing MAOC on the formation of new MAOC persists after accounting for soil physicochemical properties that covary with MAOC. In contrast with current theory, we found that MAOC formation was not clearly influenced by microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE). Our findings demonstrate that existing MAOC and saturation deficit, not microbial CUE, are key to determining new MAOC formation in agricultural soils.",

On a dataset of 1730 antibody-antigen complexes, AbEpiTope-1.0 outperforms AlphaFold in predicting modeled antibody-antigen interface accuracy. By creating swapped antibody-antigen complex structures for each antibody-antigen complex using incorrect antibodies, we show that predicted accuracies are sensitive to antibody input. Furthermore, a model variant optimized for antibody target prediction—differentiating true from swapped complexes—achieved an accuracy of 61.21% in correctly identifying antibody-antigen pairs. The tool evaluates hundreds of structures in minutes, providing researchers with a resource for screening antibodies targeting specific antigens.

However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of ASNS in breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) are not well understood. Our study revealed that the family with sequence similarity 50 member A (FAM50A) gene substantially modulates the brain metastatic potential of breast cancer by up-regulating ASNS and promoting asparagine biosynthesis. We demonstrated that FAM50A forms a complex with chromosome 9 open reading frame 78 (C9ORF78), specifically at the S121 residue, to enhance ASNS transcription. This interaction accelerates the rate of ASNS-mediated asparagine synthesis, which is essential in facilitating metastatic cascades to the brain. From a therapeutic perspective, both the genetic suppression of FAM50A and pharmacological inhibition of asparagine synthesis effectively counteract BCBM. Our results highlight the importance of the FAM50A-ASNS signaling pathway in BCBM therapy.",

A critical yet poorly constrained parameter is whether crustal carbon can “survive” devolatilization processes that accompany slab subduction and therefore influence deep carbon budgets. Carbonatites provide a key record to address this important topic. Here, we present high-precision potassium isotope data for a large set of carbonatite samples from both continental and oceanic settings, spanning from 2 billion years ago to the present. Modeling suggests that the heavy potassium isotopic compositions of carbonatites are inherited from their mantle sources, rather than resulting from magmatic and postmagmatic processes. Our results demonstrate a strong link between the subduction of oceanic crust and the recycling of carbonates into the mantle sources of carbonatites. These findings support the hypothesis that subduction of carbonate-bearing altered oceanic crust has been a critical mechanism for transferring carbon into the deep Earth through time.",

However, technological advancements and political mandates for decarbonization bring new opportunities to challenge this thesis. This article clarifies why the arrangements of knowledge exchange networks are relevant to understand the governance of designed markets. The arrangement of regulator’s social embeddedness matters, independently of market structure. This research leverages the comparison of three countries with markedly different models of electricity governance—Chile, China, and Mexico—to explore how governments manufacture the conditions for robust action in industrial governance. The analysis reveals three distinct forms of reconfiguration of knowledge networks, forming new expert organizations, appropriating expert organizations owned by the industry, and diversifying the nature of knowledge exchange relations.
