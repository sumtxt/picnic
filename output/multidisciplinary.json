          "abstract": "Plastic pollution of the marine realm is widespread, with most scientific attention given to macroplastics and microplastics 1,2 . By contrast, ocean nanoplastics (&lt;1 μm) remain largely unquantified, leaving gaps in our understanding of the mass budget of this plastic size class 3–5 . Here we measure nanoplastic concentrations on an ocean-basin scale along a transect crossing the North Atlantic from the subtropical gyre to the northern European shelf. We find approximately 1.5–32.0 mg m −3 of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoplastics throughout the entire water column. On average, we observe a 1.4-fold higher concentration of nanoplastics in the mixed layer when compared with intermediate water depth, with highest mixed-layer nanoplastic concentrations near the European continent. Nanoplastic concentrations at intermediate water depth are 1.8-fold higher in the subtropical gyre compared with the open North Atlantic outside the gyre. The lowest nanoplastic concentrations, with about 5.5 mg m −3 on average and predominantly composed of PET, are present in bottom waters. For the mixed layer of the temperate to subtropical North Atlantic, we estimate that the mass of nanoplastic may amount to 27 million tonnes (Mt). This is in the same range or exceeding previous budget estimates of macroplastics/microplastics for the entire Atlantic 6,7 or the global ocean 1,8 . Our findings suggest that nanoplastics comprise the dominant fraction of marine plastic pollution.",

          "abstract": "The ability of coronaviruses to recombine and cross species barriers affects human and animal health globally and is a pandemic threat 1,2 . FCoV-23 is a recently emerged, highly pathogenic recombinant coronavirus responsible for a widespread outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis. Here we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures of two FCoV-23 spike isoforms that correspond to the in-host loss of domain 0 observed in clinical samples. The loss of domain 0 markedly enhances the fusogenicity and kinetics of entry into cells and possibly enables biotype switching and lethality. We show that FCoV-23 can use several aminopeptidase N orthologues as receptors and reveal the molecular determinants of receptor species tropism, including a glycan that modulates human receptor engagement. We define antigenic relationships among alphacoronaviruses that infect humans and other mammalian species and identify a cross-reactive alphacoronavirus monoclonal antibody that inhibits FCoV-23 entry. Our results pave the way for the development of vaccines and therapeutics that target this highly pathogenic virus.",

          "abstract": "Infectious diseases have had devastating effects on human populations throughout history, but important questions about their origins and past dynamics remain 1 . To create an archaeogenetic-based spatiotemporal map of human pathogens, we screened shotgun-sequencing data from 1,313 ancient humans covering 37,000 years of Eurasian history. We demonstrate the widespread presence of ancient bacterial, viral and parasite DNA, identifying 5,486 individual hits against 492 species from 136 genera. Among those hits, 3,384 involve known human pathogens 2 , many of which had not previously been identified in ancient human remains. Grouping the ancient microbial species according to their likely reservoir and type of transmission, we find that most groups are identified throughout the entire sampling period. Zoonotic pathogens are only detected from around 6,500 years ago, peaking roughly 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the widespread domestication of livestock 3 . Our findings provide direct evidence that this lifestyle change resulted in an increased infectious disease burden. They also indicate that the spread of these pathogens increased substantially during subsequent millennia, coinciding with the pastoralist migrations from the Eurasian Steppe 4,5 .",

          "abstract": "Cryptic genetic variants exert minimal phenotypic effects alone but are hypothesized to form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity driving trait evolvability through epistatic interactions 1–3 . This classical theory has been reinvigorated by pan-genomics, which is revealing pervasive variation within gene families, cis -regulatory regions and regulatory networks 4–6 . Testing the ability of cryptic variation to fuel phenotypic diversification has been hindered by intractable genetics, limited allelic diversity and inadequate phenotypic resolution. Here, guided by natural and engineered cis -regulatory cryptic variants in a paralogous gene pair, we identified additional redundant trans regulators, establishing a regulatory network controlling tomato inflorescence architecture. By combining coding mutations with cis -regulatory alleles in populations segregating for all four network genes, we generated 216 genotypes spanning a wide spectrum of inflorescence complexity and quantified branching in over 35,000 inflorescences. Analysis of this high-resolution genotype–phenotype map using a hierarchical model of epistasis revealed a layer of dose-dependent interactions within paralogue pairs enhancing branching, culminating in strong, synergistic effects. However, we also identified a layer of antagonism between paralogue pairs, whereby accumulating mutations in one pair progressively diminished the effects of mutations in the other. Our results demonstrate how gene regulatory network architecture and complex dosage effects from paralogue diversification converge to shape phenotypic space, producing the potential for both strongly buffered phenotypes and sudden bursts of phenotypic change.",

          "abstract": "Optically active spin defects in solids 1,2 are leading candidates for quantum sensing 3,4 and quantum networking 5,6 . Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) 7–11 , a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Owing to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing 12 , including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects 7–11 remain unknown and detecting a single nuclear spin with a hBN spin defect has been elusive. Here we report the creation of single spin defects in hBN using 13 C ion implantation and the identification of three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S = 1/2 and S = 1 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a π-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.",

Fertility barriers and a lack of genomic resources have hindered the effective use of crop–wild introgressions. Decades of research into barley’s closest wild relative, Hordeum bulbosum , a grass native to the Mediterranean basin and Western Asia, have yet to manifest themselves in the release of a cultivar bearing alien genes 2 . Here we construct a pangenome of bulbous barley comprising 10 phased genome sequence assemblies amounting to 32 distinct haplotypes. Autotetraploid cytotypes, among which the donors of resistance-conferring introgressions are found, arose at least twice, and are connected among each other and to diploid forms through gene flow. The differential amplification of transposable elements after barley and H. bulbosum diverged from each other is responsible for genome size differences between them. We illustrate the translational value of our resource by mapping non-host resistance to a viral pathogen to a structurally diverse multigene cluster that has been implicated in diverse immune responses in wheat and barley.",

          "abstract": "Weight loss significantly improves metabolic and cardiovascular health in people with obesity 1–3 . The remodelling of adipose tissue (AT) is central to these varied and important clinical effects 4 . However, surprisingly little is known about the underlying mechanisms, presenting a barrier to treatment advances. Here we report a spatially resolved single-nucleus atlas (comprising 171,247 cells from 70 people) investigating the cell types, molecular events and regulatory factors that reshape human AT, and thus metabolic health, in obesity and therapeutic weight loss. We discover selective vulnerability to senescence in metabolic, precursor and vascular cells and reveal that senescence is potently reversed by weight loss. We define gene regulatory mechanisms and tissue signals that may drive a degenerative cycle of senescence, tissue injury and metabolic dysfunction. We find that weight loss reduces adipocyte hypertrophy and biomechanical constraint pathways, activating global metabolic flux and bioenergetic substrate cycles that may mediate systemic improvements in metabolic health. In the immune compartment, we demonstrate that weight loss represses obesity-induced macrophage infiltration but does not completely reverse activation, leaving these cells primed to trigger potential weight regain and worsen metabolic dysfunction. Throughout, we map cells to tissue niches to understand the collective determinants of tissue injury and recovery. Overall, our complementary single-nucleus and spatial datasets offer unprecedented insights into the basis of obese AT dysfunction and its reversal by weight loss and are a key resource for mechanistic and therapeutic exploration.",

By linking sequence divergence in structurally conserved regions to a variety of metabolic properties of the enzymes, we reveal that metabolism shapes structural evolution across multiple scales, from species-wide metabolic specialization to network organization and the molecular properties of the enzymes. Although positively selected residues are distributed across various structural elements, enzyme evolution is constrained by reaction mechanisms, interactions with metal ions and inhibitors, metabolic flux variability and biosynthetic cost. Our findings uncover hierarchical patterns of structural evolution, in which structural context dictates amino acid substitution rates, with surface residues evolving most rapidly and small-molecule-binding sites evolving under selective constraints without cost optimization. By integrating structural biology with evolutionary genomics, we establish a model in which enzyme evolution is intrinsically governed by catalytic function and shaped by metabolic niche, network architecture, cost and molecular interactions.",

          "abstract": "Over the last two decades, ocean warming and rapid loss of sea ice have dramatically changed the Pacific Arctic marine environment 1–3 . These changes are predicted to increase harmful algal bloom prevalence and toxicity, as rising temperatures and larger open water areas are more favourable for growth of some toxic algal species 4 . It is well known that algal toxins are transferred through food webs during blooms and can have negative impacts on wildlife and human health 5–7 . Yet, there are no long-term quantitative reports on algal toxin presence in Arctic food webs to evaluate increasing exposure risks. In the present study, algal toxins were quantified in bowel samples collected from 205 bowhead whales harvested for subsistence purposes over 19 years. These filter-feeding whales served as integrated food web samplers for algal toxin presence in the Beaufort Sea as it relates to changing environmental conditions over two decades. Algal toxin prevalences and concentrations were significantly correlated with ocean heat flux, open water area, wind velocity and atmospheric pressure. These results provide confirmative oceanic, atmospheric and biological evidence for increasing algal toxin concentrations in Arctic food webs due to warming ocean conditions. This approach elucidates breakthrough mechanistic connections between warming oceans and increasing algal toxin exposure risks to Arctic wildlife, which threatens food security for Native Alaskan communities that have been reliant on marine resources for subsistence for 5,000 years (ref. 8 ).",

          "abstract": "When two monolayer materials are stacked with a relative twist, an effective moiré translation symmetry emerges, leading to fundamentally different properties in the resulting heterostructure. As such, moiré materials have recently provided highly tunable platforms for exploring strongly correlated systems 1,2 . However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states near the Γ (refs. 3,4 ) or K (refs. 5–9 ) points of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Here we introduce a new class of moiré systems based on monolayers with triangular lattices but low-energy states at the M points of the BZ. These M-point moiré materials feature three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by threefold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of exfoliable 1T-SnSe 2 and 1T-ZrS 2 as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we identify twist angles that yield flat conduction bands, provide accurate continuum models, analyse their topology and charge density and explore the platform’s rich physics. Notably, the M-point moiré Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice structure. This represents, to our knowledge, the first experimentally viable realization of projective representations of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these systems act as six-flavour Hubbard simulators with Mott physics. Moreover, the presence of a momentum-space non-symmorphic in-plane mirror symmetry renders some of the M-point moiré Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger-liquid physics.",

          "abstract": "Work from home (WFH) surged worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic, then partially receded as the pandemic subsided. Using our Global Survey of Working Arrangements covering dozens of countries, we find that average WFH rates among college-educated employees stabilized after 2022. The average number of WFH days per week is steady at roughly 1 d per week globally from 2023 through early 2025. Cross-country variation persists: WFH is about twice as common in advanced English-speaking economies as in much of Asia. These results show how the pandemic-driven shift to remote work has persisted and reached a new equilibrium with implications for urban economies, workforce flexibility, and future research on labor markets.",

We examine models of this learning mechanism that emphasize teaching what to do (causally opaque procedures) and those that foreground what to aim for and why (goals and causal reasoning). Learning procedures is cheap but inflexible; learning goals is more flexible to changing circumstance, but requires expensive individual learning about how to achieve them. In an iterated learning experiment, we demonstrate that cultural learning adapts in precisely this way: Microcultures more often instruct future generations to follow procedures when the world is stable, but they tend to share information about valuable outcomes and causal relations when the world is variable.",

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more—both farther and faster—on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental trade-off: Random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the theoretical and methodological limitations of migration research in understanding gender-specific trends of migration. In particular, theory-driven methods suffer from the gender blindness of migration theories, while data-driven methods suffer from the scarcity of gender disaggregated migration data. This research aims to evaluate how these dual limitations affect the accuracy of commonly used migration prediction models. By analyzing migration flows disaggregated by gender, the study compares the performance of deterministic methods and probabilistic gravity-type models in predicting migrant flows with varying gender compositions. The findings reveal significant differences in the predictive performance of gravity-type models based on the gender composition of migration flows. Drawing on migration theories and case studies, the study contextualizes these findings, concluding that the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and the limited availability of gender-specific migration data have critically undermined the accuracy of current prediction and forecasting methods. The implications of this research highlight the urgent need for a critical reassessment of migration theories and methodologies through the lens of gender biases, paving the way for more inclusive and accurate migration predictions.",

          "abstract": "The study of DNA tumor viruses has revolutionized cancer biology, partly by virtue of the unique capabilities of viral oncoproteins to manipulate key proteins and pathways involved in tumorigenesis. We find a high affinity and selective binding of the polyoma small T antigen (PyST) with the transcription cofactor TAZ. By engineering a degradable version of PyST, we demonstrate that, when TAZ activity is modulated by PyST, a surprisingly small number of genes have altered expression and thus are candidate transcription targets of TAZ. Notably, knocking out TAZ, or its target genes CTGF or CYR61, abolishes the growth-promoting properties of PyST that are evident upon growth factor withdrawal. Therefore, by controlling the protein abundance of PyST and consequently TAZ activity, we find that TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator that can achieve important biological effects by acting on a limited number of gene targets.",

          "abstract": "The cardiac sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a critical regulator of intracellular calcium (Ca) in cardiomyocytes. Although strongly regulated by pH, the role of NCX1 pH sensitivity in cardiac function and intracellular Ca regulation is not understood. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to produce a pH-resistant NCX1 mouse by replacing histidine 165 with alanine (H165A). H165A mice live into adulthood and are fertile. Comparative studies in isolated ventricular myocytes demonstrated that NCX1 current (I NCX ) was significantly inhibited by lowering pH i to ~6.5 in the wild type (WT) but was unaffected in myocytes from pH-resistant H165A mice. Similarly, in WT cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca indicator fura-2 AM, Ca transient amplitude increased dramatically during field stimulation when pH i was lowered to 6.5, consistent with impaired Ca efflux caused by proton-mediated NCX1 inhibition. In contrast, Ca transients were unchanged by low pH i in H165A myocytes, indicating effective Ca efflux by the mutant exchanger despite acidosis. When we subjected H165A mouse hearts to ischemia/reperfusion, where cellular injury is thought to result in part from Ca accumulation and inhibition of NCX1 by ischemic acidosis, there was reduced injury and improved recovery of function compared to WT. These results reveal that maintaining NCX1 activity during ischemia, and presumably maintaining Ca extrusion, is a powerful approach to protect or precondition the heart against injury that would otherwise occur subsequently during reperfusion. We conclude that allosteric regulation of NCX1 by protons is a highly relevant physiological process that takes place in clinical settings associated with abnormally low pH, such as cardiac ischemia.",

          "abstract": "Sliding friction between two dry surfaces is commonly described by the speed-independent Amonton–Coulomb friction force law. However, there are many situations where multiple frictional contact points between two surfaces are “active” and each can move at a different relative speed. Here, we study the sliding friction properties of a system with multiple active contacts each with independent and controllable speed. We demonstrate that multiple active contacts can produce controllable speed-dependent sliding friction forces, despite each individual contact exhibiting a speed-independent friction. We study in experiment a rotating carousel with ten speed-controlled wheels in frictional contact with the ground. We first vary the contact speeds and demonstrate that the equilibrium system speed is the median of the active contact speeds. Next we directly measure the sliding friction forces and observe how the contact speeds can control the force–speed curve of the system. In the final experiments, we demonstrate how control of the force–speed curve can create sliding friction with a controllable effective viscosity and controllable sliding friction coefficient. Surprisingly, we are able to demonstrate that frictional contacts can create near frictionless sliding with appropriate force–speed control. By revealing how active contacts can shape the force–speed behavior of dry sliding friction systems, we can better understand animal and robot locomotion and furthermore open up opportunities for new engineered surfaces to control sliding friction.",

          "abstract": "CDK12 primarily functions as a transcription regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) that controls mRNA elongation, splicing, and polyadenylation. The CDK12 gene is implicated in human cancers since it is frequently mutated and/or deleted in prostate and ovarian cancer but paradoxically amplified in breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that CDK12 promotes serine-933 phosphorylation of DNA2, a nuclease/helicase critical for replication fork stress regulation, and the phosphorylation subsequently facilitates DNA2 polyubiquitination and degradation mediated by the APC/C CDC20 E3 ubiquitin ligase. CDK12 inactivation induces but amplification suppresses genome-wide expression of interferon response and antigen processing and presentation machinery genes in ovarian and breast cancer cells, respectively. Besides causing aberrant DNA2 stabilization, replication stress, genomic instability, and cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) accumulation, CDK12 loss also triggers cGAS–STING activation and innate immune response, which can be reversed by forced expression of replication protein A (RPA) subunits or DNA2 depletion. Our findings identify DNA2 as a phosphorylation substrate of CDK12, connecting CDK12 to cell cycle regulation. These data also reveal DNA2 protein destruction as a critical mechanism that dictates genomic instability, cGAS–STING signaling activation, and innate immune response in CDK12-deregulated cancers.",

          "authors": "Ying Yang, Yuanqing Ma, Richard D. Tilley, J. Justin Gooding",
          "abstract": "In superresolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI), molecules spaced closer than the diffraction limit can be separated through spatial and temporal correlation analysis of the fluorescence intensity fluctuations. The resolution and speed of SOFI imaging greatly depend on the characteristics of these fluorescence fluctuations. Fluorophores with stochastic and rapid fluorescence fluctuations are favorable for improving SOFI imaging resolution and speed, especially in high-order cumulant analysis. Stochastic blinking of organic dyes in oxygen scavenging and thiol reducing buffers are well suited for SOFI due to their high brightness. However, the blinking rates can be too slow and nonuniform, which introduces nonlinearity in SOFI image. To address these challenges, we introduce electrochemically controlled dye switching for SOFI (EC-SOFI). By applying an oscillating electrochemical potential to a transparent electrode surface, we increase the overall dye switching rate and uniformity. Using Alexa 647 dye as an example, EC-SOFI reduces the average ON time by over threefold and switching variance by more than twofold compared to conventional photochemical switching, achieving ~60 nm spatial resolution in 6th order EC-SOFI image. We further demonstrate that EC-SOFI achieves ~130 nm and ~80 nm resolution with 100 and 300 frames, respectively, enabling fast, large-area tile-scan superresolution imaging. This advancement in EC-SOFI significantly enhances the practical potential of the SOFI technique.",

          "abstract": "In chemotaxis, motile bacteria recognize external molecules and move toward favorable concentrations. Chemoreceptors form complexes that perform transmembrane signaling, control a histidine kinase, and undergo posttranslational adaptational modifications. Chemoreceptors are thought to function by switching between two signaling states: kinase-off, favored by ligand occupancy, and kinase-on, favored by adaptational modification. Many structural and biochemical features of the two states have been identified, but little is known about the equilibrium between them and the response of that equilibrium to signaling inputs. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we monitored helical separations in the Escherichia coli aspartate chemoreceptor Tar for the two pairs of helices that form the cytoplasmic four-helix coiled coil bundle. Rather than the commonly assumed switch between two conformations in response to signaling inputs, we identified two separations in each helical pair that were present under all conditions but with variation in relative occupancy. Ligand occupancy and adaptational modification were found to differentially impact the conformational equilibria, rather than reversing the same conformational response, as previously thought. Ligand occupancy changed symmetrical packing in the four-helix bundle into rhomboid packing, whereas adaptational modification determined which helical pair was central in the rhombus. Thus, the structural consequence of ligand binding was not stabilization of a specific helical conformation but instead the collective geometry of all helices in the bundle. Such changes in helical geometry may play a role in conformational signaling by other transmembrane receptors.",

Strikingly, this inhibition can be overcome which was correlated with the emergence of three breakthrough mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (S P812R, ORF3 Q185H, and E S6L). Subsequent analyses confirmed that the combination of these mutations conferred accelerated replication kinetics, higher viral titers, and more rapid onset of cytopathic effects, but not MPA resistance. Comparison of global transcriptional responses to infection highlighted dysregulation of specific cellular gene programs under MPA treatment prior to breakthrough mutation emergence. Together, these findings identify viral and host drivers of variant emergence under immunosuppression. They also advocate for close monitoring of immunosuppressed patients, where emergence of novel viral variants with a fitness advantage may arise.",

Bacterial carbohydrate sulfatases are key enzymes in gut colonization, and they are elevated in human IBD and correlate with disease severity. Selective inhibitors of carbohydrate sulfatases could function as sulfatase-selective drugs, allowing precise control of sulfatase activity while preserving these otherwise beneficial bacteria. Arylsulfamates are covalent inhibitors that target a catalytic formylglycine residue of steroid sulfatases, a residue that is also conserved in carbohydrate sulfatases. Here, we find that a library of aryl- and carbohydrate sulfamates is ineffective against carbohydrate sulfatases, yet can inhibit human gut microbiota (HGM) species grown on sulfated glycans. Leveraging thermal proteome profiling (TPP), we identify a lipid kinase as the target responsible for these effects.

We identified a zinc finger protein, ZNF148, which is coexpressed and physically binds p63 in carcinoma cells. Genome occupancy analyses identified a functional transcribed enhancer-derived RNA (eRNA) upstream of the CCND1 gene occupied by both factors.

          "abstract": "Single-domain antibodies, such as variable heavy domain of heavy chain (VHH) domains from camelids, are an attractive platform for therapeutic purposes. VHHs have a smaller size than traditional antibodies, which harbors certain advantages such as tissue penetration or accessing epitopes that may be shielded by protein domains. However, the smaller size of VHHs typically involves a smaller binding site, which can limit the scope of related antigens they are able to bind and, in the specific case of antiviral VHHs, render them susceptible to escape by a single point mutation. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental protein engineering approach to broaden the reactivity of SARS-CoV-1 receptorbinding domain (RBD)-specific VHH-72 for SARS-CoV-2 and Delta. Our strategy focuses on increasing the size of the binding site by imparting “second site” interactions toward heterologous antigens. We utilized the residue-based pharmacophore modeling approach, Protein-ligandinterface design (ProtLID), to identify potential productive side chain interactions in this second site and then encoded the ProtLID-predicted restricted diversity into a VHH-72-based phage library, which we then screened for cross-reactive SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD clones. Based on sequence analysis from the resulting population of functional VHH clones, we identified a VHH-72 triple mutant (T60P.D61P.D100eY), which maintained high affinity for SARS-CoV-1 RBD but was enhanced by 18- and 20-fold for RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and Delta relative to WT VHH-72. These results highlight the potential of computationally customizing phage display diversity for single-domain binding proteins and provide a strategy for designing extension of protein binding interfaces.",

The circadian clock, which is driven by positive regulators Clock (CLK) and Cycle (CYC), and negative regulators Period and Timeless, is thought to mediate this response. However, it remains unclear whether diapause induction involves a canonical rhythmic mechanism or occurs independently of their traditional roles in timekeeping. Using the ladybug Harmonia axyridis as a model for short-day-induced winter diapause, we demonstrate that knockdown of Clk and cyc , but not per or tim , disrupted entry into reproductive diapause. This finding demonstrated that Clk-cyc regulates diapause independently of per and tim . We further show that the DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1)-mediated Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4)/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex impinges on diapause regulation by acting simultaneously as a downstream effector and a physical interactor of CLK-CYC. Application of the juvenile hormone (JH) receptor agonist methoprene effectively rescued the diapause phenotypes caused by Clk , cyc , and dmap1 knockdowns, highlighting the central role of the CLK-CYC-NuA4/TIP60 complex in JH production. Additionally, using a corpora allata (CA)-specific driver in Drosophila melanogaster , we demonstrate that this complex functions locally in the CA to mediate JH biosynthesis. Collectively, our findings identify a previously unrecognized pathway by which circadian clock proteins interact with an epigenetic regulator to specifically govern JH biosynthesis in a critical endocrine tissue, thereby regulating diapause entry independently of canonical circadian clock mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical forces are ubiquitous and essential during vertebrate development, yet how these forces are translated into biochemical signals and regulate development during postnatal organogenesis remains poorly understood. While early embryogenesis relies on cell-autonomous mechanotransduction, the role of sensory innervation—abundant in postnatal stages—has been overlooked. Here, using the postnatal mouse molar development model, a system experiencing sustained mechanical forces and extensive innervation during tooth root formation, we first identify a subpopulation of Piezo2 + mechanosensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglia and reveal these neurons specifically detect tooth root-associated mechanical forces and orchestrate tooth root development via paracrine signaling. Critically, we show that Piezo2 in neurons—not in dental cells—is essential for tooth root morphogenesis, revealing sensory neurons as unexpected master regulators of mesenchymal cell fate. Mechanistically, Piezo2 activation triggers the calcium-dependent secretion of platelet-derived growth factor A, defining the neuronal mechanotransduction pathway that directly converts force into biochemical signals to drive organogenesis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Piezo2 + mechanosensory neurons primarily orchestrate mechanical-force-regulated processes during postnatal development. The identification of the PIEZO2–calcium–PDGF axis provides important insight into mechanotransduction by introducing sensory neurons as active architects of tissue development. This work establishes a paradigm in developmental biology, revealing how mechanosensation bridges biomechanics and neurobiology to regulate postnatal organogenesis, with implications for tissue regeneration strategies.",

          "abstract": "Aberrant aggregates of the 42-residue form of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ 42 ) are cytotoxic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cost-effective and chronically safe disease-modifying therapeutics are needed to address the AD medical emergency worldwide. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms of Aβ 42 -induced cytotoxicity and to investigate clinically relevant aminosterols, we study the impact of claramine on the aggregation kinetics and properties of Aβ 42 aggregates, as well as the ability of these proteotoxic species to bind and disrupt cell membranes. Whereas previously studied aminosterols accelerated Aβ 42 aggregation, we show that claramine potently inhibits Aβ 42 amyloid fibril formation. We find that claramine stabilizes soluble Aβ 42 , speeding up primary and secondary nucleation into species with antiparallel β-sheet structure that are elongation incompetent, thereby depleting Aβ 42 monomers from the aggregation reaction. This steroid–polyamine also dissociates Aβ 42 fibrillar aggregates, resulting in the abrogation of the autocatalytic capacity of Aβ 42 fibrils, and it also inhibits the aggregation of a tau fragment relevant to AD. Upon exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to stabilized Aβ 42 oligomers, claramine effectively neutralized Aβ 42 oligomer-induced cytotoxicity by preventing their binding to cell membranes. Owing to the unique mechanism of action of aminosterols to reduce the toxicity of soluble Aβ 42 aggregates by protecting cell membranes, and the newly characterized ability of claramine to inhibit Aβ 42 fibril formation and dissociate fibrillar Aβ 42 resulting in the interruption of the positive feedback loop in Aβ 42 aggregation, our findings further emphasize the relevance of this family of natural products as potential treatments for AD and other protein misfolding diseases.",

While numerous studies have explored peripheral and central pain mechanisms, the specific neural circuits linking the spinal cord to the brain remain poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive neurons in the parvicellular part of the subparafascicular nucleus (SPFp) in pain. Tracing revealed that CGRP neurons in the SPFp (CGRP SPFp ) receive projections from the dorsal horn. Increased calcium activity was observed in CGRP SPFp neurons during mechanical, thermal, and inflammatory stimuli. Genetic silencing of these neurons resulted in reduced pain responses in animals. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of CGRP SPFp neurons induced aversive memory but did not alter mechanical or thermal pain thresholds. This study reveals a distinct neural circuit involving CGRP SPFp neurons that mediates pain, which differs from CGRP neurons in the parabrachial nucleus. Understanding these circuits could lead to better pain treatments with fewer side effects.",

However, reliable cloud screening remains a fundamental challenge for these instruments, where traditional spatial and temporal approaches are limited by cloud variability and limited temporal coverage. The Spectroscopic Transformer (SpecTf) addresses these challenges with a spectroscopy-specific deep-learning architecture that performs cloud detection using only spectral information (no spatial or temporal data are required). By treating spectral measurements as sequences rather than image channels, SpecTf learns fundamental physical relationships without relying on spatial context. Our experiments demonstrate that SpecTf significantly outperforms the current baseline approach implemented for the Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) instrument, and performs comparably with other machine learning methods with orders of magnitude fewer learned parameters. Critically, we demonstrate SpecTf’s inherent interpretability through its attention mechanism, revealing physically meaningful spectral features the model has learned. Finally, we present SpecTf’s potential for cross-instrument generalization by applying it to a different instrument on a different platform without modifications, opening the door to instrument-agnostic data-driven algorithms for future imaging spectroscopy tasks.",

Shading patterns provide one of the most powerful—yet least understood—visual depth cues. Most theories assume the brain infers surface normals from luminance values. However, this seems unlikely as visual neurons are broadly insensitive to luminance. To identify alternative cues, we measured responses of model orientation-selective cell populations to images of shaded objects. We found a surprising statistical relationship between image orientations and surface curvature properties, suggesting a way to estimate shape from shading. We find that the orientation-based cues not only predict striking illusions of shape perception when lighting varies, but also the impressive robustness of shape perception when large image modifications are introduced to directly pit luminance and image orientation cues against one another. The findings resolve the longstanding question of which image measurements drive shape from shading perception.",

          "abstract": "Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) pollution is an environmental problem of global concern because overenrichment of water bodies increases phytoplankton biomass and ecosystem metabolism, depletes oxygen in bottom waters, and increases the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms. These responses to nutrient pollution have motivated policies to reduce anthropogenic nutrient inputs. However, these policies have not been universally implemented and their success at reducing phytoplankton biomass is confounded by other components of global change that regulate the conversion of nutrients into biomass. These regulating processes themselves are changing in the Anthropocene. Our study is an assessment of changing phytoplankton biomass over the period 2000–2019, using chlorophyll a trends measured in 191 lakes and 159 estuarine-coastal sites. Our results show that phytoplankton biomass has decreased in most lakes, increased in most coastal sites, and the largest trends have been predominantly negative for lakes and positive for coastal sites. These results provide evidence of opposing directions of phytoplankton biomass change between lakes and coastal sites in this recent period of unprecedented global change. Nutrient pollution is a knotty environmental problem, and our study indicates that it might be a particularly challenging problem for ecosystems situated in densely populated landscapes where freshwater and sea water meet. Success at overcoming this challenge will require deeper scientific understanding of changes in processes that regulate the conversion of nutrients into phytoplankton biomass, substantial investments of time and resources to reduce nutrient inputs, and a flexible strategy designed to anticipate and adapt to a changing world.",

Most sRNAs regulate mRNA expression by directly base pairing with complementary sites in the target mRNA with the help of the chaperone protein Hfq. sRNAs and Hfq must rapidly search hundreds of candidate mRNAs for matched (cognate) targets while discriminating against noncognate targets. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly observe how cognate and noncognate mRNAs bind immobilized sRNA–Hfq. The results show that initially unstable sRNA–Hfq–mRNA complexes either dissociate within seconds by ejecting one of the two RNAs, depending on their interactions with Hfq, or are stabilized by sRNA–mRNA base pairing. Cognate mRNAs are more likely to form long-lived sRNA–Hfq–mRNA complexes, even in the presence of competing RNA. Active competition for the mutual Hfq chaperone introduces a kinetic barrier to RNA colocalization that is resolved by base pairing, driving the accumulation of cognate sRNA–mRNA interactions while eliminating noncognate interactions.",

          "abstract": "Hovering, the ability to maintain a stationary position in fluid, is essential for many fish species during prey capture, habitat exploration, and mating. While traditionally assumed to be energetically inexpensive for fishes with a swim bladder, the metabolic costs and morphological factors influencing postural stability during hovering remain poorly understood. Hovering requires fishes to counteract small instabilities in position and orientation, often through continuous adjustments using their fins and body. To examine the energetic consequences of this active stabilization, we measured body posture, fin kinematics, and metabolic rates in 13 near-neutrally buoyant fish species during both hovering and resting. Our results show that hovering nearly doubles metabolic rates compared to resting, and species with greater separation between the center of mass and center of buoyancy and increased caudal fin activity exhibit higher energetic costs. In contrast, species with more posteriorly positioned pectoral fins and lower length-to-depth ratios show reduced hovering costs. Our findings demonstrate that, despite morphological traits that promote instability, fishes maintain posture and position through fine-scale fin control—at a significant energetic expense. This study suggests that hovering is a costly behavior that likely plays a key role in shaping the evolution of fish morphology and locomotor strategies.",

          "abstract": "The fossil record provides the most powerful evidence of large-scale biodiversity change on Earth, but it does so at coarse and often idiosyncratic temporal scales. One critical problem that arises concerns the evolutionary consequences of individual environmental experience. Individuals respond to their environment instantaneously, whereas the resolution of most fossil records aggregates multiple paleoenvironments over time scales beyond individual lifespans. Therefore, the presence of phenotypic plasticity in deep time and the extent of its influence on macroevolution remain poorly understood. Using coupled computed tomography and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry protocols, we studied the environmental dependence of developmental trajectories across three sister species of macroperforate planktonic foraminifera. A foraminiferal shell preserves all stages of the individual’s ontogeny, as well as the environmental state experienced throughout its lifetime. Generalized additive mixed effect (GAMM) models show that somatic growth rates differ among the three Menardella species and that these are inversely correlated with calcification temperature, as reconstructed from Mg/Ca measurements through ontogeny. This environmental dependence varies among species: The thermal sensitivity of individual chamber-to-chamber growth rates of Menardella limbata and Menardella pertenuis is double that seen in Menardella exilis . In contrast, no such environmental signal was recovered for architectural shape traits. Our integrated approach is widely applicable and demonstrates that detecting developmental plasticity in the fossil record is feasible. Extrapolating these techniques in deep time promises to revolutionize our understanding of the ways in which environmentally associated trait variation drove the diversification of life on Earth.",

The simulation also accounts for both the complex three-dimensional (3D) geometry, expected as the norm in a geological waste repository, and the anisotropy of the geological formation. In addition, the high resolution of the model makes it possible to include “skin effects” developed at the interface between highly reactive materials, in this case between the high pH cement and the circumneutral but electrostatic Opalinus Clay. The successful history matching with the field experiment demonstrates that the distinct geochemical and physical properties of the cement and the Opalinus Clay in the CI-D experiment can be accounted for.

Here, we identified an 18.6 kDa heat shock protein gene ( TaHSP18.6 ) through combining a transcriptome analysis and a genome-wide association study. We verified the positive role of TaHSP18.6 in regulating wheat FCR resistance using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutants and genetic transformation. Next, we screened a lysine deacetylase sirtuin-like (TaSRT1) to determine its potential interaction with TaHSP18.6. We demonstrated that TaSRT1 deacetylated TaHSP18.6 and thereby inhibited TaHSP18.6 protein accumulation. Haplotype analysis revealed that the K171M substitution of TaHSP18.6 generated a susceptible haplotype TaHSP18.6 M171 in wheat, and mass spectrometry results implied that K171 is a key lysine acetylation site. We confirmed the differential acetylation level between TaHSP18.6 K171 and TaHSP18.6 M171 by TaSRT1. Analysis of overexpression lines and EMS mutants showed that TaSRT1 negatively regulated wheat FCR resistance. Meanwhile, we identified that TaHSP18.6 interacted with an auxin-responsive protein IAA1 (TaIAA1) that negatively regulated FCR resistance. TaHSP18.6 overexpression and TaSRT1 mutation significantly increased the auxin content. Exogenous application of auxin substantially enhanced wheat FCR resistance. Taken together, we proposed a TaSRT1–TaHSP18.6 model regulating FCR resistance possibly through mediating TaIAA1 to change the endogenous auxin content in wheat plants.",

Some studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. However, we theoretically show that this is not necessarily the case when the population is modeled as a network instead of using the mean-field approach. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the biased distribution of immunity toward socially active individuals enhances herd immunity, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in a low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for a careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of macromolecules adsorbed from extracellular fluids onto cell membranes is crucial for elucidating basic cellular processes and advancing applications in biotechnology, such as biosensing, therapeutics, and synthetic biology. However, this is complicated by the interplay between membrane heterogeneity, macromolecule conformation, and fluid hydrodynamics. We investigate the dynamics of linear polymers on binary lipid membranes using hydrodynamics simulations and single-molecule tracking experiments. We find that the preferential adsorption of nanosized polymer onto the raft-forming component of the membrane induces and stabilizes a single lipid raft that colocalizes with the polymer. This lipid raft, in turn, imposes dynamic confinement on the polymer, resulting in swollen yet restricted 2D conformations and Saffman–Delbrück-type diffusivity. These effects lead to an unusual scaling for polymer interfacial diffusion, D ∼ N − ν D with ν D ≈ 0.5 . Normal mode analysis further reveals that the relaxation time of the polymer’s slowest mode surprisingly follows the prediction of Zimm model for a 3D chain in a good solvent, irrespective of whether the polymer’s hydrodynamics are dominated by the 3D solvent or 2D fluid membrane. We also identify two diffusive modes: Saffman–Delbrück-type for polymer on heterogeneous membranes and Stokes–Einstein-like for polymer on homogeneous membranes, demonstrating the potential of polymer adsorbates as biosensors for membrane heterogeneity. Our study provides insights into polymer dynamics on biological membranes and suggests that polymer adsorbates can modulate lipid rafts, influencing raft-related cellular processes.",

We report that aging B-1a cells exhibit hallmarks of decline, including DNA damage, apoptosis, and reduced proliferation, with striking sex-specific disparities: aged females retain higher B-1a cell numbers than males, correlating with enhanced glycolysis and chromatin accessibility. Motif analysis of accessible regions identified the transcription factor Bcl11a, which shows elevated chromatin accessibility and expression in aged female B-1a cells but declines in males. Bcl11a deletion reduced B-1a cell numbers, impaired viability, and increased apoptosis across sexes and ages. Mechanistically, Bcl11a sustains survival by upregulating antiapoptotic genes ( Mcl1 , Mdm2 , and Mdm4 ) to suppress p53-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by partial rescue of viability defects in Bcl11a-deficient B-1a cells upon p53 deletion. Conversely, Bcl11a overexpression or Bcl11a-high B-1a cells from aged Bcl11a -eGFP reporter mice enhanced stress resistance.

Identifying new materials that stimulate regeneration while providing mechanical properties is an active area of research. One class of promising material in bone regeneration is graphene and its derivatives including graphene oxide (GO), the oxidized form of graphene. Recently, calcium phosphate graphene (CaPG), synthesized from GO, has been proven to have osteoinductive properties in vivo. However, CaPG is a powder, and therefore, processing is difficult. Here, we present a method for creating porous CaPG matrices by incorporating it in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). This research has comprehensively evaluated CaPG-encapsulated PLGA-based microspheres for localized delivery of osteoinductive inducerons, calcium, and phosphate ions for bone regenerative engineering. CaPG distribution improved mechanical properties and matrix hydrophilicity. CaPG-integrated matrices successfully supported cell viability, proliferation, and enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. Major osteogenic gene expression significantly increased, including Sp7, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein, COL1A1, bone sialoprotein, and dentin matrix protein1. The CaPG-containing matrices induced the endogenous canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, with no significant difference when treated with DKK1 inhibition, demonstrating its possible selective activation mechanism. The increased protein expression of pathway-specific target genes, Bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) and WNT-1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP-1), further confirmed endogenous activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These results suggest that CaPG-modified matrices improve the cellular osteogenic differentiation via the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This study provides further mechanistic insights into the nature of crosstalk between cells and inducerons-rich functionalized matrices for osteoblastic differentiation and improved bone regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Historically, it was widely assumed that males dominate females socially in most mammals. However, recent studies revealed significant variation within and among species, opening new possibilities to explore the extent and drivers of sex biases in dominance relations. This study uses quantitative data from 253 populations across 121 primate species to investigate the distribution of, and factors associated with, sex biases in the outcome of male–female contests. We first showed that male–female contests are common (around half of all contests) and that males win &gt;90% of these contests in less than 20% of populations. We next tested five hypotheses to explain sex biases in dominance relations. We found that female-biased dominance primarily occurs in primate societies where females have substantial reproductive control, as in monogamous, sexually monomorphic, and arboreal species. Female-biased dominance is also frequent in societies where female–female competition is intense, as in solitary or pair-living species where females are intolerant of each other, as well as in species where females face lower reproductive costs and are philopatric. Conversely, male-biased dominance is common in polygynous, dimorphic, terrestrial, and group-living species and often relies on physical superiority. In contrast, female empowerment hinges on alternative strategies, such as leveraging reproductive control. Our study highlights that male–female dominance relationships are highly variable and identifies the traits associated with the emergence of female- versus male-biased dominance in primate evolutionary history, which may also deepen our understanding of the origins of gender roles in early human societies.",

          "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana , the FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) gene encodes florigen, a floral stimulus that integrates multiple environmental cues to optimize the timing of flowering, which is crucial for reproductive success. The FT protein is synthesized in the phloem companion cells of leaves but exerts its function in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to initiate floral morphogenesis. While the environment-dependent regulation of FT transcription in leaves is well studied, the mechanisms underlying FT transport, particularly its cell-to-cell translocation within the SAM, remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed an in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating FT intercellular translocation in the SAM. We demonstrate that low ambient temperature inhibits the cell-to-cell movement of FT in the SAM through abscisic acid signaling pathways, resulting in flowering delay. We further show that the permeability of plasmodesmata (PD) is involved in FT transport; in particular, CALLOSE SYNTHASE ( CalS ) 1 and CalS7 are induced at low temperature, leading to reduced permeability of PD and inhibition of symplastic FT translocation in the SAM. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the intercellular translocation of FT in the SAM in response to environmental conditions and lead to a framework for the understanding of flowering.",

Most TEAD-targeting small molecules are designed to disrupt interaction between TEAD and the oncogenic transcriptional activators YAP and TAZ. Here, we uncover an alternative mechanism for a subset of TEAD lipid pocket-binding molecules. We report that select sulfonamide-containing TEAD-targeting compounds enhance the interaction between TEAD and the transcriptional repressor VGLL4. Chemically induced VGLL4–TEAD complexes confer an antiproliferative effect by outcompeting YAP–TEAD complexes at chromatin. This cofactor switch from YAP to VGLL4 impacts transcriptional networks, including influencing the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and mechanosignaling. We demonstrate that VGLL4 is required for an antiproliferative response to these sulfonamide-containing compounds by counteracting YAP. We show that VGLL4 overexpression can confer sensitivity to these compounds in Hippo-driven cell lines, and we further show that genetic deletion of VGLL4 oblates cellular responsiveness to these molecules in cells and in vivo. Our data reveal a category of TEAD inhibitors that act as “molecular glues” toward the repressive VGLL4–TEAD interaction. These findings open up understandings for curbing the oncogenic activity of Hippo pathway deregulation in cancer, and identify glue-like molecules that promote transcriptional repression.",

We established a system in Caenorhabditis elegans to dynamically probe glycolytic states in single cells of living animals via the use of the glycolytic sensor HYlight and determined that neurons can dynamically regulate glycolysis in response to activity or transient hypoxia. We performed an RNAi screen and identified that PYGL-1, an ortholog of the human glycogen phosphorylase, is required in neurons for glycolytic plasticity. We determined that neurons employ at least two mechanisms of glycolytic plasticity: glycogen-dependent glycolytic plasticity (GDGP) and glycogen-independent glycolytic plasticity. We uncover that GDGP is employed under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as transient hypoxia or in mutants for mitochondrial function. We find that the loss of GDGP impairs glycolytic plasticity and is associated with defects in synaptic vesicle recycling during hypoxia. Together, our study reveals that, in vivo, neurons can directly use glycogen as a fuel source to sustain glycolytic plasticity and synaptic function.",

          "abstract": "The fidelity of template-dependent mRNA synthesis during transcription elongation is the primary determinant of accurate gene expression and the maintenance of functional RNA transcripts. However, the mechanisms governing transcription fidelity remain incompletely understood. While previous studies have characterized how error rates vary with nucleotide identity at upstream and downstream positions from the incorporation site, the comprehensive microscopic explanation of this sequence dependence has not been elucidated. In this study, we develop a theoretical approach that integrates transcription proofreading mechanisms and inhomogeneous DNA sequence effects. Using first-passage analysis validated by Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively characterize nucleotide-specific error rates during RNA polymerase II transcription. The model accurately reproduces experimental error rates and predicts kinetic parameters influencing transcriptional fidelity. Analysis reveals nucleotide incorporation rates follow the hierarchy U&lt;C&lt;G&lt;A, consistent with independent experimental observations. Notably, our model not only explains how the error rates depend on the nature of the base immediately downstream (+1) but also predicts that the identity of the nucleotide at the second downstream position (+2) also plays an important role. Pyrimidines at position +2 contribute to lower error rates than purines, whereas the third downstream base (+3) has no effect. These previously unreported correlations are corroborated by bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets. In addition, using the BRCA1 gene as an example, we explore the physiological implications of sequence-dependent error rates, identifying an increased likelihood of premature stop codon errors. These findings clarify how DNA sequence context modulates nucleotide incorporation kinetics, advancing our understanding of transcriptional fidelity and its functional consequences.",

Arousal states are influenced by neuromodulators like catecholamines (noradrenaline and dopamine) and acetylcholine. To investigate their contributions to this law, we pharmacologically enhanced arousal while measuring human decision-making and spontaneous arousal fluctuations via pupil size. The catecholaminergic agent atomoxetine increased overall arousal and shifted the entire arousal–performance curve, suggesting a relative arousal mechanism where performance adapts to arousal fluctuations within arousal states. In contrast, the cholinergic agent donepezil did not measurably affect arousal or the curve. We modeled these findings in a neurobiologically plausible computational framework, showing how catecholaminergic modulation alters a disinhibitory neural circuit that encodes sensory evidence for decision-making.

          "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts to develop strategies to inhibit cancer metastasis—the leading cause of cancer-related deaths—progress has been limited in recent decades. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) initiates metastasis by enhancing the migratory capacity and plasticity of cancer cells, enabling them to escape the primary tumor site. Identifying vulnerabilities unique to mesenchymal cancer cells is, therefore, critical for developing effective antimetastatic therapies. Our prior research has highlighted the crucial role of the Golgi apparatus in EMT-driven cancer cell motility and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the antimigratory effects of various Golgi-disrupting compounds and identified Monensin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic, as a potent migration suppressor in mesenchymal non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Monensin treatment increases the pH within the Golgi lumen, inducing rapid exocytosis of the promigratory Golgi scaffold protein Golgi Integral Membrane Protein 4 (GOLIM4). GOLIM4 plays a key role in regulating cell motility and adhesion by modulating the post-Golgi trafficking of Talin 1 (TLN1), an essential focal adhesion component. Furthermore, we found that both GOLIM4 and TLN1 are highly expressed in mesenchymal cancer cells and are direct targets of microRNA-200b, a microRNA that is suppressed during EMT. Treatment with Monensin or depletion of GOLIM4 or TLN1 significantly impaired the migratory activity of mesenchymal NSCLC cells. In summary, this study demonstrates that Monensin exhibits potential antimetastatic activity by disrupting the promigratory GOLIM4–TLN1 axis in mesenchymal NSCLC cells.",

          "abstract": "Northeastern US temperate forests are currently net carbon (C) sinks and play an important role offsetting anthropogenic C emissions, but projected climatic changes, including increased temperatures and decreased winter snowpack, may influence this C sink over the next century. Past studies show that growing season warming increases forest C storage through greater soil nutrient availability that contributes to greater rates of net photosynthesis, while reduced winter snowpack induces soil freeze/thaw cycles that reduce tree root vitality, nutrient uptake, and forest C storage. The year-round effects of climate change on this C sink are not well understood. We report here decade-long results from the Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which determines the combined effects of growing season warming and a smaller winter snowpack on C storage in northern temperate forests. We found after a decade of treatments that growing season warming increases cumulative tree stem biomass C by 63%. However, winter soil freeze/thaw cycles offset half of this growing season warming effect. The amount of C stored in stem biomass of trees experiencing both growing season warming plus smaller winter snowpack is only 31% higher than the reference plots, but this difference is not significant. Our results suggest that current Earth system models are likely to overestimate the C sink capacity of northern temperate forests because they do not incorporate the negative impacts of a shrinking snowpack and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw cycles on C uptake and storage by trees.",

Such sites are rare globally in nonmarine settings during the 12 million years (Ma) preceding the end-Triassic extinction (ETE; ~201.5 Ma), obscuring patterns of faunal change across this interval. A vertebrate assemblage from Arizona, USA, provides unique insights into community composition and ecology prior to the ETE. PFV 393 is a macro- and microvertebrate bone bed preserved in a volcaniclastic fluvial channel-fill with a high-precision U-Pb zircon age of 209.187 ± 0.083 Ma. The fossil assemblage consists of three-dimensionally preserved, delicate, and small skeletal elements of known and new taxa that document a local paleocommunity including hybodontiformes, actinopterygians, actinistians, metoposaurids, salientians, synapsids, lepidosaurs, testudinatans, trilophosaurids, Vancleavea , doswelliids, Revueltosaurus , loricatans, phytosaurs, and pterosaurs. The new early-diverging pterosaur is one of the few Triassic pterosaurs found outside of Europe and the only one with a documented precise radioisotopic age. The testudinatan material shows the rapid dispersal of terrestrial stem-turtles across the Pangaean supercontinent in the Norian and refines temporal constraints on the origin of the turtle shell. The presence of vertebrate lineages endemic to the Triassic highlights their persistence in a mesic, fluvial paleocommunity through a prolonged phase of environmental change preceding the ETE. These lineages coexisted with frogs, lepidosaurs, turtles, and pterosaurs- all key elements of post–Triassic Mesozoic communities. The arrival of turtles and pterosaurs in west-central Pangaea therefore may have been driven by the northward drift of Laurentia from humid equatorial conditions into more arid subtropical latitudes.",

          "abstract": "Autophagic dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease, leaving neurons vulnerable to the accumulation of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins. However, the late onset of diseases suggests that compensatory quality control mechanisms may be engaged to delay these deleterious effects. Neurons expressing common familial Parkinson’s disease-associated mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) exhibit defective autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that both primary murine neurons and human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC)-derived neurons harboring pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles. We used unbiased proteomics to characterize the secretome of LRRK2 G2019S neurons and found that autophagic cargos including mitochondrial proteins were enriched. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that autophagosomes are rerouted toward secretion when cell-autonomous degradation is compromised to mediate clearance of undegraded cellular waste. Immunoblotting confirmed the release of autophagic cargos and live-cell imaging demonstrated that secretory autophagy is upregulated in LRRK2 G2019S neurons. We also found that LRRK2 G2019S neurons upregulate the release of exosomes containing microRNAs. Live-cell imaging confirmed that this upregulation of exosomal release is dependent on hyperactive LRRK2 activity, while pharmacological experiments indicate that this release staves off apoptosis. Finally, we show that markers of both vesicle populations are upregulated in plasma from mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2. In sum, we find that neurons expressing pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate secretory autophagy and the compensatory release of exosomes to mediate waste disposal and transcellular communication, respectively. We propose that this increased secretion contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, delaying neurodegenerative disease progression over the short term while potentially contributing to neuroinflammation over the longer term.",

It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers’ success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model’s behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: in the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine ICL and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.",

High-resolution structures and force measurements on the DNA packaging motor of bacteriophage Φ29 revealed that its five ATPase subunits coordinate ATP hydrolysis with each other to maintain the proper cyclic sequence of DNA translocation steps about the ring. Here, we explore how the Φ29 motor regulates translocation by timing key events, namely ATP binding/hydrolysis and DNA gripping, through trans-subunit interactions. We used subunit dimers bound to DNA as our model system, a minimal system that still captures the conformation and trans-subunit interactions of the full pentameric motor complex. Molecular dynamics simulations of all-ATP and mixed ATP–ADP dimers revealed that the nucleotide occupancy of one subunit strongly affects the ability to hydrolyze ATP in the adjacent subunit by altering the free energy landscape of its catalytic glutamate approaching the gamma phosphate of ATP. Specifically, one ATP-bound subunit donates residues in trans that sterically block the neighboring subunit’s catalytic glutamate. This steric hindrance is resolved when the first subunit hydrolyzes ATP and is ADP bound. This obstructive mechanism is supported by functional mutagenesis and appears to be conserved across several Φ29 relatives. Mutual information analysis of our simulations revealed intersubunit signaling pathways, via the trans-acting obstructive residues, that allow for sensing and communication between the binding pockets of adjacent subunits. This work reveals how the sequential order of DNA translocation events among subunits is preserved through trans-subunit interactions and pathways.",

In 40 exceptional immune responders to anti-PD1 monotherapy for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), genome sequencing showed 30% had inherited a NOD2 LOF variant, more than twice the population frequency ( P = 0.0021). Conversely, a gain-of-function RIPK2 allele known to increase NOD2 signaling was inherited by 61% of nonresponders from the same cohort, compared to 10% of exceptional responders and much higher than the population frequency ( P &lt; 0.0001). Within the overall recruited cohort of 144 NSCLC anti-PD1 patients, individuals with immune-related adverse events (irAE) had better overall survival, further improved in those with NOD2 LOF. In independent anti-PD1 monotherapy cohorts with a range of cancers, inherited NOD2 LOF was associated with complete or partial response ( P = 0.0107).

          "abstract": "The electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ), powered by renewable electricity, provides an energy- and cost-efficient alternative to conventional thermocatalytic methods for purifying crude ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) streams. This approach provides a more sustainable route to polymer-grade C 2 H 4 by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, yet its commercial potential remains limited by the scarcity of high-performance catalysts and the absence of comprehensive techno-economic analyses for large-scale implementation. In this study, we conduct an extensive screening and evaluation of monodisperse metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Bi) with tunable particle sizes and morphologies for the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of C 2 H 2 in flow reactors. Among these candidates, 45 nm Cu nanocubes and 8 nm Ag NPs exhibited the highest performance. In a simulated crude ethylene stream (C 2 H 2 : C 2 H 4 = 1:80), Cu nanocubes achieved 99.7% C 2 H 2 removal at room temperature with a specific selectivity of 86.7% for C 2 H 4 and maintained stability for 120 h. Meanwhile, 8 nm Ag NPs exhibited a high specific selectivity of 98.9%, with 96.7% conversion and 24-h stability under the same conditions. A detailed techno-economic analysis confirms the feasibility of electrocatalytic systems for industrial-scale crude ethylene treatment, with an optimal conversion cost of $0.74 per kg of C 2 H 2 , compared to $1.34 per kg for the optimized thermocatalytic system. Furthermore, our life cycle assessment highlights the environmental benefits of the electrocatalytic pathway with a carbon emission reduction of over 50%. Our electrified, efficient C 2 H 2 semihydrogenation in C 2 H 4 crude streams minimizes environmental impact and optimizes resource use, contributing to a more sustainable future.",

          "authors": "Juan Ignacio Polanco, Philippe-E. Roche, Luminita Danaila, Emmanuel Lévêque",
          "abstract": "The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid 4 He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale’s contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures 1.44 K ≲ T ≲ 2.16 K indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance ℓ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale L 0 ) should behave as ℓ / L 0 ≈ 0.5 Re κ − 3 / 4 with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation κ . This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.",

Each LD is enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids, distinct from bilayer membranes. The composition of LD surface phospholipids and their impact on LD growth and function remain to be defined. Phosphoinositides mark cellular organelles and regulate organellar function. Here, we demonstrate that PI(4)P decorates a subset of LDs to recruit and activate CIDE proteins. Enhanced expression of ORP2 and ORP5, LD-associated lipid transfer proteins that remove PI(4)P from LDs, abolished the localization and function of CIDE proteins. Blocking the synthesis of PI(4)P on the LD surface via knocking down PI4K2A also impaired the localization and function of CIDE proteins. In adipocytes, depleting PI(4)P dramatically reduced the size of LDs, as well as adipose tissue mass. In severe steatotic liver, depleting PI(4)P impeded LD enlargement. Our results thus identify a key function of LD surface PI(4)P under physiological conditions and unveil how CIDE proteins are recruited to LDs.",

          "abstract": "Natural language unfolds over multiple nested timescales: Words form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, and paragraphs build into full narratives. Correspondingly, the brain exhibits a hierarchy of processing timescales, spanning from lower- to higher-order regions. During narrative comprehension, neural activation patterns have been shown to propagate along this cortical hierarchy with increasing temporal delays (lags). To investigate the mechanisms underlying this lag gradient, we systematically manipulate the structure of a recurrent reservoir network. In the biologically inspired “Limited-Canal” configuration, word embeddings are received by a limited set of sensory neurons and transmitted through a series of local connections to the distal end of the network. This configuration endows the network with an intrinsic lag gradient, inducing a cascade of activity as information propagates along the network. We found that, similar to the human brain, this intrinsic lag gradient is enhanced by naturalistic narratives. The interaction between naturalistic input and network structure becomes evident when manipulating local connectivity through the “canal width” parameter, which determines how closely the Limited-Canal model mirrors the human brain’s sensitivity to narrative structure. In addition, we found that processing cost, as a computational proxy for the BOLD signal, increases more slowly in later neurons, which can account for the emergence of the lag gradient. Our results demonstrate that narrative-driven neural dynamics can emerge from macroscale anatomical topology alone without task-specific training. These fundamental topological properties of the human cortex may have evolved to effectively process the hierarchical structures ubiquitous in the natural environment.",

          "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG), a defining feature of the bacterial cell envelope, is crucial for cell integrity and morphology. PG is a macromolecular mesh consisting of glycan polymers crosslinked by short peptides encasing the cytoplasmic membrane. PG peptides contain two to five amino acids of both L- and D-configuration, with a conserved L-alanine residue at the first position in most bacteria. We previously identified a β-lactam hypersensitive mutant of Escherichia coli lacking yfiH (renamed pgeF ) that shows incorporation of L-serine or glycine instead of L-alanine. Here, we demonstrate that PgeF is an editing enzyme that imparts fidelity to the biosynthesis of PG peptides across bacterial genera. Using extensive mass spectrometry, we find accumulation of misincorporated cytoplasmic PG precursors in the absence of pgeF . Detailed biochemical analysis of several bacterial PgeF homologs reveals that PgeF specifically cleaves serine or glycine but not alanine from the PG precursors. Additionally, expression of heterologous ligases that incorporate L-serine or glycine is lethal in the absence of pgeF , indicating that L-alanine at the first position is crucial for wall integrity. Interestingly, PgeF is selectively conserved in bacteria and vertebrates; however, we find that the PG editing activity is exclusive to bacterial homologs. Furthermore, homologs from both taxa were previously characterized as purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNP). Here, we find that they indeed have a weak PNP activity, but with no physiological relevance in bacterial systems. Overall, our study demonstrates the existence of a conserved proofreading pathway that is fundamental to the integrity of the bacterial cell wall.",

Breastfeeding is known to support infant health, but the contributions of the numerous breastmilk components to gut microbiota and immune maturation remain unclear. Secretory IgA (SIgA), the most abundant antibody in human milk, is a key modulator of gut microbiota composition. We have shown previously that mouse milk SIgA protects against asthma by limiting segmented filamentous bacteria in mice. The present study uncovers a similar mechanism in humans. Using human milk from the CHILD Cohort Study, we define a relationship between human milk SIgA and infant gut microbiota composition. This leads to the identification of Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum as a key player in immune development, which is controlled by milk SIgA. Cell culture modeling demonstrates that SIgA restricts the capacity of E. ramosum to adhere to the intestinal epithelium and to induce Th17 responses, which are implicated in allergic and other chronic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Inferring coexistence metrics, such as niche and fitness differences, in changing environments is key for understanding the mechanism behind species coexistence and predicting its likelihood. However, it first requires estimating the per capita interactions between organisms and their intrinsic growth rates—parameters that are typically measured by isolating organisms from their natural context. Here, we first use weighted multivariate regression on the per capita growth rates of populations to estimate these key ecological parameters directly from time-series data of species-rich communities. Second, we infer niche differences and species resistance, which are two important metrics for understanding species coexistence. Our approach allows these metrics to vary over time and under different environmental conditions. We validate our approach using synthetic data and apply it to both experimental and observational data as a proof of concept. Experimental results show an expected allocative trade-off between grazing resistance and rapid growth in algae. Moreover, coexistence likelihood decreases, and coexistence balance is disturbed under stressful environmental conditions. Observational data suggests variations in intrinsic growth rates and per capita interactions among autotrophic guilds with respect to seasonal patterns. In addition, interactions between cyanobacteria with green algae and chrysophytes might indicate a potential cause for bloom development. Our approach offers a powerful toolbox to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying ecological dynamics, species coexistence, and community structures under varying environments. Such an understanding will help us address important ecological and evolutionary questions, such as explaining biodiversity patterns and solving the problem of cyanobacteria bloom.",

          "abstract": "Accumulation of cytosolic DNA has emerged as a hallmark of aging, inducing sterile inflammation. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein translates the sensing of cytosolic DNA by cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) into an inflammatory response. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby cytosolic DNA-induced cGAS–STING pathway leads to aging remain poorly understood. We show that STING does not follow the canonical pathway of activation in human fibroblasts passaged (aging) in culture, senescent fibroblasts, or progeria fibroblasts (from Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome patients). Despite cytosolic DNA buildup, features of the canonical cGAS–STING pathway like increased cGAMP production, STING phosphorylation, and STING trafficking to perinuclear compartment are not observed in progeria/senescent/aging fibroblasts. Instead, STING localizes at endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, and chromatin. Despite the nonconventional STING behavior, aging/senescent/progeria cells activate inflammatory programs such as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and the interferon response, in a cGAS and STING-dependent manner, revealing a noncanonical pathway in aging. Importantly, progeria/aging/senescent cells are hindered in their ability to activate the canonical cGAS–STING pathway with synthetic DNA, compared to young cells. This deficiency is rescued by activating vitamin D receptor signaling, unveiling mechanisms regulating the cGAS–STING pathway in aging. Significantly, in HGPS, inhibition of the noncanonical cGAS–STING pathway ameliorates cellular hallmarks of aging, reduces tissue degeneration, and extends the lifespan of progeria mice. Our study reveals that a new feature of aging is the progressively reduced ability to activate the canonical cGAS–STING pathway in response to cytosolic DNA, triggering instead a noncanonical pathway that drives senescence/aging phenotypes.",

Key features observed in soft–hard composites, including mechanical hysteresis, sacrificial bond-driven toughening, and brittle-to-ductile (BTD) transitions, are successfully reproduced, suggesting that the simplest model captures the essence of toughening in soft–hard composites. Visualization of internal fracture reveals distinct fracture patterns associated with the BTD transition, while numerical and theoretical analyses elucidate its mechanical origins. Furthermore, we identify an optimal toughening composition governed by a unified scaling relation linked to the fracture toughness ratio between soft and hard components. A fundamental toughening phase diagram is also established in terms of strength and toughness. This work sheds light on the underlying toughening landscape of soft–hard composite systems.",

Recently determined GPCR structures have revealed allosteric pockets facing the lipid bilayer, enabling rational drug design. Here, we develop a virtual screening strategy to discover ligands of extrahelical binding pockets and apply this approach to the adenosine A 1 receptor (A 1 R). The A 1 R is a high-value therapeutic target for ischemia–reperfusion injury and chronic neuropathic pain. Developing effective A 1 R therapeutics remains challenging due to high structural conservation across orthosteric binding sites and on-target unwanted effects stimulated by prototypical A 1 R agonists, such as bradycardia and atrioventricular block. However, A 1 R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) acting through spatially distinct allosteric sites can fine-tune A 1 R activity with high subtype selectivity and spatiotemporal specificity, thereby overcoming current limitations. A chemical library of 160 million compounds was computationally docked to the allosteric pocket identified in a cryo-EM structure of the A 1 R, and a set of 26 top-ranked compounds were selected for experimental evaluation. Pharmacological evaluation of these, and structure-guided hit optimization, led to the discovery of subtype-selective A 1 R PAMs. These compounds demonstrated minimal allosteric agonism and negligible impact on A 1 R-mediated beat rate of an orthosteric agonist. The discovered PAMs pave the way for potential treatments for neuropathic pain and ischemia–reperfusion injury without accompanying side effects.

Herein, we identify a peculiar electroinduced thiol to thione tautomerization of 4-mercaptopyridine (4MPy) molecule on Cu catalyst surfaces at this triple-phase interface driven by cathodic polarization. This leads to a significant performance improvement of CO 2 RR on Cu with a C 2+ Faradaic efficiency of over 80% with more than 60% C 2 H 4 , as well as a 300 mV reduction of cell voltage compared to bare Cu. A home-designed MEA-type operando Raman cell enables mechanistic studies directly under a current density of over 100 mA cm −2 , elucidating the intricate impacts of the 4MPy tautomerization on the local catalytic environments under real reaction conditions. Surprisingly, this tautomerization does not occur in other commonly utilized electrolyzers, e.g., flow cell and H-cell, even with the same catalyst and electrolyte conditions. The direct contact with the electrolyte in the latter cells was found to cause rapid desorption of 4MPy from the catalyst surface before its possible chemical transformation. These results highlight the opportunities of utilizing surface molecular tautomerization to promote CO 2 RR performance and using the triple phase of MEA to drive reactions that would otherwise be hard to happen in classical electrochemical devices of similar conditions.",

Here, we show that ACBP plasma concentrations are elevated in (close-to-)centenarians (mean ± SD age 99.5 ± 4.5 y) commensurate with their health deterioration, correlating with a reduced glomerular filtration rate and a surge in senescence-associated cytokines. ACBP neutralization by means of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) improved health span in a strain of progeroid mice. In a mouse model of chronic kidney injury induced by cisplatin, anti-ACBP mAb administration counteracted both histopathological and functional signs of organ failure. ACBP inhibition also prevented the senescence of tubular epithelial cells and glomerular podocytes induced by cisplatin or doxorubicin, respectively, as measurable by the immunohistochemical detection of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, best known as p21). Senescence was also prevented by anti-ACBP mAb treatment in additional mouse models of accelerated aging. This applied to liver damage induced by a combination of high-fat diet and carbon tetrachloride, where hepatic cells become senescent. Moreover, administration of anti-ACBP mAb prevented natural and doxorubicin-accelerated cardiomyocyte senescence. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to study the transcriptome of hearts that had been exposed to doxorubicin and/or anti-ACBP in vivo. In cardiomyocytes, doxorubicin caused an anti-ACBP-reversible dysregulation of mRNAs coding for cardioprotective proteins involved in autophagy, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial homeostasis, and oxidative phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings plead in favor of a broad age-promoting effect of ACBP across different organ systems.",

Sex sorting in rearing facilities, enabling male-only releases, is necessary to ensure SIT programs are efficient, cost-effective and, in case of mosquito control, also safe. This can be greatly facilitated by genetic sexing strains (GSS), exhibiting sex-specific phenotypic markers. However, the development of GSS remains challenging. The construction of a temperature-sensitive lethal ( tsl )-based GSS in the Mediterranean fruit fly ( Ceratitis capitata ) over three decades ago was considered a major breakthrough for SIT programs but was never successfully replicated in other pests. After over 30 y of research, we have pinpointed a specific mutation in the C. capitata lysine--tRNA ligase ( Lysyl-tRNA synthetase , LysRS ) gene responsible for the tsl phenotype. Introducing this specific mutation into a wild-type strain produced full embryonic lethality under heat stress, replicating the original mutant phenotype. The random integration of a LysRS minigene reversed this effect. The high conservation of LysRS among insects suggests that tsl-based GSS could be expanded to multiple pest species and extend applications of SIT programs for disease prevention and the protection of agriculture.",

          "abstract": "To uncover substrates mediating the oncogenic activity of WWP1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed a proteomic analysis that identified the histone demethylase KDM5B /JARID1B as a candidate target. Of note, JARID1B is indispensable for efficient recruitment of several DNA damage repair factors and for damage resolution, thus negatively influencing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemo- and radiation therapies. Validation of JARID1B as a substrate of WWP1 revealed a positive regulation of JARID1B half-life by WWP1 through the establishment of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. As a result, downregulation of JARID1B rising from WWP1 inactivation was associated with higher H3K4me3 enrichment at JARID1B target genes in WWP1-depleted relatively to control AML cells. Integration of RNA-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data uncovered a highly significant overlap between upregulated gene expression and enriched H3K4me3 peaks after shWWP1 inactivation. We confirmed transcriptional activation of JARID1B targets in WWP1-depleted cells, supporting a role for WWP1 in regulating JARID1B activity. Coherently, upon WWP1 inactivation, we observed a defective recruitment of repair proteins after DNA damage, with subsequent reduced DNA damage repair efficiency and enhanced sensitization of AML cells to the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic drugs. All together, these data identify JARID1B as a bona fide target of WWP1 and imply that WWP1-mediated regulation of JARID1B impacts its ability to modify chromatin and to recruit DNA damage repair factors, thus ultimately affecting chemosensitivity of AML cells.",

However, the roles of these pathogenic factors in synaptic dysregulation and cognitive malfunction are still poorly understood. In this study, a conditional knockout mouse model lacking ZC4H2 —an X-linked gene implicated in ZC4H2-associated rare disorder (ZARD) —in forebrain excitatory neurons is generated and these mice exhibit cognitive malfunction, recapitulating the intellectual disability manifestation of ZARD. Mechanistically, ZC4H2 harbors a protein interaction network with key excitatory synaptic regulators and ZC4H2 interacts directly with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and regulates their ubiquitination at the postsynaptic sites, thereby maintaining AMPARs protein stability and synaptic expression. ZC4H2 deficiency specifically and aberrantly increases AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission and impairs synaptic plasticity of long-term potentiation. More importantly, pharmacological treatment with perampanel, an AMPAR-specific antagonist, successfully restores the excitatory synaptic activity and cognitive function of ZC4H2-deficient mice. Together, we establish that ZC4H2 is a postsynaptic regulator for AMPARs and excitatory synaptic activity and highlight that the dysregulation of these biological processes is a crucial etiology underlying ZARD-associated intellectual disability.",

While beneficial in localized infections, excessive NET formation can lead to widespread coagulopathy and organ failure. While the roles of NET-associated proteins such as histones in immunothrombosis are well characterized, NET-derived DNAs are much less known. To address this issue, we report herein the direct interaction between thrombin and DNA scaffolds and further, the identification of short tandem repeats of single-stranded (ATTCC) n in NETs that selectively bind thrombin, a crucial enzyme involved in both blood clot formation and immune response. We have also developed a strategy of selective targeting ss(ATTCC) n using antisense locked nucleic acids (LNAs), effectively disrupting NET–thrombin interactions. This finding reveals an unexplored role of single strand DNA (ssDNA) within NETs and provides a broad avenue for developing targeted therapeutic interventions for immunothrombosis-related disorders.",

          "abstract": "The mitotic inhibitor docetaxel (DTX) is often used to treat endocrine-refractory metastatic breast cancer, but initial responses are mitigated as patients develop disease progression. Using a cohort of ex vivo cultured circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with heavily pretreated breast cancer (n=18), we find distinct patterns of response to DTX, which are intrinsic and independent of past clinical treatment with taxanes. In some CTC cultures, treatment with a single dose of DTX results in complete cell killing, associated with accumulation of nonviable polyploid (≥8 N) cells arising from endomitosis. In other CTC cultures, a transient viable drug-tolerant persister (DTP) population emerges, ultimately enabling renewed proliferation of CTCs with preserved parental cell ploidy and restored DTX sensitivity identical to that of the pretreated culture. In these CTCs, efficient cell cycle exit generates a ≤4 N drug-tolerant state dependent on CDKN1B (p27/kip1). Exposure to DTX triggers stabilization of CDKN1B through AKT-mediated phosphorylation at serine 10. Suppression of CDKN1B reduces the number of persister CTCs, increases ≥8 N mitotic cells and abrogates regrowth after DTX exposure. Thus, CDKN1B-mediated suppression of endomitosis contributes to the initiation of a reversible drug-tolerant persister state following mitotic inhibitors in advanced patient-derived breast cancer cells.",

Cities are increasingly recognized as key agents in achieving a climate-safe future , protecting biodiversity , staying within planetary and Earth system boundaries , and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Cities that have been successful in transforming themselves have the potential to do much more than alter their own trajectories.

Reconstructed genomes self-organize into six spatially distinct taxonomic cohorts and 10 functionally distinct biomes that are primarily structured by wind-driven circulation at the surface and density-driven circulation at depth.

Each observation has received its own tailored explanation involving multiple genetic and evolutionary causes. In this work, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory for sex chromosome evolution incorporating the coevolution of cis- and trans-acting regulators of gene expression and leading to systematic misexpression of dosage-compensated genes in heterogametic F1 hybrids, for both young and old sex chromosomes.",

As long as compartmentalization is maintained, different symbiont species can peacefully coexist, but experimental removal of compartment walls leads to deadly conflicts. Modeling suggests that compartmentalization optimizes nutritional benefits by increasing the time during which domatia harbor large ant colonies.

Results show that single-thread channels originate from a balance between lateral erosion and accretion, which enables a thread to migrate while maintaining equilibrium width. In contrast, multithread channels originate from imbalance—erosion outpaces accretion in individual threads, causing threads to repeatedly widen and split. Thread-width imbalance provides a mechanistic explanation for how multithread channels develop on Earth and other planets and, in application, can help lower the cost of nature-based river restoration projects.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) synthesizes telomeric repeats at chromosome ends using a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a telomerase RNA (hTR in humans). Previous structural work showed that human telomerase is typically monomeric, containing a single copy of TERT and hTR. Evidence for dimeric complexes exists, although the composition, high-resolution structure, and function remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human telomerase dimer bound to telomeric DNA. The structure reveals a 26-subunit assembly and a dimerization interface mediated by the Hinge and ACA box (H/ACA) RNP of telomerase. Premature aging disease mutations map to this interface. Disrupting dimer formation affects RNP assembly, bulk telomerase activity, and telomere maintenance in cells. Our findings address a long-standing enigma surrounding the telomerase dimer and suggest a role for the dimer in telomerase assembly.",

          "abstract": "Maintenance of mitochondrial redox homeostasis is of fundamental importance to cellular health. Mitochondria harbor a host of intrinsic antioxidant defenses, but the contribution of extrinsic, nonmitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms is less well understood. We found a direct role for peroxisomes in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis through contact-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer. We found that ACBD5 and PTPIP51 form a contact between peroxisomes and mitochondria. The percentage of these contacts increased during mitochondrial oxidative stress and helped to maintain mitochondrial health through the transfer of mitochondrial ROS to the peroxisome lumen. Our findings reveal a multiorganelle layer of mitochondrial antioxidant defense—suggesting a direct mechanism by which peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial health—and broaden the scope of known membrane contact site functions.",

We modulated developmental signaling pathways combined with TF overexpression to explore the spectrum of neuron subtypes generated from pluripotent stem cells. We screened 480 morphogen signaling modulations coupled with TF induction using a multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic readout. Analysis of 700,000 cells identified diverse excitatory and inhibitory neurons patterned along the developmental axes of the neural tube. Patterning neural progenitors prior to TF overexpression expanded neuronal diversity by enabling access to regulons active in primary tissue counterparts. Our approach provides a strategy for programming diverse human cell subtypes as well as investigating how cooperative signaling drives neuronal fate.",

BioEmu integrates over 200 milliseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, static structures and experimental protein stabilities using novel training algorithms. It captures diverse functional motions—including cryptic pocket formation, local unfolding, and domain rearrangements—and predicts relative free energies with 1 kcal/mol accuracy compared to millisecond-scale MD and experimental data. BioEmu provides mechanistic insights by jointly modelling structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties. This approach amortizes the cost of MD and experimental data generation, demonstrating a scalable path toward understanding and designing protein function.",

Our understanding of glymphatic function and its involvement in the pathogenesis of AD derives primarily from correlative clinical data and rodent studies. A causal role for glymphatic dysfunction in AD has not yet been established in humans. We review current approaches to assess glymphatic function clinically, which capture different features of perivascular fluid dynamics or their results. The absence of clinically suitable imaging approaches to measuring glymphatic exchange in the human brain is an obstacle to evaluating whether glymphatic function is impaired in AD populations and to developing and evaluating therapeutics to modulate glymphatic function in the treatment and prevention of AD.",

We found distinct regional populations and evidence for two migrations of dogs into Greenland with the Inuit from Canada. Furthermore, we found that there is minimal European ancestry in present day Qimmit and limited recent inbreeding despite low heterozygosity.

Here, we analyze more than 320 million daily observations of milk production across 12 years, paired with survey data, to provide estimates of the effect of humid heat and the scope for adaptation. Results indicate that extreme heat reduces milk yield by up to 10%, with effects that persist for more than 10 days. Effects are stronger when cows are at more productive stages, suggesting a productivity-resilience trade-off. Cooling infrastructure and management adjustments were widely adopted over the preceding two decades, but only partially mitigate these losses, reducing them by less than half. Given the technological advancement and the representation of the climate of key producing countries in our sample, these results suggest that adaptation strategies, even those at the technological frontier, may be insufficient to address climate change damages.",

          "abstract": "Selective inhibition of the more than 100 S1 family serine proteases is a long-standing challenge due to their active site similarity. Mesotrypsin, implicated in cancer progression, exemplifies these difficulties; no current inhibitors achieve selectivity over other human trypsins. We found an unexpected autoinhibited conformation of mesotrypsin via x-ray crystallography, revealing a cryptic pocket adjacent to the active site. Using high-throughput virtual screening targeting this cryptic pocket, we identified a conformationally selective small-molecule inhibitor that stabilizes the inactive state of mesotrypsin. This inhibitor demonstrates selectivity for mesotrypsin over other trypsins. Our findings challenge the accepted view of digestive trypsins as constitutively active enzymes lacking potential for allosteric regulation. Furthermore, analyses of other structures suggest that dynamic sampling of closed states with analogous allosteric cryptic pockets appears widespread among S1 serine proteases. These observations point to a potentially generalizable strategy to achieve selective inhibition, offering broad implications for drug development targeting serine proteases in cancer and other diseases.",

Multiplane light conversion (MPLC) enables spatial mode transformation and is applicable in both classical and quantum optics. Here, we demonstrate a polymer-based MPLC device, fabricated via femtosecond laser three-dimensional printing, that realizes high-dimensional quantum logic gates in an ultracompact format. Specifically, we design a three-dimensional Hadamard gate by training a diffractive neural network to generate the required phase distribution. The device is evaluated through quantum process tomography at the single-photon level within spatial modes, achieving a fidelity of 90%. Compared to traditional spatial light modulator–based implementations, our approach integrates spatial mode manipulation into a miniaturized photonic platform. These results highlight the feasibility of polymer-based MPLC for compact quantum logic and open possibilities for scalable, high-dimensional quantum information processing on integrated photonic chips.",

          "abstract": "Because of the inferior thermoelectric performance of metals, the semiconductor-to-metal transition in thermoelectric materials is always avoided. Here, we demonstrate that α-to-β semiconductor-metal transition in MgAgSb is actually not detrimental but can be strategically exploited to create α/β-MgAgSb junction, enabling 150% enhancement in output power while maintaining high conversion efficiency. This power enhancement lies in the notably reduced internal resistance induced by semiconductor-to-metal transition, which is independent of dimensional changes. Consequently, α/β-MgAgSb can simultaneously achieve high maximum conversion efficiency exceeding 10% (9%) and maximum power density above 1 (0.9) W cm −2 by simulation (experiment), outperforming most p-type materials under identical conditions. In addition, a two-pair thermoelectric module combining α/β-MgAgSb with n-type Mg 3 Sb 0.6 Bi 1.4 achieves an unprecedented power density, representing notable advancements over existing Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 /MgAgSb two-pair system. These findings highlight the immense potential of α/β-MgAgSb for thermoelectric applications and provide insights into the design of high-power thermoelectrics.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high throughputs. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-DOF robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs of more than 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing defects. With this self-supervised neural network–driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.",

We identified Foxc1 and Arid5A genes as prospective transactivation targets by the mutant GR in skeletal muscle.

Moreover, Foxc1 and Arid5a programs in muscle were divergently changed by glucocorticoid regimens with opposite metabolic outcomes.

MERS E conducts K + ions with a unitary conductance of 113 picosiemens, fivefold larger than the conductance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 E. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that the MERS E transmembrane domain forms a five-helix bundle that spans the lipid bilayer. The amino-terminal helical interface features multiple interacting phenylalanine (Phe) residues and an asparagine (Asn), whereas the carboxyl-terminal channel pore contains Phe 33 . Mutation of Phe 17 abolished K + conductance, whereas mutations of Phe 33 and Asn 15 suppressed most channel activity.

By leveraging a rodent-adapted strain of S. aureus , we developed a natural model of SSTIs. We found that LukMF′, a pore-forming leukocidin homolog to the human-specific LukSF-PV toxin, drives skin pathology in mice. LukMF′ lyses neutrophils via the chemokine receptor CCR1, which in turn fuels inflammatory pathology and microbial survival within the infectious nidus. Ablation of CCR1, depletion of neutrophils, or vaccination with LukMF′ all protected mice from skin pathology. Thus, these data support epidemiological studies linking leukocidins with human SSTIs and highlight the power of natural models to unearth potential targets to curtail infections.",

To identify glycosyltransferases, glycans, and glycoproteins essential for melanoma maintenance, we conducted an in vivo growth screen with a pooled short hairpin RNA library of glycosyltransferases, lectin microarray profiling of benign nevus and melanoma samples, and mass spectrometry–based glycoproteomics. We found that α-2,3-sialyltransferases ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 and corresponding α-2,3–linked sialosides are up-regulated in melanoma compared to nevi and are essential for melanoma growth. Glycoproteomics revealed that glycoprotein targets of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 are enriched in transmembrane proteins involved in growth signaling, including the amino acid transporter SLC3A2/CD98hc. CD98hc suppression mimicked the effect of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 silencing, inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation. We found that both CD98hc protein stability and its prosurvival effect on melanoma are dependent upon α-2,3-sialylation mediated by ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2.

A relative of the UrIg2 V domain exon was invaded by the RAG transposon, revealing the genesis of the adaptive immune system.

We show that kinetically arrested phase separation of polymer solutions confined to narrow capillaries resulted in alternating segments of isotropic and chiral nematic phases. The chiral structure of the nematic segments originated from the interplay between the constrained geometry, surface anchoring, orientational wetting, and elastic anisotropy of rigid-rod polymers. The catenoidal shape of the chiral structure recapitulated the morphology of biological chiral structures. These findings provide insight into the organization of soft matter under spatial confinement and offer a straightforward way to form chiral structures from achiral synthetic polymers.",

The penetration capacity is demonstrated by an unprecedented depth (~150 micrometers) of bovine serum albumin (66.4 kilodaltons) across aortic vessels under pressing for only 60 seconds. This spongy coating-based PMI technique can be integrated with medical balloon devices, offering endoluminal treatment within blood vessels, tracheas, and intestines.

Simultaneous catalytic inactivation of DOT1L and the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 (SET domain containing 2) leads to hyperactive transcription and failures in neural differentiation.

Furthermore, YAP-TEAD inhibition restores the expression levels of genes hyperactivated by H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss.

Complement pathway inhibitors could offer strategies to address these challenges. Here, we assess the efficacy of inhibitors with various nanoparticles, including dextran superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoworms, polyethylene glycol (PEG) liposomal drugs, and mRNA lipid nanoparticles. In human sera, inhibitors of the alternative pathway iptacopan and danicopan exhibit variable efficacies, ranging from high nanomolar to incomplete inhibition. However, both iptacopan and danicopan display poor efficacy with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin. Sutimlimab, an inhibitor of the classical pathway, demonstrates poor efficacy with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, even in sera with anti-PEG antibodies. Iptacopan displays donor-dependent inhibition of the uptake of nanoparticles in human blood. Bolus coadministration of iptacopan with nanoworms in mice, rats, and dogs inhibits C3 opsonization and uptake by granulocytes. Iptacopan also alleviates nanoparticle-induced lethargy in rats and severe hypotension in dogs. These data suggest that complement inhibitors can enhance the immunocompatibility and hemocompatibility of nanomedicines in a donor-dependent manner.",

Despite their critical role, the biological differences between single CTCs and CTC clusters remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively compared their behavioral, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles in lung cancer models. Compared with single cells, CTC clusters present enhanced metastatic potential, greater survival in the bloodstream and increased resistance to microenvironment. Mechanistically, the Src/FN1 pathway is centrally activated in clusters, promoting intercellular cohesion and protecting against immune clearance and stress in circulation. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with the clinical inhibitor KX2-391 disrupted clustering, impaired CTC survival, and reduced metastasis in preclinical models. Our findings identify the Src/FN1 pathway as a key vulnerability in CTC cluster–driven metastasis, suggesting that Src inhibitors are promising therapeutic strategies to disrupt clustering and improve outcomes in patients with metastatic lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. Its high mortality rate reflects limited therapeutic options and a poor understanding of disease-causing signaling. We show that the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for increased mortality in a model of secondary HLH (sHLH). Unexpectedly, neither deletion of the NLRP3-activated pyroptotic effector GSDMD nor combined deletion of the inflammasome-activated cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 conferred strong protection from sHLH. Instead, co-deletion of GSDMD and caspase-8–activated GSDME limited sHLH-driven lethality, demonstrating redundancy in the pyroptotic machinery required to induce sHLH. We also found that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors prevent NLRP3-driven pyroptosis, which acted by blocking inflammasome priming. BET inhibitors prevented increased NLRP3 levels in diseased tissue, limited the production of sHLH-associated IL-1β, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor, and protected from sHLH pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting NLRP3 could limit sHLH and identify clinically relevant bromodomain-selective BET inhibitors capable of eliminating NLRP3-driven pyroptosis and the sHLH cytokine storm.",

The Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) controls the return of internalized cargos to the plasma membrane, and Rab25 has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancer by promoting invasive migration. However, while Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here, we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localization to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargos, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin β1, with the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin–rich filopodium-like protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in the three-dimensional matrix.",

Amyloid-β, the main component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease, has been shown to be generated in the presence of microbes. Entrapment of microbes by aggregated amyloid-β may serve as an innate immune response to pathogenic infections. To understand the association of amyloid-β plaques and pathogenic infections in the central nervous system, we obtained viable short-interval postmortem human retinal tissue and generated human retinal organoids that contain electrophysiologically active neurons. Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces amyloid-β extracellular protein aggregates in human retinal explants and retinal organoids. Last, pharmacological inhibition of neuropilin-1 resulted in reduced amyloid-β deposition in human retinal explants treated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 protein.

Suborbital to millennial-scale surface water bioproductivity changes provide no evidence for a continuous ice shelf in the AAG and the Nordic Seas over the past ~750,000 years. Instead, proxy data and model simulations reveal the persistent presence of seasonal sea ice cover and open water phytoplankton blooms during both glacial and interglacial times.

Inspired by the unique properties of cell membrane–derived nanodiscs, particularly their ultrasmall size and intrinsic membrane functions, we develop macrophage membrane–derived nanodiscs (denoted “MФ-NDs”) as a nanomedicine for the treatment of systemic bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Our findings demonstrate that MФ-NDs interact directly with bacteria, disrupting their membranes, inducing leakage of intracellular contents, and ultimately causing bacterial death. Meanwhile, MФ-NDs reduce intracellular bacterial count. In a mouse model of systemic MRSA infection, treatment with MФ-NDs significantly improves survival rates in both therapeutic and preventative contexts. Moreover, MФ-NDs show a lower propensity to induce bacterial resistance compared to conventional small-molecule antibiotics. No acute toxicity is observed in mice treated with MФ-NDs. Overall, this study underscores the straightforward fabrication and promising potential of MФ-NDs for addressing antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.",

Specifically, missense p53 (misp53) GOF mutations associate with therapy resistance and worse clinical outcomes. However, the molecular functions of distinct misp53 mutants in plasticity and therapy response remain unclear. Integrating multicenter patient data and multi-omics, we report that the misp53 R273H/C mutant is associated with cell cycle progression and a basal-like state compared to the misp53 R248W/Q mutant. Loss of misp53 R273H/C decreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53 R273H/C specifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53 R273H/C mutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53 R273H/C -associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms.",

Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods.

Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete-element modeling with three-dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs overlap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrecognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones.",

Wearables were given to 103 children for 21 days immediately after appendectomy, and biorhythm metrics were extracted from per-minute data. A machine-learned model using these metrics retrospectively predicted postoperative complications up to 3 days before formal diagnosis with 91% sensitivity and 74% specificity.

          "abstract": "The November 2021 introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b into North America triggered a devastating outbreak, affecting more than 180 million domestic birds and spreading to more than 80 wildlife species across Canada and the US. From this outbreak, we have sequenced 2955 complete A(H5N1) viral genomes from samples collected in Canada and, in conjunction with previously published data, performed multifaceted phylodynamic analyses. These analyses reveal extensive diversification of A(H5N1) viruses via reassortment with low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We find evidence of repeated ancestral strain replacement by direct descendants, indicative of compounding viral fitness increases. Spatiotemporal modeling identified critical geographic areas facilitating transcontinental spread and demonstrated genotype-specific host dynamics, offering essential data for ongoing control and prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "The silicon-based field-effect transistor (FET) is approaching the physical limits for the prominent short-channel effects and the sequent leakage currents under the conventional paradigm. Here, we propose a momentum-dependent field-effect transistor (MD-FET) to address this issue, in which a monolayer 2D semiconductor is sandwiched by two cross 1D carbon nanotube electrodes. The MD-FET enables a perfect off state, as the elastic tunneling is forbidden by the momentum mismatch between the cross 1D contacts. It can also access a substantial on state, because the momentum mismatch can be compensated by the electron-phonon scattering in a 2D channel. The MD-FET with sub–1-nm channel thus exhibits high on/off ratios of ~10 7 , which breaks through the theoretical limit on the short-channel effect. The MD-FET opens up a previously unknown paradigm to further scale down transistors beyond silicon and inspires a promising solution for the post-Moore era.",

A nonlinear modified power function was used to predict the forgetting rates on the DMTS task, using separate models for prenatal and childhood Pb.

Produced rapidly via cascade tubing microfluidics, PMDMs can self-assemble, disassemble, and reassemble into chains that autonomously switch among four locomotion modes—walking, crawling, swinging, and lateral movement. Their reconfigurable design allows navigation through complex and constrained biomimetic environments, including obstacle negotiation and stair climbing with record speed at the submillimeter scale. We also developed a molecular dynamics–based computational platform that predicts PMDM assembly and motion. PMDMs demonstrated precise, programmable cargo delivery (e.g., drugs and cells) with postdelivery retrieval.

Methods for generating humanized mouse models that allow scientists to probe contributions of particular genes have been rudimentary. Here, we established an efficient method for generating genetically modified human cord blood–derived CD34 + cells for transplantation, resulting in humanized mice with near-complete loss of specific gene expression by the human immune system.

These artificial cells feature nano-organelles that segregate incompatible modules: one for photocatalytic cofactor regeneration and another for biocatalytic alcohol metabolism. This spatial separation ensures sustainable cofactor provision and protects enzymes from oxidative damage. Co-compartmentalization of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase within a single nano-organelle enhances cascade reaction efficiency while inhibiting intermediate leakage. When cocultured with hepatocytes, these artificial cells demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and efficiently mitigate oxidative stress from alcohol metabolism.

We enhance the exposure of single atoms in nanopores by coating the catalysts on a carbon nanotube–interwoven membrane framework. Electrofiltration intensifies the transport and adsorption of nitrate in confined nanopores with highly exposed single-atom active sites to enhance reduction. The membrane enables a superior ammonia turnover frequency of 15.1 grams of nitrogen per gram of metal per hour, up to four orders of magnitude higher than that reported in the literature, under both high removal efficiency and Faradaic efficiency of over 86% when treating influents with a low nitrate concentration of 100 milligrams of nitrogen per liter in a residence time on the order of seconds.",

Adult muscle cells are large and chain thousands of sarcomeres into long periodic myofibrils that attach to the skeleton. During development, muscle cells must increase in length to maintain the mechanical connection to the growing skeleton. How muscles add new sarcomeres to facilitate muscle growth is unknown. Using live imaging and high-throughput image analysis, we have now tracked the sarcomere components during the developmental growth of Drosophila muscle and found that individual sarcomeres divide along the myofibril tension axis into daughter sarcomeres. This way, new sarcomeres can be inserted into contractile and mechanically intact myofibrils. We propose that sarcomere division is triggered by tension and local sarcomere damage originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions. Sarcomere divisions repair damaged sarcomeres, ensure their mechanical integrity, and synchronize sarcomere addition with skeletal growth during animal development.",

Silencing of TMEM9B-AS1 in primary human myotubes attenuated protein synthesis, concomitant with reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Moreover, we show that TMEM9B-AS1 plays a pivotal role in regulation of ribosomal biogenesis by facilitating messenger RNA stabilization of the transcription factor MYC through direct physical interaction with the RNA binding protein, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1). Disrupted ribosomal biogenesis resulting from TMEM9B-AS1 silencing leads to decreased expression of muscle contractile and structural proteins important for maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function.

Here, we tested this by recording dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and dorsomedial striatum while rats executed a sensory preconditioning task that incorporated both types of learning. We found that dopamine release in both regions correlated with errors in predicting value-neutral cues during latent learning and with errors in predicting reward during reward-based conditioning. Moreover, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens reflected inferred value in the probe test, supported by orbitofrontal cortex activity. Our findings show that dopamine signals prediction errors about both valued and neutral stimuli, consistent with its operation as a general teaching signal that supports learning across different informational domains.",

We found that activating cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB) at S133 and methyl-CpG–binding protein 2 (MeCP2) at S421 drives the transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), contributing to arketamine’s antidepressant-like effects.

We tackle this question by studying the onset of embryonic differentiation in mice, where cell competition eliminates 35% of embryonic cells. These loser cells have mitochondrial dysfunction, which we show causes amino acid deprivation and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), a pathway essential for their survival. We demonstrate that l -proline is a key amino acid sensed by the ISR and that proline represses the ISR and drives their elimination. These results indicate that cell competition acts as a previously unidentified tissue-sparing mechanism, regulated by the availability of extracellular amino acids, that allows for the elimination of dysfunctional cells when amino acids are plentiful but ensures their survival in nutrient-poor environments.",

          "abstract": "Rapid climate change represents a profound threat to biodiversity. Understanding the local adaptations and their vulnerabilities to climate change are imperative for developing conservation measures. Here, we combined a multidisciplinary approach to determine the local adaptations of an endemic and near-threatened primate, aiming to reveal its potential to cope with future climate change. Results suggest that climatic fluctuations played an important role in shaping its demographic trajectory and genetic structure. In addition, Tibetan macaques have experienced a severe bottleneck in the recent past, with highly deleterious mutations partially removed, but moderately deleterious mutations accumulating. The severe bottleneck and lower genetic diversity may have reduced their potential to adapt to environmental change, which will compromise long-term viability. Furthermore, we found that the eastern group exhibited higher genomic offsets and loss of suitable habitat in response to climate change. Overall, we emphasize the importance of integrating population genomics and environmental data to predict the adaptation of post-bottleneck populations to rapid climate change.",

          "abstract": "The endoribonuclease Dicer is a central component of the posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism based on RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes. The antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian cells remains controversial while a number of viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR) able to inhibit Dicer activity and promote infection have been identified. Here, we explored the integrity and functional role of Dicer during FMDV infection. These studies showed that the FMDV-encoded Leader protease (Lpro) specifically cleaves Dicer at a conserved DExD/H helicase motif releasing the complete N-terminal helicase domain. Dicer cleavage by Lpro suppressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)–induced RNAi in swine cells. Silencing of Dicer conferred increased susceptibility to an Lpro-deficient FMDV, revealing a Dicer-dependent antiviral effect which can be effectively counteracted by Lpro. This mutant generated a remarkably different profile of viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) in infected cells compared with the wild-type virus. Overall, we identified a viral mechanism of dampening or modulating antiviral defenses based on Dicer proteolytic degradation.",

Elevated OPA1 levels in multiple cancers correlate with reduced therapy sensitivity and poor survival, calling for specific OPA1 GTPase inhibitors. A high-throughput screening of ~10,000 compounds identified MYLS22, a heterocyclic N -pyrazole derivative as a reversible, noncompetitive OPA1 GTPase inhibitor. MYLS22 engaged with OPA1 in vitro and in cells where it induced cristae remodeling and mitochondrial fragmentation contingent on intactness of its predicted OPA1 binding site. MYLS22 enhanced proapoptotic cytochrome c release and sensitized breast adenocarcinoma cells to anti–Bcl-2 therapy, without toxicity on noncancer cells. By MYLS22 structure-activity relationship studies, we obtained Opa1 inhibitor 0 (Opitor-0) that inhibited OPA1, promoted cytochrome c release, and restored anti–Bcl-2 therapy sensitivity more efficiently than MYLS22. These chemical probes validate OPA1 as a therapeutic target to increase cancer cell apoptosis at the mitochondrial level.",

The incidence of human infections of POWV in North America has been increasing because of the expanding distribution of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis that transmits POWV to humans. To mitigate the dangers of handling a risk group 3 human pathogen, a chimeric virus was constructed from the genetic backbone of a yellow fever virus vaccine strain 17D (YFV-17D) and the external structural proteins of POWV lineage II. The chimera had a comparable phenotype as POWV. The atomic resolution of yellow fever virus-Powassan virus chimera (yPOWV) structure was built without ambiguity, revealing surface glycans and lipid pocket factors. The similarity to other flavivirus structures and the phenotype similar to YFV-17D suggest that there could be future potential as a vaccine candidate.",

However, the current approaches to structured sound often have restrictions on the multiplexing capacity of generating sound vortices and lack of dynamic manipulation over them. Here, we unveil an approach to generating structured acoustic waves and achieving remote dynamic control based on the proposed concept of topological-charge (TC) multiplexed metasurface (TCMM). We demonstrate that the TCMM can serve as an efficient device to yield structured sound field with multiple spatial vortex singularities, whose features and physics are entirely determined by the TCs encoded in it. These degrees of freedom can be tuned independently, enabling the dynamic remote control of multiple acoustic vortices and leading to the precise control over their motion. Our findings provide different insights into the generation and control over sound vortices and establish a powerful platform for engineering structured acoustic waves.",

Here, we report a synthetic efferocytic receptor (SER) integrating Aβ-targeting scFv, efferocytosis receptor backbone based on TIM4 and downstream signal for microglia (MG) reprogramming, which enabled selective elimination of Aβ without inducing an inflammatory response. Specifically, our in-house–customized MG-editing mRNA lipid nanoparticles (MERLINs) efficiently introduced SER mRNA into MG to generate Aβ-specific SER-MG in situ. SER-MG exhibited robust Aβ-specific phagocytosis and stimulated anti-inflammatory efferocytosis typical signaling in vitro. In a mouse model of AD, SER expression in the MG markedly increased the clearance of Aβ and dampened inflammation, resulting in improved behavioral outcomes along with substantially reduced synapse elimination. Our findings establish that AD-associated aberrant MG can be in situ reprogrammed with SER for Aβ clearance in an anti-inflammatory manner, with broad application in other inflammation-related diseases.",

However, the intrinsic stability issue of halide perovskites, especially under strong excitation conditions required for lasing, remains to be solved. Previous development of perovskite lasing has been largely limited to proof-of-concept devices with short operation time. Here, we report remarkably stable green lasing from colloidal CsPbBr 3 perovskite nanocrystals dispersed in liquids placed in a Fabry-Pérot cavity under excitation by nanosecond pulses. The output intensity of this laser is stable for more than 10 days of continuous operation. Transient absorption measurements reveal that the optical power efficiency of the laser is limited by the relatively short gain lifetime of NCs (160 ps), which nevertheless can be enhanced to 4.2% by implementing a double-pulse excitation scheme. Deep-red liquid lasing from CsPbI 3 nanocrystals has also been achieved, suggesting the feasibility to develop perovskite liquid lasers that are seamlessly tunable across the whole visible spectrum.",

Nonetheless, the complexities of self-regulating stress or structural characteristics through growth or gene expression render the anti-wrinkling of “nonliving” artificial surfaces using bionic principles a pressing yet formidable challenge. Here, inspired by nonliving dehydrated leaves, we propose an on-demand customizable, material invariant, parametric surface anti-wrinkling strategy using leaf vein–imitated boundary curvature–coupled constraints. This strategy allows for an exact surface customization with enhanced anti-wrinkling capability, tailored to specific anti-wrinkling demands while maintaining the original cross-section materials. The defined parameters, anti-wrinkling width and concave radius, are customized by the anti-wrinkling design criteria via the dimensionless dual-correction stiffness model, which are simple linear or quadratic functions of anti-wrinkling demands and cross-section properties. Experiments at different scales and materials validate the correctness of the design criteria. The strategy in this study is effective on diverse wrinkle-prone surfaces at multiple scales and can inform real engineering design of the nonliving artificial surfaces.",

We then propose strategic magnetic driving methods that enable FHMRs with five powerful motion modes for negotiating various application scenarios. Experimental results show that FHMRs can move flexibly and effectively simulate thrombus removal within a vascular model by integrating multiple motion modes. Furthermore, modified FHMRs can swiftly deliver drugs to targeted areas, with the capability for phased release on surfaces of wrinkled physiological tissues.

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger metabolic adaptations that resemble those induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here, we show that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairment, modeled by Ndufs4 deficiency, reprograms lung epithelial metabolism to promote IAV pathogenesis. In both Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mice and lung epithelial cells, OXPHOS deficiency increased glycolytic flux, diverting carbons into hexosamine and de novo sialic acid (SIA) biosynthesis pathways. This led to elevated sialylation and enhanced viral attachment. In Ndufs4 KO models, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase signaling was insufficient to blunt this increased metabolic flux. IAV infection further exacerbated this metabolic vulnerability, amplifying SIA and viral burden. Pharmacologic rerouting of glucose carbons with dichloroacetate reduced sialylation, viral replication, and inflammatory responses in Ndufs4 KO models. These findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction enhances IAV susceptibility by disrupting energy sensing and fueling viral receptor biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of epithelial metabolism in viral pathogenesis and suggesting metabolic modulation as a potential therapeutic.",

While asymmetric optical responses have enabled breakthroughs in classical applications like nonreciprocal light transmission, we report the experimental demonstration of asymmetric nonlinear responses for biphoton entanglement. Using a structural-asymmetric semiconductor metasurface incorporating [110] InGaP nanoresonators, we realize continuous tuning of polarization entanglement from partially entangled states to a Bell state by adjusting the pump wavelength. We also observe pronounced spatial anti-correlations and theoretically confirm that this approach can extend to tailor hyperentanglement. Furthermore, our nanoscale entanglement source features an ultrahigh coincidence-to-accidental ratio of ≈7 × 10 4 , outperforming existing semiconductor flat optics by two orders of magnitude. Introducing asymmetric nonlinear response in quantum metasurfaces opens directions for tailoring on-demand quantum states.",

In this article, we seek to demonstrate that the existing literature on the VC-inequality nexus in North America can help make sense of the interrelationship between VC allocation decision-making and socially differentiated access to VC in Africa. By summarizing existing findings on the VC allocation-inequality nexus and combining insights from different disciplines, we provide conceptual clarity through a systematic inventory of the existing literature. Secondly, by developing a view from Africa, we show how an engagement with VC from ‘the margins’ complicates existing narratives on investee discrimination mainly generated in a North American context. Finally, we filter our findings through VC experiences of Asian economies, where VC funding has often evaded the classic ‘race’ problem due to its domestic nature, even though these experiences are far from equal affairs.",
