          "abstract": "Chemical feedback is ubiquitous in physiology but is challenging to study without perturbing basal functions. One example is addictive drugs, which elicit a positive-feedback cycle of drug-seeking and ingestion by acting on the brain to increase dopamine signalling 1–3 . However, interfering with this process by altering basal dopamine also adversely affects learning, movement, attention and wakefulness 4 . Here, inspired by physiological control systems, we developed a highly selective synthetic physiology approach to interfere with the positive-feedback cycle of addiction by installing a cocaine-dependent opposing signalling process into this body–brain signalling loop. We used protein engineering to create cocaine-gated ion channels that are selective for cocaine over other drugs and endogenous molecules. Expression of an excitatory cocaine-gated channel in the rat lateral habenula, a brain region that is normally inhibited by cocaine, suppressed cocaine self-administration without affecting food motivation. This artificial cocaine-activated chemogenetic process reduced the cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine rise in the nucleus accumbens. Our results show that cocaine chemogenetics is a selective approach for countering drug reinforcement by clamping dopamine release in the presence of cocaine. In the future, chemogenetic receptors could be developed for additional addictive drugs or hormones and metabolites, which would facilitate efforts to probe their neural circuit mechanisms using a synthetic physiology approach. As these chemogenetic ion channels are specific for cocaine over natural rewards, they may also offer a route towards gene therapies for cocaine addiction.",

          "abstract": "Generative models cover various application areas, including image and video synthesis, natural language processing and molecular design, among many others 1–11 . As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge 12–14 . Here we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models 4 , where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create images never seen before following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of the images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multicolour images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, human faces and artworks, following the data distributions of MNIST 15 , Fashion-MNIST 16 , Butterflies-100 17 , Celeb-A datasets 18 , and Van Gogh’s paintings and drawings 19 , respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural-network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate images of handwritten digits and fashion products. In addition, we generated Van Gogh-style artworks using both monochrome and multiwavelength illumination. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient and scalable inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial-intelligence-generated content.",

They are characterized by topological boundary modes that remain stable under symmetry respecting perturbations 1–4,6–8 . In clean, gapped systems without disorder, the stability of these edge modes is restricted to the zero-temperature manifold; at finite temperatures, interactions with mobile thermal excitations lead to their decay 9–11 . Here we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge mode 12–14 , which is protected by emergent symmetries and persists across the entire spectrum, in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. Through digital quantum simulation of a one-dimensional disorder-free stabilizer Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles for a wide range of initial states. We show that the interaction between these edge modes and bulk excitations can be suppressed by dimerizing the stabilizer strength, leading to an emergent U(1) × U(1) symmetry in the prethermal regime of the system. Furthermore, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence, despite the system being disorder-free and at finite temperature. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach 15–18 to experimentally study topological matter at finite temperature and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived, robust boundary qubits in disorder-free systems.",

          "abstract": "The mechanical properties of metallic materials often degrade under harsh cryogenic conditions, posing challenges for low-temperature infrastructures 1 . Here we introduce a dual-scale atomic-ordering nanostructure, characterized by an exceptionally high number density of co-existing subnanoscale short-range ordering (approximately 2.4 × 10 26 m −3 ) and nanoscale long-range ordering (approximately 4.5 × 10 25 m −3 ) domains, within a metallic solid-solution matrix in a CoNiV-based alloy to improve the synergy of strength and ductility at low temperatures. We observe an ordering-induced increase in dislocation shear stress as well as a more rapid dislocation multiplication owing to the dislocation blocking effect of nanoscale long-range ordering and the associated generation of new dislocations. The latter effect also releases stress concentrations at nanoscale long-range-ordered obstacles that otherwise would promote damage initiation and failure. Consequently, the alloy shows a strength–elongation product of 76 GPa % with a yield strength of approximately 1.2 GPa at 87 K, outperforming materials devoid of such ordering hierarchy, containing only short-range ordered or coherent precipitates of a few tens of nanometres. Our results highlight the impact of dual co-existing chemical ordering on the mechanical properties of complex alloys and offer guidelines to control these ordering states to enhance their mechanical performance for cryogenic applications.",

          "abstract": "To orchestrate ribosomal peptide synthesis, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) must be aminoacylated, with activated amino acids, at their 2′,3′-diol moiety 1,2 , and so the selective aminoacylation of RNA in water is a key challenge that must be resolved to explain the origin of protein biosynthesis. So far, there have been no chemical methods to effectively and selectively aminoacylate RNA-2′,3′-diols with the breadth of proteinogenic amino acids in water 3–5 . Here we demonstrate that (biological) aminoacyl-thiols ( 1 ) react selectively with RNA diols over amine nucleophiles, promoting aminoacylation over adventitious (non-coded) peptide bond formation. Broad side-chain scope is demonstrated, including Ala, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser and Val, and Arg aminoacylation is enhanced by unprecedented side-chain nucleophilic catalysis. Duplex formation directs chemoselective 2′,3′-aminoacylation of RNA. We demonstrate that prebiotic nitriles, N -carboxyanhydrides and amino acid anhydrides, as well as biological aminoacyl-adenylates, all react with thiols (including coenzymes A and M) to selectively yield aminoacyl-thiols ( 1 ) in water. Finally, we demonstrate that the switch from thioester to thioacid activation inverts diol/amine selectivity, promoting peptide synthesis in excellent yield. Two-step, one-pot, chemically controlled formation of peptidyl-RNA is observed in water at neutral pH. Our results indicate an important role for thiol cofactors in RNA aminoacylation before the evolution of proteinaceous synthetase enzymes.",

          "abstract": "Microorganisms have driven Earth’s sulfur cycle since the emergence of life 1–6 , yet the sulfur-cycling capacities of microorganisms and their integration with other element cycles remain incompletely understood. One such uncharacterized metabolism is the coupling of sulfide oxidation with iron( iii ) oxide reduction, a ubiquitous environmental process hitherto considered to be strictly abiotic 7,8 . Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of sulfur metabolism across prokaryotes, and reveal bacteria that are capable of oxidizing sulfide using extracellular solid phase iron( iii ). Based on a phylogenetic framework of over hundred genes involved in dissimilatory transformation of sulfur compounds, we recorded sulfur-cycling capacity in most bacterial and archaeal phyla. Metabolic reconstructions predicted co-occurrence of sulfur compound oxidation and iron( iii ) oxide respiration in diverse members of 37 prokaryotic phyla. Physiological and transcriptomic evidence demonstrated that a cultivated representative, Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus , grows autotrophically by oxidizing dissolved sulfide or iron monosulfide (FeS) to sulfate with ferrihydrite as an extracellular iron( iii ) electron acceptor. The biological process outpaced the abiotic process at environmentally relevant sulfide concentrations. These findings expand the known diversity of sulfur-cycling microorganisms and unveil a biological mechanism that links sulfur and iron cycling in anoxic environments, thus highlighting the fundamental role of microorganisms in global element cycles.",

          "abstract": "Terrestrial plant communities show great variation in their annual rhythms of growth, or seasonal phenology 1,2 . The geographical patterns resulting from this variation, known as land surface phenology (LSP) 3 , contain valuable information for the study of ecosystem function 4,5 , plant ecophysiology 6–8 , landscape ecology 9,10 and evolutionary biogeography 11–13 . Yet globally consistent LSP mapping has been hampered by methods that struggle to represent the full range of seasonal phenologies occurring across terrestrial biomes 14 , especially the subtle and complex phenologies of many arid and tropical ecosystems 1,15,16 . Here, using a data-driven analysis of satellite imagery to map LSP worldwide, we provide insights into Earth’s phenological diversity, documenting both intercontinental convergence between similar climates and regional heterogeneity associated with topoclimate, ecohydrology and vegetation structure. We then map spatial phenological asynchrony and the modes of asynchronous seasonality that control it, identifying hotspots of asynchrony in tropical mountains and Mediterranean climate regions and reporting evidence for the hypothesis that climatically similar sites exhibit greater phenological asynchrony within the tropics. Finally, we find that our global LSP map predicts complex geographical discontinuities in flowering phenology, genetic divergence and even harvest seasonality across a range of taxa, establishing remote sensing as a crucial tool for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of allochrony by allopatry.",

          "abstract": "Many chirality-sensitive light–matter interactions are governed by chiral electron dynamics. Therefore, the development of advanced technologies making use of chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and controlling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond timescales. Such endeavours have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized circularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been overcome 1,2 . Here we introduce chiroptical spectroscopy with attosecond pulses and demonstrate attosecond coherent control over photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) 3,4 , as well as the measurement of chiral asymmetries in the forward–backward and angle-resolved photoionization delays of chiral molecules. We show that co-rotating attosecond and near-infrared (IR) pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign compared with single-photon ionization. We demonstrate that chiral photoionization delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of photoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring 3D momentum resolution. We measure forward–backward chiral-sensitive delays of up to 60 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionization delays of up to 240 as, which include an asymmetry of about 60 as originating from chirality in the continuum–continuum transitions. Attosecond chiroptical spectroscopy opens the door to quantitatively understanding and controlling the dynamics of chiral molecules on the electronic timescale.",

This raises questions about the universality of such hierarchical structures. Here we examined the large-scale functional organization for vision in one of the closest living relatives to primates, the tree shrew. We performed Neuropixels recordings 3,4 across many cortical and thalamic areas spanning the tree shrew ventral visual system while presenting a large battery of visual stimuli in awake tree shrews. We found that receptive field size, response latency and selectivity for naturalistic textures, compared with spectrally matched noise 5 , all increased moving anteriorly along the tree shrew visual pathway, consistent with a primate-like hierarchical organization 6,7 . However, tree shrew area V2 already harboured a high-level representation of complex objects. First, V2 encoded a complete representation of a high-level object space 8 . Second, V2 activity supported the most accurate object decoding and reconstruction among all tree shrew visual areas. In fact, object decoding accuracy from tree shrew V2 was comparable to that in macaque posterior IT and substantially higher than that in macaque V2. Finally, starting in V2, we found strongly face-selective cells resembling those reported in macaque inferotemporal cortex 9 . Overall, these findings show how core computational principles of visual form processing found in primates are conserved, yet hierarchically compressed, in a small but highly visual mammal.",

Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.",

          "abstract": "The forthcoming sixth-generation and beyond wireless networks are poised to operate across an expansive frequency range—from microwave, millimetre wave to terahertz bands—to support ubiquitous connectivity in diverse application scenarios 1–3 . This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management 4 . However, existing electrical or photonic-assisted solutions face a lot of challenges in meeting this demand because of the limited bandwidths of the devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of system architectures 5 . Here we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless system. Leveraging the Pockels effect and scalability of the TFLN platform, we achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including baseband modulation, broadband wireless–photonic conversion and reconfigurable carrier and local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high-frequency stability and consistent coherence. Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we realize full-link wireless communication across nine consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a crucial ability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum environments. Our proposed system represents a marked step towards future full-spectrum and omni-scenario wireless networks.",

          "abstract": "Solution-processed semiconductor lasers promise lightweight, wearable and scalable optoelectronic applications. Among the gain media for solution-processed lasers, metal halide perovskites stand out as an exceptional class because of their ability to achieve wavelength-adjustable, low-threshold lasing under optical pumping 1–8 . Despite the progress in this field, electrically driven lasing from perovskite semiconductors remains a critical challenge. Here we demonstrate an electrically driven perovskite laser, constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED (PeLED) sub-unit. Under pulsed electrical excitation, the dual-cavity perovskite device shows a minimum lasing threshold of 92 A cm −2 (average threshold: 129 A cm −2 , at about 22 °C, in air), which is an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art electrically driven organic lasers 9,10 . Key to this demonstration is the integrated dual-cavity device architecture, which allows the microcavity PeLED sub-unit to deliver directional emission into the single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit (at a coupling efficiency of about 82.7%) to establish the lasing action. An operational half-life ( T 50 ) of 1.8 h (6.4 × 10 4 voltage pulses at 10 Hz) is achieved, outperforming the stability of electrically pumped organic lasers 9,10 . The dual-cavity perovskite laser can be rapidly modulated at a bandwidth of 36.2 MHz, indicating its potential for data transmission and computational applications.",

          "abstract": "Large urban gullies cause damage in many tropical cities across the Global South 1,2 . They can result from inappropriate urban planning and insufficient infrastructure to safely store and evacuate rainfall in environments that are already highly sensitive to soil erosion 1,3,4 . Although they can cause large destruction and societal impacts such as population displacement 1,2,5 , the magnitude of this geo-hydrological hazard remains poorly documented and understood 6,7 . Here we provide an assessment of the extent and impact of urban gullies at the scale of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Through mapping, we identify 2,922 urban gullies across 26 cities. By combining their formation and growth rates with population density data 8 , we estimate that around 118,600 people (uncertainty range: ± 44,400 people) have been displaced by urban gullies over the period 2004–2023. We find that average displacement rates increased from about 4,650 persons yr −1 (pre-2020) to about 12,200 persons yr −1 (post-2020). Between 2010 and 2023, the number of people living in the potential expansion zone of urban gullies doubled from 1.6 (±0.6) to 3.2 (±1.3) million, with more likely to be exposed due to urban sprawl 9,10 and climate change 11 . We suggest that there is a need for tools and strategies to prevent and mitigate this hazard.",

          "abstract": "The use of complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAIM) is highly prevalent among autistic individuals, with up to 90% reporting having used CAIM at least once in their lifetime. However, the evidence base for the effects of CAIM for autism remains uncertain. Here, to fill this gap, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism across the lifespan and developed a web platform to disseminate the generated results. Five databases were searched (up to 31 December 2023) for systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism. Independent pairs of investigators identified eligible papers and extracted relevant data. Included meta-analyses were reestimated using a consistent statistical approach, and their methodological quality was assessed with AMSTAR-2. The certainty of evidence generated by each meta-analysis was appraised using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework. This process led to the identification of 53 meta-analytic reports, enabling us to conduct 248 meta-analyses exploring the effects of 19 CAIMs in autism. We found no high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of any CAIM for core or associated symptoms of autism. Although several CAIMs showed promising results, they were supported by very low-quality evidence. The safety of CAIMs has rarely been evaluated, making it a crucial area for future research. To support evidence-based consideration of CAIM interventions for autism, we developed an interactive platform that facilitates access to and interpretation of the present results ( https://ebiact-database.com ).",

          "authors": "Ralph Lawton",
          "abstract": "Exposure to infectious disease in early life may have long-term ramifications for health and lifespan. However, reducing pathogen exposure may not be uniformly beneficial. The rise of modern sanitation and reduction of infectious diseases has been implicated in increasing levels of allergy and immune dysregulation: termed, the “hygiene hypothesis.” This study leverages quasi-experimental variation from combining precampaign hookworm exposure with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission’s deworming campaign in the early 20th century to rigorously examine the impacts of childhood hookworm exposure on adult lifespan and morbidity. Findings show deworming before age five leads to 2.5 additional months of life in a large sample of adult death records. Further, decreasing hookworm exposure is related to improvements in biomarkers for inflammation and skin-tested allergies, in contrast to predictions of the “hygiene hypothesis.” Placebo tests using health outcomes that should not be affected by deworming do not show similar patterns. Overall, childhood deworming leads to improvements in morbidity and lifespan decades later.",

          "abstract": "Social media are often said to exacerbate polarization by platforming hostility between groups. However, positive social emotions like ingroup solidarity may also drive social media engagement, particularly after major threats such as military invasions or terror attacks. In this preregistered study, we examine the socioemotional drivers of engagement following group threats in the context of the US 2024 presidential campaign trail, where both major political parties faced crises in July of 2024. We test how ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility predicted social media users’ engagement with 62,118 posts by 484 US partisan accounts before and after the first Trump assassination attempt (July 13) and Biden’s re-election campaign suspension (July 21). We find that, while outgroup hostility is typically the dominant predictor of engagement, interactions with ingroup solidarity surged among Republicans after the Trump shooting and among Democrats after Biden’s withdrawal. We show that negativity toward other groups is not always key to going viral. Rather, positive ingroup emotions appear to play a leading role in times of crisis.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation often requires individuals to balance personal risk with mutual gain. The Stag Hunt game provides a well-established paradigm for studying such decision-making. Prior research suggested that verbal communication about the game correlated with participants finding the optimal coordinated solution, but these studies either did not manipulate communication directly or informed participants of the payoff structure in advance. This study examined whether communication improves cooperative decision-making among college students under conditions in which the payoff structure had to be inferred through repeated play. A total of 127 same-sex dyads ( M age = 22.8 y, 51.2% female) played 40 rounds of an online Stag Hunt game, with dyads randomly assigned to either a no communication or communication condition. Participants were not informed about the game’s payoff structure in advance and had to infer it during play. Results showed that coordination on the payoff-dominant outcome (Stag–Stag) increased across trials, but only when communication was possible. No significant sex differences were observed. These findings highlight the central role of communication in fostering cooperation, particularly in environments in which information must be jointly discovered. This is an important consideration for developing and interpreting future research. Moreover, subsequent research should explore how the content, timing, and relevance of communication shape cooperative outcomes over time.",

          "authors": "Valentina Canessa-Pollard, Andrey Anikin, David Reby",
          "abstract": "For over 5,000 y, chanting has been practiced across many Western and Eastern traditions. However, there is hardly any empirical research on 1) whether chants from across the globe share common acoustic properties, 2) whether these acoustic features make them distinct from other human vocalizations, and 3) the extent to which they may positively impact listeners’ well-being. Here, we collected 242 chants belonging to seven distinct traditions and associated with a wide range of language families, and compared them acoustically to a large corpus of song (n = 126) and speech (n = 616) samples from across 14 linguistic and 12 geographical regions. We show that, irrespective of language and geographical origin, chants share distinctive acoustic traits, namely relatively flat and slow-changing intonation and steady, unbroken voicing in a comfortable, rather low pitch range with a prevalence of mid-central vowels. Thus, chants are produced in a relaxed vocal tract configuration with minimal articulation. Additionally, playback experiments involving original chants (with a participant pool of 61 listeners), resynthesized chants (with 114 listeners), and fully synthetic chants (with 80 listeners) demonstrate that these acoustic characteristics enhance listeners’ perceived sensations of relaxation. Specifically, relatively flat and slow-changing intonation, combined with vowel production in a relatively relaxed vocal tract configuration, resulted in higher overall relaxation ratings. Together these results hint at a specific function of chants’ acoustic commonalities: the enhancement of well-being through relaxation.",

          "abstract": "How societies remember the dead can reveal what people value in life. We analyzed 38 million obituaries from the United States to examine how personal values are encoded in individual and collective legacies. Using Schwartz’s theory of basic human values, we found that tradition and benevolence dominated legacy reflections, while values like power and stimulation appeared less frequently. Major cultural events—the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—were systematically linked to changes in legacy reflections about personal values, with security declining after 9/11, achievement declining after the financial crisis, and benevolence declining for years after COVID-19 began and, to date, not yet returning to baseline. Gender and age of the deceased were also linked to differences in legacy: Men were remembered more for achievement , power , and conformity , while women were remembered more for benevolence and hedonism . Older people were remembered more for tradition and conformity than younger people. These patterns shifted dynamically across the lifespan, with obituaries for men showing more age-related variation than legacies for women. Our findings reveal how obituaries serve as psychological and cultural time capsules, preserving not just individual legacies, but also indicating what US society values collectively regarding a life well lived.",

          "authors": "Patrik Michaelsen, Aksel Sundström, Sverker C. Jagers",
          "abstract": "Rapid global expansion of protected areas is critical for safeguarding biodiversity but depends on political action for successful implementation. Following widespread ratification of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, an unprecedented increase in area-based conservation is required to reach its target of conserving 30% of land, waters, and seas by 2030. These expansions prompt difficult trade-offs between conservation, social, and economic interests. A key factor in securing legitimacy and practical feasibility for expansion regimes is understanding what factors determine public support for them. Using survey and experimental data, we show that in eight countries across five continents, public opinion is 1) strongly in favor of the “30-by-30”-target and 2) highly consistent regarding policy priorities for the design of international- and domestic-level expansion regimes. We find that for international-level policy regimes, support increases with protection responsibilities equally split between countries, rich countries bearing higher costs, more countries actively cooperating, and placement trade not allowed. For domestic-level policy regimes, support generally increases when nature values are prioritized over social or economic values and, in many countries, decreases when costs are borne by a general tax increase, parks are managed by private companies, and when access to parks is restricted. Together, these results demonstrate how protected area expansion policies can be shaped to facilitate reaching 30% protected areas by 2030.",

We discuss how this provides a step toward a nonstandard method of inferring (deciphering) the motivations behind the human behaviors.

          "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A proteases (IgAPs) are a diverse group of enzymes secreted from bacteria that inhabit human mucosal tissues. These enzymes have convergently evolved to cleave human immunoglobulin A as a means of modulating and evading host immunity. Only two of three known IgAP families have been biochemically characterized beyond their initial discovery. Here, we show using solution-scattering, steady-state kinetic, and crystallographic approaches that the protease from Thomasclavelia ramosa , representing the uncharacterized third family, has a truly modular and minimizable protein architecture. This analysis also revealed a unique metal-associated domain that likely functions as a molecular spacer and generated a working hypothesis detailing the structural mechanism behind the enzyme’s high substrate specificity. Our work provides an in-depth biochemical account of this IgAP family, paving the way for advancing clinically relevant IgAP-related research and our understanding of IgAPs as a whole.",

          "abstract": "Glucose metabolism impacts the innate immune response against viral infection. However, the key enzymes or the natural products and mechanisms involved are not well elucidated. Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection.",

          "abstract": "Street art murals are increasingly recognized as valuable contemporary artworks, often attaining significant artistic, historical, and social importance. As these murals become integral parts of cultural heritage, finding efficient strategies for their conservation is crucial. However, their typical large surface areas, heterogeneous materials, and high variability in exposure to environmental and pollution factors pose significant challenges in establishing appropriate analytical strategies to obtain the necessary information. This study proposes a multiscale and multitechnique noninvasive approach to investigate and monitor street art murals in situ. By combining portable point techniques—such as external reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy—with visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging, the mural’s composition across a square meter surface could be analyzed. Additionally, multispectral imaging mounted on a drone provided a global reconstruction and characterization of the overall mural. This method was complemented by microdestructive laboratory analyses of selected samples, using pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry, to further investigate selected samples and support noninvasive results. The approach was applied to the iconic mural “Musica Popolare” (2017) by Orticanoodles in Milan, Italy, revealing detailed information about its pigments, binders, fillers, and degradation. The findings demonstrate the potential of this integrated methodology for the effective material identification, conservation assessment, and short-and long-term monitoring of urban heritage.",

          "abstract": "Soil microbial diversity is crucial to sustaining ecosystem productivity and improving carbon sequestration. Global temperature continues to rise, but how climate warming affects microbial diversity and its capacity to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) remains uncertain. Here, by conducting a global meta-analysis with 251 paired observations from 102 studies, we showed that, on average, warming reduced bacterial and fungal diversity (measured by richness and Shannon index) by 16.0 and 19.7%, respectively, and SOC by 18.1%. The negative responses of both soil bacterial and fungal diversity to warming became more pronounced with increasing warming magnitude, experimental duration, and decreasing soil nitrogen availability. Under the worst-case climate warming scenario (2010 to 2070, 3.4 increase in °C), soil bacterial diversity and fungal diversity are projected to reduce by 56% and 81%, respectively, over 60 y. Importantly, in addition to the direct impact of warming on SOC, warming-induced declines in microbial diversity also contributed to SOC losses. We highlight that prolonged warming could substantially reduce soil microbial diversity and decrease SOC sequestration, accelerating future warming and underscoring the urgent need for decisive actions to mitigate global climate change.",

The condition was reported to be familial, consistent with a genetic element. This hypothesis, however, has never been tested. Using an erythrocyte FAD-dependent glutathione reductase activity assay, we identified individuals with flavin-deficient erythrocytes (FDE) in Ferrara, Italy (23% of 150 individuals screened), and in Huye, Rwanda (13% of 169 individuals). None of the individuals with FDE had a dietary riboflavin deficiency. Importantly, FDE from individuals in Ferrara, as well as erythrocytes depleted of flavins in vitro by riboflavin starvation, inhibited the intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum . We provide evidence that these erythrocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress, potentially explaining their inhibitory effect on parasite proliferation. Genetic analysis identified mutations in the FAD synthase gene of three individuals with FDE from Huye, consistent with a potential genetic basis.",

We show how the ϵ = d − 2 expansion and the 1 / d expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent y depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension.

Recently, a method to measure the rates of individual mutations was applied to a narrow region in the human hemoglobin subunit beta ( HBB ) gene containing the site of the hemoglobin S (HbS) mutation as well as to a paralogous hemoglobin subunit delta ( HBD ) region, in sperm samples from sub-Saharan African and northern European donors [Melamed et al ., Genome Res. 32 , 488–498 (2022)]. The HbS mutation, which protects against malaria while causing sickle-cell anemia in homozygotes, originated de novo significantly more frequently in the HBB gene in Africans compared to the other three test cases combined (the European HBB gene and the European and African HBD gene). Here, we apply this approach to the human apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene containing the site of the G1 1024A→G mutation, which protects against African sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense while causing a substantially increased risk of chronic kidney disease in homozygotes. We find that the 1024A→G mutation is the mutation of highest de novo origination rate and deviates most from the genome-wide average rate for its type (A→G) compared to all other observable mutations in the region and that it originates de novo significantly more frequently in Africans than in Europeans—i.e., in the population where it is of adaptive significance. The results are unexpected given the notion that the probability of a specific mutational event is independent of its value to the organism and underscore the importance of studying mutation rates at the individual-mutation resolution.",

We demonstrate that the VFs produced by amoeba-infecting viruses have liquid-like properties and identify a conserved molecular grammar governing viral factory scaffold protein: charge-patterned intrinsically disordered regions that drive phase separation independently of sequence homology. This grammar predicts functional scaffold proteins across the 15 viral families, revealing evolutionary constraints invisible to sequence or structural analysis. Strikingly, VFs exhibit subcompartmentalization analogous to nuclei, segregating transcription and mRNA processing (inner condensates) from replication (interphase zones) and translation (host cytoplasm). Our work establishes phase separation as a fundamental organizational principle bridging extreme genomic diversity, explaining how biological complexity emerges without gene conservation. This grammar is likely also conserved in non-amoeba-infecting members of the phylum and thus may represent a primordial solution for organelle-like organization, with broad implications for antiviral targeting.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have several nucleotide second messengers, most of which act as global regulators to control a wide range of bacterial physiological processes. Studies usually focus on a single second messenger, and the mechanisms and physiological significance of the cross-regulation between different nucleotide second messengers are often unclear. Here, we show that Shewanella putrefaciens can form biofilms in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media. While both are controlled by c-di-GMP, the regulatory models differ. Under low nutrient conditions, cross-regulation of cAMP-CRP and c-di-GMP occurs at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, thereby controlling biofilm development. During the early stages of biofilm development, cAMP-CRP directly promotes the transcription of a PDE gene, lrbR , by LrbA. Additionally, cAMP-CRP recruits LrbR to BpfD to suppress early biofilm formation via LrbR-dependent local degradation of c-di-GMP. Finally, as intracellular LrbR levels decrease, cAMP-CRP-BpfD enables a rapid shift to biofilm development and supports biofilm maintenance. Under high nutrient conditions, this cross-regulation does not occur, resulting in a positive correlation between global c-di-GMP levels and biofilm biomass. The identification of distinct modes of biofilm regulation in different nutrients will provide a theoretical basis for future targeted control of biofilm formation in different nutrient environments.",

          "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)–related lesions contain types with benign outcomes and those with a risk of progression to cancer. We addressed the role of immune surveillance in 76 cervical biopsies (normal = 23, HPV+ benign = 16, HPV+ precancer = 37) by studying the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and the expression of the immune modulators PDL1, ICOSL, and miR-155 and compared the data to 101 cervical squamous cell carcinomas. In the normal cervix, ICOSL expression was restricted to the endocervical epithelia whereas neither miR-155 nor PDL1 were detected. MiR-155 was up-regulated in both the benign (88%) and precancerous (92%) HPV squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and colocalized to cells in the upper part of the lesion that is the area with productive viral infection. Both PDL1 (95%) and ICOSL (89%) were only evident in the precancerous SIL and each localized to squamous cells in the basal aspect that lacked replicating virus. In both microinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell cancer miR-155 expression remained high (83%) as did PDL1 expression (80%) but ICOSL detection was reduced to 17%. Infiltration by CD8+ T cells was intense in the invasive lesions and these cells were mostly inactive as determined by the lack of granzyme B colocalization. It is concluded that miR-155 expression is a marker of HPV infection in both benign and precancerous lesions, whereas the approximately 10% of the latter lesions that progress to cancer gain PDL1 and lose ICOSL expression, which are important factors in avoiding immune surveillance.",

Activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) is the only type I receptor among the seven TGF-β type I receptors that interacts with both activin and BMP ligands. With BMPs, ALK2 acts as a signaling receptor to activate small mothers against decapentaplegic 1 (SMAD1)/5/8 signaling. Alternatively, with activins, such as Activin A (ActA), ALK2 forms nonsignaling complexes that negatively regulate ALK2 and ActA signaling. To gain insight into how ALK2 interacts with two distinct classes of ligands, we resolved the cryoelectron microscopy structure of ALK2 in complex with the type II receptor, ActRIIB, and the ligand, BMP6, in parallel with the corresponding structure with ALK3 for direct comparison. These structures demonstrate that ALK2 and ALK3 utilize different mechanisms to interact with BMP6 at the wrist interface, with ALK2 relying on BMP6 glycosylation and ALK3 relying on a salt bridge. Modeling of ALK2:ActA reveals that binding relies on ActA’s fingertip region, mirroring the interaction of ActA with its other receptor, ALK4. Our results demonstrate that ALK2 is a “hybrid” receptor that incorporates features of BMP type I receptors such as ALK3 at the wrist interface and an activin type I receptor such as ALK4 at the fingertip.",

The scarcity of verified Denisovan fossils makes it challenging to study their anatomy, and how well they were adapted to their environment. We previously developed a genetic phenotyping approach to gain insight into Denisovan anatomy by detecting gene regulatory changes that likely altered Denisovan skeletal morphology. Here, we scan the Middle Pleistocene fossil record for crania matching the predicted Denisovan morphology and might therefore be related to Denisovans. We developed quantitative measures to assess both the proportion and extent of matches. These analyses revealed that the East Asian specimens of Harbin and Dali show an exceptionally high concordance with the Denisovan profile, surpassing all other examined Middle Pleistocene hominin specimens, including Neanderthals. Specifically, 15 out of 18 of Dali ’s features and 16 out of 18 of Harbin ’s matched Denisovan predictions. These findings are robust to overall skull size and to correlations between phenotypes. We also found that Kabwe 1 shows a strong affinity to the Denisovan–Neanderthal clade and might be placed near its root.

          "abstract": "The fast-paced improvements in mortality in high-income countries since the early 1900s have led to a sustained increase in life expectancy. However, whether this linear trend will continue or life expectancy gains will decelerate in the near future remains unclear. To answer this question, we apply multiple established and recently developed mortality forecasting methods to estimate cohort life expectancy for individuals born between 1939 and 2000 in 23 high-income countries. Across all forecasting methods, our results robustly and consistently indicate a deceleration in cohort life expectancy. The previously observed pace of improvement, 0.46 y per cohort, declines by 37% to 52%, depending on the method used. Robustness checks suggest that these findings are unlikely to be solely due to downward bias in cohort life expectancy forecasts. Furthermore, an age-decomposition analysis indicates that this deceleration is primarily driven by a slower pace of mortality improvement at very young ages. Over half of the total deceleration is attributable to mortality trends under age 5, while more than two-thirds is explained by mortality trends under age 20. This pattern had already emerged in the observed data for the cohorts included in our analysis. Thus, even if these estimates turned out to be overly pessimistic, it is unlikely that the deceleration will reverse in the near future.",

          "abstract": "Global demand for wood products is increasing forest harvest. One understudied consequence of logging is that it accelerates mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to aquatic ecosystems where it is more easily rereleased to the atmosphere. Here, we tested how logging changed DOM in headwaters of hardwood-dominated catchments in northern Ontario, Canada. We applied a before-after-control-impact experiment across four catchments for 3 y and measured DOM monthly during ice-free seasons. DOM concentration in streams from logged catchments quadrupled, on average, only for the first 2 mo postharvest, but resulting changes to the molecular composition of DOM persisted for at least 2 y. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DOM composition within logged streams became more available for microbial use and chemically diverse than in controls, with novel highly unsaturated polyphenols, carboxylic-rich alicyclic, and nitrogen-containing formulae. The molecular composition of stream DOM measured fortnightly postharvest was most similar to the DOM composition of surrounding soils, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity. Alongside carbon being more likely to be released into the atmosphere, we estimate that selective logging increased the total flux of dissolved organic carbon in streams by 6.4% of the carbon extracted as timber. Although these estimates are short-lived, they should affect the millions of hectares that are logged annually. Carbon accounting of forestry, including as a natural climate solution, must now consider the transport and fate of DOM from land into water.",

          "abstract": "It is crucial for both animal evolution and engineering to optimize the relative size of structures. Animal wings are no exception, every structural design having its limits in terms of achievable size and performance. For instance, many microinsects have bristled wings, which are more efficient at small scales than the membranous wings common in larger insects. However, the limitations and the optimal characteristics of bristled wings remain largely underinvestigated. We collected morphological and kinematic data on a variety of beetles ranging between 0.3 and 5 mm in wing length. This was followed by a theoretical analysis to explain from the mechanical standpoint the morphological traits and allometric scalings observed in the data. We derived functional dependencies for parameters such as the number of bristles, bristle length and diameter, size of the wing blade, etc., from considerations of wing inertia minimization under the aerodynamic and structural stiffness constraints. The solution of the optimization problem reveals scaling relationships aligning with empirical trends, which suggests that the reduction of wing membrane during miniaturization can be explained by mechanical optimality. Thus, scaling of the number of bristles and the average gap width between bristles follows directly from the aerodynamic condition of maintaining low permeability, while the bristle diameter and length are determined mainly by the structural stiffness requirement. Similar mechanical arguments are likely applicable to other miniature animals that propel through fluids.",

Here, we revisit the concept of directed communities as a mapping between sending and receiving communities. This translates into a definition that we term bimodularity. Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the Caenorhabditis elegans , for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems.

The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO 2 -laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a nonlinear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam’s soap films (≠1 for CO 2 /air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.",

They have garnered great interest in synthetic biology applications given the abundance of uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, progress has been hindered by the limited availability of genetic tools for manipulating these bacteria. Several representative CRISPR-Cas systems have been established in Streptomyces to streamline experimental workflows and improve editing efficiency. Nevertheless, their broader applicability has been constrained by issues such as nuclease activity-related cytotoxicity and the large size of effector proteins. To address these challenges, we present Streptomyces -compatible TnpB-assisted genome editing (STAGE), a genetic toolkit based on ISDra2 TnpB, which is approximately one-third the size of Cas9 and enables precise, site-specific gene editing. We demonstrated that STAGE introduces genetic mutations with high efficiency and minimal off-target effects in two industrially important Streptomyces strains. Building on this platform, we developed STAGE-cBEST and STAGE-McBEST, enabling single and multiplexed C·G-to-T·A base editing, respectively, with editing efficiencies exceeding 75%. To further enhance performance, we engineered the ISDra2 TnpB system using an AI-assisted protein engineering framework, resulting in two variants that achieve nearly 100% genome editing efficiency. Additionally, through sequence homology analysis, we identified a TnpB ortholog from the same biological origin of ISDra2 TnpB, which also functions effectively as a gene editing tool. Our study establishes STAGE as a highly precise, programmable, and versatile genome editing platform for Streptomyces , paving the way for advanced genetic manipulation and synthetic biology applications in these industrially important bacteria.",

The nanobubbles, when exposed to FUS, induce a highly localized and reversible opening of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) with significantly enhanced precision (up to fourfolds compared to microbubbles, as measured by the precision loss metric). Repeated multitarget FUS-NB precisely delivers macromolecular human-derived anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) into the small brain region within a 2-h half-life window per opening. Fluorescence images confirm HuMAb retention in the brain parenchyma for at least 10 d postadministration. With this approach, we targeted the lateral habenula, a small but effective brain target for antidepressant treatments, and significantly alleviated depression-like symptoms at least 2 wk in a mouse model (tail suspension test/forced swim test: P &lt; 0.01/0.05). Moreover, minimal red blood cell extravasation (0.9‱ affected area) was observed in the treated region after multiple FUS treatments, indicating the safety and tolerability of FUS-nanobubble-mediated BBB opening.

GCPs undergo high proliferation in the postnatal cerebellum under Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) activation, but the type of DNA lesions that require the function of the BRCA2 to prevent tumorigenesis remains unknown. To identify such lesions, we assessed both GCP neurodevelopment and tumor formation using a mouse model with deletion of exons three and four of Brca2 in the central nervous system, coupled with global Trp53 loss. Brca2 Δex3-4 ;Trp53 −/− animals developed SHH subgroup medulloblastomas with complete penetrance. Whole-genome sequencing of the tumors identified structural variants with breakpoints enriched in areas overlapping putative G-quadruplexes (G4s). Brca2 -deficient GCPs exhibited decreased replication speed in the presence of the G4-stabilizer pyridostatin. Pif1 helicase, which resolves G4s during replication, was highly upregulated in tumors, and Pif1 knockout in primary medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in increased genome instability upon pyridostatin treatment. These data suggest that G4s may represent sites prone to replication stalling in highly proliferative GCPs and without BRCA2, G4s become a source of genome instability. Tumor cells upregulate G4-resolving helicases to facilitate rapid proliferation through G4s highlighting PIF1 helicase as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of BRCA2-deficient medulloblastomas.",

          "abstract": "The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving ∼ 10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we reexamined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification, and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) aerosols exacerbate air pollution and climate warming, but their climatic impacts and sources are poorly constrained by bottom–up emission inventories (EIs). China’s Clean Air Action (CAA), which was launched in 2013, provides an excellent opportunity for investigating interannual variations in source contributions and validate the accuracy of EIs. Here, we present an 11-y (2008–2018) record of the BC concentration and its source-diagnostic radiocarbon ( 14 C) and stable carbon isotope ( 13 C) signatures at a receptor site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, South China. The results revealed that the implementation of the CAA (2014–2018) led to a 41% reduction in the BC concentration compared with that in the preaction period (2008–2013). There is a large and systemic discrepancy over the whole period in the contribution of biomass burning to BC in South China between predictions from technology-based EIs (4 to 9%) and these source-diagnostic dual-isotopic fingerprints of actual ambient aerosols (21 to 32%). Observational constraints by source-diagnostic δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope measurements revealed that the reduction in biomass burning contributed 22% to the decrease in BC associated with the CAA, whereas predictions from EIs assigned a much smaller fraction. These results emphasize the need for observation-based source diagnostics of changing BC emission sources. Detailed source apportionment using independent δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope methodology is crucial for refining air pollution control strategies and improving the accuracy of models used for assessing the air quality and climate effects of BC in China and elsewhere.",

Here, we systematically mapped the ligand specificities of selected extracytoplasmic sensory domains from twenty members of the human gut microbiota, with a primary focus on the abundant and physiologically important class of Clostridia. Twenty-five metabolites from different chemical classes—including amino acids, nucleobase derivatives, amines, indole, and carboxylates—were identified as specific ligands for fifteen sensory domains from nine bacterial species, which represent all three major functional classes of transmembrane receptors: chemotaxis receptors, histidine kinases, and enzymatic sensors. We have further characterized the specificity and evolution of ligand binding to Cache superfamily sensors specific for lactate, dicarboxylic acids, and for uracil and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Structural and biochemical analysis of the dCache sensor of uracil and SCFAs revealed that its two different ligand types bind at distinct sensory modules. Overall, combining experimental identification with computational analyses, we were able to assign ligands to approximately half of the Cache-type chemotaxis receptors found in the eleven gut commensal genomes from our set, with carboxylic acids representing the largest ligand class. Among these, the most commonly found ligand specificities were for lactate and formate, indicating a particular importance of these metabolites in the human gut microbiota and consistent with their observed growth-promoting effects on selected bacterial commensals.",

We found that most class 3 mAbs, especially those not blocking receptor-binding domain-ACE2 binding, including VIR-7831, were substantially underestimated in cell-line-based assays.

Collectively, the robust organoid culture system and biologically relevant expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 make nasal organoids present a correlate of in vivo protection of neutralizing mAbs exclusively.

Recent studies identified excessive glutamate accumulation as a key Aβ-dependent determinant of hyperactivity. The cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal silence depend on both Aβ and tau protein pathologies, with an unknown role of Aβ. Here, by using single-cell-initiated rabies virus (RV) tracing in mouse models of β-amyloidosis, we demonstrate that the presynaptic connectivity of silent, but not that of hyperactive, neurons is severely disrupted. Furthermore, silent neurons display a major spine loss and strongly suppressed synaptic activity. Thus, we suggest that synaptic decoupling is an Aβ-dependent cellular mechanism underlying progressive neuronal silencing and a critical factor for the cognitive impairments encountered in AD.",

That perinatally produced Tregs persist for a protracted period in peripheral lymphoid organs has been well documented, as has their superior ability to protect the organism from many autoimmune diseases. However, their contribution to pools of nonlymphoid-tissue Tregs and their homeostatic functions therein have been little studied. We show that perinatal Tregs preferentially derive from a CD25 + Foxp3 − thymocyte progenitor; that they seed and persist to varying degrees in every nonlymphoid tissue examined; and that transient depletion of perinatally generated Tregs in adults, but not in neonates, is followed by poor reconstitution of Treg numbers and phenotypes in epididymal visceral-adipose tissue (eVAT) and the skin but not in several lymphoid and other nonlymphoid tissues. Potential clinical implications of such a deficiency are highlighted by findings on mice subjected to weight cycling: Imposing a low-fat–high-fat–low-fat diet regimen in adult, but not juvenile, mice results in an impoverished eVAT, but not spleen, Treg compartment, accompanied by normal weight gain and glucose tolerance but profound insulin resistance. These findings point to a layered immune system, the different layers exerting specialized, nonredundant functions.",

          "abstract": "Life thrives due to its remarkable ability to create complex structures through the self-assembly of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. Achieving such complex assemblies with the same level of fidelity, reproducibility, and advanced functionality in synthetic systems, however, has remained a grand challenge. One outstanding problem is the presence of parasitic products and long-lived intermediate states that slow the reaction process and limit the yield of the final product. Biology overcomes this challenge by proofreading to recognize and disassemble parasitic products. Such local checks, however, are currently difficult to implement in available self-assembly platforms. Here, we overcome this challenge by implementing a proofreading mechanism in a self-assembly platform. Specifically, we design intermediate states that strongly couple to an external force but a final product that is decoupled and thus highly stable to external driving, such that application of external forces selectively dissociates parasitic products. To implement this idea, we introduce lithographically patterned magnetic dipoles and an applied magnetic field to drive an assembly process similar to thermal self-assembly, but with additional controls. By applying patterns of magnetic driving that selectively destabilize parasitic states, we effectively implement a proofreading strategy to enable high-yield, time-efficient self-assembly. This realization of a general proofreading mechanism bridges the gap between artificial and biological self-assembly, paving the way for advanced self-assembled materials, with applications in next generation responsive materials, biomimetic devices, and microscale machines.",

          "abstract": "Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a Ca 2+ -sensing protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The depletion of ER Ca 2+ stores induces a large conformational transition of the cytosolic STIM1 C-terminus, initiated by the dimerization of the transmembrane (TM) domain. We use the AI-guided transition path sampling algorithm aimmd to extensively sample the dimerization of STIM1-TM helices in an ER-mimicking lipid bilayer. In nearly 0.5 ms of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without bias potentials, we harvest over 170 transition paths, each about 1.2 μs long on average. We find that STIM1 dimerizes into three distinct and coexisting configurations, which reconciles conflicting results from earlier crosslinking studies. The dominant X-shaped bound state centers around contacts supported by the SxxxG TM interfacial motif. Mutating residues in this contact interface allows us to tune the STIM1-dimerization propensity in fluorescence experiments. From the trained model of the committor probability of dimerization, we identify the transition state ensemble for TM-helix dimerization. At the transition state, interhelical contacts in the luminal halves of the two monomers dominate, which likely enables the luminal Ca 2+ -sensing domain in STIM1 to condition the dimerization of the TM helices. Our work demonstrates the unique power of AI-guided simulations to sample rare and slow molecular transitions and to produce detailed atomistic insight into the mechanism of STIM1 TM-helix dimerization as a key step in ER Ca 2+ -sensing.",

          "abstract": "Progenitor cell dedifferentiation is important for stem cell maintenance during tissue repair and age-related stem cell decline. Here, we use the Drosophila ovary as a model to study the role of cytonemes in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling–directed germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and dedifferentiation of germ cells to GSCs. We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend longer cytonemes that are more polarized toward the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signaling. The presence of additional somatic cells in the niche is associated with a failure of germ cell dedifferentiation, consistent with the formation of a physical barrier to cytoneme–niche contact and outcompetition of germ cells for BMP. Using BMP beads in vitro, we show that these are sufficient to induce cytoneme-dependent contacts in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We demonstrate that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localized to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalization reduces the frequency, length, and directionality of cytonemes. During homeostasis, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalization impairs GSC fitness by reducing GSC BMP signaling and niche occupancy. Disrupting cytonemes by targeting Ena during dedifferentiation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate. Overall, our results provide evidence that cytonemes play a fundamental role in establishing polarized signaling and niche occupancy during stem cell maintenance and dedifferentiation.",

Although there is a well-established link between ENOD40 and nodulation, it is not fully clear by which mechanism ENOD40 functions in this process. Here, we show that a region harboring box2 can complement nodule formation in an ENOD40 knock-out mutant ( enod40-1-2/1 ). The sequence of box2 bears the characteristics of a miR169 target mimic. We show that the artificial target mimic MIM169defg can indeed complement the reduced capability of nodule formation in enod40-1-2/1 , and that box2 exhibits target mimic activity in a transient luciferase assay. In addition, the introduction of a miR169 -resistant form of MtNF-YA1 also elevates the capacity to form nodules in enod40-1-2/1. We conclude that ENOD40 effectuates nodule initiation by posttranscriptional upregulation of the miR169 target NF-YA1 , which encodes an essential transcription factor in this step of the nodulation process.",

LEABs enable the encapsulation of bioactive materials for long-term analysis with unique lasing characteristic fingerprints. The reactions within LEAB can interact with the most resonating light, enhancing detection sensitivity by over 100-fold compared to conventional WGM sensors.

Here, we demonstrate that CHP1 is a critical regulator of both GPAT3 and GPAT4, essential for their stability, enzymatic activity, and lipid droplet (LD) localization. Structural modeling and mutational analyses identified key hydrophobic interfaces mediating the CHP1–GPAT interaction, which are required for optimal GPAT activity and LD growth. Loss of CHP1 impairs LD expansion and disrupts the localization of GPAT3/4 and downstream enzymes in the TAG synthesis pathway, including 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). Mechanistically, CHP1 helps circumvent seipin-mediated restriction of late LD-targeting enzymes, facilitating their access to mature LDs. Together, our findings reveal CHP1 as a dual-function regulator that stabilizes and activates microsomal GPATs while enabling the coordinated recruitment of TAG biosynthetic enzymes to LDs. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating LD growth and glycerolipid metabolism, with broad implications for lipid homeostasis and metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "The plant immune system utilizes nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins to detect pathogen virulence factors (effectors) inside host cells and transduce recognition to rapid defense. In dicotyledenous plants, pathogen activated Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor-containing NLRs (TNLs) establish a signaling network of enhanced susceptibility 1 (EDS1)-family dimers with RPW8-type coiled-coil (CC R ) domain NLRs (RNLs) to stimulate transcriptional reprogramming leading to host cell death and pathogen restriction. Evidence suggests that TNL- and EDS1-activated RNLs function as oligomeric Ca 2+ permeable ion channels at the plasma membrane. However, the downstream processes for immunity execution are poorly understood. Here, we studied pathogen effector-triggered immunity conferred by Nicotiana benthamiana TNL (Roq1) which signals almost exclusively through the EDS1-senescence associated gene101 (SAG101)-N required gene 1 (NRG1) RNL module. We identify a pair of glutamate receptor–like Ca 2+ ion channels (GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b) which, unlike most other pathogen-induced GLRs, are highly up-regulated by the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module in the TNL immune response. We show that oligomeric NRG1 Ca 2+ channel activity is necessary for GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b induced expression. Consequently, GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b proteins contribute to NRG1 -dependent Ca 2+ accumulation in host cells, and to pathogen resistance and host cell death. We establish that GLR2.9a localizes mainly to the plasma membrane/cytoplasm whereas GLR2.9b accumulates preferentially at the nuclear envelope. The data show that transcriptionally up-regulated canonical Ca 2+ ion channels GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b are a functional output of the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module for TNL-triggered immunity.",

Mineral–organic interactions in frozen environments, such as soils and permafrost, are crucial for explaining the flux of soluble iron during melting events, yet the mechanisms remain misunderstood. This study elucidates the unique roles of freezing in the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles (α–FeOOH) by oxalate, a low molecular weight dicarboxylate, under acidic conditions. From time-resolved experiments conducted over 4 d, we demonstrate that soluble iron was released through reactions in minute volumes of liquid water trapped between ice micrograins. Freeze concentration of nanoparticles, oxalate, and protons into this liquid water drove oxalate- and proton-promoted dissolution reactions at temperatures as low as −30 °C. Remarkably, ice at −10 °C dissolved more iron than liquid water at 4 °C under high oxalate loadings, and even more than at 25 °C under low oxalate loadings. In contrast, high salinity subdued dissolution. Also, sequential freeze-thaw cycles enhanced dissolution by releasing unreacted oxalate that was previously locked in ice. By resolving the chemical controls on mineral dissolution in ice, this work can help explain how freeze-thaw events are supplying new fluxes of soluble iron to nature.",

We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.",

The hippocampus is implicated in mismatch detection, yet it is not known whether it signals mismatches with episodic memories or generalized knowledge. Across three functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiments, we show that the hippocampus selectively responds to mismatches with episodic memories of specific events. In contrast, schematic mismatches engage Semantic Control and Multiple Demand Networks, as well as subcortical regions linked to prediction error signaling. Episodic mismatches also recruit the Default Mode Network. These findings challenge accounts that propose the hippocampus is a domain-general mismatch detector. Instead, the findings support a more specialized role for the hippocampus in learning that is underpinned by its well-established importance in processing episodic memories.",

          "abstract": "The oxygenation history of Earth’s surface environments has had a profound influence on the ecology and evolution of metazoan life. It was traditionally thought that the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event enabled the origin of animals in marine environments, followed by their persistence in aerobic marine habitats ever since. However, recent studies of redox proxies (e.g., Fe, Mo, Ce, I) have suggested that low dissolved oxygen levels persisted in the deep ocean until the Late Devonian, when the first heavily wooded ligniophyte forests raised atmospheric O 2 to modern levels. Here, we present a Paleozoic redox proxy record based on selenium enrichments and isotope ratios in fine-grained siliciclastic sediments. Our data reveal transient oxygenation of bottom waters around the Ediacaran–Cambrian boundary, followed by predominantly anoxic deep-water conditions through the Early Devonian (419 to 393 Ma). In the Middle Devonian (393 to 382 Ma), our data document the onset of permanent deep-ocean oxygenation, coincident with the spread of woody biomass across terrestrial landscapes. This episode is concurrent with the ecological occupation and evolutionary radiation of large active invertebrate and vertebrate organisms in deeper oceanic infaunal and epifaunal habitats, suggesting that the burial of recalcitrant wood from the first forests sequestered organic carbon, increased deep marine oxygen levels, and was ultimately responsible for the “mid-Paleozoic marine revolution.”",

          "abstract": "Humans can implicitly learn about multistep sequential relationships between events in the environment from their statistical co-occurrence. Theoretical work has suggested that neural replay is a candidate mechanism that aids such learning. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to test whether replay is related to implicit learning of higher-order sequential relationships. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling of response times revealed that participants acquired multistep transition knowledge in a manner consistent with gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model. Yet, half of participants did not report being aware of any sequential task structure, and most participants failed to provide meaningful transition probability ratings in a posttask test. Analyses of temporal dynamics of multivariate fMRI patterns during brief 10 s pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task indicated backward sequential replay of multistep sequences in visual cortical areas. Variations in model parameters between participants that captured response time patterns related to strength of neural replay. No corresponding relations between replay and measures of explicit awareness were found. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.",

          "abstract": "Human learning embodies a striking duality: Sometimes, we can rapidly infer and compose logical rules, benefiting from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly conflicting behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems—one for rapid, rule-based inferences (e.g., in working memory) and another for slow, incremental adaptation (e.g., in long-term and procedural memory). It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of in-context learning (ICL)—the ability to flexibly infer the structure of a new task from a few examples. In contrast to standard in-weight learning (IWL), which is analogous to synaptic change, ICL is more naturally linked to activation-based dynamics thought to underlie working memory in humans. Here, we show that the interplay between ICL and IWL naturally ties together a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, including curriculum effects on category-learning tasks, compositionality, and a trade-off between flexibility and retention in brain and behavior. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering an integrative perspective on dual-process theories of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "Each year, billions of animals migrate across the globe on diverse spatial and temporal scales. Migration behavior thus plays a fundamental role in the life cycle and Darwinian fitness of many organisms. While the influence of migration on early-life survival and reproduction is well documented, its effects on senescence (aging) in advanced age remain largely unexplored. Using a unique 44-y ring-resighting dataset from a long-lived, partially migratory bird species, the Greater Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus roseus ), we demonstrate that migration plays a key role in shaping age-specific trajectories of mortality and reproduction. Resident flamingos exhibit higher early-life demographic performances, with lower baseline mortality than migrants, resulting in longer adult lifespan. Residents also have a higher probability of breeding than migrants, though their breeding success is similar. However, residents seem to pay for their early-life advantages in old age, experiencing accelerated actuarial and reproductive senescence compared to migrants. Overall, our study highlights the critical impact of migration on survival and reproduction throughout life, thereby illustrating the role played by behavioral decisions in the biology of aging in long-lived vertebrates.",

To explore the range of interactions between these two species, we utilized dual RNA-sequencing to transcriptionally profile both C. albicans and E. faecalis during coculture (compared with monoculture controls) under two conditions: 1) an in vitro setting that mimics certain features of the gut environment and 2) a gnotobiotic mouse gut model. RNA-seq analysis revealed a large number of gene expression changes induced by one species in the presence of the other. More specifically, both species highly upregulate citrate-metabolizing genes during coculture: C. albicans upregulates CIT1 (citrate synthase) which produces citrate, while E. faecalis upregulates its cit operon, which breaks down citrate. In vitro analysis showed directly that citrate cross-feeding (production of citrate by C. albicans and breakdown by E. faecalis) enhances growth of E. faecalis . A main byproduct of citrate metabolism in E. faecalis is formate, a short chain fatty acid toxic to fungi. Our RNA profiling revealed that C. albicans upregulates three formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) during coculture; we show that the FDH genes confer a growth advantage to C. albicans when E. faecalis (or simply formate) is present. These findings reveal a metabolically driven cycle between C. albicans and E. faecalis in the mouse gut and in vitro, where cross-feeding of citrate and detoxification of formate facilitates the growth of both species when they are cultured together.",

          "abstract": "Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 11) which encodes for the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Approximately 85% of NSML patients develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we show that SHP2 is recruited to tyrosyl phosphorylated protein-zero related (PZR) in NSML mice. This recruitment is required for the Iroquois homeobox (IRX) transcription factors 3 and 5 to suppress BMP10 which negatively regulates postnatal cardiac growth. The protein expression of IRX3 and IRX5 was elevated in hypertrophied NSML hearts. IRX3 and IRX5 upregulation was rescued in NSML mice harboring a knock-in mutation of PZR that fails to become tyrosyl phosphorylated and recruit SHP2. NSML mice treated with low-dose dasatinib also exhibited normalized IRX3 and IRX5 expression levels. Consistent with this, BMP10 expression levels were reduced in NSML mice and rescued in PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation-deficient and low-dose dasatinib-treated NSML mice. A crystal structure of the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bound to tyrosyl phosphorylated PZR reveals that recruitment constrains the open SHP2 conformation to facilitate cellular-Src (c-Src) binding. Disruption of c-Src binding to SHP2 abolished IRX activation and failure to suppress BMP10. Hence, NSML-associated SHP2 genetic variants disrupt IRX transcription factor signaling to BMP10, implicating this axis as a target for RASopathy-associated HCM.",

Here, we present complementary archaeobotanical and archaeological (stone tool) evidence for cereal foragers from Toda-1 Cave in the Surkhan Darya, dating to 9200 cal BP. We conclude that early Holocene foragers were processing grains along with nuts and fruits as far north as the rich river valleys of southern Uzbekistan. These data expand the known range that preagricultural cereal foragers covered in the early Holocene, adding to our understanding of the cultural processes that led to farming. Additionally, we present the earliest evidence for people interacting with the progenitors for pistachios and apples (or a close apple relative).

Here, we demonstrate that the loop-current phase breaks inversion symmetry in the presence of the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, leading to finite eMChA coefficient γ eM . In this mechanism, γ eM is proportional to the product of the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization, M orb 0 , and the lifetime of conduction electrons, τ . Therefore, γ eM is reversible by the magnetic fields, and it takes large value in kagome metals with τ v Fermi ≫ a 0 (=lattice constant). Surprisingly, the quantum metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by ∼100 times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals but also opens a path for exploring quantum metric–induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in various metals.",

          "abstract": "A remarkable example of symbiosis involves the pygmy seahorse ( Hippocampus bargibanti ). It lives obligatorily on gorgonian corals, mimicking their polyps with pink coloration and skin protuberances. Unique for seahorses, pygmy seahorses retain juvenile paedomorphic stunted snouts, resembling the coral’s polyps. We analyzed the tiny seahorse’s genome revealing the genomic bases of several adaptations to their mutualistic life including substantial reductions in conserved noncoding elements that are associated with genes in the vicinity of those CNEs that are known to play a role in growth and metamorphosis-related pathways. Comparative RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses during their ontogeny suggest that their stunted snout might result from craniofacial remodeling associated with hoxa2b defunctionalization. This is consistent also with findings from in situ hybridization and CRISPR experiments. Their immune system shows extremely low numbers of MHC genes and additional considerable losses of other immune-related genes. This is likely facilitated by the host coral’s antimicrobial metabolites and by the earlier evolution of male pregnancy that requires immunotolerance.",

          "abstract": "Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations—resembling human club and hillock cells—are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct PCa subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant PCa patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Temporal tracking of cells will precisely map disease-associated cellular transitions, and our technical framework facilitates such interrogations. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for PCa modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance.",

          "abstract": "Membranes that selectively enhance target solute permeation while rejecting competing species are essential for precision separations. This study introduces charge-patterned mosaic membranes (CMMs) that selectively transport divalent asymmetric salts by leveraging a net-neutral membrane–solution interface. This mechanism, dictated by the charge ratio of positive and negative domains on the membrane surface and the balance of cations and anions in the salt, is supported by analytical, numerical, and experimental results. Analytical solutions identified cationic domain coverages ( f + ) of 33%, 50%, and 66% as optimal for the selective transport of +2:−1 salts, +1:−1 salts, and +1:−2 salts, respectively, under conditions where the pattern size ( L ) is significantly larger than the Debye length. Numerical simulations and experiments using CMMs with alternating charged-stripes inkjet-printed onto nanostructure copolymer substrates confirmed these findings. By varying stripe widths to control f + , pressure-driven filtration experiments demonstrated selective enrichment of MgCl 2 and K 2 SO 4 at the predicted f + values, with deviations from these values leading to salt rejection. These results highlight the pivotal role of a net-neutral interface in enabling asymmetric salt enrichment. This study positions CMMs as a versatile platform for tuning ion selectivity, addressing challenges in resource recovery, water treatment, and precision separations.",

          "abstract": "Heparan sulfates are found in all animal tissues and have essential roles in living systems. This family of biomacromolecules modulates binding to calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) in low free energy reactions that influence biochemical processes from cell signaling and anticoagulant efficacy to biomineralization. Despite their ubiquity, the thermodynamic basis for how heparans and similarly functionalized biomolecules regulate Ca 2+ interactions is not yet established. Using heparosan (Control) and heparins with different positions of sulfate groups, we quantify how SO 3 − and COO − content and SO 3 − position modulate Ca 2+ binding by isothermal titration calorimetry. The free energy of all heparin-Ca 2+ interactions (Δ G rxn ) is dominated by entropic contributions due to favorable water release from polar, hydrophilic groups. Heparin with both sulfate esters ( O -SO 3 − ) and sulfamides ( N -SO 3 − ) has the strongest binding to Ca 2+ compared to heparosan and to heparin with only O -SO 3 − groups (~3X). By linking Ca 2+ binding thermodynamics to measurements of the interfacial energy for calcite (CaCO 3 ) crystallization onto polysaccharides, we show molecule-specific differences in nucleation rate can be explained by differences in water structuring during Ca 2+ interactions. A large entropic term (- T Δ S rxn ) upon Ca 2+ –polysaccharide binding correlates with high interfacial energy to CaCO 3 nucleation. Combining our measurements with literature values indicates many Ca 2+ –polysaccharide interactions have a shared thermodynamic signature. The resulting enthalpy–entropy compensation relationship suggests these interactions are generally dominated by water restructuring involving few conformational changes, distinct from Ca 2+ –protein binding. Our findings quantify the thermodynamic origins of heparin-specific interactions with Ca 2+ and demonstrate the contributions of solvation and functional group position during biomacromolecule-mediated ion regulation.",

We exploit cavitation to accumulate substantial energy in superheated liquids by suppressing its immediate release until reaching a stability limit. The energetic, unstable bubbles collapse violently, producing a burst of high power and force that initiates motion. Notably, a millimeter-scale device launched by cavitation can jump to a height of 1.5 meters—reaching a 12 meters per second (m/s) peak velocity, a 7.14 × 10 4 m/s 2 acceleration, and a 0.64% energy efficiency—and can also swim on water at 12 centimeters per second.

Their size and survival constrain Mars’ poorly known mantle rheology, indicating a high viscosity of 10 21.3 to 10 21.9 pascal-seconds and low temperature dependence, with an effective activation energy of 70 to 90 kilojoules per mole, suggesting a mantle deforming by dislocation creep.

Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality.

          "abstract": "Industrial chemicals and untreated sewage have polluted the Tijuana River for decades, recently causing &gt;1300 consecutive days of California beach closures. In summer 2024, wastewater flows surged to millions of gallons per day despite no rain, enhancing water-to-air transfer of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and other toxic gases at a turbulent hotspot. High wastewater flows and low winds led to nighttime H 2 S peaks, reaching 4500 parts per billion (ppb)—exceeding typical urban levels of &lt;1 ppb. H 2 S levels and community malodor reports were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient r = 0.92), validating long-dismissed community voices and highlighting an environmental injustice. This study demonstrates that poor water quality can substantially affect air quality—although rarely included in air quality models and health assessments—with far-reaching implications as polluted waterways increase globally.",

          "abstract": "Horsepower revolutionized human history through enhanced mobility, transport, and warfare. However, the suite of biological traits that reshaped horses during domestication remains unclear. We scanned an extensive horse genome time series for selection signatures at 266 markers associated with key traits. We detected a signature of positive selection at ZFPM1 —known to be a modulator of behavior in mice—occurring ~5000 years ago (ya), suggesting that taming was one of the earliest steps toward domestication of horses. Intensive selection at GSDMC began ~4750 ya with the domestication bottleneck, leading regulatory variants to high frequency by ~4150 ya. GSDMC genotypes are linked to body conformation in horses and to spinal anatomy, motor coordination, and muscular strength in mice. Our results suggest that selection on standing variation at GSDMC was crucial for the emergence of horses that could facilitate fast mobility in human societies ~4200 ya.",

We used a multiomics comparison of the transcriptomes of ciliated and unciliated embryonic cells to identify TFs up-regulated in ciliated cells. We also used conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells and found that the TFs SP5 and SP8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In embryos lacking Sp5 and Sp8 , primary and motile cilia were shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus. Moreover, expression of SP8 was sufficient to induce primary cilia in unciliated cells. This work will facilitate the study of cilia assembly using stem cell models and promote further understanding of human ciliopathies.",

However, global mitigation from forestation remains uncertain owing to varying estimates of carbon sequestration rates (notably in soil) and land availability. In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares). Achieving greater mitigation requires expanding dedicated forestation areas and strengthening commitments from nations with considerable but untapped potential.",

Here, we showed that tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR, a hypoxia-induced tDR derived from the 3′ end of tRNA-Asp-GTC, activated autophagic flux in kidney cells and its silencing blocked autophagic flux. Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy. This tDR-induced RNA autophagy pathway was activated during murine and human kidney diseases, suggesting clinical relevance. Thus, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR plays a role in regulating RNA autophagy, which helps to maintain homeostasis in kidney cells and protects against kidney injury.",

Here, we model the contribution of major lifecycle stages (upstream, midstream, downstream, and end-use) to air pollution and estimate the associated chronic health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities across the contiguous US in 2017. We estimate lifecycle annual burdens of 91,000 premature deaths attributable to fine particles (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and ozone, 10,350 PM 2.5 -attributable preterm births, 216,000 incidences of NO 2 -attributable childhood-onset asthma, and 1610 lifetime cancers attributable to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). Racial-ethnic minorities experience the greatest disparities in exposure and health burdens across almost all lifecycle stages. The greatest absolute disparities occur for Black and Asian populations from PM 2.5 and ozone, and the Asian population from NO 2 and HAPs. Relative inequities are most extreme from downstream activities, especially in Louisiana and Texas.",

Gastruloids, stem cell models of postimplantation mammalian development, provide a platform to address this question. Here, using quantitative live imaging and transcriptomic profiling, we show that physical parameters, particularly system size, affect morphogenetic timing and outcomes. Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain stable across a broad size range, illustrating the scaling of gene expression domains. In particular, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and shifts in gene expression patterns. Size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings position gastruloids as versatile models for dissecting spatiotemporal coordination in mammalian development and reveal how physical constraints can decouple gene expression programs from morphogenetic progression.",

          "abstract": "In the vertebrate brain, neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence is necessary for stemness maintenance. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the zebrafish adult telencephalon, we identified different molecular clusters of quiescent NSCs, interpreted to sign different quiescence depths. Here, we show that these clusters, when challenged in vivo with an inhibitor of Notch signaling, a major quiescence promoting pathway, unfold different behaviors. Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid up-regulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion. In contrast, an NSC cluster predicted to be in the deepest quiescence state resists Notch blockade, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nr2f1b mediates this resistance to activation in vivo. These results together link the molecular heterogeneity of quiescent NSCs with bona fide biological properties and their molecular regulators.",

Extending it to x-rays enables sub-angstrom spatial and zeptosecond temporal resolution, unlocking atomic-scale processes inaccessible to existing methods. Here, we demonstrate x-ray quantum interferometry using 17.5–kilo–electron volt ( λ = 70 picometers) photon pairs. Our approach introduces a phase measurement technique with exceptional noise resilience, mitigating the impact of mechanical instabilities, vibrations, and photonic noise—key challenges in x-ray interferometry. By generating and using entangled x-ray photons, we lay the foundation for next-generation techniques with unprecedented phase precision. This breakthrough carries far-reaching consequences for fundamental physics, high-resolution imaging, and spectroscopy, bringing to light quantum optical effects never before accessed in the x-ray regime.",

Here, we present a petrological and geochemical study of two types of young farside mare basalts, the ~2.8–billion year (Ga) low-Ti and ~2.9-Ga very-low-Ti basalts, collected during the Chang’e-6 mission. The results of our study show that these basalts have pyroxenitic sources and originate from a depth of ~60 to 80 kilometers and ~120 kilometers, respectively. The depth of their source that became progressively shallower over time, combined with thermal modeling results, suggests that magmatic underplating beneath the ilmenite-bearing cumulate (IBC) that escaped the mantle overturn phase could be a thermal driver for the young lunar magmatism. Global remote-sensing investigations further reveal different TiO 2 contents between young basalts from each side of the Moon, attributable to asymmetric composition and thickness of the IBC in the uppermost mantle.",

Unlike data-driven approaches, BayROM does not require training datasets, but instead, it uses probabilistic model-based reconstruction to facilitate fast high-resolution imaging.

Microbiota metabolite taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) binds to P2Y10 receptor on ILCs to initiate downstream Ca 2+ and RhoA signaling pathways. TDCA-P2Y10 engagement induces Zfp414 transcription to prime expression of CD69 and integrin αE on ILCs, leading to intestinal residency of ILCs. Moreover, decreased levels of TDCA or P2Y10 deficiency abrogates the intestinal residency of ILCs, resulting in severer intestinal inflammation.

In this study, we evaluated 57 synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) for antiviral activity in cellulo using pseudotyped virus particles (PVPs) from six high-risk viruses across three families: Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Four SCRs inhibited all tested PVPs, and their efficacy was confirmed against live viruses including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, NiV, and HeV. Notably, SCR005 and SCR007 , which exhibited minimal toxicity, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in a severe animal model with a single dose.

          "abstract": "The mechanisms that organisms allocate resources to sustain biological phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we use mobilized colistin resistance ( mcr-1 ), which modifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to confer colistin resistance, as a model to explore how bacteria reallocate resources to support mcr-1 –mediated resistance. We show that bacteria redirect resources from glycolysis, the pyruvate cycle, and LPS biosynthesis toward glycerophospholipid metabolism to produce phosphatidylethanolamine, the substrate for mcr-1 to modify LPS, while reducing LPS content to limit colistin binding. This reallocation down-regulates succinyl–coenzyme A (CoA) to diminish succinylation of proteins including triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), CpxR, and PdhR, thereby sustaining resistance. Exogenous succinate or α-ketoglutarate restores succinylation in a succinyl-CoA–dependent manner. Succinylation of TPI redirects metabolic flux to glycolysis and the pyruvate cycle, while succinylation of CpxR and PdhR up-regulates LPS biosynthesis, ultimately attenuating colistin resistance. Thus, we reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which bacteria regulate resource allocation through metabolism-driven posttranslational protein modification, offering strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.",

These intriguing molecules are rare instances of stable CO diborylation products that were made accessible by direct CO capture.

The cyclopentanone analog engages in stepwise one- and two-electron reduction processes to yield radical monoanion and dianion species while preserving the five-membered ring structure and the boron-boron bonds.

The BoNT/A–NTNH complex protects the toxin from adverse environment, while the complex consisting of HA proteins facilitates toxin absorption during oral intoxication. How these two independent modules assemble into the L-PTC remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the BoNT/A–NTNH–HA70 complex at ~2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals that the BoNT/A–NTNH complex is anchored into a concentric double β-barrel channel of trimeric HA70 through a short β-hairpin of NTNH (termed nLoop), resembling a nut-and-bolt attachment. We find that the nLoop of NTNH is strictly conserved across HA-containing BoNT complexes and that NTNH–HA70 binding is interchangeable among them.

A 2.5-Å cocrystal structure of the AMPK kinase domain with BAY-3827 revealed distinct features including a disulfide bridge between the αD helix Cys 106 and the activation loop residue Cys 174 . This bridge appears to stabilize the activation loop such that Asn 162 repositions the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif Phe 158 toward the C-terminal lobe, displacing His 137 and disrupting the regulatory spine, promoting an inactive kinase state. In hepatocytes, BAY-3827 blocked AMPK activator (MK-8722)–mediated phosphorylation of ACC1 and corresponding inhibition of lipogenesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that BAY-3827 down-regulated ~30% of MK-8722–stimulated AMPK-dependent genes.

However, global proteomics revealed that FB231 and MTK458 independently induce mild mitochondrial stress, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and activation of the integrated stress response, effects that result from PINK1/Parkin-independent off-target activities. We find that these compounds impair mitochondria by distinct mechanisms and synergistically decrease mitochondrial function and cell viability in combination with classical mitochondrial toxins. Our findings support a model whereby weak or “silent” mitochondrial toxins potentiate other mitochondrial stressors, enhancing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These insights highlight important considerations for therapeutic strategies targeting mitophagy activation in Parkinson’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic enzymes, critical for cellular homeostasis, are frequently co-opted in a disease-specific manner to drive cancer progression. Here, we identify aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), down-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers, as a pivotal metastasis suppressor correlating with improved colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Mechanistically, AKR1B10 activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by preventing redox-regulated nitration of its B56α subunit, preserving holoenzyme assembly and enabling c-Myc dephosphorylation at serine-62. Loss of AKR1B10 disrupts this pathway, stabilizing c-Myc, which drives integrin signaling and metastatic dissemination in CRC. We further demonstrate that lysine-125 of AKR1B10 is essential for its interaction with PP2A-Cα and B56α nitration, thereby attenuating CRC metastatic aggressiveness. Pharmacological restoration of PP2A activity effectively mitigates metastasis associated with AKR1B10 loss. In addition, c-Myc transcriptionally represses AKR1B10, establishing a feedback loop that sustains its down-regulation and enhances metastatic progression. This study uncovers an antimetastatic mechanism involving AKR1B10-mediated PP2A activation and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.",

Growing evidence suggests that functional heterogeneity exists within the naïve T cell pool, shaping lineage potential before antigen stimulation. Here, we identify a subpopulation of naïve CD8 T cells expressing death-associated protein-like 1 (Dapl1) that contains preprogrammed precursors biased toward memory differentiation. The differentiation of these precursors is independent of Dapl1 but relies on the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11b (Bcl11b), resulting in the generation of Dapl1 + central memory–like CD8 T cells after infection and stem-like memory cells in cancer. Dapl1 + naïve T cells originate among mature thymocytes and gradually appear in the periphery postnatally. Peripheral Dapl1 + and Dapl1 − populations show limited plasticity, supporting a thymic-imprinting model. These findings reveal a developmentally imprinted subset of naïve CD8 T cells committed to memory fate, uncovering an alternative pathway for memory T cell generation offering new avenues for therapeutic application.",

Toward the creation of biomaterials with both excellent biocompatibility and customizability, recombinant protein–based hydrogels have emerged as molecularly defined and user-programmable platforms that mimic the proteinaceous nature of the extracellular matrix. Here, we introduce PhoCoil, a dynamically tunable recombinant hydrogel formed from a single protein component with unique multistimuli responsiveness. Physical cross-linking through coiled-coil interactions promotes rapid shear-thinning and self-healing behavior, rendering the gel injectable, whereas an included photodegradable motif affords on-demand network dissolution via visible light. PhoCoil gel photodegradation can be spatiotemporally and lithographically controlled in a dose-dependent manner, through complex tissue, and without harm to encapsulated cells. We anticipate that PhoCoil will further enable applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

We integrate macronutrient regulation and metabolic flexibility to elucidate how wild orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii ) are buffered against natural fluctuations in nutritional resources. We found that these orangutans regulate protein and regularly switch between exogenous and endogenous nutritional substrates as preferred food resource availability declines. When total caloric, lipid, and carbohydrate intake declined during episodes of fruit scarcity, orangutans drew on fat and endogenous amino acids for energy. This strategy is beneficial only in the context of alternating periods of fruit scarcity and abundance.

In particular, USI’s limited ability to differentiate follicular neoplasms from benign nodules contributes to suboptimal biopsy decision-making. We propose a dual-modal imaging approach that combines multiparametric photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and USI to support smarter biopsy decisions. In 106 patients with 29 benign nodules, 45 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 32 follicular neoplasms, three PAI-derived parameters—the photoacoustic spectral gradient, oxygen saturation, and skewness of the oxygen saturation distribution—were combined using a support vector machine. Following USI-based American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, they were used to develop the ATA-Photoacoustic (ATAP) scoring system. The ATAP score achieved 97% sensitivity and 38% specificity in distinguishing nodules requiring FNAB. Our approach enabled better identification of benign nodules, reducing unnecessary FNAB in 11 of the 29 benign cases. This dual-modal strategy can assess thyroid nodules, effectively reducing unnecessary biopsies while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.",

Applied to primary samples from patients with acute leukemia, MMIL accurately separates leukemia from nonleukemia baseline cells, including rare minimal residual disease (MRD) cells; generalizes across tissues and treatment time points; and identifies biologically relevant features with accuracy approaching that of a hematopathologist.

Magnetic resonance imaging–based velocity measurements inside the printed model, which is perfused with a Newtonian fluid at two Reynolds numbers, revealed that the flow patterns are primarily influenced by the Reynolds number and the dilation of the arterial inlet.

The lower phase is enriched in free fatty acids and lead carboxylates, especially saturated species—both as free acids and metal soaps—prone to self-organization. As a result, the lower phase displays a pronounced lamellar organization with partial crystallization and exhibits viscoelastic and shear-thinning properties. In contrast, the unstructured upper phase behaves as a Newtonian fluid.

Typical photodynamic and photothermal effects were not responsible for the potent anticancer efficacy. Biophysical and photophysical experiments using vesicle models revealed that COEs can induce mechanical force likely by molecular conformation change within lipid membranes under light exposure, supporting the mechanotherapeutic mechanism by which COEs after excitation can physically disrupt cell membrane. Investigation of two other COEs with similar spectral properties but different backbone architectures revealed that their mechanotherapeutic efficacy is dependent on molecular topology.

To model CRLM, we induced liver metastasis in mice by transsplenically injecting MC38 cells. We found that patients with CRLM and mice undergoing major hepatectomy had better survival compared to those undergoing minor hepatectomy. Mechanistically, extensive hepatectomy activates hepatocellular YAP1 by regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor, altering glutamine metabolism–related gene expression and increasing liver glutamine consumption. This metabolic shift leads to glutamine scarcity in tumor cells, causing increased reactive oxygen species production, which promotes loss of YAP1 activity in tumor cells. Consequently, the production of the chemokine CXCL5 is suppressed, which inhibits myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration and enhancing the immunological function of CD8 + T cells.",

Here, we show that strong nearshore SSA production during high-wave periods greatly enhances downwind cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and aerosol mass concentrations. Strong shoreline wave breaking is widespread globally, and swell waves, which are decoupled from local winds, play a dominant role in many coastal regions. Therefore, extrapolating results based on coastal measurements to open oceans may significantly overestimate SSA concentration and its contribution to CCN and, by extension, the impact of SSA on clouds and climate. Additionally, the strong enhancement of coastal aerosol population by shoreline wave breaking and its environmental impact on coastal communities cannot be captured by current regional models, which do not parameterize nearshore SSA generation using wave energy or completely neglect it.",

Here, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to systematically identify such venues by analyzing website design, content, and publication metadata. Evaluated against extensive human-annotated datasets, our method achieves practical accuracy and uncovers previously overlooked indicators of journal legitimacy. By adjusting the decision threshold, our method can prioritize either comprehensive screening or precise, low-noise identification. At a balanced threshold, we flag over 1000 suspect journals, which collectively publish hundreds of thousands of articles, receive millions of citations, acknowledge funding from major agencies, and attract authors from developing countries. Error analysis reveals challenges involving discontinued titles, book series misclassified as journals, and small society outlets with limited online presence, which are issues addressable with improved data quality. Our findings demonstrate AI’s potential for scalable integrity checks, while also highlighting the need to pair automated triage with expert review.",

          "abstract": "Androgens act through androgen receptor (AR) to maintain muscle mass. Evidence suggests that this pathway is influenced by “the gene for speed,” ACTN3 (α-actinin-3). Given that one in five people lack α-actinin-3, it is possible that they may respond to androgens differently. Here, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency decreases AR in muscles of mice and humans (in males and females) and that AR positively correlates with α-actinin-3 expression in a dosage-dependent manner. α-Actinin-3 deficiency exacerbates gastrocnemius mass loss with androgen deprivation in male mice and stunts the muscle growth response to dihydrotestosterone in female mice at the onset of puberty. This is mediated by differential activation of pathways regulating amino acid metabolism, intracellular transport, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, MAPK, and calcineurin signaling, likely driven by seven key genes that are both androgen sensitive and α-actinin-3–dependent in expression. Our results highlight a role for ACTN3 as a regulator of muscle mass and a genetic modifier of androgen action in skeletal muscle.",

The scaling also applies to different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder.

Integrating constraints from their spatiotemporal evolution with heat transfer estimates and geological observations, we propose that while the largest events might be related to volatiles degassed from magma, most events are generated by the implosion of bubbles formed from the vaporization of entrapped seawater by hot erupted lava. Similar events have been detected at other seamounts and slow to fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, although eruptions at &gt;3000-meter depth have proportionately fewer events because seawater vaporization is inhibited. Therefore, these impulsive seafloor events can be leveraged to remotely characterize eruption dynamics in most submarine volcanic settings.",

Moreover, we show that osteocytes are responsive to cholinergic signaling, influencing bone mechanoadaptation. We report sexually dimorphic patterns in bone structure and mechanobiology based on nAChR function. In females, osteocyte mechanosensitivity was decreased at small force magnitudes and tissue level deficits were recovered with anabolic loading. In males, osteocyte mechanosensitivity was increased in some groups and anabolic loading had very little effect on overall tissue architecture.

Disruption of this mutualism by poaching exacerbates seed predation by herbivores and was associated with a 68% reduction in small sapling recruitment. This threat to the survival of a valuable and iconic tree species raises concerns about the far-reaching consequences of forest elephant extermination.",

BioFuse comprises a series of fuse-like tandem DNA cassettes that can be sequentially edited by the adenine base editors (ABEs), resulting in either the activation or deactivation of a downstream gene once the editing is complete. Adjusting the number of DNA cassettes incorporated allows precise programming of BioFuse’s reaction time. Applying BioFuse to control carotenoid biosynthesis genes decouples lycopene production from growth in E. coli and increases lycopene yield without external inducers. Using BioFuse in a bacterial autolysis system enables timely and efficient protein release.

Both complexes rely on a conserved sequence motif of their substrate GTPases for the catalytic mechanism, while secondary interactions allow discrimination between targets. We also find that dimeric Mon1-Ccz1 from fungi and the metazoan homologs with the additional third subunit RMC1/Bulli bind membranes through electrostatic interactions via distinct interfaces. Protein-lipid interaction studies and functional characterization in flies reveal an essential function of RMC1/Bulli as mediator of GEF complex membrane recruitment.

Prevailing motor control models emphasize Bayesian inference, where prior information is integrated to optimally estimate the current state. An alternative framework, efficient coding, proposes that the system dynamically reallocates encoding resources on the basis of environmental statistics—a mechanism highlighted in perception while underappreciated in motor control. We compared these frameworks in reaching movements, focusing on how the system leverages short-term priors in unpredictable environments. Unexpectedly, sequential effects aligned with the efficient coding model and contradicted Bayesian models. Specifically, current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements, and movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar. We further explored the temporal dynamics of these effects and showed that sequential bias is enhanced by intrinsic motor variability. These findings, accompanied by model comparisons, further support efficient coding in motor planning.",

We find rapid replacement of dominant species, with local species richness inversely related to dominance. Marked turnover in fish community structure and composition is also present, with different functional groups favored under changing environmental conditions.

By culturing doughnut-shape organoids on 3D-printed devices within standard 96-well plates, we generate hCO-MPSs with reduced necrosis, minimized hypoxia, and improved viability. Using these models, we found that monocytes from AD patients exhibit increased infiltration ability, decreased amyloid-β clearance capacity, and stronger inflammatory response than monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, we observed that AD monocytes induce pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the marked increase in IL1B and CCL3 expression underscores their pivotal role in AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.

Diverse ANME/SRB consortia exhibited high dry conductance close to electrogenic biofilms. This conductance diminished upon exposure to heat or oxygen but was preserved following paraformaldehyde fixation, indicating a biomolecular origin for this electric charge transfer.

We find that while cell volume and mass exhibit complex behavior after osmotic shock, CMD follows a straightforward monotonic recovery over 48 hours. This recovery is cell cycle independent and depends on coordinated adjustment of protein synthesis and volume growth rates. Unexpectedly, the protein synthesis rate decreases when CMD increases. We observe that nucleoplasm-cytoplasm transport is CMD dependent, which contributes to negative regulatory feedback on CMD.

          "authors": "Guandong Cui, Zhi Xu, Shuchen Zhang, Alessandro Siria, Ming Ma",
          "abstract": "Carbon nanomaterials exhibit unique electrokinetic phenomena due to rapid ion transport within the Debye layer, which have been exploited for energy conversion, membrane technology, and liquid lubrication. The electronic properties of solids have been found to influence water permeation and proton transport; however, their effect on ion transport has not been observed. Here, we present an experimental investigation of ion transport in individual double-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of both semiconducting and metallic nature. Systematic measurements show that conductance, streaming current, and osmotic current are larger in semiconducting tubes than in metallic ones. Together with a complete theoretical framework, we found that such behavior is caused by the smaller liquid-solid friction with the same surface charge density for the semiconducting system. As fast ion transport is the key element for efficient energy conversion, in CNTs, the thermoelectric conversion efficiency with ions is two orders of magnitude larger than with electrons, showing the supremacy of ions to recover the waste heat.",

          "abstract": "Macrophage-to-foam cell transition is an integral part of atherosclerotic plaque progression. Particularly, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a driving factor in foam cell formation, altering macrophage function and metabolism. The aim of our research was to understand the impact of oxLDL-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species on macrophage-to-foam cell differentiation. We demonstrate that macrophage oxLDL-derived superoxide modulates mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, facilitating foam cell formation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial superoxide drives signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation, leading to reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In parallel, mitochondrial superoxide enhances chromatin accessibility at STAT5 target genes, establishing a distinct STAT5 signaling signature in foam cells ex vivo and in human and mouse plaques in vivo. Inhibition of STAT5 during atherosclerosis progression prevents the differentiation of macrophages to mature Trem2 hi Gpnmb hi foam cells. Collectively, our data describe an oxLDL-induced, mitochondrial superoxide–dependent STAT5 activation that leads to a self-amplifying feedback loop of reciprocal mitochondrial superoxide production and STAT5 activation, ultimately driving macrophage-to-foam cell transition.",

          "abstract": "Prefibrillar structures of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide are central to cytotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease. Time-resolved imaging of oligomers has enabled quantification of their extension. A snapshot of these prefibrillar assemblies has been characterized using a combination of cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET), cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A highly consistent diameter for all curvilinear protofibrils and oligomers of 2.8 nanometers suggests that these assemblies are structural extensions from the smaller oligomers. In situ AFM confirms that spherical oligomers template and extend over time into curvilinear protofibrils. Furthermore, their basic cross section suggests that amyloid fibrils might be initiated by the lateral binding of two curvilinear protofibrils. Cryo-ET/EM single particles also reveal ring-shaped annular assemblies. These have a central internal channel, ~1.4 nanometers in diameter, which is capable of traversing lipid membranes. Large conductance recorded using patch-clamp electrophysiology matches the internal diameter of the Aβ annular architecture.",

          "abstract": "Craniosynostosis is a common birth defect affecting 1 of the 2200 live births causing severe skull and cognitive defects, due to premature cranial suture fusion. The current surgical treatments require invasive calvaria vault remodeling and cranial bone resection in the baby. We demonstrate that inhibition of miR-200a in PMIS–miR-200a mice results in coronal suture fusion (craniosynostosis). Therefore, we use overexpression of miR-200a to prevent suture fusion in Twist1 mutant mice, a well-known model for craniosynostosis. We developed a PEGylated-peptide nanoparticle system to deliver plasmid DNA expressing miR-200a directly to the sutures of postnatal day 4 (P4) Twist1 mutant mice before suture fusion. Injection of the miR-200a nanoparticles under the scalp before suture fusion at P7 to P10 inhibited suture fusion. Treatments increased Gli1- and Six2-positive suture stem cells and the thickness of the periosteum layer. The treated Twist1 +/− mice increased body weight and were alert and active. We demonstrate an effective noninvasive gene therapy treatment for craniosynostosis.",

          "abstract": "Writing magnetic bits through spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching is promising for fast and efficient magnetic random-access memory devices. While SOT switching of out-of-plane (OOP) magnetized states requires lateral symmetry breaking, in-plane (IP) magnetized states suffer from low storage density. Here, we demonstrate a field-free switching scheme using a 5-nanometer europium iron garnet film grown with a (110) orientation that shows a spin reorientation transition from OOP to IP above room temperature. This scheme combines the benefits of high-density storage in the OOP states at room temperature and the efficient field-free SOT switching in the IP states at elevated temperatures. While conventional switching of OOP bits faces the dilemma that high OOP anisotropy is required to improve bit stability and low OOP anisotropy is required to lower switching current density, this scheme disentangles this interdependence, allowing for low switching currents to be possible without sacrificing the bit stability, offering opportunities for future memory devices.",

A critical component of this approach is the photoresponsive material that has sufficient drug-loading capacity and can be actuated by near-infrared (NIR) light with considerable penetration depths. Here, we establish a photoactivated drug delivery platform based on the π-stacked organic framework (πOF), which demonstrates an intrinsic NIR absorption and superior photothermal effect. πOF not only has considerable loading capacity for a variety of drugs but also prompts the inducible burst release of loaded cargoes under NIR irradiation with notable increase of the release rate. Based on these features, πOF is used to effectively modulate the delivery of resiquimod (R848) and simultaneously induce photothermal effect by NIR irradiation. In 4T1-bearing mouse models, the photoactivated release of R848 can significantly potentiate treatment efficacy.",

          "authors": "Matthew J Baltz",
          "abstract": "The reorganization of global supply chains and productive capabilities is arguably one the most significant indicators that the economic integration of previous decades and the neoliberal institutional arrangements that once supported them are weakening. A key driver of these trends has been the elevation of “national security” concerns, spurred by COVID-related lockdowns, war in Ukraine, and geopolitical rivalry between the USA and China. Yet the perspectives of military elites and planners who make war and preparation for war their vocation remain an understudied subject among scholars of neoliberalism and global governance. This article addresses this gap by focusing on how American militarists understood the threats and opportunities posed by greater economic integration during the previous era of neoliberalism’s ascendency. It identifies a noteworthy divergence in thinking and discusses how this divergence offers new insights on the significance of recent initiatives to achieve “supply chain security” in a post-neoliberal era.",

          "authors": "Nick O’Donovan",
          "abstract": "In the 1990s, policymakers in affluent democracies viewed the ‘knowledge economy’ as a solution to economic stagnation and social exclusion. Yet, in many of these countries, the period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2020s has instead been associated with lacklustre levels of growth and widening inequalities. This article explores four potential explanations for growth trends during this period: skill-biased technological change, intellectual property monopoly, divergent national growth models, and automation. Using data from fourteen advanced democracies, it examines national-level transitions to and through the knowledge economy between 1995 and 2019, assessing how differences in inequality and prosperity trajectories link to differences in the knowledge-intensive industries in which different countries have specialized. It highlights how the inequality impacts of particular sectoral specialisms have changed as knowledge economies mature, with important implications for understanding the trajectories of different national growth models, and the possible effects of new technologies such as artificial intelligence on labour and capital in the near future.",
