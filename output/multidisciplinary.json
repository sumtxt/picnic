          "abstract": "Bacteriophages are the most abundant entities on earth and exhibit vast genetic and phenotypic diversity. Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterization of genes that act at the phage–host interface. So far, this has been restricted to few model phage–host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, to overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers to silence genes of DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage ΦKZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognized proteins that are essential for phage propagation and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is the RNase H-like protein ΦKZ155 (also known as Nlp2), which acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. This non-genetic antisense oligomer-based gene silencing method promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help to elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage–host pairs, and offers potential for optimizing phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.",

          "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive type of lung cancer, characterized by rapid proliferation, early metastatic spread, frequent early relapse and a high mortality rate 1–3 . Recent evidence has suggested that innervation has an important role in the development and progression of several types of cancer 4,5 . Cancer-to-neuron synapses have been reported in gliomas 6,7 , but whether peripheral tumours can form such structures is unknown. Here we show that SCLC cells can form functional synapses and receive synaptic transmission. Using in vivo insertional mutagenesis screening in conjunction with cross-species genomic and transcriptomic validation, we identified neuronal, synaptic and glutamatergic signalling gene sets in mouse and human SCLC. Further experiments revealed the ability of SCLC cells to form synaptic structures with neurons in vitro and in vivo. Electrophysiology and optogenetic experiments confirmed that cancer cells can receive NMDA receptor- and GABA A receptor-mediated synaptic inputs. Fitting with a potential oncogenic role of neuron–SCLC interactions, we showed that SCLC cells derive a proliferation advantage when co-cultured with vagal sensory or cortical neurons. Moreover, inhibition of glutamate signalling had therapeutic efficacy in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC. Therefore, following malignant transformation, SCLC cells seem to hijack synaptic signalling to promote tumour growth, thereby exposing a new route for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter—they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems 1–5 , which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. 6 , on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.",

          "abstract": "Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery 1 . Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size–luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call ‘globular-cluster-like dwarfs’ (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2–4 ), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.",

          "authors": "Saranne J. Mitchell, Carlos Pardo-Pastor, Anastassia Tchoumakova, Thomas A. Zangle, Jody Rosenblatt",
          "abstract": "Epithelial cells work collectively to provide a protective barrier, yet they turn over rapidly through cell division and death. If the numbers of dividing and dying cells do not match, the barrier can vanish, or tumours can form. Mechanical forces through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo1 link both of the processes; stretch promotes cell division, whereas crowding triggers live cells to extrude and then die 1,2 . However, it was not clear what selects a given crowded cell for extrusion. Here we show that the crowded cells with the least energy and membrane potential are selected for extrusion. Crowding triggers sodium (Na + ) entry through the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC), which depolarizes cells. While those with sufficient energy repolarize, those with limited ATP remain depolarized, which, in turn, triggers water egress through the voltage-gated potassium (K + ) channels K v 1.1 and K v 1.2 and the chloride (Cl − ) channel SWELL1. Transient water loss causes cell shrinkage, amplifying crowding to activate crowding-induced live cell extrusion. Thus, our findings suggest that ENaC acts as a tension sensor that probes for cells with the least energy to extrude and die, possibly damping inadvertent crowding activation of Piezo1 in background cells. We reveal crowding-sensing mechanisms upstream of Piezo1 that highlight water regulation and ion channels as key regulators of epithelial cell turnover.",

Despite substantial advances in the field, the transport mechanisms of NCLX remain unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NCLX, revealing its architecture, assembly, major conformational states and a previously undescribed mechanism for alternating access. Functional analyses further reveal an unexpected transport function of NCLX as a H + /Ca 2+ exchanger, rather than as a Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger as widely believed 1 .

          "abstract": "The Lepidosauria is the most species-rich group of land-dwelling vertebrates. The group includes around 12,000 species of lizards and snakes (Squamata) and one species of Rhynchocephalia, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus from New Zealand 1 . Squamates owe their success to their generally small size, but also to their highly mobile skull that enables them to manipulate large prey. These key features of lizard and snake skulls are not seen in Sphenodon , which makes it important to understand the nature of their common ancestor. Lepidosaurs originated in the Triassic 252–201 million years ago, but confusion has arisen because of incomplete fossils, many of which are generalized lepidosauromorphs, neither squamates nor rhynchocephalians 2–5 . Here we report a reasonably complete skull and skeleton of a definitive rhynchocephalian from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Helsby Sandstone Formation of Devon, UK that is around 3–7 million years older than the oldest currently known lepidosaur. The new species shows, as predicted, a non-mobile skull but an open lower temporal bar and no large palatine teeth, and it seems to have been a specialized feeder on insects. This specimen helps us understand the initial diversification of Lepidosauria as part of the Triassic Revolution, when modern-style terrestrial ecosystems emerged.",

          "abstract": "Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events 1–4 . Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events 5,6 . Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework 1 . Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes 7,8 .",

          "abstract": "The transmission of communicable diseases in human populations is known to be modulated by behavioral patterns. However, detailed characterizations of how population-level behaviors change over time during multiple disease outbreaks and spatial resolutions are still not widely available. We used data from 431,211 survey responses collected in the United States, between April 2020 and June 2022, to provide a description of how human behaviors fluctuated during the first 2 y of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that at the national and state levels, people’s adherence to recommendations to avoid contact with others (a preventive behavior) was highest early in the pandemic but gradually—and linearly—decreased over time. Importantly, during periods of intense COVID-19 mortality, adaption to preventive behaviors increased—despite the overall temporal decrease. These spatial-temporal characterizations help improve our understanding of the bidirectional feedback loop between outbreak severity and human behavior. Our findings should benefit both computational modeling teams developing methodologies to predict the dynamics of future epidemics and policymakers designing strategies to mitigate the effects of future disease outbreaks.",

          "abstract": "We analyzed the patterns of transmission in the 2022 clade IIb mpox epidemic as it unfolded in the European population of men who have sex with men (MSM). We developed an agent-based model that simulates sexual pair formation, incorporating both brief and longer-term sexual relationships. The model implements survey data on the sexual behavior of MSM and accounts for the highly heterogeneous nature of the sexual contact network within this community. When simulating the mpox epidemic, the model reproduces the reported numbers of sexual partners of mpox-infected individuals. We find that infection-derived immunity had little impact on ending the European outbreak. Instead, we suggest that the marked decrease in serial interval observed across the epidemic reflects a substantial increase in self-isolating behavior among infected persons and that this is sufficient to explain the early control of the epidemic. Our work highlights the critical interplay between relationship dynamics and adaptive behaviors in shaping mpox epidemic patterns and achieving control in 2022. Despite continued propagation of clade IIb mpox, the European MSM population remains protected by immunity, primarily vaccine-induced.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Linos, Jessica Lasky-Fink, Vincent Dorie, Jesse Rothstein",
          "abstract": "Behaviorally informed “nudges” are widely used in government outreach but are often seen as too modest to address poverty at scale. In four field experiments over 2 y ( n = 542,804 low-income households), we test whether more proactive communication, varying message framing, and more precise targeting can boost take-up of tax-based benefits in California above and beyond traditional light-touch approaches. Our interventions focused on extremely vulnerable households, most with no prior-year earnings, who were at risk of missing out on two crucial benefits: the 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit and pandemic-relief Economic Impact Payments. Light-touch outreach consistently increased take-up of these benefits by 0.14 to 2 percentage points—a 150% to over 500% relative increase—regardless of message, sample, timing, or modality. These light-touch approaches resulted in over $4 million disbursed, with a highly cost-effective return of $50 to over $8,000 per $1 spent. However, higher-touch proactive outreach, varying messaging, and more precise targeting yielded minimal additional benefits, with proactive outreach even showing negative returns. These findings demonstrate that light-touch outreach can effectively shift behavior among very vulnerable households in contexts with reduced compliance burdens, but also underscore an urgent need to rethink the role of higher-touch strategies in closing take-up gaps in social safety net programs.",

          "abstract": "Major depressive disorder affects millions worldwide, yet current treatments require prolonged administration. In contrast, ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects by blocking spontaneous N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling, which lifts the suppression of protein synthesis and triggers homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Here, we identify a parallel signaling pathway involving metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) that promotes rapid antidepressant-like effects. We show that enhancing the endogenous mGluR5 signaling produces synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus and triggers the rapid antidepressant effect, similar to ketamine. Importantly, blocking mGluR5 prevents ketamine’s effects, revealing a synergy between the two pathways. At the cellular level, spontaneous calcium transients mediated by mGluR5 activate the phosphatase calcineurin and promote eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) dephosphorylation, increasing BDNF translation to drive synaptic plasticity. We show that quantal glutamate release activates two spatially segregated Ca 2+ signals—NMDAR- and mGluR5-driven—which exert opposing effects on protein synthesis. Together, these findings highlight mGluR5 as a promising therapeutic target for rapid antidepressant action, harnessing the complex nanoscale organization of synapses.",

          "authors": "Anthony Arrowood, Jackson Frazier, Matteo Ciccotti, Gabriel E. Sanoja",
          "abstract": "Many soft, tough materials have emerged in recent years, paving the way for advances in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and flexible displays. However, understanding the interfacial fracture behavior of these materials remains a significant challenge, owing to the difficulty of quantifying the respective contributions from viscoelasticity and damage to energy dissipation ahead of cracks. This work aims to address this challenge by labeling a series of polymer networks with fluorogenic mechanophores, subjecting them to T-peel tests at various rates and temperatures, and quantifying their force-induced damage using a confocal microscope. The results challenge longstanding assumptions underlying linear viscoelastic fracture theories, revealing a complex interplay between viscoelasticity and damage governed by the Weissenberg number, W i . Specifically, they suggest a molecular picture in which the interfacial toughness increases due to polymer chain breakage and enlarged strains when W i &lt; 0.3 , and significant chain friction and network stiffening when W i &gt; 0.3 , with the damage being negligible in the limits of W i ≪ 0.3 and W i ≫ 0.3 either due to insufficient strains at the peel front or because of excessive stress at weak interfacial bonds. Overall, these results illustrate the molecular and mesoscopic mechanisms underpinning interfacial fracture, aiding to refine current viscoelastic fracture theories and accelerating the development of advanced polymer networks for increasingly demanding applications.",

          "abstract": "We model the effect of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) adoption on U.S. power system generator capacity investment, operations, and emissions through 2050 by estimating power systems outcomes under a range of EV adoption trajectory scenarios. Our EV adoption scenarios are informed by 1) an Energy Information Administration scenario with no policy intervention, 2) EV growth expected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 3) a Biden Administration 50% EV sales target by 2030, 4) the Environmental Protection Agency’s projections under vehicle emissions standards, and 5) the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to Net Zero by 2050. We find across these scenarios that increasing EV adoption induces investment in new wind, solar, storage, and natural gas capacity, affecting power generation mix and emissions. The net effect of increasing EV adoption beyond our IRA base case is to increase power sector emissions by about 5 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year in 2026 (comparable to displaced gasoline vehicle combustion emissions), but this effect rapidly drops to annual levels below 1 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year by 2032 and continues below this level through 2050. Consequential effects of EV adoption vary regionally, with most regions primarily increasing wind or solar capacity and some regions primarily increasing natural gas capacity, even in 2050. Our national emissions estimates per EV-year are relatively robust to the level of EV adoption beyond our baseline and to variation in assumptions about power systems, EV behavior, and policy.",

While bacterial adhesion mechanisms also exhibit remarkable diversity, the molecular processes that regulate the dynamic modulation of binding strength between elongated bacterial cells and host cells remain poorly understood. Fusobacterium nucleatum ( F. nucleatum ) utilizes the surface adhesin CbpF to interact with the highly expressed host receptors CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 on cancer cells to facilitate tumor colonization. By elucidating the structural details of CbpF binding to human CEACAM1/CEACAM5 receptors, and through mechanistic investigations, we identified that the prominent EFNGQYQ loop on CbpF and the key Q78 residue of CEACAM1/CEACAM5 constitute the molecular linchpin of this pathogen–host interface. Furthermore, we found a distinct type of binding particle and proposed a Velcro-like adhesion model. In this model, CbpF mediates robust attachment through the simultaneous interaction of multiple binding sites, akin to the interlocking mechanism of Velcro. This multivalent interaction allows F. nucleatum to dynamically switch between firm anchoring and easy detachment, adapting to varying physiological microenvironments. Our study elucidates the dynamic modulation of bacterial adhesion strength and lays the foundation for developing therapeutic interventions to disrupt the bacterium–host interface.",

          "abstract": "Proliferative retinopathy is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in humans; however, the molecular mechanisms behind the immune cell–mediated retinal angiogenesis remain poorly elucidated. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, we identified an enrichment of sorting nexin (SNX)-related pathways, with SNX3, a member of the SNX family that is involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, being significantly upregulated in the myeloid cell subpopulations of OIR retinas. Immunostaining showed that SNX3 expression is markedly increased in the retinal microglia/macrophages of mice with OIR, which is mainly located within and around the neovascular tufts. Myeloid cell-specific deficiency of Snx3 inhibited retinal neovascularization, hyperpermeability, and dysfunction in OIR mice. Using glutathione S-transferase pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescent staining, we found that SNX3 interacted with receptor-interacting protein 1/3 (RIP1 and RIP3). We further demonstrated that RIP1/3 degradation was accelerated in SNX3-deleted microglia/macrophages, causing an inhibition of hypoxia-induced necroptosis and mitochondrial fission, thereby decreasing the production of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors (FGF2 and MMP12). Moreover, OIR retinas from myeloid cell–specific SNX3 overexpression transgenic mice presented more angiogenic tufts, while RIP1/3 inhibition largely ablated SNX3 overexpression–induced pathological angiogenesis. Based on the structure of SNX3, we identified a small-molecule inhibitor, W1122. Intriguingly, we found that W1122 effectively inhibited retinal angiogenesis in the OIR model, and combination treatment with anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) yielded enhanced antiangiogenic effects. Collectively, our findings disclose a link between SNX3 and RIP1/3 signaling and implicate SNX3 in the development of ischemic retinopathy.",

          "abstract": "Programmable self-assembly has recently enabled the creation of complex structures through precise control of the interparticle interactions and the particle geometries. Targeting ever more structurally complex, dynamic, and functional assemblies necessitates going beyond the design of the structure itself, to the measurement and control of the local flexibility of the intersubunit connections and its impact on the collective mechanics of the entire assembly. In this study, we demonstrate a method to infer the mechanical properties of multisubunit assemblies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and RELION’s multi-body refinement. Specifically, we analyze the fluctuations of pairs of DNA-origami subunits that self-assemble into tubules. By measuring the fluctuations of dimers using cryo-EM, we extract mechanical properties such as the bending modulus and interparticle spring constant. These properties are then applied to elastic models to predict assembly outcomes, which align well with experimental observations. This approach not only provides a deeper understanding of nanoparticle mechanics but also opens pathways to refining subunit designs to achieve precise assembly behavior. This methodology could have broader applications in the study of nanomaterials, including protein assemblies, where understanding the interplay of mechanical properties and subunit geometry is essential for controlling complex self-assembled structures.",

          "abstract": "Rad51 catalyzes the DNA pairing reactions that take place during homologous recombination (HR), and HR must be tightly regulated to ensure physiologically appropriate outcomes. Rad54 is an ATP-dependent DNA motor protein that stimulates Rad51 activity during mitosis. In meiosis Rad51 is downregulated by the protein Hed1, which blocks Rad54 binding to Rad51, and allows Dmc1 to function as the active recombinase. We currently have a poor understanding of the regulatory interplay between Rad54, Hed1, Rad51, and Dmc1. Here, we identify a conserved Rad51 interaction motif within Rad54, and we solve a CryoEM structure of this motif bound to Rad51. We also identify a distinct Rad51 interaction motif within Hed1 and solve its structure bound to Rad51. These structures explain how Rad54 engages Rad51 to promote recombination between sister chromatids during mitosis and how Rad51 is downregulated by Hed1 upon entry into meiosis such that its meiosis-specific homolog Dmc1 can promote recombination between homologous chromosomes.",

The superconducting T c in many of these materials is maximized in the regime of strong nematic fluctuations, making the role of nematicity in influencing the superconductivity a topic of intense research. Here, we use the AC elastocaloric effect (ECE) to map out the phase diagram of Ba(Fe 1− x Co x ) 2 As 2 near optimal doping. The ECE signature at T c on the overdoped side, where superconductivity condenses without any nematic order, is quantitatively consistent with other thermodynamic probes that indicate a single-component superconducting state. In contrast, on the slightly underdoped side, where superconductivity condenses within the nematic phase, ECE reveals a second thermodynamic transition proximate to and below T c . We rule out magnetism and reentrant tetragonality as the origin of this transition and find that our observations strongly suggest a phase transition into a multicomponent superconducting state. This implies the existence of a subdominant pairing instability that competes strongly with the dominant s ± instability. Our results highlight the significant role of nematic order in determining the pairing symmetry close to optimal doping in this extensively studied iron-based SC, while also demonstrating the power of ECE in uncovering strain-tuned phase diagrams of quantum materials.",

Traditional control strategies, such as predefined temperature modulation, struggle to achieve substantial enhancement. Here, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that autonomously discovers optimal control policies to maximize heat transfer in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection. By dynamically adjusting wall temperature fluctuations, the DRL agent achieves a heat transfer enhancement of up to 38.5%, exceeding the 20 to 25% limit of conventional methods. The learned strategy reveals a nonlinear state–action relationship, inducing a fully modulated boundary layer regime. Furthermore, we distill the DRL insights into a simplified bang-bang control model, which retains comparable performance (up to 40.0% enhancement) and, crucially, generalizes to unseen, higher Rayleigh number cases without additional training. Our results demonstrate the power of machine learning in turbulence control and reveal a framework with potential for intelligent heat transfer optimization in real-world applications.",

For optimizing biomaterials capable of similar dynamical features, it is essential to understand the first step of these interactions, namely the multivalent molecular recognition between ligands and cell receptors. Here, we present the reciprocal cooperation between dynamic ligands in supramolecular polymers and dynamic receptors in model cell membranes, determining molecular recognition and multivalent binding via receptor clustering. The nonlinear dependences of the ligand concentration, receptors, and their binding affinity are observed experimentally by fluorescence and superresolution fluorescence microscopies, revealing a valency-dependent clustering mode of anchoring. The mechanism is supported by stochastic modeling demonstrating that such nonlinear dependence is unlikely in the absence of any dynamics and superselectivity. Using a coarse-grained molecular model, the subtle competition between local and global entropies that controls this anchoring mechanism explains the clustering. Further investigation using single particle tracking reveals the presence of two populations of bound and unbound receptors after the clustering process. The result of this study highlights the importance of reciprocity of dynamics in supramolecular polymer and lipid membrane for recruitment, multivalent binding, and clustering, all of which are crucial elements in the design of materials capable of actively interacting with biological targets.",

However, the net surface temperature impact of these processes—whether ET cooling or albedo-induced warming predominates—and how the dominance changes across phenological transitions and regions remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of vegetation foliage on daytime land surface temperature (LST) following six phenological transitions, spanning from the start of season to end of season, in deciduous and mixed forests across the mid- to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere during 2013–2021 using multiple satellite products and ground observations. We quantified vegetation effect as the difference between observed LST and LST estimates from the Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) model, representing a no-foliage scenario. We found that vegetation-induced cooling consistently outweighs warming following all phenological transitions except for the end of the season. Cooling intensity increased with vegetation greenness, ranging from 1.0 ± 0.5 °C (mean ± 0.15 SD) in 59% of forests after the start of the season (SOS) to 6.1 ± 0.8 °C in 89% of forests following the onset of maturity, before declining toward the end of the season. Over half of the regions experiencing cooling showed intensification of surface cooling with climate warming, suggesting an amplified vegetation-mediated cooling under future climate change.

While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR–βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.",

However, it is unknown how this established reward-learning ensemble adapts to changing reward contingencies, such as reward omission during extinction. Specifically, does the same ensemble adjust its activity to support behavior suppression, or is a distinct ensemble recruited for this new learning? Our data reveal that operant extinction learning recruits a distinct PL Extinction ensemble to support response inhibition, and concerted engagement of both ensembles encodes both ongoing and subsequent context-specific behavior. Using single-cell calcium imaging, we longitudinally tracked PL neurons in rats as they pressed a lever for food rewards (Training), learned to suppress responding upon reward omission (Extinction), and reinstated responding following a noncontingent “priming” pellet (Reinstatement). We trained decoders on individual rats’ PL activity patterns to predict trial-wise responses and used an in silico deletion approach to identify separate PL Training and Extinction ensembles associated with response execution and inhibition, respectively. Critically, both ensembles were reengaged and maintained their distinct roles during Reinstatement. These findings highlight ensemble-based encoding of multiple, even opposing, learned associations within the same region, demonstrating how selective ensemble recruitment enables behavioral flexibility under changing contingencies.",

In particular, the suspected cooperative hydrodynamics provided by groups of cells remains largely unexplored due to the difficulties in visualizing these dynamic three-dimensional flows.

Individual feeding flows interact hydrodynamically to create a chaotic collective flow at the population scale. Using a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, we measure and predict the entire collective flow, enabling us to assess its remarkable mixing and dispersion properties. We show that the active spreading of the food patch accelerates its detection by starving cells. As many fitness advantages provided by collective flows can be envisioned, we propose that this feeding cluster represents a form of intraspecific by-product cooperative behavior.",

          "abstract": "The origin and phylogenetic distribution of symbiotic associations between nodulating angiosperms and nitrogen-fixing bacteria have long intrigued biologists. Recent comparative evolutionary analyses have yielded alternative hypotheses: a multistep pathway of independent gains and losses of root nodule symbiosis vs. a single gain followed by numerous losses. A detailed reconstruction of the history of genes involved in signaling between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and potential hosts, particularly lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signaling, is needed to distinguish between these hypotheses. LCO recognition by plants involves the Nod Factor Perception ( NFP ) gene family; in the legume model Medicago truncatula (Fabales), MtNFP is essential for establishing rhizobial symbiosis. Here, we document convergent evolution of NFP , indicating multiple origins of LCO-driven symbiosis. In contrast to previous models that explain the recruitment of NFP via a single duplication in the ancestor of the nitrogen-fixing clade, our phylogenomic and synteny results suggest this duplication does not span the entire clade. Tandem duplication in a common ancestor of Cucurbitales and Rosales resulted in the NFP1 and NFP2 groups. In contrast, the phylogenetically closest paralog of MtNFP is MtLYR1 , located on a different chromosome within a large syntenic block. All available data indicate that a large-scale duplication resulted in MtNFP and MtLYR1 , likely corresponding to a whole-genome duplication in an ancestor of subfamily Papilionoideae of Fabaceae. We show that MtNFP and the NFP2 -like group are not orthologous, indicating multiple independent gains of NFP -based LCO signaling. This molecular convergence provides a possible mechanism for multiple gains of root nodule symbiosis across the nitrogen-fixing clade.",

          "abstract": "Low-cost yet high-performance structural materials have been invariantly sought for modern engineering applications. However, due to the localized stress concentration induced by a high Peierls-Nabarro stress and limited dislocation mobility, increasing material strength usually comes at the expense of ductility and toughness, resulting in a trade-off between strength–ductility/strength–toughness. Here, we report an anomalous phenomenon of dislocation absorption at the crack front, which is unlike typically observed dislocation emission at the crack tip, in a heterogeneous “plain” steel consisting of tempered lath martensite embedded with stable carbon-enriched retained austenite. The continuous absorption of dislocations emitted from the tempered martensite into the tough austenite significantly alleviates the localized stress concentration, and as such retards crack propagation in the tempered martensite matrix. This allows the plain high-carbon low-alloyed steel subjected to simple quenching–partitioning–tempering processes to achieve remarkable properties comprising a multiplication of strength and elongation over 50 GPa·% with an exceptionally high fracture toughness over 130 MPa·m 1/2 . The toughening strategy based on this mechanism provides a promising route for developing cost-effective plain steels with ultrahigh strength, ductility, and toughness that is a persistent pursuit in the steel industry.",

However, their thermal instability remains a persistent challenge. Inspired by the extraordinary resilience of tardigrades, an “atomic armor” strategy is introduced to enhance the stability of nanoporous structures. Applied to mesoporous silica at parts-per-million levels, the atomic armor provides thermal resistance exceeding that of existing stabilization techniques. Thermal treatment at 1,000 °C for 168 h results in a fivefold increase in specific surface area, 66% lower thermal conductivity, and a sixfold increase in pore volume compared to untreated samples. Surface viscosity is linked to sintering resistance, and glass transition temperature and fragility are introduced as design parameters. Machine-learned interatomic potentials and metabasin escape algorithm-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to reveal that materials traditionally classified as nonglass formers can exhibit glass transition temperatures and display intrinsic fragility. Alumina is identified as having a record-high glass transition temperature. By modulating the surface viscosity of nanoparticles, this approach stabilizes nanoporous structures effectively. The proposed method offers a simple and universal posttreatment process for improving the thermal stability of nanoporous structures.",

Bile acids have emerged as pivotal signaling molecules in both metabolic and reproductive disorders, but remain unexplored in the early onset of puberty in children. Herein, we find elevated levels of muricholic acid (MCA) species in the serum of girls with central precocious puberty, which strongly correlate with indices of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis activation and can reach peak levels during puberty among healthy children. Intriguingly, reduction of MCA species can lead to decreased expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and delay the early onset of puberty, while elevated MCA levels induced premature sexual development in female mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that MCA had strong activation effects on Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), and MCA enhanced GnRH expression in GnRH neurons through activation of the TGR5-PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings reveal a link between metabolic status and reproductive maturation, highlighting MCA as a potential therapeutic target for managing early puberty initiation.",

          "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are gaining attention for their inherent safety and the use of abundant sodium resources. Bismuth (Bi) anode, with its high theoretical capacity and low cost, enhances the performance and competitiveness of ASIBs in energy storage applications. However, as a conversion-type material, Bi inevitably undergoes dramatic volume changes during cycling, limiting the structural stability and calendar life of the electrode. Herein, we present a Bi-carbon composite electrode with ultrafine Bi nanocrystals (&lt; 10 nm) uniformly integrated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (UF Bi@NCF). Despite Bi’s low melting point (271 °C), Ostwald ripening of metallic Bi during carbonization (750 °C) is effectively suppressed by incorporating polyacrylic acid as a chelating polymer in the electrospun Bi(III)/polyacrylonitrile precursor solutions. The high dispersity of Bi nanocrystals at elevated temperature is attributed to the strong coordination and electrostatic interactions between carboxyl groups and Bi 3+ . This structural refinement significantly reduces localized stress concentrations during sodiation/desodiation. The UF Bi@NCF anode demonstrates a reversible capacity of 237.5 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C, and negligible capacity decay even after 5,700 cycles at an extremely high current rate of 20 C for ASIBs. These findings highlight the potential of the anti-Ostwald ripening effect in enhancing the stability and performance of metal-carbon composite electrodes, providing valuable insights into the design of advanced materials for next-generation aqueous batteries.",

          "abstract": "All organisms are exposed to various stressors, which can sometimes lead to organismal death, depending on their intensity. While stress-induced organismal death has been observed in many species, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of stress-induced organismal death in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . We identified a chymotrypsin-like serine protease Phaedra1 ( Phae1 ) as a death mediator in D. melanogaster larvae. Phae1 expression was up-regulated by lethal heat stress (40 °C) but not nonlethal heat stress (38 °C or lower). The most prominent induction of Phae1 occurred in the central nervous system (CNS). We found neuro-specific knockdown of Phae1 increased survival and reduced neuronal caspase activity following exposure to lethal heat stress, suggesting that the transcriptional upregulation of Phae1 in the CNS is essential for stress-induced organismal death. We next found via bioinformatic and biochemical analyses that the transcription factor Zeste (Z) bound the Phae1 enhancer region and that z loss-of-function impaired Phae1 induction in the CNS, increasing survival following lethal heat stress. In addition, we found via chemical screening that rapamycin, a chemical inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), suppressed Phae1 expression. Neuro-specific knockdown of mTor reduced the protein levels of both Phae1 and Z, leading to an increase in survival following lethal heat stress. Together, these results indicate that heat stress–induced organismal death in D. melanogaster larvae is regulated by a genetically encoded transcriptional signaling pathway involving the mTOR–Z–Phae1 axis.",

RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry of synovial samples from either early treatment-naïve or active chronic RA patients showed that MS4A4A expression positively correlated with synovial inflammation. Synovial macrophages from patients treated with corticosteroids (CS) exhibited an enhanced expression of MS4A4A and Fc γ receptor (FcγR) 3. Accordingly, CS enhanced in vitro the expression of MS4A4A and FcγR3 in human and murine macrophages. In an experimental model of arthritis, Ms4a4a deletion had no effect on the disease course but was associated with enhanced therapeutic response selectively to CS. These results suggest that macrophage expression of MS4A4A represents a biomarker of joint inflammation in RA and that its upregulation in concert with FcγR3 by CS counteracts the therapeutic activity of these drugs. Macrophage MS4A4A may represent a biomarker of joint inflammation in RA and a target to amplify the therapeutic activity of CS.",

          "abstract": "Following encounter with an unrepaired DNA lesion, replication is halted and can restart downstream of the lesion leading to the formation of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap. To complete replication, this ssDNA gap is filled in by one of the two lesion tolerance pathways: the error-prone Translesion Synthesis (TLS) or the error-free Homology Directed Gap Repair (HDGR). In the present work, we evidence a role for the RecBC complex distinct from its canonical function in homologous recombination at DNA double strand breaks. We show that upon lesion encounter RecBC (independently of its catalytic activity and of the RecD subunit) is required to protect the nascent DNA in order to promote efficient lesion bypass. In the absence of RecBC, our data indicate that the nuclease ExoI can access and degrade the nascent DNA, affecting both TLS and HDGR mechanisms. We show that the recruitment of RecBC becomes particularly important at strong blocking lesions, when postreplicative ssDNA gaps persist and are covered by the ssDNA binding proteins. This protective role of RecBC is reminiscent of the role of BRCA2 in protecting the nascent DNA in human cells, highlighting once again the evolutionary conservation of DNA replication mechanisms across all living organisms.",

Furthermore, the mechanical tuning curve of the male mosquito flagellum was shown not to be aligned with that of its sensory neural elements. Using a generic theoretical model for acoustic sensing, we evaluate the signal-detection advantages and disadvantages that are implied by these two schemes: distortion product detection and cascading a signal through multiple layers of oscillator elements of different characteristic frequency. Last, we show that the combination of these two schemes yields a signal detector with enhanced frequency selectivity and speed of response, thus enabling the detection of transient, narrowband flight tones.",

We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface.

Unfortunately, traditional methods to quantify phage success can be time-consuming, limiting the throughput of experiments. Here, we use theory to show how the effects of phages on their hosts can be quantified using bacterial population dynamics measured in a high-throughput microplate reader (automated spectrophotometer). We use mathematical models to simulate bacterial population dynamics where specific phage and bacterial traits are known a priori. We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g., growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.",

We assessed the influence of a historical dispersal event on community assembly by simulating various scales of dispersal for 240 serpentine annual plant communities that experienced a large shift from drought to high rainfall conditions over three years. We collected, aggregated, and redistributed the aboveground seed bank (i.e., all loose seed present on the soil surface before the growing season initiates) from 30 sites across five nested spatial scales ( ∼ 1 m, 5 m, 100 m, 5 km, and 10 km), and annually censused communities to identify change in community structure among dispersal scales and over time. Our one-time dispersal manipulation diversified aboveground seed banks, provided insurance against temporal variability at intermediate and large dispersal distances ( ≥ 100 m), and even supported community reassembly toward a new compositional state at the 10 km scale. We also found evidence that temporal lags directed community responses to environmental fluctuations, preventing rare species extirpations and providing subordinate species discrete windows of time to supplement their seed banks. Our results reveal a joint spatiotemporal equilibrium in this system where dispersal through space interacts with temporal fluctuations in climate to support species’ persistence via aboveground seed banks. This experiment underscores the importance of dispersal for diversity maintenance in this global biodiversity hotspot, where the magnitude and frequency of future climate fluctuations is uncertain.",

          "abstract": "Cyanobacteria achieve highly efficient photosynthesis using a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism relying on specialized Type I (NDH-1) complexes. Among these, NDH-1 3 and NDH-1 4 catalyze redox-coupled hydration of CO 2 to bicarbonate, supporting carbon fixation in carboxysomes. The mechanism of coupling electron transfer to CO 2 -hydration by these variant NDH-1 complexes remains unknown. We engineered a Synechococcus PCC7942 strain that expresses exclusively the high flux/low affinity NDH-1 4 complex, enabling the observation of the coupling of CO 2 hydration to cyclic electron flow in isolation from the other NDH-1 isoforms normally present in cells. We found that inhibition of the CupB protein by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxzolamide (EZ) suppressed CO 2 uptake, slowed photosystem I rereduction, and abolished proton pumping as probed by acridine orange fluorescence. These effects were absent in strains lacking Cup proteins, confirming specificity. The results demonstrate that CO 2 hydration and electron transfer through NDH-1 4 are tightly coupled via proton translocation across the thylakoid membrane. These findings provide direct evidence for the bidirectional interaction in bioenergetic coupling between the plastoquinone reduction and the CO 2 uptake at the distal Zn-site over a span of ~150 Å and support a proton-removal hypothesis involving the proton transfer pathways from the Zn-site of CO 2 hydration to an energetically coupled proton loading site evolutionarily repurposed from the ancestral proton pumping mechanism to enable energetic CO 2 uptake.",

          "abstract": "Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are being extensively researched as replacements for liquid electrolytes in future batteries. Despite significant advancements, there are still challenges in using SSEs, particularly in extreme conditions. This study presents a hydrated metal-organic ionic cocrystal (HMIC) solid-state ion conductor with a solvent-assisted ion transport mechanism suitable for extreme operating conditions. Through crystal engineering strategies, the adsorption capacity of HMIC for anions and water molecules can be regulated, thereby facilitating cation hopping transport and enhancing electrochemical stability. As a result, optimized HMIC shows exceptional properties, including an extraordinarily high Zn 2+ transference number (t Zn2+ = 0.81), an expanded electrochemical stability window (~2.6 V), and an exceptionally high Zn 2+ ion conductivity (8.6 mS cm –1 , 25 °C). Interface dynamics analysis indicates that this strong binding to water molecules can significantly reduce the desolvation energy barrier and enhance the ionic diffusion coefficient. (10 to 100 times higher than that in aqueous electrolytes). This allows Zn|| Prussian blue analog batteries to exhibit impressive fast-charging performance (180 C, 20 s, over 1,000 charge/discharge cycles) and maintain 100% discharge capacity retention and discharge plateau from –30 to 30 °C. The development of HMICs with a solvent-assisted hopping mechanism provides a promising path for solid-state zinc-ion batteries in extreme conditions, including fast charging, low temperature, and high loading.",

However, precise manipulation of cells in 3-D microfluidic environments remains challenging, particularly for heterogeneous populations. Here, we present “Electro-LEV,” a unique platform integrating electromagnetic and magnetic levitation principles for dynamic 3-D control of cell position during separation. We demonstrated that small current adjustments in electromagnets significantly alter the levitation heights of diverse particles and cell types. By periodically modulating and tracking cell positions along the z-axis, Electro-LEV identified distinct levitation behaviors between single cells and cell clusters, with clusters responding more rapidly to magnetic field changes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Electro-LEV significantly enhances the purity and efficiency of levitational sorting, achieving 10-fold enrichment of live cells from 50% starting viability samples and 18.8-fold enrichment from 10% starting viability samples. These results establish Electro-LEV as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity, differentiating cell sizes and types, and improving cell sorting efficiency. Thus, Electro-LEV is broadly applicable, offering different possibilities for high-resolution cell analysis and label-free cell sorting in various biomedical fields, including but not limited to single-cell sequencing and drug screening.",

          "abstract": "Typically, people perform actions in a valenced—positive or negative—way, depending on their attitudes or desires. These forms of action are named vitality forms (VFs). While it is well established that action goals are mediated by a parieto-frontal network, less is known about the processing of VFs. Recent fMRI studies suggest that the insula (INS)—and its connections with the parieto-frontal circuit—plays a crucial role in VFs processing. However, a key question remains: How does our internal affective state shape our motor behavior? To explore this issue, we conducted an fMRI study. Participants were required to perform two sequential tasks: 1) to evoke either a positive (enthusiastic) or a negative (angry) affective state (feeling task); 2) to execute an action while maintaining these affective states (execution task). Univariate analysis revealed activation of the INS and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the feeling task, which extended to the premotor (PM) and parietal areas during the execution task. To determine the directionality of information flow among these nodes, we employed dynamic causal modeling. Bayesian model comparison showed that, during the feeling task, affect generation involves INS, which, together with the PFC, modulates the activity of PM. In contrast, during execution, motor commands emerge from PM and influence activity in the INS and PFC. These findings indicate that while the internal states crucially imply the INS, their regulation is mediated by PFC. The PM cortex plays a crucial role in the selection of the corresponding action VFs.",

Alterations in nuclear size or the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio are hallmark features of cancer cells and often correlate with disease progression. However, the mechanisms underlying nuclear size abnormalities and their impact on tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear hypertrophy occurs in response to enhanced DNA replication stress, a key characteristic of cancer cells. Increased actin polymerization within the nucleus appears to be the primary mechanism driving nuclear hypertrophy downstream of the ATR-CHEK1 pathway. Replication stress–induced nuclear hypertrophy alters transcriptomic profiles and chromatin topology, while reducing the migratory and metastatic capacity of cancer cells. In addition, nuclear hypertrophy in cancer cells is associated with increased infiltration of antitumor immune cells. Our findings suggest that cell-autonomous effects of nuclear hypertrophy do not promote cellular fitness or aggressive characteristics in cancer cells. This may explain why cells with nuclear hypertrophy are not positively selected and persist as a subpopulation during tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, the link between replication stress and nuclear hypertrophy provides insights into why enlarged nuclei are consistently observed in advanced-stage cancers.",

          "abstract": "Organisms use circadian clocks to synchronize physiological processes to anticipate the Earth’s day-night cycles and regulate responses to environmental signals to gain competitive advantage. While divergent genetic clocks have been studied extensively in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, an ancient conserved circadian redox rhythm has been recently reported. However, its biological function and physiological outputs remain elusive. Here, we uncovered the coexistence of redox and genetic rhythms with distinct period lengths and transcriptional targets through concurrent metabolic and transcriptional time-course measurements in an Arabidopsis long-period clock mutant. Analysis of the target genes indicated regulation of the immune-induced programmed cell death (PCD) by the redox rhythm. Moreover, this time-of-day-sensitive PCD was eliminated by redox perturbations and by blocking the signaling pathway of the plant defense hormones jasmonic acid/ethylene, while remaining intact in genetic clock-defective backgrounds. This study shows that compared to robust genetic clocks, the more sensitive circadian redox rhythm serves as a signaling hub in regulating incidental energy-intensive processes, such as immune-induced PCD involving reprogramming of chloroplast and mitochondria activities, to provide organisms a flexible strategy to mitigate metabolic overload during stress responses.",

The hybrid-cell-derived exosomes could combine the functional properties of both parental cells and be readily produced by passaging. This method enables customization and large-scale production of exosomes with specific functionalities, potentially advancing precision therapies across a wide array of diseases. As demonstrated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models, exosomes derived from hybrid cells (HCs) (H/Exos) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neutrophils efficiently targeted AD-affected areas via LFA-1/ICAM-1 and improved the cognition of AD mice. Beyond directly promoting neural repair and inhibiting inflammation, we surprisingly found that H/Exos increased microglia abundance, modulated microglia gene expression, enhanced the endocytic and lysosomal function, and promoted microglial phagocytic phenotypic differentiation to clear Aβ. This hybridoma-inspired strategy offers a versatile and practical way to engineer exosomes with desired therapeutic functions, representing a promising direction for personalized therapies.",

          "abstract": "The β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR), a prototype G protein–coupled receptor, controls cardiopulmonary function underpinning O 2 delivery. Abundance of the β 2 AR is canonically regulated by G protein–coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestins, but neither controls constitutive receptor levels, which are dependent on ambient O 2 . Basal β 2 AR expression is instead regulated by the prolyl hydroxylase/pVHL-E3 ubiquitin ligase system, explaining O 2 responsivity. Interplay between O 2 and nitric oxide (NO, a potent bronchodilator) is central to cardiopulmonary function. Here, we demonstrate that pVHL-mediated β 2 AR degradation is counteracted by NO, revealing pVHL control of pulmonary function. NO S-nitrosylates Cys77 in human pVHL (cognate to mouse Cys43), which induces binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to degrade pVHL, thereby increasing β 2 AR expression. pVHL–C43S mutant mice refractory to S-nitrosylation exhibit decreases in β 2 AR signaling and increases in airway tone. Thus, pVHL controls adrenergic pulmonary function and contributes to bronchodilation by NO. Our findings suggest therapeutic approaches to asthma and obstructive airway disease.",

The origin of this ectopic fat remains enigmatic, and the absence of a genetic animal model has hindered its investigation. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P 3 ], a key signaling lipid that regulates cellular growth and differentiation, is tightly regulated by the lipid phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and SHIP2 (SH2-containing inositol phosphatase 2). Here, we demonstrate that simultaneous loss of Pten and Ship2 in the adrenal cortex induces adrenal lipoma formation in mice. These lipomatous cells display both adipocyte-like morphology and adipocyte-specific gene expression. Lineage tracing revealed that these lipomas originate from the adrenal cortex. Mechanistically, PI(3,4,5)P 3 hyperaccumulation in the adrenal cortex activates AKT (AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog), leading to ectopic PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) expression, a key driver of adipocyte differentiation. This study suggests that the PI(3,4,5)P 3 /AKT-driven transdifferentiation of adrenocortical cells may represent a central mechanism underlying adrenal lipoma formation, thereby providing insights into lipoma pathogenesis and cellular reprogramming in vivo.",

For instance, standard Kresling origami cells exhibit nontunable intrinsic energy landscapes determined by their geometry and material properties, limiting their adaptability after fabrication. To overcome this limitation, we introduce frustration to enable fine-tuning of the energy landscape and resulting deformation states. By prestressing the Kresling cell by means of special springs with individual control, we induce either global or localized (i.e., crease level) frustration, which allows changing the energy barrier (cell or assembly). We investigate the mechanical behavior of frustrated Kresling assemblies, both theoretically and experimentally, under various loading and boundary conditions. Our findings reveal that changing the frustration state leads to precise control of folding sequences, enabling previously inaccessible folding paths. The proposed concept paves the way for applications in mechanical metamaterials and other fields requiring highly programmable and reconfigurable systems – e.g., prosthetic limbs.",

Our study shows that restoring mitochondrial function using retinoic acid (RA) to boost mitochondrial biogenesis and a mitochondrial uncoupler to enhance respiration synergistically drives neuroblastoma differentiation and inhibits proliferation. U- 13 C-glucose/glutamine isotope tracing revealed a metabolic shift from the pentose phosphate pathway to oxidative phosphorylation, accelerating the tricarboxylic acid cycle and switching substrate preference from glutamine to glucose. These effects were abolished by electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors or in ρ 0 cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, emphasizing the necessity of mitochondrial function for differentiation. Dietary RA and uncoupler treatment promoted tumor differentiation in an orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft model, evidenced by neuropil production and Schwann cell recruitment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of xenografts revealed that this strategy effectively eliminated the stem cell population, promoted differentiation, and increased mitochondrial gene signatures along the differentiation trajectory, potentially improving patient outcomes. Collectively, our findings establish a mitochondria-centric therapeutic strategy for inducing tumor differentiation, suggesting that maintaining/driving differentiation in tumor requires not only ATP production but also continuous ATP consumption and sustained ETC activity.",

We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ordinary differential equation (ODE) inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "abstract": "During wound healing, tumor growth, and organ formation, epithelial cells migrate and cluster in layered tissue environments. Although cellular mechanosensing of adhered extracellular matrices is now well recognized, it is unclear how deeply cells sense through distant matrix layers. Since single cells can mechanosense stiff basal surfaces through soft hydrogels of &lt;10 μm thickness, here we ask whether cellular collectives can perform such “depth-mechanosensing” through thicker matrix layers. Using a collagen-polyacrylamide double-layer hydrogel, we found that epithelial cell collectives can mechanosense basal substrates at a depth of &gt;100 μm, assessed by cell clustering and collagen deformation. On collagen layers with stiffer basal substrates, cells initially migrate slower while performing higher collagen deformation and stiffening, resulting in reduced dispersal of epithelial clusters. These processes occur in two broad phases: cellular clustering and dynamic collagen deformation, followed by cell migration and dispersal. Using a cell-populated collagen-polyacrylamide computational model, we show that stiffer basal substrates enable higher collagen deformation, which in turn extends the clustering phase of epithelial cells and reduces their dispersal. Disruption of collective collagen deformation, by either α-catenin depletion or myosin-II inhibition, disables the depth-mechanosensitive differences in epithelial responses between soft and stiff basal substrates. These findings suggest that depth-mechanosensing is an emergent property that arises from collective collagen deformation caused by epithelial cell clusters. This work broadens the conventional understanding of epithelial mechanosensing from immediate surfaces to underlying basal matrices, providing insights relevant to tissue contexts with layers of varying stiffness, such as wound healing and tumor invasion.",

Understanding the cellular origins of PVR-associated fibroblasts (PAFs) is essential to decipher the mechanisms of ocular wound healing. In this study, we combined single-cell transcriptomics with genetic lineage tracing to map the contributions of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, immune cells, and Müller cells to disease progression. RPE cells were found to constitute the largest fraction of cells within PVR lesions, transitioning through metabolic, proliferative, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition stages during their conversion to PAFs. These cells exhibited remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity. Notably, Pdgfrb + RPE cells demonstrated significant morphological plasticity, transitioning toward a fibroblast-like phenotype, while macrophage-like RPE cells acquired inflammation-related functions post-PVR. Cell communication network analysis identified Thbs1 (encoding TSP-1) as a key hub gene driving RPE cell fate transitions during PVR. Importantly, therapeutic antibodies targeting TSP-1 significantly mitigated PVR progression. This study provides a detailed roadmap of fibrosis formation during ocular wound healing and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting TSP-1 in the management of PVR.",

Based on sequence differences among repeat units, we clustered individual sequences into 7 VNTR structural alleles called Types. Three Types were related through large duplications, but the other Types diverged much earlier such that only 12 repeat units at the 5′ end of the VNTR were shared across most Types. The most diverged Types were rare and present only in individuals with African ancestry, but a multiallelic structural polymorphism was present across populations at different frequencies, consistent with expansion of the VNTR preceding the emergence of early hominins. We demonstrated that this polymorphism was in complete linkage disequilibrium with fine-mapped schizophrenia variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and that this risk haplotype was associated with decreased CACNA1C gene expression in the brain. Our work suggests that sequence variation within a human-specific VNTR affects gene expression and provides a detailed characterization of new alleles at a flagship neuropsychiatric GWAS locus.",

We then examined compartment-specific phenotypes in RGCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation compared to isogenic controls, including differences in axonal growth and axonal transport efficiency, with OPTN-mutant RGCs showing reduced axon length and slower transport, hallmarks of neurodegeneration. Axonal RNA-seq analyses revealed transcriptomic alterations related to disease states, including specific transcriptomic changes along OPTN axons. To assess glial influences on axonal health, we developed models with astrocytes localized specifically to the proximal axonal compartment and modulated their disease states to simulate pathological conditions. Importantly, the induction of diseased astrocytes solely along proximal axons triggered compartment-specific neurodegenerative changes in RGCs. Collectively, this platform represents a successful recapitulation of the spatially distinct features of hPSC-derived RGCs under both healthy and disease conditions, offering a physiologically relevant, human-specific in vitro system to study neuronal development, axon–glia interactions, and mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.",

The same technology was applied to cultured macrophages exposed to cholesterol crystals, and the observations made on the macrophages were compared to those made on the pathological tissue. We observed that cholesterol crystal digestion and, eventually, cholesterol crystal clearance occurs in the advanced human plaques through cellular processing. Our findings suggest that cholesterol crystal disassembly occurs through the esterification of crystalline cholesterol to cholesteryl-ester in isolated volumes, whereby the ester aggregates into intra- and extracellular pools. The hypothesis is supported by the close similarity of the processes imaged in the human tissue and in the macrophages and is in agreement with earlier biochemical studies performed on cultured macrophages.",

          "abstract": "Color polymorphism can influence the evolutionary fate of cryptic species because it increases populations’ chances of survival in heterogenous or variable environments. Yet, little is known about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the persistence of cryptic color polymorphisms, or the impact these polymorphisms have on the macroevolutionary dynamics of lineages. Here, we examine the evolutionary history of the most widespread cryptic color polymorphism in anurans, involving green and brown morphs. Using an order-scale comparative analysis, we show that these morphs can coexist within species over long evolutionary periods and that polymorphic lineages switch habitat more frequently and have greater diversification rates than other groups. We then identify the locus responsible for the green/brown polymorphism in a group of African grass frogs, and demonstrate that it evolves under long-term balancing selection, resulting in trans-specific polymorphism. These results provide a microevolutionary mechanism for the long-term persistence of multiple color morphs within species observed at a macroevolutionary scale. This study underscores the importance of cryptic color polymorphism in the ecology and evolution of anurans, and provides a framework for future research on the genetic architecture and selective forces underlying cryptic coloration traits.",

          "abstract": "Despite periods of permanent darkness and extensive ice coverage in polar environments, photosynthetic ice diatoms display a remarkable capability of living inside the ice matrix. How these organisms navigate such hostile conditions with limited light and extreme cold remains unknown. Using a custom subzero temperature microscope during an Arctic expedition, we present the finding of motility at record-low temperatures in a Eukaryotic cell. By characterizing the gliding motility of several ice diatom species, collected from ice cores in the Chukchi Sea, we record that they retain motility at temperatures as low as − 15 ° C. Remarkably, ice diatoms can glide on ice substrates, a capability absent in temperate diatoms of the same genus. This unique ability arises from adaptations in extracellular mucilage that allow ice diatoms to adhere to ice, essential for gliding. Even on glass substrates where both cell types retain motility at freezing temperatures, ice diatoms move an order of magnitude faster, with their optimal motility shifting toward colder temperatures. Combining field and laboratory experiments with thermo-hydrodynamic modeling, we reveal adaptive strategies that enable gliding motility in cold environments. These strategies involve increasing internal energy efficiency with minimal changes in heat capacity and activation enthalpy, and reducing external dissipation by minimizing the temperature sensitivity of mucilage viscosity. The finding of diatoms’ ice gliding motility opens new routes for understanding their survival within a harsh ecological niche and their migratory responses to environmental changes. Our work highlights the robust adaptability of ice diatoms in one of Earth’s most extreme settings.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to pose significant threats to public health, particularly vector-borne diseases. Despite dramatic recent increases in dengue that many anecdotally connect with climate change, the effect of anthropogenic climate change on dengue remains poorly quantified. To assess this link, we assembled local-level data on dengue across 21 countries in Asia and the Americas. We found a nonlinear relationship between temperature and dengue incidence with the largest impact of warming at lower temperatures, peak incidence at 27.8°C, and a decline at higher temperatures. Using this inferred temperature response, we estimate 18% (95% CI: 11 to 27%) of historical dengue incidence on average across our study countries is attributable to anthropogenic warming. Future warming could further increase incidence by 49% (95% CI: 16 to 136%) to 76% (95% CI: 27 to 239%) by midcentury for low or high emissions scenarios, respectively, with cooler regions projected to double in incidence due to warming while other currently hot regions experience little impact or even small declines. Under the highest emissions scenario, we estimate that 262 million people are currently living in places in these 21 countries where dengue incidence is expected to more than double due to climate change by midcentury. These insights highlight the major impacts of anthropogenic warming on dengue burden across most of its endemic range, providing a foundation for public health planning and the development of strategies to mitigate future risks due to climate change.",

Here, we use a combination of stable isotope imaging and tracing to reveal carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) exchanges among three symbiotic primary producers that fuel a salmon-bearing river food web. Bulk isotope analysis, nanoSIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) isotope imaging, and density centrifugation for quantitative stable isotope probing enabled quantification of organism-specific C- and N-fixation rates from the subcellular scale to the ecosystem. After winters with riverbed-scouring floods, the macroalga Cladophora glomerata uses nutrients in spring runoff to grow streamers up to 10 m long. During summer flow recession, riverine N concentrations wane and Cladophora becomes densely epiphytized by three species of Epithemia , diatoms with N-fixing endosymbionts (proto-organelles) descended from a free-living Crocosphaera cyanobacterium. Over summertime epiphyte succession on Cladophora , N-fixation rates increased as Epithemia spp. became dominant, Cladophora C-fixation declined to near zero, and Epithemia C-fixation increased. Carbon transfer to caddisflies grazing on Cladophora with high densities of Epithemia was 10-fold higher than C transfer to caddisflies grazing Cladophora with low Epithemia loads. In response to demand for N, Epithemia allocates high levels of newly fixed C to its endosymbiont. Consequently, these endosymbionts have the highest rates of C and N accumulation of any taxon in this tripartite symbiosis during the biologically productive season and can produce one of the highest areal rates of N-fixation reported in any river ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a chromatin-associated nonhistone protein widely distributed in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is transported extracellularly as a proinflammatory mediator or late warning protein to induce immune and inflammatory reactions upon stimuli such as microbial infection. Here, we have found that HMGB1 directly interacts with bacterial DNA analogue CpG-A in the extracellular environment to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) via its positively charged DNA-binding domain. We have demonstrated that the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE) responds to stimulation of the extracellular HMGB1-CpG-A complex and triggers phase separation of the downstream adaptor protein, Src76kDa structural domain leukocyte protein (SLP76), which promotes activation of the MAPK pathway and release of inflammatory cytokines. These results not only designate that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism involved in the axis of DNA-HMGB1 stimulated RAGE-SLP76 signaling pathway but also provide evidence that the activity of HMGB1 is regulated by LLPS, highly relevant to immune responses of inflammatory cells toward microbial infection. Especially, the finding that the intracellular SLP76 forms condensates with the cytosol domain of RAGE may represent a general downstream phenomenon when an inflammatory cell membrane receptor is activated.",

The main theoretical framework for modeling the decision-making process has been based on the highly successful drift-diffusion model, which is a simple tool for explaining many aspects of this process. However, recent observations challenge this model. It was found that inhibitory tone increases during situations of difficult discrimination tasks, but the origin of this phenomenon is not understood. Motivated by this observation, we extend a recently developed model for directional decision-making of animals moving in real space. We introduce an integrated Ising-type model that includes global inhibition and use it to describe two-choice decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain’s decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered phases. Within the model, this observation can be explained by noting that this critical region has unique dynamics that give rise to advantageous properties for the decision-making process.",

          "abstract": "The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is a voltage-gated cation channel that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular excitability, especially in cardiac pacemaker cells and neurons. Its dysregulation is linked to heart diseases such as bradycardia and neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain. Structural and functional studies have revealed that the S4 voltage sensor of the HCN channel moves downward during hyperpolarization. Recent structural studies of HCN channels have shown that the extracellular portion of the S4 segment is approximately three helical turns longer than that of voltage-gated K + (Kv) channels. However, whether this extended extracellular part of S4 plays a functional role in gating is still unknown. In this study, utilizing the available HCN4 channel structures, we examined the formation of salt bridges in the extracellular part of S4 with the S5 segment and the S1-S2 linker. Results from charge-swapped mutants and double cysteine mutants suggested that sequential, stepwise salt bridge formation involving the extracellular positively charged amino acids of S4 plays a role in the voltage-dependent gating of HCN channels. Furthermore, we applied voltage clamp fluorometry to confirm that the extracellular salt bridge network affects the S4 movement. This extracellular S4 portion includes disease-related arginine residues, R375 and R378. Our results suggest that disruption of salt bridge formation may perturb the smooth transition of S4 movement and cause HCN channel dysfunction.",

Here, we ask whether a plant Rubisco chaperone can be reprogrammed by directed evolution to accommodate a nonnative client. We developed a selection strategy to assess Rubisco assembly factor activity in high-throughput and used this selection to identify mutants of the chaperone Raf1 from Arabidopsis thaliana ( At Raf1) that assemble Nicotiana tabacum Rubisco, for which wild-type At Raf1 has minimal activity. We show that directed evolution can generate At Raf1 variants that enable significantly increased N. tabacum Rubisco assembly compared to wild-type At Raf1. Evaluation of evolved At Raf1s indicates that they retain the ability to assemble their native client and can assemble other dicot Rubisco orthologs that they were not evolved to recognize. This work may provide a strategy for addressing the constraints chaperone selectivity impose upon Rubisco-centric efforts to improve plant photosynthesis.",

In this study, we use intergenerational single-nucleus omics to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of seasonal temperature changes in fruits containing developing seeds of the next generation. We show that the sensing of temperature takes place specifically in maternal fruit tissues and that mothers preadapt their progeny to maternal temperature through the intergenerational flux of the hormone ABA to the zygote itself where it is sensed to affect dormancy. We conclude that mothers can control filial traits via direct transfer of hormones to progeny and propose that this is an important mechanism by which populations can rapidly adapt to environmental change.",

Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4 , the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater neuronal activity than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta in response to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Finally, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.",

While bacterial and archaeal primase generate short RNA primers, the eukaryotic primase, Polα-primase, contains both RNA primase and DNA polymerase (Pol) subunits that function together to form a &gt;20 base hybrid RNA–DNA primer. Interestingly, the DNA Pol1 subunit of Polα lacks a 3’-5’ proofreading exonuclease, contrary to the high-fidelity normally associated with DNA replication. However, Polδ and Polε synthesize the majority of the eukaryotic genome, and both contain 3’-5’ exonuclease activity for high fidelity. Nonetheless, even the small amount of DNA produced by Pol1 in each of the many RNA/DNA primers during chromosome replication adds up to tens of millions of nucleotides in a human genome. Thus, it has been a longstanding question why Pol1 lacks a proofreading exonuclease. We show here that Polα is uniquely capable of traversing common oxidized or hydrolyzed template nucleotides and propose that Polα evolved to bypass these common template lesions when they are encountered during chromosome replication. Additionally, we show a unique ability of replication factor C (RFC) to stimulate Polδ lesion bypass, independent of its sliding clamp. This suggests that there may be a coordination between Polδ and RFC that does not involve RFC loading of PCNA.",

Targeting this pathway represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human REV1, a ca. 100 amino acid scaffold essential for TLS polymerase interactions, disrupts REV1/POLζ-dependent TLS in mammalian cells. Inducible expression of REV1-CTD in multiple human and murine cancer cell lines sensitizes cells to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, and methyl methanesulfonate, without intrinsic cytotoxicity. REV1-CTD expression increases genomic instability, decreases mutagenesis, and enhances G2 arrest following genotoxic stress. Mutational disruption of the CTD’s interaction interfaces abrogates these effects, confirming a dominant-negative mechanism via sequestration of TLS components. In a xenograft mouse model, REV1-CTD expression markedly enhances cisplatin efficacy, significantly reducing tumor burden. These findings establish the REV1-CTD as an effective dominant-negative inhibitor of TLS and support its development as a therapeutic agent delivered to cancer cells to enhance the efficacy of genotoxic chemotherapy.",

Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) was identified as strongly elevated in the lungs and sera of aged human (&gt;65 y old) and mouse (&gt;21 mo old). ApoD was able to localize to mitochondria and interact, through its WXXI motif in the LC3B-Interacting Region domain, with LC3B to trigger mitophagy during IAV infection, in a PINK1 pathway independent manner, which attenuated type I interferon response and promoted virus replication. ApoD deficiency, on the other hand, protected older mice from severe influenza and improved survival. Likewise, depletion of senescent cells by ABT-263, a senolytic compound, in aged mice lowered ApoD level and restored innate immune antiviral response, limiting virus propagation and associated pulmonary damage. Thus, age-induced ApoD drives IAV-mediated mitophagy, and promotes virus replication and infection severity, and is therefore a promising target for inhibition to improve disease outcome in older patients.",

          "abstract": "Ovulation is an intricate process that is essential for reproductive success. In Drosophila melanogaster , ovulation increases after mating. This increase is initiated by the male seminal fluid protein ovulin and is executed by female pathways, including octopamine (OA) neuronal signaling. Despite OA signaling’s central role in ovulation regulation, the broader molecular landscape underlying female control of ovulation remains poorly understood. Here, using ovulin as a probe, we performed evolutionary rate covariation and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction screens to identify candidate female ovulation-regulating proteins. Ovulation assays performed on knockdowns or mutants of identified membrane-protein candidates revealed seven important female ovulation regulators: Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, mthl9, Smog, Cirl, and CG6067. Lgr3 and GabaβR1 function in an ovulin-dependent manner, while SIFaR and mthl9 regulate ovulation independently of ovulin. For proteins with known nervous system expression, we examined their requirement in OA neurons and their expression in female reproductive tract neurons. Tissue-specific knockdown revealed that Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, and CG6067 act in OA neurons to influence ovulation, highlighting OA neurons as a key signaling hub. Additionally, Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, Smog, and Cirl are expressed in OA neurons innervating the reproductive tract, suggesting a potential local function. Finally, we identified evidence of recurrent positive selection having acted on residues within Smog’s ligand binding region, which is interesting in light of ovulin’s rapid evolution. Together, these findings significantly expand our understanding of the molecular networks regulating ovulation following mating in Drosophila .",

          "abstract": "Animals can improve their decision-making abilities by integrating information from multiple senses, which is especially beneficial when living in fluctuating environments. However, understanding how wild predators may use multimodal sensing when hunting prey in split-second interactions remains largely unexplored. As nocturnal hunters, bats rely on echolocation to navigate and to locate evasive prey, yet they have retained functional vision, despite the associated costs. We therefore hypothesized that bats use vision to enhance sensory redundancy when commuting and tracking small insects. To test this, we equipped 21 wild common noctule bats ( Nyctalus noctula ) with high-resolution light, sound, and motion sensor loggers and measured their echolocation and movements while commuting and foraging in both dark and lit environments. When commuting, the bats maintained consistent echolocation sampling across light levels. However, when tracking prey in illuminated environments, the bats emitted calls with half the rate and with 7 dB higher call levels compared to in dark conditions, but at much faster approach speeds (from 5.2 in darkness to 7.9 m/s in lit conditions). This suggests that, in illuminated environments, hunting bats integrate acoustic and visual information, resulting in more efficient approaches to prey. Our findings demonstrate how a wild sensory specialist predator uses multimodal sensing to hunt efficiently in highly dynamic resource landscapes.",

This year’s Lasker Basic Science Award is given to Steven McKnight and Dirk Görlich for their pioneering work on such low-complexity domains (LCDs). They showed, using a variety of elegant approaches, that such LCDs can form homotypic and heterotypic interactions that lead to reversible phase separations in cells. These phase separations, which in the laboratory manifest as hydrogels and in cells as membrane free structures (liquid condensates) such as P bodies and stress granules, form hubs for molecular processes such as transcription and messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and also underlie the selectivity of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which act a barriers to large molecules unless they are escorted by specific LCD containing nuclear transporters that interact with LCD containing nucleoporins within NPC channels. Naturally occurring LCD mutations linked to neurodegeneration and other diseases cause the formation of irreversible (rather than reversible) LCD polymers, resulting in insoluble, amyloid-like, fibrils, underscoring the critical importance of these domains.",

          "abstract": "Organisms often face multiple selective pressures simultaneously (e.g., mine tailings with multiple heavy metal contaminants), yet we know little about when adaptation to one stressor provides cross-tolerance or cross-intolerance to other stressors. To explore the potential for cross-tolerance, we adapted Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high concentrations of six single metals in a short-term evolutionary rescue experiment. We then measured cross-tolerance of each metal-adapted line to the other five metals. We tested three predictors for the degree of cross-tolerance, based on similarity in 1) the physiochemical properties of each metal pair, 2) the overlap in genes known to impact tolerance to both metals, and 3) their co-occurrence in the environment. None of these predictors explained significant variation in cross-tolerance. Instead, the strongest predictor was the metal in which adaptation occurred: Cobalt-adapted lines performed well in most metals (generalists) while manganese-adapted lines typically performed poorly (specialists). To determine the genetic basis, we sequenced the genomes of 109 metal-adapted lines. Broader cross-tolerance characterized lines bearing mutations affecting phosphorus metabolism, with three genes related to phosphate metabolism bearing several independent mutations ( PHO84 , SIW14 , VTC4 ). Thus, while a genome-wide analysis failed to predict cross-tolerance, a subset of genes facilitated growth in multiple metals. We also observed two “mutator” lines (both in manganese) and report evidence that cadmium, cobalt, and manganese altered the mutation spectrum. While it is challenging to predict how evolutionary adaptation to one stressor will impact tolerance to other stresses, our work helps reveal the environments and pathways that contribute to cross-tolerance among metals.",

However, dozens of historically clear streams have recently turned orange and turbid. Thawing permafrost is thought to have exposed sulfide minerals to weathering, delivering iron and other potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report stream water metal concentrations throughout the federally designated Wild and Scenic Salmon River watershed and compare them with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic (4-d) exposure thresholds for toxicity to aquatic life. The main stem of the Salmon had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca relative to a predisturbance baseline for most of its length, consistent with increased sulfide mineral weathering. Most of the tributaries also had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca, especially those in the upper watershed. The Salmon River mainstem consistently exceeded EPA chronic exposure thresholds for total recoverable iron, total recoverable aluminum, and dissolved cadmium from its first major tributary to its mouth. Nine of ten major tributaries that we sampled exceeded EPA thresholds for at least one metal on at least one of three sampling dates. Our findings indicate that habitat quality for resident and anadromous fish has been severely degraded in the Salmon River watershed. Loss of important spawning habitat in the Salmon and many other streams in the region might help explain a recent crash in chum salmon returns, which local communities depend upon for commercial and subsistence harvest.",

Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of sporadic and familial BDII patients, we found that Serinc2 expression showed deficits in iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, resulting in decreased synaptic pruning. Further, combining the microglia-specific Serinc2-deficient mouse and iPSC-microglia models, we found that microglial Serinc2 deficits functioned through attenuating the synthesis of serine-related phospholipids in the plasma membrane, thus resulting in depression-like behavioral abnormalities in the animals. Finally, we showed that the Serinc2-dependent lipid deficits diminished microglial membrane CR3 formation to interrupted synaptic pruning signals from neurons. Therefore, our results indicated that Serinc2 deficits in microglia might contribute to the pathogenesis of BD.",

          "abstract": "Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) is the central prey species in the Southern Ocean food web, supporting the largest and fastest-growing fishery in the region, managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Climate change is threatening krill populations and their predators, while current catch limits do not take into account climate variability or krill population dynamics. In 2024, CCAMLR was unable to renew its spatial catch limits, highlighting the urgent need for improved management of the krill fishery to prevent any harm to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. To address this, we propose a management framework that integrates variability in krill recruitment and key pathways between spawning and nursery areas—a krill stock hypothesis—to inform decisions on catch limits and conservation measures. Implementing this approach will require targeted data collection, which we propose can be achieved through a multisector collaborative network that combines traditional and new technologies, including the use of fishing vessels as data collection platforms. We use case studies to demonstrate how fisheries can contribute to data collection while promoting sustainable management. A major challenge in this effort is securing long-term funding for data collection, which is critical for managing climate-sensitive populations of high commercial interest. We therefore recommend using the industry as a source of funding, research platform and data provider, alongside national research funding opportunities. Given the fundamental role of krill in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, its decline would have cascading effects on predators and essential ecosystem services.",

          "abstract": "Excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs), composed of the glycine-binding NMDA receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN3A, have recently emerged as a novel neuronal signaling modality that challenges the traditional view of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Unlike conventional GluN1/GluN2 NMDARs, the distribution and role of eGlyRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that eGlyRs are highly enriched in the ventral hippocampus (VH) and confer distinct properties on this brain region. eGlyRs display a massive expression in both VH CA1 pyramidal cells and SST- and PV-positive interneurons, whereas in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) pyramidal cells lack these receptors. eGlyRs mediate excitatory tonic currents and control VH network excitability. They are also responsible for the attenuated long-term potentiation (LTP) in the VH compared with the DH, providing a molecular basis for this difference. Furthermore, eGlyRs are required for regulation of VH LTP by corticosterone, pointing to eGlyRs as mediators of the neuroendocrine stress response. Consistent with this pervasive influence in the ventral division of the hippocampus, eGlyRs contribute to the modulation of anxiety-related behaviors. Our work identifies eGlyRs as key players in VH circuitry and function, demonstrating their intimate association with brain regions that control internal states and emotional processing.",

The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue.

          "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) may activate or repress gene expression through an interplay of different mechanisms, including RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruitment, exclusion, and initiation. However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.",

          "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte hypocontractility underlies inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Yet, whether fibroblasts modify DCM phenotypes remains unclear despite their regulation of fibrosis, which strongly predicts disease severity. Expression of a hypocontractility-linked sarcomeric variant in mice triggered cardiac fibroblast expansion from the de novo formation of hyperproliferative-mechanosensitized fibroblast states, which occurred prior to eccentric myocyte remodeling. Initially this fibroblast response reorganized fibrillar collagen and stiffened the myocardium albeit without depositing fibrotic tissue. These adaptations coincided with heightened matrix-integrin receptor interactions and diastolic tension sensation at focal adhesions within fibroblasts. Targeted p38 deletion arrested these cardiac fibroblast responses in DCM mice, which prevented cardiomyocyte remodeling and improved contractility. In conclusion, p38-mediated fibroblast responses were essential regulators of DCM severity, marking a potential cellular target for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Speciation, the process by which new reproductively isolated species emerge from ancestral populations, results from the gradual accumulation of barriers to gene flow within genomes. To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.",

          "abstract": "Conventional wisdom suggests that wildfires in the western United States (WUS) degrade air quality nationwide as a result of aerosol emissions and eastward transport. However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM 2.5 ) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM 2.5 pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin is essential in shaping social behavior across the lifespan. Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.",

A network of 819 pigments was found in Eh-PSI-FCPI, which functions to capture and transfer light energy with 95% quantum efficiency.

Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + ·(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale. These results quantify the kinetics of proton transfers in the context of a closed, finite system at well-defined internal energies and therefore provide experimental benchmarks for theoretical efforts that are being developed to treat relatively slow, highly cooperative solvent-mediated chemical processes.",

This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked.

We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%). Aggregation-focused metrics confirmed increases in 57 to 83% of forests. Human activities such as agriculture and logging drive this change.

          "abstract": "Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing threatens the sustainability of fisheries and communities dependent on them. The Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) is a key tool for combatting IUU fishing by foreign fleets, requiring standardized inspections, information sharing, and port denial. Using satellite data, we characterized how PSMA has affected high seas vessel behavior and identify opportunities to strengthen its impact. PSMA adoption has increased travel distances to the nearest ports in States not Party to PSMA and channeled more fishing effort to domestic and PSMA Party ports. However, domestic fishing fleets need greater attention because they constituted 66% of port visits in 2021. Among reflagged vessels, we also found a 30% increase in visits to PSMA ports by vessels shifting to domestic flags after PSMA entered into force, allowing them to avoid PSMA requirements for foreign vessels. Our results highlight the centrality of implementing consistent, effective port State measures across foreign and domestic fleets to address IUU fishing risks.",

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is largely driven by overuse of antibiotics, which is particularly common in low- and middle-income countries. We combine provider knowledge assessments and over 2000 anonymous standardized patient visits to providers in India to examine why they overprescribe antibiotics for pediatric diarrhea and figure out how to reduce overprescribing. Seventy percent of providers prescribed antibiotics without indication of bacterial infection. Knowledge gaps explain little: 62% of providers who knew antibiotics were inappropriate still prescribed them. Closing this “know-do gap” would reduce prescribing by 30 percentage points, versus only 6 points if all providers had perfect knowledge. Using randomized experiments, we revealed that the know-do gap stems from providers’ beliefs that patients want antibiotics, not from profit motives or lack of alternative treatments. Yet, a discrete choice experiment suggests patients do not prefer providers who give antibiotics. Our findings indicate that addressing provider misperceptions about patient preferences may be more effective than standard information-based interventions in reducing antibiotic overuse.",

          "abstract": "HIV-1 evades immune responses by modulating plasma membrane receptors. Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4 + T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4 + T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96 Hi CD4 + T cells exhibited a proinflammatory T H 1/T H 17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of T H 1/T H 17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4 + T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target.",

Variations in translation rhythm can cause misfolding linked to disease; however, predicting cotranslational folding pathways remains challenging. Here, we computationally predict and experimentally validate a vectorial hierarchy of folding resolved at the atomistic level, where early intermediates are stabilized through non-native hydrophobic interactions before rearranging into the native-like fold. Disrupting these interactions destabilizes intermediates and impairs folding. The chaperone trigger factor alters the cotranslational folding pathway by keeping the nascent peptide dynamic until the full domain emerges.

A data-driven topology optimization framework enables efficient search of the optimal 2D precursor pattern that maximizes out-of-plane dimension of the resulting 3D network material. Computational and experimental results demonstrate rational assembly of optimal multilayer precursor structures into well-architected 3D network materials with an evident interlayer separation.

          "abstract": "Sterols are essential isoprenoid derivatives that contribute to membrane structure and function. In plants, they also serve as precursors to phytohormones and specialized metabolites important for development, defense, and health. Although the sterol biosynthetic pathway is considered well-characterized, we report the discovery of a plant-specific cytochrome b 5 –like protein, CB5LP, as a critical component of phytosterol biosynthesis. Loss of CB5LP in Arabidopsis causes embryonic defects, seedling lethality, and accumulation of 14α-methyl-sterols, with reduced levels of sitosterol and stigmasterol—indicating a defect in sterol 14α-demethylation. TurboID-based proximity labeling and in vitro assays show that CB5LP physically and functionally interacts with CYP51, a cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing this demethylation step. Unlike canonical cytochrome b 5 proteins, CB5LP has a reversed topology and is exclusive to plants, acting as an evolutionarily distinct electron donor. This discovery reveals an uncharacterized redox partnership essential for sterol biosynthesis and highlights a promising target for the development of selective herbicide.",

          "abstract": "Insects, unlike vertebrates, use heteromeric complexes of odorant receptors and co-receptors for olfactory signal transduction. However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 ) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP 3 levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP 3 is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP 3 as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts. These findings elucidate the universal function of IP 3 in olfactory signal perception, shedding light on the key nodes of insect olfactory signal transduction.",

Here, we review evidence supporting this paradigm and quantify the differences in global and Northern Hemisphere estimates of the net land sink derived from atmospheric inversion and satellite-derived vegetation biomass time series. Our analysis, combined with additional synthesis, supports a hypothesis that the net land sink is substantially weaker than commonly reported. At a global scale, our estimate of the net land carbon sink is 0.8 ± 0.7 petagrams of carbon per year from 2000 through 2019, nearly a factor of two lower than the Global Carbon Project estimate. With concurrent adjustments to ocean (+8%) and fossil fuel (−6%) fluxes, we develop a budget that partially reconciles key constraints provided by vegetation carbon, the north-south CO 2 gradient, and O 2 trends. We further outline potential modifications to models to improve agreement with a weaker land sink and describe several approaches for testing the hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Ketonyl C -glycosides, a vital subclass of alkyl C -glycosides, play essential roles in drug discovery, biochemistry, and materials sciences. However, a practical strategy that merges bench-stable glycosyl donors with styrenes—a ubiquitous class of synthetic building blocks—remains elusive. Herein, we report a simple and general approach for synthesizing ketonyl C -glycosides. The transformation uses designed glycosyl sulfides as air- and moisture-stable precursors to glycosyl radicals, styrenes as aglycone sources, and dimethyl sulfoxide as both an oxidant and solvent, proceeding under photoredox catalysis. Glycosyl radicals are generated from glycosyl sulfides via efficient unimolecular homolytic substitution. This approach obviates harsh conditions for donor activation and the use of activated aglycone precursors, accommodating extensive functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction also exhibits high stereoselectivity across various glycosyl units. Demonstrating synthetic versatility, this method enables efficient access to diverse drug-sugar conjugates and complex C -glycopeptidomimetics. Mechanistic studies reveal key intermediates, suggesting a radical-polar crossover pathway. This study offers a broadly applicable approach to valuable sugar-containing structures.",

Our findings reveal higher reactivity of terrestrial organic matter released to the Laptev Sea and the eastern East Siberian Sea, lower reactivity in the western East Siberian Sea, and no deducible degradation in the Kara Sea. The reactivity of terrestrial organic matter is primarily determined by the degradation status and composition of its source, alongside potential microbiological controls during transport.

By monolithically integrating a TISE laser with a micro-ring resonator on an AlGaInAs multiple quantum-well platform, the proposed device achieves efficient photon injection and linewidth narrowing. Experimental characterization indicates stable single-mode operation over a wide injection current range (65 to 300 milliamperes), exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 decibels. The laser’s Voigt linewidth was reduced from 2 megahertz to 4.2 kilohertz, with an intrinsic linewidth of 983 hertz extracted from power spectrum density, underscoring the MOIL-TISE laser’s promise for coherent communications and modulation-free quantum key distribution applications.",

This weakening of correlations persists for hundreds of picoseconds and exhibits a recovery time independent of photodoping density across two orders of magnitude. A broadening of the charge-transfer gap is also observed, consistent with dynamical screening. The high degree of control achieved over both the energy and temporal dynamics of electronic correlations offers a promising avenue to a full optical control of correlated systems and the Mott transition.",

PTPN22 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling through dephosphorylation of the kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70). The regulation of PTPN22 remains poorly understood. Here, we identify PTPN22 Ser 449 as a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is triggered by TCR engagement and is hyperphosphorylated in lupus peripheral blood cells. PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation selectively lowered the affinity of PTPN22 for ZAP70 versus LCK but also indirectly suppressed inhibitory LCK Tyr 192 phosphorylation through a ZAP70-CD45 signaling axis. The resulting dephosphorylation of LCK Tyr 192 not only enhanced TCR signaling but also modulated pathway activation downstream the TCR. In vivo loss of PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation reduced T cell responses and suppressed experimental lupus nephritis. These results suggest that PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation promotes a CD45-mediated retrograde ZAP70-LCK feedback loop that enhances T cell responses and promotes autoimmunity.",

However, the brain is extensively interconnected, and the neurons comprising those connections may themselves be particularly susceptible to neurostimulation. Here, we test this hypothesis by identifying long-range projections in single-unit recordings from nonhuman primates receiving transcranial alternating current stimulation. We find that putative long-range projections are more strongly affected by stimulation than other cells. Specifically, they are both more entrained on average and account for occurrences of extremely strong entrainment. Given that stimulation appears to target the edges, rather than nodes, of neural networks, it may be necessary to rethink how neurostimulation strategies are designed.",

Using fluorescent-labeled AGs and flow cytometry, we quantified differential uptake. To enhance AG efficacy, we screened 198 carbon sources for their ability to induce transporter expression using a cmtA - gfp fusion. Uridine emerged as a strong inducer of cmtA and 12 additional AG-importing transporters. Coadministration of uridine considerably improved AG efficacy against clinical and resistant E. coli strains by enhancing drug uptake. This combination also improved outcomes in human blood ex vivo and in a murine urinary tract infection model.

To materialize this mapper, we developed an automated, in situ synthesis platform that facilitates the self-acting fabrication of robust, solid-state, chiral optical spin constrained assemblies. Our mappers, formed by randomized arrays of discrete assemblies, demonstrate near-theoretical performance in uniformity (0.4917), uniqueness (0.4968), and reliability (0.9355).

          "abstract": "Acute sleep deprivation (SD) rapidly alleviates depression, addressing a critical gap in mood disorder treatment. Rapid eye movement SD (REM SD) modulates the excitability of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons, influencing the synaptic plasticity of pyramidal neurons. However, the precise mechanism remains undefined. To investigate this, we used a modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to induce 12 hours of REM SD, specifically targeting VIP neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our results show that REM SD mitigated depression by suppressing VIP neurons activity, which directly increased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and, consequently, promoted synaptic plasticity recovery. In addition, the knockdown of VPAC2 on mPFC pyramidal neurons revealed that VPAC2-mediated AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in these neurons is essential for REM SD to mitigate depression-like behavior. These findings suggest that VIP neurons directly regulate pyramidal neurons and are crucial in alleviating depression by REM SD.",

We identified two conserved mechanisms controlling particle mobility: Ribosome concentration, a known regulator of cytoplasmic crowding, works in concert with a previously unknown function for the giant KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/SYNE homology) protein ANC-1 in providing structural constraints through associating with the endoplasmic reticulum.

          "abstract": "The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a key driver of global climate variability. Early-season westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been suggested to be important for ENSO evolution and diversity, with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) among the main sources of WWBs. However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role. These findings suggest that March MJO activity alone may not be a reliable predictor for ENSO evolution, but underscore the importance of North Pacific atmospheric variability.",

Identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the salt stress response is of great importance. Here, we uncovered the NAC-type transcription factor, TaVOZ1, as a positive regulator of wheat salt tolerance. Its overexpression could enhance yield and biomass production under salt stress, while TaVOZ1 knockdown attenuates salt tolerance. TaVOZ1 transcriptionally activates stress-responsive genes, especially HKT1 -family transporters, decreasing shoot Na + accumulation. However, the RING-type E3 ligase, TaGW2, directly interacts with and ubiquitinates TaVOZ1, promoting its ubiquitin/26 S proteasomal degradation. TaGW2 overexpression reduces salt tolerance, while its knockdown or knockout enhances wheat response to salt stress. Moreover, we found a moonlight function of TaGW2 wherein it binds the same DNA motifs as TaVOZ1 to block its up-regulation of HKT1 -family genes while coordinately governing both the salt tolerance and grain yield. This study highlights the functional versatility of TaGW2 and defines an antagonistic TaGW2-TaVOZ1 regulatory module in wheat salt tolerance.",

In a humanized xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, they dampen T cell activation, alleviate GVHD pathology, and prolong survival without impairing antileukemia activity. Mechanistically, CD8 T rp cells promote immune regulation by inducing FOXP3 expression in both CD4 T reg cells and themselves.

Knockout of either OsbZIP35 or OsTCP19 results in increased grain length, confirming their regulatory roles in grain development. The OsbZIP35-COR1-OsTCP19 module controls the expression of the cell cycle gene OsCycB1;4 , thereby modulating cell proliferation and ultimately determining grain size. Five haplotypes of COR1 were identified, with COR1 -Hap1 and COR1 -Hap3 being elite alleles associated with longer grains.

          "abstract": "Movement is executed through balanced excitation-inhibition in spinal motor circuits. Short-term perturbations in one type of neurotransmission are homeostatically counteracted by the opposing type, but prolonged excitation-inhibition imbalance causes dysfunction at both single neuron and circuit levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used functional, morphological, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable SMA motor circuits fail to respond homeostatically to reduced excitation and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment. Reducing inhibition genetically or pharmacologically improves neuronal function and motor behavior in SMA mice. Thus, the disruption of excitation-inhibition homeostasis is a major maladaptive mechanism that diminishes the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions in SMA.",

Both binders activate their targets when at low concentration, driving pore formation, but inhibit membrane permeabilization when in excess. Crystallography shows that the BAK binder induces BAK unfolding, exposing the α6 helix and BH3 domain. Together, these data suggest that upon binding, BAK or BAX unfold; at high binder concentrations, self-association of the partially folded BAK or BAX proteins is blocked and the membrane remains intact, whereas at low concentrations, dimers form, and the membrane ruptures.

The p at 200°C ( p  = 45.4 × 10 −4 C m −2  K −1 ) rises more than sevenfold compared to poling within the orthorhombic phase ( p  = 6.5 × 10 −4 C m −2  K −1 ), representing the highest value reported to date and offering benefit for high-temperature thermal sensing.

To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls.

A skin-adaptive focused ultrasound method with rational array design is proposed to implement measurement under wide ranges of skin curvatures and depths with improved sensing performances. We introduce a self-adhesive hydrogel layer to enhance the acoustic impedance matching, biocompatibility and contact reliability at device-skin interfaces, and a microelectromechanical systems-compatible process for batch-to-batch and high-consistency manufacturing.

The joint inversion of these geodetic data, template-matching seismicity, and repeating earthquakes, revealed the first two shallow slow slip events (SSEs) observed in Mexico. The first one migrated from the trench to the earthquake hypocenter before rupture, and the second one occurred following an M w 7.3 long-term SSE induced by the earthquake. Episodic near-trench oceanic-crust deformations (i.e., tilt transients) associated with shallow and deep synchronous decoupling of the plate interface reveal the occurrence of “slab-pull surges” before three regional earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, including the Acapulco event, suggesting that they may serve as rupture precursors observable in subduction zones.",

One of the core bottlenecks in multidimensional manipulation is the lack of a systematic design methodology, which prevents the generation of an acoustic field that simultaneously meets the collaborative control requirements of multi-degree-of-freedom forces and torques, making it difficult to achieve precise control under conditions of stable suspension, high-frequency rotation, and complex spatial constraints. To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end inverse design methodology for acoustic tweezers based on coding metasurfaces, establishing a dual-objective, dual-scale optimization paradigm. At the microscale, the phase modulation and transmission efficiency are co-optimized through coupled physical models. While at the mesoscale, the particle suspension and rotation dynamics are considered. Based on the inverse design framework constructed with a finite-bit element library, we successfully optimized the metasurface configuration with specific acoustic response characteristics and achieved noncontact, multi-degree-of-freedom customized manipulation of individual particles. This approach provides implementation pathways for adaptive multiscale strategies in precision engineering applications.",

We evaluated aging of diaphyseal strength and cortical bone loss in a European Holocene sample of 1881 adult humeri, femora, and tibiae. Diaphyseal aging did not differ between Early and Late Holocene adults, despite their differences in physical activity. Adult diaphyseal aging was accompanied by the disproportionate rate between a faster increase in the medullary area and an absent or marginal increase in the total area. This indicates that subperiosteal apposition did not fully biomechanically compensate for the medullary expansion. Diaphyseal strength remained unchanged through age in female femora and male diaphyses but declined in female humeri and tibiae. We highlight the importance of postnatal growth to compensate for adult medullary expansion. Diaphyseal aging is critical for the upper limbs, as humeri are more sensitive to aging than femora and tibiae.",

A critical component of the ECM mechanosensing machinery, including the protein talin, is organized at the cardiomyocyte costamere. Our previous work indicated a different talin tension, depending on the ECM stiffness, but the effects on downstream signaling remained elusive. Here, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule), and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at a specific ECM stiffness, this interaction is preserved in the absence of tension, and the interaction is regulated through focal adhesion kinase signaling. Moreover, DLC1 regulates cardiomyocyte RhoA activity in a stiffness-dependent way, whereby the loss of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin interactome to fine-tune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease.",

Subretinal injection confines transduction to the treated area. To address this, we manufactured high-concentration fibrin hydrogels encapsulating AAV2–green fluorescent protein (AAV2- GFP ). Gels had homogeneous AAV distribution, desired mechanical properties, and retained infectivity. Epiretinal placement of fibrin–AAV2- GFP ( n  = 11) was compared to subretinal ( n  = 5) and intravitreal AAV2- GFP injection ( n  = 3). The subretinal group exhibited inconsistent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transduction restricted to the injection region with severe atrophy in two cases. The intravitreal group had weak transduction and inflammation. In contrast, epiretinal hydrogels degraded within days and led to broad transduction of RPE without atrophy or inflammation.

Here, we found that the rib structure of a cicada’s tymbal exhibits exceptional toughness and fatigue resistance, attributed to its unique architecture composed of alternating soft and stiff polymer layers. Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life. The nanoconfined crystallization restricts molecular motion and disperses external forces within the crystalline structure, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties. These improvements enable the ARF to outperform commercial polymer films as an acoustic transducer, achieving 2.7 times increase in frequency response and 2.2 times increase in displacement amplitude.",

Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands.

More than 800 short-duration seismic events were detected within 28 days along a 150-kilometer profile, indicating widespread ongoing explosive gas release. We suggest that billions of tons of hydrogen gas were produced through serpentinization associated with fluid infiltration via fractures formed by bending of the oceanic plate. Hydrogen was retained in fractures sealed by mud and carbonate. However, hydrogen alone cannot produce the explosive capacity responsible for the formation of pipes. Oxygen released from circulating seawater can be concentrated at crustal depths and then mixed with mantle-derived hydrogen.

To address this critical need, we developed acoustofluidic-based system for targeted antibody removal in transplantation (A-START). A-START is engineered to handle small blood volumes and has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical small animal trials. In a sensitized rodent skin transplantation model, A-START only demands 240 microliters of blood, selectively removing donor-specific alloantibodies (DSAs) while preserving protective antibodies, such as tetanus antibodies. A-START retains ~95% of beneficial antibodies and achieves a 60% improvement in DSA removal compared to conventional methods.

We epitaxially grow arrays of crystal phase–engineered InP nanosheets with atomically smooth sidewalls as both the laser active medium and a symmetry-broken quasi-BIC cavity, strategically optimizing coupling between spontaneous emission and the lasing mode. Furthermore, we leverage the dipole selection rule associated with the wurtzite crystal structure of the nanosheets for side mode suppression, achieving single-mode lasing at room temperature with lasing threshold as low as 14 μJ cm −2 pulse −1 . Optimal light-cavity coupling is evidenced by spontaneous emission factors as high as 0.8, showcasing the potential of bottom-up BIC lasers in realizing near-thresholdless lasing at room temperature.",

          "abstract": "Mobile robots that simultaneously have fast speeds, sufficient load-carrying capabilities, and multiple locomotive functions have always been challenging to develop. Here, we introduce a liquid-amplified electrostatic rolling (LAER) mechanism, which elegantly integrates actuation and adhesion into a streamline single-degree-of-freedom structure. Based on this, we developed a rigid tethered LAER roller (0.015 grams) that exhibited a rapid moving speed of ~210 body length per second on ceilings and a flexible tethered roller (10.600 grams) that had a load-to-weight ratio of ~121 moving on the ground. Liquid regulating modules were embedded into LAER structures to exhibit controlled moving. We also developed a single-wheeled and two-wheeled untethered LAER robots with onboard power supply. Furthermore, we demonstrate a LAER linear actuator and a camera equipped untethered LAER robot for preliminary environmental monitoring. The lightweight, scalable LAER structure is promising to bring fast electrostatic actuators, motors, and robots with superior load-to-weight ratios and multimodal locomotion capabilities such as turning, circular moving, and plane-to-plane transitioning.",

Here, we incorporate a DNA cassette tape with 5.5 × 10 5 addressable data partitions (addressing rate up to 1570 partitions per second), a DNA loading capacity of 28.6 mg per kilometer, and deposit-many-recover-many (DMRM) features per partition to flexibly manage large-scale storage data and achieve hundreds of years of data preservation. We develop a compact DNA cassette tape drive and verify its functionality by randomly depositing incomplete images into the data partition, demonstrating a completely automated closed-loop operation involving addressing, recovery, removal, subsequent file deposition, and file recovery again, all accomplished within 50 min. Last, the complete image is restored by next-generation sequencing and decoding. DNA cassette tape provides a strategy for fast, compact, large-scale DNA-based cold or warm data storage.",

          "abstract": "Being naturally hyperglycemic and insulin insensitive, birds maintain plasma glucose levels twice as high as mammals of similar size. Recent evidence suggests that perturbation of myo-inositol (MI) plays a role in mammalian hyperglycemic regulation. Using an integrative approach, we identify a fundamental role of MI in avian metabolism. We show that MI transporters are highly conserved across birds and that dietary MI reduces fat accumulation in Anna’s hummingbirds. MI consumption by hummingbirds varies with seasonal changes in body mass, consistent with a regulatory role. Furthermore, MI enhances fatty acid oxidation in avian cells, via effects on pyruvate-dehydrogenase complexes, indicating a role in mitochondrial fuel selection. Our findings underscore the importance of MI in avian metabolism, offering insights into their evolutionary adaptations in the context of insulin insensitivity.",

Genomic profiles from 853,005 cells mapped to 12 pancreatic cell types, including multiple exocrine subtypes. β, Acinar, and other cell types, and related cellular niches, had altered abundance and gene activity in T1D progression, including distinct pathways altered in AAB + compared to T1D. We identified epigenomic drivers of gene activity in T1D and AAB + which, combined with genetic association, revealed causal pathways of T1D risk including antigen presentation in β cells. Last, single-cell and spatial profiles together revealed widespread changes in cell-cell signaling in T1D including signals affecting β cell regulation. Overall, these results revealed drivers of T1D in the pancreas, which form the basis for therapeutic targets for disease prevention.",

          "abstract": "Most studies on modern Asian monsoon formation focus on mechanisms arising within the Afro-Eurasian continent, while fewer compare the effects from remote continents. Here, we explore this question using a coupled climate model. We show that the existence of the North American continent is critical for the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. The mechanism involves North America acting as an additional heating center, resulting in the strengthening and extension of oceanic advection toward the monsoon region. This is achieved via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism that strengthens the North Pacific subtropical high and through a widespread Northern Hemisphere heating that shifts the Hadly circulation subsidence center poleward. This teleconnection is independent of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, and its impact on East Asian summer precipitation is found to be smaller but comparable to that of Tibet. The individual role of other continents outside Afro-Eurasia is found to be less important.",

The achieved ultrahigh power factor of up to 30.0 microwatts per centimeter per square kelvin and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.38 watts per meter per kelvin at room temperature are attributed to the synergy of modulated modest carrier concentration and weighted mobility in homo-layer films. These results bring forth a maximum output power density of 300 watts per square meter at a temperature gradient of 60 kelvin and a normalized cooling factor of 0.6, which is sufficient to sustain consumer electronics with large-area manufacturing of up to 120 square centimeters. Our developed homo-layer deposition with industry compatibility and scalability potentials highlights a facile yet cost-effective strategy, not only for structure-property relation manipulation in inorganic semiconductors but also for solid-state electronic fabrication for heat harvesting and management frontiers.",

          "abstract": "Breastfeeding is essential for reducing infant morbidity and mortality, yet exclusive breastfeeding rates remain low, often because of insufficient milk production. The molecular causes of low milk production are not well understood. Fresh milk samples from 30 lactating individuals, classified by milk production levels across postpartum stages, were analyzed using genomic and microbiome techniques. Bulk RNA sequencing of milk fat globules (MFGs), milk cells, and breast tissue revealed that MFG-derived RNA closely mirrors luminal milk cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA analyses identified changes in gene expression and cellular composition, highlighting key genes ( GLP1R , PLIN4 , and KLF10 ) and cell-type differences between low and high producers. Infant microbiome diversity was influenced by feeding type but not maternal milk production. This study provides a comprehensive human milk transcriptomic catalog and highlights that MFG could serve as a useful biomarker for milk transcriptome analysis, offering insights into the genetic factors influencing milk production.",

          "abstract": "Integrins bind ligands between their alpha (α) and beta (β) subunits and transmit signals through conformational changes. Early in chordate evolution, some α subunits acquired an “inserted” (I) domain that expanded integrin’s ligand-binding repertoire but obstructed the ancestral ligand pocket, seemingly blocking conventional integrin activation. Here, we compare cryo–electron microscopy structures of apo and ligand-bound states of the I domain–containing αEβ 7 integrin and the I domain–lacking α 4 β 7 integrin to illuminate how the I domain intrinsically mimics an extrinsic ligand to preserve integrin function. We trace the I domain’s evolutionary origin to an ancestral collagen-collagen interaction domain, identifying an ancient molecular exaptation that facilitated integrin activation immediately upon I domain insertion. Our analyses reveal the evolutionary and biochemical basis of expanded cellular communication in vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Chromosomal fissions and fusions are common, yet the molecular mechanisms and implications in speciation remain poorly understood. Here, we confirm a fission event in one zokor species through multiple-omics and functional analyses. We traced this event to a mutation in a splicing enhancer of the DNA repair gene Aplf in the fission-bearing species, which caused exon skipping and produced a truncated protein that disrupted DNA repair. An intronic deletion in Dna2 , known to facilitate neo-telomere formation when knocked out, reduced gene activity. These variants collectively drove chromosomal fission in this zokor species. The newly formed chromosome became fixed due to carrying essential genes and strong selective pressure. While geographic isolation likely initiated the divergence of this species and the sister one, the fission event and associated decline at the chromosome level in gene flow probably exacerbated the speciation process. Our work elucidates the genetic basis of chromosomal fission and underscores its role in speciation dynamics.",

          "abstract": "What drives upwardly mobile individuals to support their families of origin, and what are the consequences of such support? This article examines how upward social mobility intersects with kin support in contemporary Chile. Drawing on sixty interviews with individuals who have attained high-status professions, it finds that such support is driven by a deeply internalized sense of duty to maintain close family ties. Kin assistance takes financial, occupational, and caregiving forms, often extending beyond the nuclear family. Yet these obligations carry significant emotional, financial, and professional costs—particularly for women. In response, individuals develop strategies to manage and delimit kin demands. By shedding new light on the normative drivers and multifaceted consequences of kin support, the article contributes to a relational understanding of social mobility and calls for a broader, comparative agenda on how mobility unfolds in contexts marked by high inequality, weak welfare provision, and strong familistic norms.",
