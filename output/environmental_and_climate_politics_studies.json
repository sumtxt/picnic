          "authors": "Jeremiah Bohr",
          "abstract": "This study employs word embedding regression to examine the meaning of climate change in U.S. congressional discourse on Twitter from 2015–2022. By analyzing semantic variations across partisanship, district CO 2 emissions, climate vulnerability, and constituent education levels, it offers novel insights into political communication on this issue. Results reveal less partisan polarization around climate change compared to contentious issues like abortion, guns, and immigration, with polarization decreasing in recent years. Notably, congressional representatives show greater polarization on climate change meaning in districts with fewer per capita emissions or higher shares of college graduates. This computational approach allows for systematic investigation of semantic meaning across social groups and time, contributing to our knowledge of how politicians frame climate change. The findings challenge common assumptions about partisan divides on climate issues and highlight the complex interplay between local factors and political discourse, offering implications for climate communication strategies and policy development.",

          "abstract": "Environmental organizations play an active role in electoral politics, yet these interventions have received far less study than the movement’s efforts at public persuasion or policy advocacy. We examine the effect of environmental voter mobilization on turnout and attitudes among supporters of a Canadian environmental organization. Through a field experiment during the 2017 British Columbia election, we evaluate two prevalent types of get-out-the-vote (GOTV) conversations – a regular GOTV conversation focused on vote plan-making, and an issue GOTV conversation that first engaged respondents in a personal discussion about environmentalism. For both GOTV interventions, we estimate a positive yet borderline significant effect on turnout. Neither GOTV intervention strengthened environmental attitudes, and the regular GOTV intervention may have even decreased en-vironmental issue salience. Our research illuminates the challenges that climate advocates face in mobilizing their constituents, while demonstrating their potential for influence on the electorate.",

          "abstract": "Concerns about adverse security implications of climate change have fostered a booming research agenda and have also gained increasing traction in international political fora, such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). To what extent do policy discourses and decisions reflect the scientific understanding of the problem? Here, we assess evidence on uptake of scientific research on climate change and violent conflict in high-level UNSC debates, 2007–2022. We show that UNSC member states increasingly acknowledge climate-conflict risks as real but context-dependent, consistent with recent academic literature on the topic. Even so, views remain divided among prominent Council members, blocking progress on this matter. Explicit engagement with science on climate change and conflict, which might have helped resolve disagreements, remains rare and partly selective. We highlight challenges and opportunities for the scientific community to improve the perceived relevance and accessibility of research to stakeholders and strengthen science-policy interaction.",

          "abstract": "Global climate change science-policy assessments have historically relied on emissions and mitigation scenarios, with relatively limited uptake in adaptation or vulnerability research. Reframing global climate scenarios can enhance their relevance in these fields. A systematic review of 155 studies involving regional scenario development reveals five key perspectives for regionalising the global Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) narratives. While top-down approaches largely dominate, multigenerational regional scenario analyses are emerging, where first-generation regional SSPs provide context for second-generation or further extensions. Participatory methods increasingly integrate bottom-up approaches, offering novel insights into cross-scale consistency. By positioning global scenarios as both boundary objects and boundary conditions, this study highlights the opportunity to expand towards more diverse regional scenarios, potentially broadening engagement with impact, adaptation, and vulnerability scholars beyond the Global North.",

          "abstract": "Municipalities face growing challenges in independently managing frequent and severe external shocks, often constrained by limited relief supplies and inefficient allocation strategies. Here we develop and implement hybrid coordination strategies that integrate cross-regional and multi-entity resource allocation to enhance national flood resilience across China’s eight major river basins. By incorporating cross-regional coordination among government reserves, we demonstrate that the 12-h demand coverage rate (DCR) for 1-in-100-year basin flood events can increase from 15% to 51%. Expanding to multi-entity coordination, which integrates enterprise reserves, further improves the 12-h DCR to 76%. Optimizing enterprise contractual reserve proportions can achieve complete demand coverage, even in the Yangtze and Pearl River basins with dense populations and large relief shortages. Our work provides insights into operational disaster relief coordination and informs flood management strategies for other countries facing extreme flooding challenges.",

          "abstract": "Climate-induced hazards are becoming more frequent and severe, causing escalating economic losses worldwide. Consequently, climate change adaptation is increasingly necessary to protect people, nature and the economy. However, little is known about who is adapting and how much they spend on adaptation measures, especially in the private sector. This article focuses on firms—the backbone of economic development, yet understudied in climate adaptation research. Here we present insights from a unique panel dataset detailing businesses’ adaptation investments across 28 European countries (2018–2022), 5 hazard types, and 19 economic sectors. Our descriptive analysis reveals low but increasing adaptation investments across Europe (0.15–0.92% of national gross domestic product, annually increasing by 30.6–37.4%). Moreover, we highlight considerable differences in adaptation intensity across sectors, including low adaptation intensity in manufacturing and retail trade. Additionally, our econometric analysis indicates that public adaptation spending crowds in private investments in adaptation, highlighting opportunities to facilitate autonomous adaptation.",

Bamber, Alessandro Longo, Danilo Di Genova",
          "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions, driven by magma fragmentation, pose significant geohazards due to their rapid energy release and widespread dispersal of pyroclasts. High magma viscosity promotes brittle fragmentation by limiting volatile escape and enhancing internal pressure buildup. Although recent studies have recognized that iron-titanium oxide nanocrystal formation increases melt viscosity, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly constrained. Here we quantify the influence of nanocrystallization on magma viscosity by developing viscosity models that incorporate iron-titanium variations, calibrated against nanocrystal-free andesitic melts. Using time-resolved imaging, we show that nanocrystals form within seconds within synthetic andesitic melts. This process generates nanoscale chemical heterogeneities, including silica enrichment in the surrounding melt and aluminum-rich shells embedding the nanocrystals. These heterogeneities result in viscosity increases of up to 30-fold at eruptive temperatures. Our findings indicate that nanocrystallization modulates magma rheology during early crystallization, with direct implications for the dynamics of andesitic eruptions.",

          "abstract": "Fundamental ecological questions about the distribution of ocean life remain unanswered, hindering both the effective management of the ocean, and our comprehension of life on this planet. The benthic and pelagic realms are subject to different methods of study, and to understand where to best focus effort, a thorough understanding of existing information is required, allowing identification of critical knowledge gaps. Open-access data repositories provide a valuable means to identify such gaps; however, these repositories are subject to challenges in separating benthic from pelagic data. Here we demonstrate an automated data pipeline for extracting and separating benthic from pelagic data in open-access repositories. By stratifying data against essential ocean variables in a critical gap analysis, we show that large spatial and taxonomic biases exist in both the benthic and pelagic global datasets, favouring depths shallower than ~100 m, the northern hemisphere, and vertebrate species. The newly compiled, cleaned, and classified dataset is used to identify areas of chronic under sampling and high-priority regions for exploration. We argue that coordinated strategic prioritisation of sampling is needed to support modelling and prediction, enabling us to better manage our oceans and comprehend life on Earth.",

          "abstract": "Carbon mineralization in humidified carbon dioxide offers a promising route to mitigate anthropogenic emissions in a world stressed by water security. Despite its technological importance, our understanding of carbonation in water-poor environments lags, as traditional dissolution-precipitation pathways struggle to explain the adsorbed water nanofilm-mediated reactivity. Here, we utilize in operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and advanced molecular simulations to investigate nanoconfined reactions driving forsterite carbonation, the magnesium-rich olivine. By examining magnesium ion dissolution and transport in atomistic simulations of the forsterite-water-carbon dioxide interface and comparing these with the in operando XRD activation energies, we identify both processes as rate-limiting at saturation. Our simulations reveal a mechanistic view of interfacial carbonation, where dissolution and precipitation are mediated by anomalous quasi two-dimensional diffusion. The transport process involves intermittent diffusive hopping in the desorbed state, separated by crawling events that are spatially short but temporally long. This understanding transcends carbon mineralization, with implications for understanding the transport of contaminants in geosystems, the design of multifunctional materials, water desalination, and molecular recognition systems.",

          "abstract": "The Western Antarctic Peninsula is undergoing rapid environmental change. Regional warming is causing increased glacial meltwater discharge, but the ecological impact of this meltwater over large spatiotemporal scales is not well understood. Here, we leverage 20 years of remote sensing data, reanalysis products, and field observations to assess the effects of sea surface glacial meltwater on phytoplankton biomass and highlight its importance as a key environmental driver for this region’s productive ecosystem. We find a strong correlation between meltwater and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a across multiple time scales and datasets. We attribute this relationship to nutrient fertilization by glacial meltwater, with potential additional contribution from surface ocean stabilization associated with sea-ice presence. While high phytoplankton biomass typically follows prolonged winter sea-ice seasons and depends on the interplay between light and nutrient limitation, our results indicate that the positive effects of increased glacial meltwater on phytoplankton communities likely mitigate the negative impact of sea-ice loss in this region in recent years. Our findings underscore the critical need to consider glacial meltwater as a key ecological driver in polar coastal ecosystems.",

Using eDNA metabarcoding, we identified diverse communities, with Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota dominating prokaryotic communities, while Gyrista (mostly diatoms), Fungi and Arthropods were prevalent among eukaryotes. Geographic location significantly influenced community composition, with differences between the Bransfield Strait and the Gerlache Strait/Bellingshausen Sea.

          "abstract": "Sea-air exchange of carbon dioxide in the Southern Ocean is strongly seasonal, with ocean uptake in summer, which is partly offset by carbon dioxide outgassing in winter. This seasonal balance can shift due to sea ice conditions, inducing interannual variability in the Southern Ocean carbon sink. A decade (2010–2020) of unique, year-round marine carbonate chemistry observations from the Rothera Time Series (West Antarctic Peninsula) reveals that interannual variability in seawater fugacity of carbon dioxide depends on wintertime processes. Sea ice duration controls ocean stratification, which acts as a gateway to the carbon-rich ocean interior. Consequently, years with persistent sea ice cover and high mean winter stratification absorb, on average, 20% more carbon dioxide than years with less sea ice and weaker stratification in winter. Wintertime marine observations are therefore essential to resolve critical processes and reliably quantify interannual variability of the sea-air carbon dioxide flux in seasonally sea ice-covered regions.",

The hydrogeochemical analysis, supported by dimensional reduction and network-based clustering, linked one-third of the samples to contamination outbreaks from seawater intrusion, extensive gypsum dissolution in the south, and nitrate pollution in the ubiquitous carbonate aquifer matrix. Temporal variations of water quality indicated changes in regional recharge trends and increasing human impact in recent decades. Moreover, ~23% of water samples from human-use sources exceeded acceptable sulfate and nitrate limits for drinking water purposes.

But how these extremes evolve in response to climate change remains unexplored. Here we show that the statistical distribution of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index grows wider with increasing global warming in large ensembles of climate change simulations as well as reanalysis data. Such an amplified variability of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation caused by global warming leads to a higher probability of summer North Atlantic Oscillation extremes — for both positive and negative phases — accompanied by an amplification of their impacts on surface temperature over northwestern Europe. Changes in summer North Atlantic Oscillation extremes highlight the effects of climate change on the transient behaviour of the atmosphere, and thus have important implications for extreme weather attribution.",

We use tree ring oxygen isotope records to confirm that the Amazon hydrological cycle has intensified since 1980. Diverging isotopic trends from terra firme and floodplain trees from distinct sites (approximately 1000 km apart) in Western Amazon indicate rainfall amounts increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season at large-scale. Using the Rayleigh distillation model, we estimate that wet season rainfall increased by 15–22%, and dry season rainfall decreased by 8–13%. These diverging trends provide evidence, independent from existing climate records, that the seasonality of the hydrological cycle in the Amazon is increasing. Continuation of the observed trends will have a pervasive impact on Amazon forests and floodplain ecosystems, and strongly affect the livelihoods of the regional riverine communities.",

          "abstract": "Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important.",

Our findings revealed that total methane flux from non-glacier-fed lakes were approximately three times higher than from glacier-fed lakes, with ebullition being the predominant emission pathway. Network analysis showed that the microbial community structure in glacier-fed lakes was more stable. The neutral community model confirmed deterministic processes mainly shape microbial assembly in glacial lakes with different recharge types. Microbial communities in glacier-fed lakes were more stable and tightly connected, while those in non-glacier-fed lakes were more fragmented.

But based on the timing and expression of change, it remains unclear whether this trigger was oceanic or atmospheric. We present data from a High Arctic Lake sediment sequence, whose geochronology was previously published, that suggests Heinrich Event 2 was preceded by atmospheric warming. Alkenone-inferred temperatures, geochemical indicators of stratification and provenance, and leaf wax-based information about moisture availability, all indicate summers warmed from 27.5 to 23.5 thousand years before present. This evidence supports the view that Heinrich Stadials were marked by extreme seasonality rather than year-round cold conditions.

Using observations of remotely sensed solar-induced vegetation fluorescence and terrestrial water storage, together with ecosystem flux data, we find that CMIP6 models overestimate the frequency of water limitation by 14% over land and 26% in the tropics. Model overestimation occurs over 57% of the land area, and 78% in the tropics. These too frequent water-limited conditions are not conclusively linked to a potential underestimation of land water storage capacity in the models, hinting at gaps in how ESMs represent rooting depths, plant water uptake, and plant water-use strategies.

During the last four decades, mean annual temperatures in the Arctic have increased on average by ~3 °C. Warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons likely drive increases in plant productivity throughout northern latitudes, but it is not clear whether warming has resulted in lateral spread of Arctic peatlands. Using long time-series Landsat satellite data, coupled with information gathered from fieldwork in situ, we show that Arctic peatlands have likely undergone lateral expansion over the last 40 years. On 21 transects from the edges of 16 extant peatlands in the European and Canadian Arctic (both high and low Arctic locations from 62 to 79°N), over two thirds of the peatland edges we studied showed statistically significant peak-summer greening (as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) in the last 15 to 20 years, compared to the period 1985–1995. Peak summer moisture (as normalised Difference Moisture Index) levels remained stable or increased at most study sites. The lateral expansion of Arctic peatlands suggests they are an increasingly important natural carbon sink, at least in the near term.",

The use of local forecast, however, faces challenges by increasing climate variability, which undermines farmers’ confidence in their forecast. This study addresses these challenges by developing a hybrid forecast that integrates both scientific and local forecast using machine learning techniques to improve precipitation predictions in northern Ghana. Results show that the hybrid forecast improves precipitation forecast accuracy by 23% and 33% compared to scientific forecast and local forecast, respectively. The best performance is achieved by combining two random forests or a voting classifier and a random forest. This research highlights the potential of machine learning to develop more accurate hybrid forecast than other statistical methods. Such enhanced precipitation forecasts could enable smallholder farmers in the Global South to make better-informed agricultural decisions, ultimately enhancing their livelihoods.",

Among the widespread impacts of exceptional heat, rising food prices are beginning to play a prominent role in public perception, now the second most frequently cited impact of climate change experienced globally, following only extreme heat itself. Recent econometric analysis confirms that abnormally high temperatures directly cause higher food prices, as impacts on agricultural production translate into supply shortages and food price inflation. These analyses&amp;#xD;track changes in overall price aggregates which are typically slow-moving, but specific food goods can also experience much stronger short-term spikes in response to extreme heat. In this perspective, we document numerous examples from recent years in which food prices of specific goods spiked in response to climate extremes. By evaluating the extremity of the associated climate conditions, we thereby build a global and climatological context for this phenomenon. We further review the knock-on societal risks which these effects may bring with the ongoing intensification of extremes under climate change. These range from increasing economic inequality and the&amp;#xD;burden on health systems, as well as destabilising monetary and political systems.

The results indicate that regional environmental policy convergence has statistically significant and positive direct and spillover effects. Conversely, stricter environmental policy intensity tends to hinder sustainability in both local and neighboring regions. Furthermore, empirical analysis demonstrates that environmental policy convergence generates significantly greater positive impacts than the suppressive effects caused by policy intensity, both in direct and spillover terms.

This study examines exposure, vulnerability, and resilience across three consecutive extreme events in the Portland metro area: the September 2020 wildfire-related air pollution, the February 2021 snowstorm, and the June 2021 heatwave. We used geographically weighted regression and Spearman rank correlation analysis to investigate relationships between hazard impacts, the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI), Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC), and proximity to community-based organizations (CBOs) in 416 census tracts. Our analysis reveals strong spatial correlations between wildfire-related air pollution, winter storm impacts, and extreme heat exposure. Communities already burdened by poor air quality, freezing precipitation, and urban heat island effects faced heightened cumulative risk. While this varied by neighborhood, racial minorities, migrant workers, non-U.S. citizens, and low-income households were significantly affected. In contrast, affluent communities with lower SoVI scores and higher BRIC values exhibited greater resilience and were less exposed to these hazards. Although CBOs were concentrated in areas with high SoVI, they were insufficient in mitigating disaster impacts. This study underscores the urgent need for multi-hazard resilience planning centered on advancing environmental justice, vulnerability reduction, CBO capacity building, and investment in critical infrastructure in at-risk communities.",

          "abstract": "The winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant pattern of atmospheric circulation variability over the North Atlantic region. It influences climate and weather such as surface air temperatures (SAT) downstream over Eurasia through establishing a large-scale teleconnection, but past studies on the NAO’s downstream teleconnection have been largely limited to observational data, and further evidence of downstream impacts and associated mechanisms from comprehensive climate modelling is desirable. This study quantifies and analyzes this teleconnection on an interannual timescale by using both ERA5 reanalysis, and five large ensembles from four climate simulation models. A particular focus is placed on dynamical pathways, as well as variability among ensemble members that modulates the teleconnection strength. Results suggest that NAO signals are propagated downstream by Rossby waves, efficiently transmitted through waveguides along both the polar and subtropical jet streams to Eastern Eurasia; while heat can be advected weakly from upstream, advection plays a rather local effect inducing temperature anomalies from the Pacific Ocean onshore. Multiple linear regression shows that internal climate variability significantly modulates the teleconnection: a more locally dominant NAO pattern, and narrower waveguides could strengthen the teleconnection. These two factors combine to explain up to 70% of variance in the teleconnection strength, with each contributing almost equally. Reanalysis data marginally agree with the regression model (1.9 standardized residuals higher in strength), suggesting potential model biases in jets and the NAO variability. Monitoring these modulating factors would be crucial to understanding downstream climate predictability and improving climate prediction models linked to the NAO.",

Climate change emergence is a key statistic used to quantify the impact of human activities on climate and inform climate change mitigation strategies. Previous studies determining when climate change has emerged, however, do not account for the combined uncertainty from historical observations and climate models. Here, we show that the emergence of regional warming is early, widespread, and robust to observational and model uncertainty. Warming has emerged over more than 90% of the global land surface as of 2020, and had emerged over more than 50% of the earth’s land surface by 2000. Emergence occurs despite observational and model uncertainty creating delays of more than 10 years over 75% of the land surface. These conclusions demonstrate that accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty is necessary for robust detection of climate change emergence.",

          "abstract": "A high degree of uncertainty persists regarding current and future emissions of methane from both natural and constructed wetlands. Part of the problem is the existence of “hot spots” of methane flux, which have not been clearly identified and studied at multiple scales. Methane has a short lifetime compared to carbon dioxide; thus, efforts to avoid methane hot spots from constructed wetlands can promptly decelerate the rate of atmospheric warming. In this study we measured methane fluxes using flux towers in a restored oligohaline wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where we previously identified a hot spot of methane flux using footprint-weighed flux maps and chambers. Our main objectives with this study were to determine why this hot spot occurs and what are the biogeochemical and microbiological conditions that lead to these high methane fluxes. We found four main mechanisms that explain the existence of the hot spot. 1) The hot spot was associated with areas where the water level was closer to the surface 2) Methane originated mostly from older unoxidized peat in deeper layers, which had a shorter migration pathway to the atmosphere at the hot spot location due to soil disturbance during wetland construction. 3) Relatively lower methane oxidation in the hot spot in the upper soil layer (10-30 cm under the surface), deduced from isotopic profiles in porewater carbon and upper-level methanotroph abundance. 4) Higher ebullition events at the hot spot that can be related to low water levels and lower bulk density throughout the soil profile. This study thus suggests that mitigating soil disturbances during wetland construction and managing water level can reduce the occurrence and magnitude of hot spots of methane flux in constructed wetlands.",

However, the specific effects of natural growth (NG) and artificial restoration (AR) of vegetation on surface hydrology remain unclear. Using a recently developed ecohydrological model, we demonstrate that NG and AR have contrasting spatial impacts on hydrological components across China’s Yellow River Basin, a hotspot with intensive human-driven revegetation over the recent decades. Our analysis identifies a critical annual precipitation threshold of 300 mm, below which both NG and AR have marginal hydrological impact. In regions where precipitation exceeds this threshold, NG significantly reduces evapotranspiration and increases runoff, while AR has the opposite effects. These results suggest that NG is a more sustainable strategy in areas receiving less than 300 mm of annual precipitation, while AR may be appropriate for regions with precipitation higher than this threshold. Our findings offer valuable guidance for policymakers in designing sustainable revegetation strategies tailored to local environmental conditions.",

          "abstract": "Agricultural land abandonment presents potential environmental benefits through either revegetation, and associated carbon sequestration, habitat and landscape connectivity benefits, or recultivation, which offsets the need for agricultural conversion of natural areas. Yet, the extent and pace of land abandonment depends on future demand for food, energy, and other anthropogenic drivers. Here we quantify the extent and spatial distribution of agricultural abandonment and conversion in the southeastern US under a range of future development scenarios, addressing (1) what is the extent of future agricultural abandonment and conversion, (2) how much forecast agricultural conversion could be offset by recultivation of abandoned land, and (3) within a given development scenario, how do different strategies for recultivation of abandoned lands influence (a) habitat fragmentation and (b) connectivity for the umbrella species Ursus americanus. Future abandonment ranged from 1.63 Mha (local economic scenario) to 7.95 Mha (local environmental scenario). Future conversion ranged from 1.24 Mha (global environmental scenario) to 5.65 Mha (global economic scenario). While environmental scenarios predicted surplus abandonment available to offset all conversion, economic scenarios predicted enough abandonment to offset a third of conversion at most. Within a given development scenario, strategic recultivation targeting carbon or biodiversity conservation can reduce fragmentation by up to 17% compared to land-use decisions that do not consider those characteristics. However, strategic recultivation did not significantly affect connectivity, which was instead driven by development scenarios: cost-weighted distance to least-cost path ratio was highest in the economic development scenarios and lowest in the environmental concern scenarios. Our results suggest that while socio-economic development scenarios are the primary drivers of land-use change patterns and the attendant ecological consequences, strategic recultivation decisions targeting carbon sequestration or biodiversity potential can reduce habitat fragmentation within development scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Reforestation of degraded riparian areas provides climate mitigation benefits through increased carbon (C) storage. However, the magnitude of this potential natural climate solution remains uncertain across ecoregions. Few studies have evaluated riparian planting C sequestration and storage, particularly in highly productive wet riparian ecosystems. In recent decades, riparian reforestation has accelerated in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States, primarily aiming to restore ecosystem functions and associated benefits.&amp;#xD;Using these plantings as a ‘natural experiment’, we assessed C storage in woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and soils across a chronosequence of PNW riparian reforestation sites. Our study evaluated changes in C storage with planting age and identified key covariates affecting C storage in plants and soils and their relationship with planting age across a ~430 km latitudinal gradient in western Oregon, USA.&amp;#xD;We found that woody and soil C stocks increase with planting age, averaging 24% and 1% per year, respectively. Increases in tree C were strongly driven by increasing planting age and tree stem density. Understory C was weakly related to stand characteristics and geomorphic properties, and strongly related to planting age. Soil C gains were positively driven by precipitation. We find that riparian reforestation can result in increased C storage, with woody vegetation comprising most of the increase. Our results highlight the importance of including both trees and shrubs in plantings to realize C accumulation gains in the earlier years. Because C accumulation is gradual, yet compounding (i.e., 10+ and 15+ years for total C stocks to increase by 1.95, and 19.2 Mg C ha-1, respectively), riparian reforestation projects implemented today could take over a decade to deliver high natural climate solution benefits, emphasizing the urgency to implement these projects to limit the worst of climate change impacts.&amp;#xD;",

          "abstract": "Since 2023, the Amazon rainforest has experienced unprecedented compound drought and heatwaves (CDHW). These events are closely linked to low soil moisture (SM) and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and have significant impacts on the Amazon ecosystem. In this study, we examine CDHW and concurrent low-SM/high-VPD events in the Amazon from 1981 to 2024, with a particular focus on the record-breaking drought of 2023-2024. Our findings reveal that CDHW events generally coincide with low-SM/high-VPD conditions, with most occurring during the well-documented droughts of 1983, 1997-1998, 2010, 2015-2016, and 2023-2024. The 2023-2024 period stands out with a record-high number of compound events and the most extensive coverage, with CDHW and low-SM/high-VPD conditions affecting 50% of the Amazon region during the austral springs of 2023 and 2024. The results also indicate that both CDHW and low-SM/high-VPD events have become more frequent, prolonged, and widespread in the Amazon since 2000. The Mann-Kendall tests also reveal an increasing trend of +0.5 events per year for CDHW and +0.6 for low-SM/high-VPD. Additionally, our findings highlight that the 2023-2024 period is not only marked by record-breaking CDHW events but also by unprecedented concurrent low-SM/high-VPD conditions.&amp;#xD;",

This study examines the impacts of recent climate change and variability on run-of-river (RoR) hydropower production and electricity systems planning. We present an end-to-end pipeline to convert runoff and hydropower specifications into hydropower generation and subsequently integrate it into an electricity systems model. Applying this methodology to Switzerland, we provide an accurate re-analysis of hydropower generation for each RoR power plant with capacities of 300 KW or more for the period 1991-2022. When aggregated on a national scale, our estimations match well nationally reported production and displays a climate-driven year-to-year variability. Our results show an overall tendency towards decreased RoR production in the past decades in Switzerland due to human-induced climate change (decrease in water availability). This trend was compensated at a national level with an infrastructure expansion. Based on the derived hydropower time series, we simulate the electricity system under scenarios with either no or a high renewable energy target and showcase contrasting sensitivities of electricity prices to climate variability. We argue that a careful choice of policies, considering climate variability, could lead to a more climate-resilient electricity system.",

          "abstract": "This study assesses model performance in simulating the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) pattern using the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP). It is found that models exhibit a large diversity in the western extension of the IPO, leading to distinct global impacts. The IPO-related sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies extend more westward to the equatorial western Pacific (WP) in the low-resolution (LR) models, along with a westward shift of atmospheric responses. However, such biases are largely reduced in the high-resolution (HR) models, ascribing to better behavior in reproducing the mean-state SST in the cold tongue. In general, the HR models simulate smaller zonal advection in the equatorial WP due to a weaker zonal SST gradient compared to the LR models. In addition to the tropics, the intensity of IPO-related SST over the North Pacific is also improved in the HR models due to their benefits in simulating the Kuroshio extension. These findings suggest that the HR models have superior capabilities in predicting and projecting future changes in the IPO.",

          "abstract": "High Mountain Asia holds the largest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over High Mountain Asia via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036–2065) and far future (2066–2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as droughts. While droughts are known to reduce crop yields, their impacts on livestock systems are more complex and evolve over time. Producers may respond to drought conditions by liquidating herds, including breeding stock, which alters supply dynamics throughout the meat value chain. These shifts may occur through multiple, overlapping channels, including increased feed costs and direct physiological effects on animals such as heat stress. We estimate the short- and long-term effects of drought-related environmental stress on the U.S. beef value chain, using the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) as a composite measure of realized drought conditions. We interpret our findings as capturing the total effect of drought conditions on livestock market dynamics. Results show that producer prices increase significantly with a lag following drought events, while livestock futures markets respond earlier. Retail beef prices are also affected, but the impact on consumers is dampened and more delayed. These findings suggest that drought-related supply disruptions are a key contributor to rising US beef prices.",

          "abstract": "The rising urban flood events with variable precipitation patterns across Indian cities make them vulnerable to precipitation extremes and cause huge economic losses. Considering this, the Indian Smart Cities Mission was initiated in 2015 to make cities resilient to climate change and promote the nation’s growth. Thus, we quantify the historical precipitation variability in precipitation amount and days. Further, we assessed the nonstationary influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillations, Indian Ocean Dipole, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations on future precipitation extremes projections for 10, 25, 50, and 100 year return levels. Based on this, we computed the hazard due to precipitation dynamics across Indian cities and found it to be maximum for Silvassa city. Subsequently, we assessed the vulnerability of the cities based on the urban infrastructure and development and exposure to the regional population and economy to compute the risk for Indian cities. The study revealed that Ahmedabad, Thane, and Surat cities observed maximum risk due to precipitation dynamics in a changing climate. Further, we observed that risk was induced due to precipitation dynamics and associated extremes observed to be maximum in the Northwest, West Central, and Central Northeast precipitation zones. It assists policymakers in enhancing the urban climate action plan to make cities resilient to urban flood events.",

          "abstract": "Tropical cyclone (TC) intensification rate (IR) critically influences TC intensity, yet the key factors governing its long-term variations over the North Atlantic (NA) remain poorly understood. This study addresses this gap using a simplified energetically based dynamical system (EBDS) model that explicitly separates and quantifies dynamical and thermodynamic influences. A pronounced dipole pattern is identified in TC IR trends over the past four decades, characterized by decreases (increases) in the northwest (southeast) NA. While thermodynamic factors have generally become more favorable for intensification across the entire NA, dynamical factors, primarily vertical wind shear, exhibit a dipole trend closely aligned with observed IR changes. Quantitative analyses indicate that the decreasing TC IR in the northwest NA is primarily driven by deteriorating environmental dynamical conditions linked closely with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Conversely, the IR increase in the southeast NA is mainly attributable to enhanced thermodynamic conditions associated with global warming. These results highlight region-specific drivers of long-term changes in TC intensification, providing insights for improving future projections.&amp;#xD;",

          "abstract": "New environmental constraints for hydropower improve ecosystems but reduce energy production and flexibility, creating a dilemma between protecting nature and ensuring a sufficient and reliable energy supply. Approximately 88% of Norway’s power comes from hydropower, produced by over 1770 plants. We assess how 285 potential new or revised environmental constraints affect hydropower production and flexibility in the Northern European power system. To do so, we combine a method for estimating environmental flow releases in bypass reaches and stochastic power system optimization. Our results show that reductions in hydropower output due to these constraints are consistent across power system scenarios and two power system models. The reductions amount to 3 TWh yr-1 (2% of Norway’s production), by our estimates. These reductions are primarily driven by flow diversions to bypass river sections. Further, we find that high power prices increase and low prices decrease, reflecting reduced system flexibility. Price increases typically occur in dry spring periods and are linked to activation of season-dependent reservoir restrictions in that period, while price decreases result from higher reservoir volumes entering periods of rain-heavy summer or autumn periods, indirectly linked to restrictions active earlier in the year. In our simulations, we observe that flexibility losses due to environmental constraints to some degree are offset by increased flexible operation of unaffected reservoirs and transmission interconnectors. Finally, our findings suggest that reservoir restrictions may cause spilling, as higher water levels in regulated reservoirs increase the risk of spilling during wet summer or autumn periods. This system-level understanding is crucial for regulatory authorities designing new environmental requirements and revising the terms of hydropower licenses. Our study contributes to informed discussions for balancing hydropower production with local environmental benefits and offers a framework for studying similar constraints in other regions, such as Sweden, North America and the Alpine region.",

          "abstract": "The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) plays a pivotal role in shaping global climate. Using observational datasets, we uncover significant multidecadal shifts in the northern and southern edges of the WPWP. Heat budget analysis based on century-long ocean model hindcast simulations reveals that the meridional displacements of the WPWP northern edge are mainly caused by surface heat flux variations, while the southern edge’s shifts can be primarily attributed to meridional oceanic heat advection associated with the wind-driven Ekman transport. These meridional movements largely covary with the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), expanding poleward during AMV's ascending phases and contracting equatorward during descending phase. Multi-model idealized AMV± experiments estimate that trans-basin forcing of the AMV accounts for 47%±8% of the observed northern edge shifts and 26%±7% of the southern edge changes. Reducing model uncertainties in AMV teleconnections will help to better quantify their impacts on the Pacific decadal climate variability.",

Here we provide up-to-date numbers, comprehensively accounting for three dimensions—physical and social uncertainties, global strategies and equity—and the relative impact of them on each country’s emissions allowance. In the short run, normative considerations substantially impact fair emissions allowances—directing current discussions to this debate—while global discussions on temperature targets and non-CO 2 emissions take over in the long run.
