          "abstract": "As a major ocean circulation system, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may approach a critical transition under anthropogenic forcing, yet how large-scale AMOC changes imprint on regional circulation pathways remains incompletely understood. While persistent changes in overturning are expected to be meridionally coherent, their horizontal expression may be highly non-uniform. Here, we use 22,000-year-long transient deglacial climate simulations to examine how latitudinally coherent AMOC variations are redistributed across the upper Atlantic circulation. By separating externally forced, long-term AMOC changes from internally generated, short-term variability, we show that the former are disproportionately reflected along the full meridional extent of the South Atlantic western boundary current system. In contrast, North Atlantic counterparts relate primarily to higher-frequency, unforced AMOC variability. Our findings highlight South Atlantic western boundary transports as outstanding fingerprints of past externally forced AMOC changes, thereby outlining their particular sensitivity to a predicted, anthropogenically forced weakening of the AMOC.",

          "abstract": "Oxygen minimum zones are large-scale subsurface oxygen-deficient layers experiencing rapid reconfiguration under climate change, partly driven by changes in ventilation whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. Along the eastern South Pacific oxygen minimum zone, a subsurface salinity maximum associated with equatorial subsurface water creates thermohaline gradients that trigger salt-finger instabilities across the lower oxycline. Here we show, using high-resolution microstructure, velocity, and oxygen observations, that these instabilities enhance diapycnal mixing and drive significant oxygen fluxes into the oxygen-deficient layer. While the upper oxycline is dominated by shear-driven turbulence, strong stratification suppresses vertical mixing, resulting in low diffusivities where sharp oxygen gradients are present, whereas salt fingering below yields high diffusivities where gradients are weaker, leading to comparable oxygen fluxes across both boundaries. The widespread occurrence of salt-finger-favorable conditions across the eastern South Pacific suggests that this mechanism plays a persistent and previously unrecognized role in the oxygen minimum zone ventilation.",

          "abstract": "The absence of plate tectonics and the young surface age (0.3-1 billion years) of Venus have led to diverse geodynamic models for Venus. The energetics of the Venusian interior drives these models; however, the lack of direct constraints on surface heat flow hampers their quantitative assessment. Here we present a global heat flow map for Venus, as well as estimates of the total heat loss, obtained from an inversion of geophysical data, including lithospheric effective elastic thickness, crustal thickness, and radioactive heat production. Heat flow on Venus is lower and less geographically structured than on Earth, with an average of 31 mW m —2 , but with highs associated to rifts systems reaching values typical of active terrestrial areas. The obtained total heat loss is 11-17 TW, similar to estimates of the total radioactive heat production. Therefore, at present, Venus proportionally dissipates much less heat than Earth.",

          "abstract": "Marine cloud brightening (MCB), a geoengineering strategy that increases the cloud albedo, is potentially able to reduce the impacts of global warming. We simulate an MCB strategy to offset the warming induced by anthropogenic aerosol reduction following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-1.9 carbon-neutral scenario. Injecting sea salt aerosol into four cloudy regions in the eastern Pacific Ocean every year from 2020 to 2100 effectively restrains the future global-mean surface air temperature and precipitation change to the 2020 level. Aerosol-cloud interaction dominates the cooling in this MCB strategy. However, this strategy does not fully offset the warming in Europe, the United States, northeastern China and downwind offshore oceans, partly related to the acceleration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation driven by the MCB-induced hemispherical asymmetric radiation gradients. Considering both the anthropogenic aerosol reductions and the MCB sea salt injection, some regions would face unintended climate change. Our study highlights the need for a more careful implementation strategy to produce both widespread cooling and fewer regional climate risks considering the effects are highly dependent on the strategy and seeding location.",

          "abstract": "A 10-fold enhancement of lithium atoms was detected at 96 km altitude by a resonance lidar at Kühlungsborn, Germany, approximately 20 hours after the uncontrolled re-entry of a Falcon 9 upper stage. The upper-atmospheric extension of the ICON general circulation model, nudged to ECMWF, was used to calculate winds. Backwards trajectories, including wind variability as measured by radar, traced air masses to the Falcon 9 re-entry path at 100 km altitude, west of Ireland. This study presents the first measurement of upper-atmospheric pollution resulting from space debris re-entry and the first observational evidence that the ablation of space debris can be detected by ground-based lidar. The analysis of geomagnetic conditions, atmospheric dynamics, and ionospheric measurements supports the claim that the enhancement was not of natural origin. Our findings demonstrate that identifying pollutants and tracing them to their sources is achievable, with significant implications for monitoring and mitigating space emissions in the atmosphere.",

In Jezero crater, several olivine-rich units have been investigated by the  Perseverance  rover, including an olivine cumulate in the crater floor (Séítah formation) and the enigmatic “Margin Unit”; an olivine- and carbonate-rich unit commonly interpreted as either a lake shore deposit or a local expression of the regional olivine-carbonate unit. We developed a method incorporating X-ray diffraction energy and spatial information to accurately determine the forsterite content (molar percentage of MgO/(MgO+FeOT)) of monocrystalline olivine encountered by  Perseverance . Forsterite content in clastic sediments of the western Jezero fan indicate multiple olivine sources. In contrast, forsterite content analysed in the Margin Unit is similar to the Séítah formation, suggesting that at least some of the Margin Unit may represent an altered igneous cumulate with similar origins to the Séítah formation.",

          "abstract": "Earth observations from satellites are the primary information source for Numerical Weather Prediction models. While some land surface variables, such as surface soil moisture, are assimilated to improve initial land conditions, the use of additional satellite-derived land surface and vegetation products remains limited partly due to systematic model biases. Here we examine the potential of satellite-derived land surface temperature and vegetation indicators to enhance near-surface temperature forecast skill. We build deep learning surrogate models for Numerical Weather Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory networks. Results show that including these satellite datasets improves temperature forecast skill globally across lead times from 1 to 12 days, with the largest improvements at 4-day lead time. Satellite-based predictors are the most relevant variables in about 60% of global grid cells. Among them, sun-induced fluorescence is the most important predictor, reflecting vegetation photosynthetic activity and its influence on surface energy partitioning and near-surface temperature.",

          "abstract": "Alpine rivers are becoming increasingly exposed to atmospheric heatwaves. Because of their strong relationship with air temperature, rivers can experience persistent heat anomalies, known as riverine heatwaves, which can have serious consequences for river ecosystems and the economy. This study aims to improve our understanding of how river water temperature responds to atmospheric heatwaves by focusing on the interplay of various hydro-climatic variables that can strengthen or weaken the thermal sensitivity of rivers to such events. Our results show that the response of water temperature to atmospheric heatwaves can vary substantially, with only 47% of atmospheric heatwaves leading to riverine heatwaves. Riverine heatwave development can be prevented by positive anomalies in discharge and meltwater, while negative anomalies in discharge strengthen the link between atmospheric and river temperatures. Future changes in these hydro-climatic conditions will likely increase the sensitivity of Alpine rivers to atmospheric heatwaves.",

          "abstract": "Since 2005, the Campi Flegrei nested caldera volcano, located about 10 km west of Naples, Italy, has experienced accelerating uplift accompanied by increased seismicity, raising concerns in this densely populated area. This ongoing uplift is part of a millennium-long history of inflation-deflation cycles, in which seismicity correlates with uplift phases, albeit nonlinearly. Here, we show that the combination of stress shadowing and loading with frictional fault behavior reproduces the observed long-term seismicity trend. However, in the short term, earthquake clustering occurs, which we demonstrate is at least partly related to earthquake interactions and can be effectively modeled by overlapping aftershock sequences. Merging the long- and short-term approaches yields a combined model that effectively replicates the observed seismicity patterns. A pseudo-prospective test shows that the model can also provide probabilistic short-term forecasts of earthquake rates and maximum magnitudes on weekly to monthly time horizons.",

          "abstract": "Major natural disasters inflict huge direct damage and far-reaching indirect economic impacts. To drive faster, better recovery, global efforts prioritize post-disaster restoration and reconstruction. While some studies note positive effects of post-disaster technical progress, its nature remains unclear. Building on Schumpeter’s “creative destruction”, large-scale reconstruction—though a byproduct of disasters—may drive technological renewal, optimize industrial structure, and generate potential positive economic impacts. This study pioneers integrating matrix transformation and IO table forecasting to simulate dynamic technical coefficient matrices, offering unprecedented insights into post-2008 Wenchuan Earthquake technological evolution. Breakthroughly embedding technical progress effects into the Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, we quantified their economic dividends—revealing striking technological leaps in resource- and technology-intensive sectors, largely driven by large-scale external assistance under China’s national system. Counterfactual analyses show Sichuan’s IELs would be underestimated by 98.3% if the non-disaster economic development trends are ignored, while neglecting technical progress could lead to a 6.4-fold overestimation of IELs. These findings position post-disaster technological renewal and industrial upgrading as pivotal drivers of economic recovery and resilience—offering transformative guidance for global reconstruction strategies while validating the “double negative yields positive” disaster economics theory.",

          "abstract": "Scenario development faces the tension between broadening the range of future possibilities to address uncertainty and the path dependency inherited from historical conditions. This unresolved tension affects adaptation to future risks, especially at the local level, resulting in uncertainty that has prevented effective governance, mainstreaming across policy instruments, and transformative implementation. In this paper, we contribute to the growing literature on local risk and adaptation scenarios, reconciling local extensions of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with path dependency analysis focused on urban development dynamics. To do so, we first extend the global SSPs to provide regional narratives for the Metropolitan Region of Jakarta, a rapidly developing megacity in Southeast Asia. Second, we reconcile the scenarios with path dependencies from urban development (e.g., sprawl and urbanisation) across each narrative. Finally, we provide context-rich regional information to strengthen the salience and legitimacy of the scenarios. To achieve these results, we implement participatory scenario development and urban dynamics cross-analysis under the path dependency lens. Our findings show that the region’s narratives extend and contrast with assumptions found in the global narratives (e.g., SSP1 leads to higher inequality). Moreover, the regional narratives need to be compatible with idiosyncrasies regarding the region’s national role (e.g., global economic hub) and tensions from inter-municipal competition and informality, for example. The urban dynamics in the region also foreground strong path-dependent trends for future adaptation preconditions. Major urban interventions, such as sea walls and transit-oriented systems, concentrate investment and restrict the distributive aspects of future pathways. Additionally, sprawl and gentrification are present across all future pathways and may sap adaptation effectiveness while reproducing substantial development inequality. These results strengthen informed decision-making by providing context-rich data. They also contribute to scenario development more broadly by setting the stage for transformative policy scenarios assumptions, reducing uncertainty and increasing salience and fairness.",

          "authors": "Dianti Farhana Kamasela, Shinichiro Fujimori, Tomoko Hasegawa, Saritha Sudharmma Vishwanathan",
          "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is a key nature-based solution to mitigate climate change. Previous studies have highlighted its potential and the role of improve management practice, but many relied on static land-use assumptions or limited spatial data, overlooking socio-economic and climate-driven changes that affect land availability. This study assessed the global SOC sequestration potential of cropland and bioenergy land under three land-use pathways: business-as-usual (BAU), a sustainable food system (FOOD), and a 2°C climate target (2Degree). Our results show that both climate and food policies may influence SOC sequestration through land-use changes. Under the 2 °C scenario, large-scale expansion of bioenergy crops could increase SOC stocks by about 7% (~9 Gt CO2). In contrast, the FOOD scenario achieves only modest SOC gains, slightly lower than BAU (−1.59 Gt CO₂). This because dietary shifts reduce pasture demand but do not significantly change cropland area, and bioenergy deployment is limited. While plant-based diets improve food system efficiency and reduce emissions, their SOC benefits are indirect and depend on how freed-up land is used for mitigation, such as afforestation or bioenergy production. Regions with significant bioenergy expansion—such as Latin America, reforming economies, and OECD/EU countries—show the highest SOC gains. Regions with large cropland areas, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, contribute 70% of the global potential. Moreover substantial SOC potential can be realized at a cost below $100 per ton of CO₂, highlighting SOC sequestration as a feasible and economically viable climate mitigation strategy. Our study findings underscore the trade-offs between food system transformation, land-use efficiency, and carbon storage, and emphasize that climate policies promoting bioenergy expansion can achieve substantial SOC gains, while dietary policies alone have limited impact without strategic land management.",

          "authors": "Dana RN Brown, Christopher D. Arp, Todd J Brinkman",
          "abstract": "River ice is a vital component of the cryosphere, influencing hydrology, ecology, and society. When adequately thick and stable, river ice serves as a key transportation corridor for residents of remote Arctic and sub-Arctic communities. Climate change is altering the timing, extent, and duration of river ice cover, impacting both environmental processes and human activities. This study examines regional variability and temporal change in river ice phenology across Alaska using satellite observations and climate-driven modeling. We extracted reach-scale surface water extent from the Landsat archive to characterize river ice cover at sub-monthly time scales, capturing spatial heterogeneity and seasonal transitions during freeze-up and break-up. We then developed statistical models driven by ERA5-Land climate reanalysis to reconstruct annual metrics identifying the beginning, end, and duration of ice-covered conditions from water years 1979–2023. Model results show that typical river ice duration varied strongly along climatic gradients, ranging from 2.4 months in a southern coastal region to 7.3 months in northern Alaska (2000–2023). Decadal comparisons show that river ice duration during 2014–2023 was substantially shorter than in the 1980s across much of the state, with reductions exceeding three weeks within western and southwestern Alaska. These recent declines reflect the combined influence of delayed freeze-up and, to a lesser extent, earlier break-up onset. Long-term trend analyses (1979–2023) reveal persistent declines in ice duration, primarily driven by later freeze-up, with rates of change from 3–5 days/decade where trends are significant. Together, these findings demonstrate substantial, regionally structured changes in Alaska’s river ice regimes and underscore growing challenges in transportation, public safety, and access in river-dependent communities.",

          "abstract": "Due to insufficient emission reductions in recent years, it is increasingly likely that global warming will exceed the 1.5 °C temperature limit in the late 2020s or 2030s. As a result, several Earth system tipping elements could, at least temporarily, have their tipping points surpassed, posing risks of large-scale and profound structural change. Tipping does not always occur immediately upon crossing such a critical threshold. If the length of time the driver is beyond the critical level is short enough, tipping could still be avoided for some slow-responding elements of the climate system. An improved understanding is therefore needed of whether tipping remains avoidable, for which systems, and under what conditions. Here, we review how minimising the magnitude and duration of any temperature overshoot beyond 1.5 °C could decrease tipping risks. Tipping elements with fast response times, such as warm-water coral reefs, are especially vulnerable to overshoot. In contrast, those with slow response times, such as polar ice sheets, may be less sensitive to temporary overshoot. Potential interactions between tipping elements and additional human pressures, such as deforestation in the Amazon or pollution and overfishing of coral reef habitats, may further lower tipping points, narrowing the range of overshoot trajectories that can still avoid it. The vulnerability of many tipping elements, even under shorter overshoot conditions, underscores that global warming must peak below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, return to below 1.5 °C as quickly as possible (i.e. within this century), and to around 1 °C thereafter to limit tipping point risks.",

We address this gap by mapping NCP supply across 12 ecosystem types on the southern slopes identifying hotspots and coldspots and quantifying synergies and trade-offs among NCP categories. We use 25 context-specific NCP categories that integrates local and scientific knowledge with field measurements and remote-sensing-derived proxies. Combining long-term field data with remote sensing and machine learning, we upscaled plot-scale indicators into standardized supply maps. Total NCP supply is strongly concentrated in mid-elevation ecosystems: the 1,100–2,200 m band alone accounted for ~59% of total supply compared with ~18% in the lowlands (700–1,100 m), and the 1,100–2,800 m belts together provide ~73%, whereas high-elevation zones (2,800–4,600 m) contribute &lt;9%. Hotspots clustered in lower montane forest, Ocotea forest and homegardens at mid-elevations, while coldspots occur in Erica forest and Helichrysum vegetation at high elevations and in maize fields and savanna at low elevations. We detected moderate (r = 0.55) to strong synergies (r = 0.83) among the three NCP groups (material, regulating, non-material). After accounting for climatic co-variation, the correlations among NCP groups weakened (r = 0.23 to 0.44), underscoring the critical role of climate for NCP supply. Our study maps NCP hotspots and coldspots across Mt Kilimanjaro and provides a decision-support layer for conservation, restoration and agroforestry management, as well as a blueprint for spatially-explicit NCP mapping and analyses.",

          "abstract": "Forest fire regimes in Europe are evolving due to complex interactions between climate change, land use, and management strategies. Traditionally concentrated in Mediterranean countries during the summer, fire activity is increasingly affecting regions and periods not historically considered at risk. In this study, we analyzed 20 years (2001–2020) of satellite-derived weekly forest fire data across five European biogeographical regions—Mediterranean, Atlantic, Alpine, Continental, and Boreal—to detect shifts in fire frequency, size, and extent. Using wavelet analysis and multi-method breakpoint detection on weekly fire metrics (burned area, number, and size), we identified significant temporal and seasonal changes in several regions. Results show a decline in summer fire activity in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions, likely reflecting improved fire suppression and prevention. In contrast, our results show that the Alpine region shows increasing fire activity, particularly outside the summer season, suggesting an expanding fire season linked to climatic and ecological changes. Smaller but notable changes were also detected in Boreal and Continental regions. Our findings highlight the growing relevance of fires occurring outside the summer season in shaping Europe’s fire regimes. These results underscore the need for adaptive, region-specific fire management strategies that account for shifting seasonality and emerging risks beyond the traditional summer fire window.",

          "abstract": "Plastic pollution is a growing environmental challenge, and Latin America is one of several Global South regions that have seen a rise in plastic waste imports. For 18 countries in the region, we combine a quantitative analysis of plastic scrap trade data (UN Comtrade) with an assessment of waste management capacity. Following China’s 2018 ban on plastic waste imports, Latin America saw increases in all types of plastic waste, and in particular, imports of low-quality (“difficult-to-recycle”) plastics, particularly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS), increased considerably. We identify seven “plastic pollution hotspots,” or countries that have (1) high imports of low-quality (“difficult-to-recycle”) plastic waste AND (2) high rates of mismanaged waste: the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay. Furthermore, we find that after 2018, difficult-to-recycle plastics have been recirculated within the region to countries with lower GDP per capita and limited waste management capacity, further disadvantaging the plastic pollution hotspots we identify. Our study provides timely evidence of the need to reduce plastics production, reduce chemical additives, and increase regulations surrounding hazardous plastic waste exports that are disproportionately impacting Global South regions.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of Amazon floodplains is tightly connected to the adjacent river flood pulse, yet its hydrological functioning differs from that of the main channel. While the river transports water downstream, floodplain flows promote lateral connection, facilitating biogeochemical exchanges with the river and sustaining local ecosystems and riverine communities. Extreme floods in the Amazon Basin have become more frequent in recent years, and their impact on floodplain flow remains unknown. Here, we show that floodplains flows of the lower Amazon basin can reach up to 40,000 m3 s-1 during extreme floods, a magnitude comparable to the world´s largest rivers. While the mean (maximum) Amazon River flow has only increased by ~4.7% (8.7%) since 2005, the mean (maximum) flow in the adjacent floodplain has increased by 60% (68%), corresponding to a relative increase approximately 13 times larger than that of the mainstem. This suggests a nonlinear and amplified hydrodynamic response, where small increases in river level produce disproportionately large relative increases in floodplain flow. Interestingly, the floodplain water extent shows only a moderate increase (13.5%), indicating that the recent intensification of Amazon River discharge does not primarily expand flooded areas but instead accelerates water movement within them. Such intensified flows may enhance fluvial erosion, sediment transport, and ecosystem disturbance, increasing the vulnerability of floodplain ecosystems and communities to extreme hydrological events and ongoing environmental changes. Our study indicates that actual changes in the Amazon floodplain flow are significantly larger than in the main river, calling for more studies to assess the impacts on the Amazon floodplain human populations and ecosystems.",

          "authors": "Davide Martinetti, Davide Stucchi, Daniele Bevacqua, Lorenzo Mari, Renato Casagrandi",
          "abstract": "Permafrost degradation in Arctic and Subarctic regions, accelerating due to rapid climate change, exposes vast extents of ice- and organic matter-rich soils directly to the atmosphere. This ancient permafrost is known to harbor metabolically active microbes, including potentially harmful pathogens that have survived for thousands of years under extreme environmental conditions. The release and subsequent long-range dispersal of these organisms via atmospheric transport presents a significant, yet often neglected, pathway for novel disease emergence. Here, we develop a quantitative risk framework to geographically identify downwind areas in the Palearctic region potentially reached by air-transported pathogens emerging from Siberian retrogressive thaw slumps. We simulate air-mass trajectories to derive a hazard metric that accounts for the accelerating rate of slumps thawing. This hazard is coupled with the distribution of humans, major crops, or livestock representing the exposure term. We evaluate the associated health risk by introducing a novel hierarchical Pareto ranking approach, which prioritizes locations based on the joint effect of hazard and exposure without applying subjective weights. The results indicate that high risks are not only concentrated near source areas, but also extend to distant, densely populated urban centers in Russia, China, and Japan, and impact key agricultural regions. Given the increasing rates of permafrost thawing and the consequent risk of exposure of distant host populations, we call for a better characterization of the pathosphere in Arctic frozen grounds and for the development of credible models to identify and monitor specific One Health risk hotspots for plant, animal, and human populations.",

          "abstract": "The North American arctic and boreal regions (ABRs) are rapidly warming and experiencing intensifying disturbances. Accurately quantifying aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for understanding the impacts of these changes on the carbon cycle and for designing climate change mitigation strategies. Several AGB maps have been developed for the North American ABRs, including recent contributions from NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) campaign. However, these maps differ widely in training data, methodology, and resulting AGB density estimates. Presently, a comprehensive comparative evaluation is lacking, making it difficult for users to select datasets suited to their research or management needs. &amp;#xD;Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of nine AGB density datasets across North American ABRs, specifically for Alaska and Canada. We (1) summarized AGB by ecoregion and Canadian provinces, (2) evaluated their accuracy against field-based measurements, (3) analyzed spatial and temporal similarities among datasets, and (4) assessed their ability to capture disturbance (fire and harvest) impacts on AGB. &amp;#xD;We found substantial variation in regional and local AGB estimates across datasets, with overall accuracy ranging from R2 = 0.25 to 0.62 and Bias% from -47.8% to 69.9% when validated against field plots. Despite these differences, most datasets have comparatively consistent spatial patterns in AGB (r &gt;0.8 for most cases). In contrast, agreement on the temporal patterns of AGB change is generally low. We found datasets with spatial resolutions &lt;=300 m are capable of capturing disturbance impacts on AGB dynamics, though sensitivity varies across products. Our findings and dataset summary provide guidance for selecting appropriate AGB datasets for different applications within our study area. Our analysis also highlights the need to decrease map bias and increase capability to detect temporal change to decrease uncertainty of AGB datasets potentially by using training data which is representative of major plant functional types within the mapped area.",

          "abstract": "The Antarctic Ice Sheet is subject to amplifying feedbacks which can accelerate ice loss and lead to effectively irreversible retreat. We here analyse the distinct nature and risk of long-term ice loss for each individual drainage basin under different levels of warming. Depending on topographic and climatic conditions, we find that ice loss in some basins unfolds gradually with warming, whereas other basins are characterized by a critical threshold or tipping point beyond which large parts eventually disintegrate. A first threshold, potentially as low as 1–2 °C above pre-industrial levels, triggers the long-term collapse of ~40% of marine ice volume in West Antarctica. Marine-based sectors in East Antarctica, representing ~5 m of potential sea-level rise, are at risk of losing stability at 2–5 °C. Our results imply that the Antarctic Ice Sheet does not act as one single tipping element, but rather as several tipping systems interacting across drainage basins.",

          "abstract": "Spatially explicit cropland greenhouse gas emission data are essential for identifying emission hotspots and guiding sustainable mitigation strategies. Here we develop high-resolution (5 arcmin) global maps of cropland emissions across 46 crop classes in 2020 by integrating sectoral datasets on synthetic fertilizer, manure, crop residue, in-field burning, rice cultivation and cultivated drained peatlands. Global croplands emitted 2.5 (95% CI 2.4–2.7) GtCO 2 e yr −1 , with drained peatlands (35%), rice paddies (35%) and synthetic fertilizer (23%) as the primary contributors. Four crops—rice, maize, oil palm and wheat—accounted for 67% of total emissions. Emission areal intensities averaged 2 MgCO 2 e ha − 1 globally, with higher intensities in Asia and Europe, where croplands also achieved high caloric productivity. Spatial correlations between emission intensity and production efficiency reveal geographic trade-offs between mitigation potential and food production. The resulting dataset establishes a unified global framework for a spatially explicit assessment of agricultural emissions and efficiency.",
