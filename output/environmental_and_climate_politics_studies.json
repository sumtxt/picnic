          "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of sea level rise (SLR) exposure on residential property values in Hawaiʻi by employing a repeat sales methodology on coastal properties transacted between 2000 and 2022. Our analysis reveals that properties exposed to a projected 3 ft of SLR appreciate by 0.8% less annually than unexposed properties. This depreciation effect is particularly pronounced on Oʻahu (-1.4% annually) and Hawaiʻi Island (-1.1% annually). The discount is in part explained by local buyers, with properties they purchase incurring a significantly higher annual penalty compared to those acquired by non-local buyers. Seawalls are associated with higher home appreciation rates; however, they do not offset the penalty associated with SLR exposure. Our work provides new evidence on the forward-looking capitalization of climate change exposure into housing markets, demonstrating that buyer origin—potentially representing differing beliefs or knowledge of risk—has a significant influence.",

Here we present a spatial algorithm-based automatic labeling method for enhancing mass-wasting inventories. Events are distinguished into four types based on movement behavior. A visually interpreted inventory was created from the July 2023 extreme precipitation event in Beijing, China, to validate the proposed method. Results show an overall consistency of 82% to 85% between manual and automatic labeling, with lower consistency for debris floods (59%). The method was then applied to a larger inventory to automatically identify failure types and delineate source areas. Using Shapley Additive Explanations, we quantified factor contributions by mass-wasting types based on the automatic labels in a downstream analysis. This method enhances inventories without large labeled datasets and provides type-specific insights into controls on mass wasting.",

          "abstract": "The conversion of natural forests to agricultural land threatens soil biodiversity and ecosystem stability, but its integrated impacts on soil multitrophic communities remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationships between forest-to-agriculture conversion, soil multitrophic community diversity, and temporal stability along a 3000 km transect in the Yangtze River Basin. Forest conversion increased the α-diversity of copiotrophic bacteria, but decreased the α-diversity of mycorrhizal fungi, parasitic protists, and most nematode functional groups. Crucially, it consistently decreased β-diversity across all functional groups, homogenizing soil communities. This homogenization destabilized ecosystem productivity by impairing soil nitrogen cycling and weakening plant–soil feedbacks. While the loss of α-diversity was observed in certain groups, it was the decline in β-diversity, or spatial variation, that emerged as the primary driver of reduced ecosystem stability. Our findings challenge conventional conservation paradigms by demonstrating that preserving ecosystem stability requires prioritizing β-diversity through sustainable agriculture and habitat protection.",

          "abstract": "Porphyry copper (-gold) deposits in both arc and non-arc settings are hosted by oxidized magmatic rocks, but the exact mechanism by which the source magmas of these non-arc deposits become oxidized remains obscure. Through whole-rock geochemistry, mineral chemistry, and zircon isotopic analyses, here we show that the Neoproterozoic root of the Cretaceous Shaxi porphyry copper-gold deposit in the Jiangnan orogen is reduced and copper-sulfide rich, whereas the Cretaceous ore-forming magmas are oxidized. An oxidized mafic melt flushed the Neoproterozoic root zone, extracted copper and gold, and transported them to the upper crust where the Cretaceous Shaxi deposit formed. Evidence is recorded in growth zones of clinopyroxene, zircon, spinel, and plagioclase. Our results indicate that the relatively reduced, sulfide-enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle or lower crust is essential but not sufficient for the formation of fertile non-arc porphyry magmas. Addition of a newer oxidized magma is crucial for the formation of this mineralization style.",

          "abstract": "Accurate basal melt prediction is crucial for assessing ice sheet stability and sea level rise. Recent observations at eastern Thwaites Glacier reported low melt rates despite warm ocean waters. Weak vertical mixing due to low current speeds and strong density stratification suppresses melting. However, the basal melt parameterization approach in ocean models overestimates the melt rates there. Hence, we revisit the parameterization by applying an ice-ocean boundary current model to a simple horizontal ice base. This setting creates a boundary layer (BL) over a dynamically stable pycnocline. We show that the pycnocline’s low diffusivity restricts heat transfer, causing models to overpredict melting, especially for weaker far-field currents. While reducing the prescribed BL depth can minimize this overprediction in ocean models, a better fix might be prescribing an upper melt rate limit for slower currents. We also propose a physics-based parameterization framework that more accurately emulates physics in models and observations.",

          "abstract": "On 1 January 2024, the Noto Peninsula earthquake generated a devastating tsunami that struck coastal areas within several minutes, yet resulted in few tsunami casualties. Despite its importance, the cause of this unexpectedly low human loss remained unclear, as conventional surveys were hindered by the limited access and the presence of many visitors during the holiday. Here we reveal evacuation behaviour during the 2024 Noto Peninsula tsunami using large-scale geolocation data collected from a smartphone app. We find that the evacuation was extremely fast, occurring within 2–6 min after the origin time. Additionally, the long-term analysis of the data reveals that people started returning to the coastal area 20–100 min after the origin time, which was long before the downgrading and cancellation of the tsunami warnings. These results highlight the utility of the geolocation data for evacuation surveys, which addresses the limitations of conventional evacuation surveys.",

          "abstract": "Reduced and polymerized phosphorus species may have been crucial for the origin and early evolution of life, as they are more reactive and soluble than phosphate. Thermal processes could have produced these phosphorus species; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly constrained, and geological evidence of polymerized species in the Precambrian is so far absent. Here, we investigated contact-metamorphic rocks from the ca. 3.22 Ga Moodies Group (South Africa), where mafic dikes intruded into shallow-marine sediments. We provide evidence of magmatic phosphite (up to 2.85 ppm) and metamorphic polyphosphate (up to 39.3 ppm). Additional laboratory experiments suggest that carbon can facilitate the thermal production of polyphosphates and reduced phosphorus species, including phosphide, from less reactive minerals such as apatite and vivianite. We conclude that magmatic and thermal-metamorphic rocks could have provided soluble and reactive phosphorus species crucial for the origin and early evolution of life.",

In recent decades, montane forests have been under increasing pressure from small-and large-scale deforestation, yet associated spatio-temporal changes in temperature buffering capacity remain unclear. Here, we studied the changes in temperature buffering capacity due to forest loss from 2003 to 2022 in three montane forest ecosystems in Africa (Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Bale, and the Taita Hills). We modeled the temperature buffering changes based on in situ microclimate measurements inside forests and in open areas, climate data, airborne laser scanning data, and satellite observations. We found that during the study period montane forests were lost at a rate of 2–9% across the study areas. This loss led to an annual average microclimate air temperature warming ranging from 2.0 ± 0.8 °C to 5.6 ± 2.1 °C across the three montane forests. The warming reduced the maximum air temperature buffering by an average of 3 ± 1.5 °C. Locally, the temperature buffering disappeared over time and transitioned to a mesoclimate amplification. Our findings demonstrate that microclimate buffering capacity was markedly diminished as a result of microclimate warming driven by recent forest loss.",

          "abstract": "In the Arctic, substantial amounts of methane are stored in marine sediments. Yet, the distribution and stability of methane reservoirs is poorly understood, especially offshore Greenland. As Arctic warming accelerates, understanding natural methane seepage is crucial for assessing its role in the carbon cycle and climate impact. Here, we present a unique interdisciplinary geoscientific data set that spans the ice-covered Northeast Greenland shelf and captures entire fluid flow systems from source to sink. Our data documents widespread natural seepage of oil and gas from the seafloor through the water column, locally reaching the sea surface. The released hydrocarbons are sourced from deep petroleum systems and primarily migrate along permeable beds towards the seafloor. Glacial erosion during the Quaternary has effectively removed the sealing units, creating geologic windows that allow widespread natural seepage. Our first-order estimates suggest that minimum 677–1460 Mt of thermogenic gas ( ~ 0.5–1.1 Gt of carbon) has been released into the ocean since grounded ice retreated from the shelf around ~15 ka BP. These findings provide new insight into the impact of active natural seepage in a rapidly changing climate and have substantial implications for the Arctic Ocean’s carbon cycle and marine ecosystems.",

However, the decoupling extent of crop-livestock systems and effectiveness of recoupling strategies remain uncertain due to diverse-resolution investigations. Here we map China’s manure phosphorus (P) supply-demand balance from provincial to 1-km resolutions to represent multi-resolution crop-livestock linkages, and identify effective recoupling strategies by mathematical programing models. We find that resolution improvement substantially emphasizes the spatial mismatch of manure P supply-demand and high-density manure P surplus, implying coarse-resolution studies would underestimate the extent and intensity of crop-livestock decoupling whereas overestimating the area of manure P surplus regions. Compared to moderate livestock redistribution, manure transport is generally more effective at national scale for mitigating manure P surplus/deficiency; however, it is less effective in regions with severe manure surplus or large spatial extent. This study deepens the understanding of crop-livestock decoupling and the effectiveness of recoupling strategies.",

We identify nanometer- to micrometer-scale magnetite in pentlandite-troilite assemblages from a Chang’e-5 regolith breccia. Magnetite occurs at and within pentlandite, locally enclosing pentlandite nanoinclusions, implying a formation pathway distinct from troilite-hosted occurrences. Textures and compositions indicate sequential crystallization from an impact-generated Fe-Ni-S-O melt: rapid pentlandite growth along troilite margins followed by magnetite nucleation at sulfide-silicate interfaces. The lunar low oxygen fugacity stabilizes Fe 2+ -enriched magnetite, unlike terrestrial analogues. High crystallinity and single-domain to single-vortex states indicate strong remanence stability, making these grains reliable recorders of the contemporaneous lunar magnetic fields. These results broaden the inventory of lunar magnetic carriers, demonstrate impact-driven magnetite formation under lunar redox conditions, and motivate use of magnetite to refine the Moon’s magnetic history.",

Our results indicate a 63% (SSP2-4.5) and 85% (SSP5-8.5) increase in 100-year peak discharges in the 21st century, with extreme floods occurring nearly every decade under high-emission scenarios. Our climate-driven hydrologic modeling, risk analysis, and climate projections emphasize the need for coordinated planning, provide actionable risk information, and a framework for regional cooperation and preparedness to mitigate future flood risks and address water security challenges in the Nile Basin.",

          "authors": "Yuan Liang, Donggen Wang",
          "abstract": "Existing evidence on the societal impacts of heatwaves has largely centered on human health and labor productivity. This study contributes new evidence to this body of literature by showing that heatwaves significantly reduce human mobility, a high-frequency indicator of economic activity and social interaction, in and between Chinese cities. Using a set of fixed effects panel regression models estimated with mobile phone-derived human mobility data, coupled with daily meteorological and air quality data, we find that heatwaves, on average, reduce the intracity trip rate and inbound trips in Chinese cities by 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Notably, nearly one-third of the heatwave-induced decline in the intracity trip rate can be attributed to the added effect of sustained periods of extreme heat beyond the temperature mobility relationship (i.e., the added effect of heatwaves). Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on these estimates suggest that the 2023 Chinese summer heatwave caused nationwide mobility reductions on a scale equivalent to suspending all intracity and inbound trips in Shanghai, one of China’s largest and most populous cities, for an entire week. Moreover, the adverse impacts of heatwaves on human mobility are particularly pronounced in cities of small size and with limited economic resources and green spaces, highlighting the urgent need to enhance the heatwave resilience of these cities.&amp;#xD;",

          "abstract": "Is democratic governance a key driver of environmental policy in the agricultural sector? We address this question using a global dataset covering national-level agri-environmental policies and regime transitions between autocracy and democracy from 1961 to 2021. Our empirical strategy employs a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator within an event-study framework to identify the causal impact of democratization on the adoption of agri-environmental policy measures. The results show that democratic transitions lead to a significant increase in the adoption of such policies. In the short to medium run (within six years), democratization causes a +25% increase in the number of agri-environmental policies compared to a counterfactual scenario under autocracy. In the long run, this effect persists and is likely to grow further. These newly implemented policies predominantly address biodiversity protection, fertilizer use, forest conservation, and soil erosion. We find no systematic evidence of heterogeneous effects among democracies based on characteristics such as government type, electoral system, levels of political corruption, or international integration. The relevance of these findings is heightened by current global political developments, as many democracies are experiencing institutional backsliding. Future research should directly examine how such developments influence the adoption of environmental policies.",

          "abstract": "Rising global temperatures increase the potential for heat-related adverse impacts, while economic growth, by enabling greater adoption of air conditioning, can help reduce them. This makes it unclear in which countries the net effect will lead to a worsening or easing of these impacts as the climate and economies change. We define a Cooling Deficit Index as the product of cooling degree days and the fraction of the population without air conditioning to indicate the extent to which high temperatures are experienced without access to cooling. We used this index to investigate the relationship between economic growth, global warming, and the fraction of population exposed to high temperatures without the benefits of air conditioning. We find that populations in lower-income countries tend to experience the greatest number of hightemperature days without access to cooling and are likely to face the largest increases in such days as global temperatures rise. These countries would require GDP growth rates that exceed historical rates to avoid increasing numbers of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning. Reducing or reversing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth, and lowering the cost of cooling technologies could all contribute to decreasing the number of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning, especially in low-income countries.",

The record-breaking hot and dry 2023–2024 summer in southwestern Australia induced widespread stress of the Jarrah Forest ecosystem. Analysis of vegetation greenness anomalies using airborne geophysics data, groundwater depth records, climate data, and remote sensing revealed that vegetation die-off emerged from the interactions of heat, water stress, and subsurface conditions. Shallow soils, rocky substrates, and limited access to subsurface water predisposed vegetation to experience heat and drought stress. Identifying the role and location of subsurface features enables identification of vulnerable, and resilient, areas and will guide adaptive forest management for resilience against future climate extremes.",

          "abstract": "Climate change has profoundly altered the timing of phenological events, disrupting ecosystem functions and carbon dynamics. However, photosynthetic duration is often overestimated, particularly in autumn, as greenness and photosynthesis tend to decouple, highlighting the need for a more precise understanding of autumn photosynthetic phenology to refine global carbon assessments. In this study, we estimated the end-of-photosynthesis date (EOP) across the Northern Hemisphere (&gt;30° N) from 2001 to 2021 using satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data combined with flux tower observations. We analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in EOP and identified its primary biome-specific drivers. Our results reveal a widespread advancement of EOP across the Northern Hemisphere, except in water-limited biomes, with the most pronounced shifts occurring in colder regions, such as boreal forests and tundra. These shifts are primarily driven by the carryover effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and elevated early-season temperatures, which are likely influenced by leaf lifespan and sink capacity. Additionally, nitrogen limitation may further exacerbate sink constraints, particularly in colder biomes. These drivers counteract the delaying influence of late-season warming on EOP. The significant advancement of early-stage EOP (EOP75) indicates that the accelerating effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming outweigh the delaying effect of late-season warming. In contrast, the late-stage EOP (EOP25) exhibits a near balance between these opposing forces, resulting in a negligible advancement. Consequently, the limited photosynthetic gains from an earlier or unchanged EOP may fail to offset respiratory carbon losses, potentially weakening the Northern Hemisphere’s carbon sink capacity and complicating future carbon-climate feedback projections.&amp;#xD;",

Model averaging and PLS path modeling showed that the merchandise imports and international tourism were positively correlated with non-native insect occurrences. 49.63% of the countries, including China, South Korea, Russia and Poland, were identified as medium- to high- vulnerable regions for non-native insect introduction.

          "authors": "Karl Kosciuch, Daniel Riser-Espinoza, Marisa Mitchell",
          "abstract": "As the fastest growing energy source in the United States, utility scale solar energy (USSE) features prominently in the scientific literature, particularly regarding the “lake effect hypothesis”, which posits that water birds perceive USSE as water bodies, are subsequently attracted to them, and experience mortality as a result. Policymakers and environmental regulators rely on research to evaluate and publicly disclose the impacts of emerging technologies on wildlife and to craft appropriate avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures. We completed a literature review and analyzed data from two papers to better understand how technology type influences conclusions regarding bird mortality at USSE facilities. We found 16 papers addressing bird mortality at USSE primarily from the United States where authors pooled data across fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker panel photovoltaic (PV) facilities, despite fixed-tilt facilities trending substantially downward in installed capacity in the U.S. in the last 10 years. Our analysis revealed that data to support the lake effect hypothesis is sparse when data from fixed-tilt panel facilities developed prior to the commercial transition to anti-reflective coating (ARC) are separated from tracker panel facilities. A dataset from a single fixed-tilt PV facility built prior to the ARC transition was used in eight papers and cited by 14 of the 16 papers that discussed aquatic bird mortality. This single dataset underpins the entire lake effect hypothesis discussion in the scientific literature. Despite this facility being unrepresentative of current USSE facilities, conclusions drawn from these data have been broadly applied to all PV USSE facilities. Overall, our findings show that it is important for researchers to separate data by technology type, and for regulators to understand that avian mortality trends associated with older solar facilities might not be applicable to modern USSE installations.",

Yet, unlike air pollution, which is enjoying relatively more public attention, there is limited measurement data and policy efforts on environmental noise pollution. &amp;#xD;Objective: We followed a recent city-wide measurement approach used in Accra (Ghana) and characterized environmental noise patterns in Kigali, a contrasting city with very different topography and regulatory system than Accra to inform urban policy. &amp;#xD;Methods: We established 10 ‘fixed’ (yearlong) and 120 ‘rotating’ (weeklong) monitoring sites to capture both the temporal and spatial patterns in Kigali’s sound environment. The measurement occurred between November 2022 and December 2023, and samples were collected at 1-minute interval, resulting in 5,155,014 (3,580 site-days) and 1,190,620 (827 site-days) site-minutes of valid data from the fixed and rotating sites, respectively. The 130 monitoring sites covered a variety of geographic and land-use factors across diverse neighborhoods and sources. We computed several noise metrics, including 1-hour (LAeq1hr), daily (LAeq24hr), day-time (Lday), and night-time (Lnight). &amp;#xD;Results: Daily noise (LAeq24hr) levels across the city ranged between 38-85 dBA. Commercial, business, and industrial (CBI) and high-density residential (HD) communities experienced the highest noise levels, with some sites constantly above 70 dBA at day and 65 dBA at night. About 63% of our observed day-time values (up to ~72% in some areas) exceeded the Rwandan daytime standard (55 dBA) for residential areas, whereas 69% of the observed night-time values (up to 80% in some areas) exceeded the corresponding nighttime standard (45 dBA). In Nyarugenge, the most urbanized district, as much as 75% of our site-days data exceeded day-time standard. However, diurnal patterns throughout the city were similar, rising from ~5am, peaking at about 8am and plateauing until 6pm before falling to their lowest at midnight. Overall, noise levels in the city did not vary much by day of the week, weekdays vs weekend, or dry vs wet seasons.&amp;#xD;Conclusion: Environmental noise in Kigali often exceeded both Rwandan standards and international guidelines, with residents in the city center district, CBI, and HD areas at risk of higher exposure and hence higher risk of adverse effects. Detailed assessment of the sources, at-risk population, and associated health effects may inform Rwandan’s environmental policy efforts and city initiatives in the face of the ongoing urban growth and densification.",

Long-term SSH observations reveal two distinct waveguide modes during autumn-winter: an eastern mode propagating from eastern IO to Bay of Bengal (BOB), and a western mode extending from central IO to Arabian Sea (AS). These modes exhibit significant coherence in central IO exclusively during concurrent ENSO-IOD events, with stronger SSH anomalies occurring during positive phase. We identify a complete wave-mediated pathway in which equatorial Kelvin-coastal Kelvin waveguide interacts with equatorial Rossby-coastal Kelvin waveguide in central IO, transmitting SSH signal from eastern IO through BOB to AS coast.

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of data-driven weather forecasting has prompted increasing interest in how such models perform relative to traditional numerical weather prediction systems. While recent studies have highlighted the formers' superior skill on standard forecast metrics, questions remain regarding their ability to forecast physically complex, derived variables, particularly in the context of extreme events. In this study, we assess the performance of two leading operational data-driven models (GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) in forecasting Integrated Vapour Transport (IVT) and Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), using ECMWF’s IFS-HRES as a reference physics-based forecast. Forecasts are evaluated against ERA5 reanalysis over one year of global data, using three AR detection algorithms and lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days.&amp;#xD;Results show that data-driven models achieved root-mean-square errors for IVT comparable to or slightly better than IFS-HRES, particularly in the tropics and at shorter lead times. However, they achieved a poorer representation of the higher quantiles of the IVT distribution. A case study of a high-impact AR event revealed that all models could forecast the main event characteristics up to five days in advance. However, AR characteristics and detection performance varied substantially across detection algorithms. Notably, the geometrically stricter detection method highlighted a clearer advantage for IFS-HRES, especially in the midlatitudes and at shorter leads.&amp;#xD;Overall, while no model systematically outperformed the others across all AR detection algorithms, the results suggest that physics-based models may retain advantages in forecasting geometrically and physically consistent derived features like ARs, particularly under strict detection criteria. These findings underscore the importance of targeted evaluation frameworks for derived and extreme phenomena as data-driven models become more central in operational forecasting.",

Medium‑density (600–1400 trees ha⁻¹) mixed stands with ~25–40 % deciduous trees stored 15–30 % more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures by coupling rapid early growth with long‑term retention and greater disturbance resilience. Replanting under‑stocked stands with these mixtures raised long‑term storage by 18–30 % over business‑as‑usual. Accounting for albedo showed pure evergreen or deciduous stands lost 6–20 % of their climate benefit, whereas mixed stands yielded net cooling and the highest sequestration (≈ 4.6–4.7 t CO₂e ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). Partial harvesting plus replanting preserved, and sometimes increased, ecosystem carbon (≈ 300–340 t C ha⁻¹) and productivity (≈ 1.6–2.0 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) without raising risk.

Here, we explored the potential of ERW as a bridge for sharing decarbonization responsibilities, with less-developed regions contributing cropland deployment and more developed regions providing financial support, thereby enhancing equity in global decarbonization. Low GDP regions (bottom 50% GDP administrative region as a case) in major global economies contribute 55%–89% of the total national or continental ERW decarbonization potential. Deploying ERW on 10% of cropland in these regions could achieve a cumulative global carbon removal of 22.92 Gt by 2075, approximately equivalent to half a year of current global emissions. Carbon trading between developed and developing regions can deliver annual economic benefits of up to 4.5% of the deployment regions’ 2023 GDP, measured by carbon prices.

Excluding the effects of soil variables (soil texture, microbial composition, and solution chemistry) led to a decline in R 2 (from 0.79 to 0.7 for R s models and from 0.40 to 0.34 for Q 10 models) and an underestimation on R s . The results of rotated principal component analysis (rPCA) showed that these soil variables collectively explained 50% of the cumulative variance in R s variability. Soil variables significantly constrained Q 10 values, especially in nutrient-poor soils. SHAP analysis showed that the interactive effects of high soil sand proportion and high soil fertility may suppress R s . High soil evapotranspiration may also decrease R s at the extreme conditions of soil texture. These findings highlight the underappreciated mechanistic influence of soil properties in Earth system models and underscore the need to incorporate multivariate interactions when modeling future soil respiration and its feedbacks to global change.&amp;#xD;",

          "abstract": "Groundwater, the largest accessible store of freshwater, plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems and supporting human activities. Increasing water demands and climate variability, however, are accelerating the exploitation of this resource in many regions, often beyond environmentally sustainable limits. In this study, we present the first global-scale assessment of sustainable groundwater head declines, defined as the maximum permissible drop in groundwater head that avoids environmental harm. With a global-scale hydrological-groundwater model coupling (VIC-WUR-MODFLOW) at 5-arcmin resolution, we simulated groundwater discharge and head under natural conditions. Using these values, we isolated mean groundwater levels during low-flow, intermediate-flow, and high-flow periods to estimate historic sustainable groundwater head declines. We compared our estimates with observations and simulations to assess the historic sustainability of groundwater use practices. Globally, the median sustainable groundwater head decline was 4.5 meters between 1984-2018. Tropical regions (e.g., Amazon Basin, southeast Asia) exhibited greater sustainably available groundwater due to high recharge, while arid regions (e.g., western United States, South Africa) exhibited limited capacities. Comparisons with historic groundwater head revealed that several key agricultural regions (e.g., Indo-Gangetic Plain, North China Plain, Central Valley) exceeded sustainable limits by more than 20 meters, corresponding to overexploitations of sustainable resources by more than 150%. In contrast, much of Europe and North America remained within sustainable boundaries when assessed at the aquifer-scale, although localized overexploitation was still evident. We also identified emerging hotspots (e.g., Iran, northern Africa) where groundwater head declines approached sustainable thresholds over the study period. As freshwater demands continue to rise, these regions may become future hotspots of unsustainable groundwater use without intervention. This study provides a novel global methodology to quantify environmentally sustainable groundwater resources, offering insight into at-risk regions and supporting informed water resources management under future pressures.",

          "abstract": "Rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence is expected to drive proportional expansion of economic activity through productivity gains–potentially leading to higher energy consumption and associated environmental impacts, including increased carbon dioxide emissions. We combine data on economic activity with early estimates of likely adoption of AI across occupations and industries to quantify the potential change in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions for the United States. At the industry level, we estimate annual increases in energy use ranging from 0 and 12 petajoules (PJ) and carbon emissions from 0 tonnes to 272 kt (ktCO 2 ). Aggregated across the economy, AI adoption could lead to an additional 28 PJ of energy use and 896 ktCO 2 in emissions annually–equivalent to approximately 0.03% of annual national energy use and 0.02% of annual national CO 2 emissions. These results highlight the need to account not only for the aggregate energy and environmental implications of AI-driven productivity gains, but also for how these impacts vary across industries based on their specific characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Shanxi Province, a major hub of coal production and industrial activity in China, faces severe PM2.5 pollution and complex co-emission sources that challenge air quality monitoring. This study developed multiple machine learning models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in 2022 by integrating ground-based PM2.5 observations, Himawari-8 measurements, CO, NO2 and Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI) derived from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and ERA5. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that incorporating TROPOMI-derived CO, NO2 and UVAI produced the highest predictive performance, reducing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 14% and 16% respectively. Meanwhile, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and partial dependence analysis identified CO as the most important species driving PM2.5 prediction, with all three variables showing positive contributions to PM2.5 that increased with higher values. This emphasis on the importance of CO and NO2 is physically realistic given that CO is co-emitted with primary aerosols, and NO2 is a secondary aerosol precursor. However, such work has not been previously considered by the community focusing on surface PM2.5 prediction using AI models and satellite observations. The model revealed pronounced spatiotemporal gradients in PM2.5 across Shanxi, peaking in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year (62.0 μg/m3), and minimizing in summer (21.0 μg/m3), while remaining persistently high in southern and eastern industrial regions. The steady PM2.5 rise in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year, suggesting that pre-holiday production activities may contribute to short-term emission intensification, while demonstrating that traditional season-based analysis approaches may miss these extremes. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multi-sensor satellite observations with interpretable machine learning for characterizing pollution dynamics in complex industrial regions.",

          "abstract": "Only about one-third of global rivers (or tributaries) remain in a nearly natural condition, known as climate-sensitive rivers. We lack clear evidence on the changes in streamflow volume and timing of these rivers, which significantly compromises our capacity for protection. Here, we analyse alterations in streamflow and centre of timing at 1017 stream gauges across 812 climate-sensitive rivers and tributaries worldwide from 1950 to 2022. We observed increasing trends in streamflow volume (Q) at just over half of our sites (512), biased towards earlier changes in centre of timing (CT) (≥ -2 days year-1), with more than 65% of records reflecting this trend. At over 80% of gauges, we found that rising Q and earlier CT are sensitive to increasing precipitation (P) and earlier centre of timing of precipitation (PCT). More than 60% of significant gauges show moderate to severe changes in Q and CT. We identified 104 global climate-sensitive rivers, located in subtropical, temperate and arctic regions, that have experienced large and severe changes based on long-term changes in Q seasonality (CT &gt;  15 days). Long-term changes in Q and CT may persist in rivers experiencing large and severe changes and intensify in those with minor and moderate changes. These changes will increase flooding, alter storage, cause water shortages, and degrade river health. We recommend proactive strategies including better streamflow monitoring, adaptive infrastructure (e.g., reservoirs, flood control), flexible flood management protocols, water-sharing agreements during droughts, and prioritised protection of ecosystems to buffer against variations in Q and CT.",

          "abstract": "Lakes are an important source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to the atmosphere. However, the indirect N 2 O emission factor (EF) model, which applied by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for estimating inland waters N 2 O emissions, is inadequate for lakes due to uncertainties in the N 2 O production pathways and significant spatiotemporal variations of EF values. Herein, we combined in situ N 2 O emission investigations, metagenomic sequencing and isotopic mapping techniques to determine the pathway of N 2 O production and environmental controls of EF values in shallow eutrophic lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Dissolved N 2 O concentration exhibited a significant correlation with nitrate (NO 3 - -N), coupled with a positive relationship between the (nirK+nirS)/nosZ ratio and N 2 O fluxes. Furthermore, δ 15 N SP -δ 18 O N2O mapping approach model verified that 94.0±9.1% of total N 2 O production was contributed by denitrification. These observations jointly demonstrated denitrification dominated the N 2 O production in the studied lacustrine system. Based on the finding, the nitrogen source (NO 3 - -N) concentration for denitrification and the ratio of carbon source (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) to NO 3 - -N concentration (DOC/NO 3 - -N) were incorporated into a process-based model, both of which showed high correlations with EF values in the studied lacustrine system and global meta-analysis dataset. This model, which provides a good fit, corrects N 2 O emission overestimations from IPCC models by easily obtained water quality variables.",

          "abstract": "Agroforestry systems (AFS) enhance biodiversity, productivity, and climate resilience, yet their inherent complexity challenges traditional modeling approaches. This study presents an integrated framework combining process-based modeling (PBM), machine learning (ML), and life cycle assessment (LCA) into a user-friendly decision support system (DSS) for AFS analysis and optimization. Multi-scenario simulations using Hi-sAFe (16 configurations varying in latitude and orientation) for maize–poplar systems produced detailed outputs, including land equivalent ratios (LER up to 1.29), crop yield (ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 t ha⁻¹), and N₂O emissions (1.6 to 9.4 kg N ha⁻¹). We trained Random Forest models on PBM diagnostics, microclimate, and design covariates; post-hoc SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified maximum air temperature (Tmax), distance to tree rows, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as the dominant predictors of yield and LER. To address data gaps, long short-term memory (LSTM) and TrAdaBoost-LSTM models were used for microclimate forecasting, achieving high fidelity (R² = 0.88) in capturing hourly temperature and humidity trends. Outputs have been integrated into an LCA workflow, producing CO₂-equivalent and nitrogen footprint metrics that feed into a functional web-based DSS. This platform enables robust, transparent, and scalable AFS evaluation, supporting stakeholders with real-time scenario exploration and scientifically grounded decision-making tools. Furthermore, the framework enables greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting in agroforestry systems by integrating modeled soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and N₂O emissions. A Germany-wide assessment illustrates the significant GHG reduction potential achievable through large-scale implementation of agroforestry systems.",

          "abstract": "Irrigating urban greenery can be an effective strategy to mitigate heat. However, as drought-heatwave combined events become more prevalent, cooling efforts may be compromised by water-saving strategies. This paper considers the heat implications of restricting irrigation and aims to further understanding of how water-saving and cooling objectives compete. &amp;#xD;Using ecohydrological modelling, validated for Melbourne, Australia, five irrigation scenarios were simulated over 10 years. To determine the level of heat stress under the five irrigation scenarios, the ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&amp;C), simulated temperatures and thermal stress in a Melbourne street.&amp;#xD;Results predict that heat stress is reduced with increasing irrigation amount. Every 1.5 mm of additional irrigation each week (up to 28 mm/wk) is predicted to reduce the number of heat stress days (where maximum Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) &gt; 32 °C) at the study site by one per year, with irrigation most effective at cooling when air temperatures are the hottest. The number of days with a mean air temperature over 28°C is predicted to increase by 15% and 20%, respectively, if irrigation is restricted or stopped entirely. Therefore, ensuring the maintenance of irrigation during hot periods may prevent deaths. &amp;#xD;Our results suggest that the amount of irrigation required to decrease the mean air temperature by 1 °C is approximately 7mm/day for oceanic climates, consistent with predictions in previous studies. We also predict the effect of irrigation amount on the number of heat stress days (UTCI &gt; 32 °C). This relationship is important in understanding and communicating the impacts of water restrictions on urban heat. Furthermore, innovative urban planning and design, including onsite alternative water sources for irrigation, may enable irrigation for cooling, without exacerbating water stress.",

Exploring these questions, we propose a start to a “next-generation research strategy,” focused on how global environmental politics scholars should be researching empirical topics.

          "abstract": "In the last decade, international financial institutions have advocated that multilateral funding be leveraged to reduce the risk of institutional investors, such as pensions and mutual funds, mobilizing private capital for development and decarbonization. Have international organizations (IOs) that deliver climate finance adopted the de-risking agenda? How is it affecting their work? Through a text analysis of the replenishment documents of five IOs in the climate finance regime, and an assessment of Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Green Climate Fund (GCF) projects, we find that de-risking is reshaping IO activities in three ways. First, the central idea that multilateral climate funding should be used to mobilize institutional investors is widespread across IOs in the climate finance regime. Second, in funding this work, GCF and GEF act as financial advisers to states and domestic banks, erasing the traditional boundary between economic and environmental IOs. Third, when de-risking, IOs often commit multilateral funding to financial institutions to facilitate their lending, rather than to individual mitigation or adaptation projects. This represents a fundamental shift in how multilateral climate funding is spent and raises transparency issues that make it difficult to assess the efficacy of de-risking efforts.",

However, recent apparent breakdowns of PDO–ecosystem correlations have raised concerns about the stability of the mode and its continued relevance in a warming climate. Here we show that basin-wide warming now overwhelms PDO-related sea surface temperature (SST) variability, although neither the PDO’s spatial pattern nor its strength have changed. We introduce the pan-basin pattern as a complementary index to describe the non-stationary SST baseline of the North Pacific. Regional SSTs increasingly reflect the superposition of these two signals, providing an explanation for weakened or inverted PDO–ecosystem correlations. Future use of the PDO index in management will require discerning the effects of internal dynamics from those of absolute changes in SST as extreme and no-analogue ocean conditions driven by interacting natural variability and anthropogenic warming become more common.",

At half-hourly and daily scales, we detect consistent nonlinear interactions between ALAN and night duration, with R e increasing under higher ALAN and partially decoupling from gross primary production. At the annual scale, gross primary production shows no direct ALAN response and is instead influenced by the growing season length and urban proximity, whereas R e responds more strongly and consistently across timescales. Our findings show that ALAN disrupts the fundamental energetic constraints on ecosystem metabolism, warranting the inclusion of light pollution in global change and carbon–climate feedback assessments.",
