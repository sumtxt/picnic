          "authors": "Frederic Traylor, Steven Brechin, Rachael Shwom",
          "abstract": "Geoengineering represents a set of options to reduce the greenhouse effect that causes global climate change. While public support is necessary for effective governance and implementation, the lay public has low awareness of its existence, types, and mechanisms. Prior studies have found that providing information to the public can affect support, but there are conflicting results. This study examines to what extent these differences may be the result of survey sampling rather than the information itself. Survey respondents were randomly assigned to receive either basic or extensive information about five types of geoengineering: space mirrors, stratospheric aerosol injection, ocean fertilization, direct air capture, and afforestation. This design was replicated across four online survey samples gathered from address-based sampling, an opt-in online panel, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and a college classroom. Across analyses, there was general consistency of effects between the address-based sample, the opt-in sample, and the classroom sample, with limited exceptions. Effects from the MTurk sample, however, were uncorrelated with the other samples, diminishing their utility, even when filtering out responses that failed two attention checks. As new climate technologies come out, it is important to test which information is given to the public in surveys to generate useful opinions. In general, we found that researchers should be able to use many kinds of samples, besides MTurk, for initial studies.",

          "authors": "Trang Nguyen, Patricio Velasquez, Andreas Dietzel, Lauren M. Cook",
          "abstract": "In comparison to regional climate models, convection-permitting models (CPMs) improve predictions of short-duration extreme rainfall by resolving convective processes. Their sub-daily rainfall output is thus valuable for impact models like those used for urban drainage systems. However, limitations remain, including short simulation periods and biases requiring correction to match station-scale resolution. To overcome these limitations, this study evaluates five quantile mapping (QM) approaches to bias correct and downscale sub-hourly COSMO-CLM simulations at 2.2 km resolution to the station scale using data from over 70 weather stations in Switzerland. To more effectively analyze the impact of QM on different rainfall features, stations were grouped based on location, altitude, and rainfall characteristics through an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Conventional QM was tested against several advanced methods, including using a moving window, spatial pooling, and extending the observational record. These techniques were validated using cross-validation and by evaluating several historical rainfall indices and the climate change signal. Results reveal that wet biases in raw CPM output remain and can exceed 90%. QM reduces biases in annual precipitation indices, but conventional QM often overcorrects, introducing dry biases in extreme quantiles. Additionally, all QM approaches can modify climate change signals, inflating or reversing trends in key indices. Combining spatial pooling with a moving window shows the most promise for reducing overall bias; however, challenges persist, such as data scarcity for extreme events, observation-simulation precision disparities, and short calibration periods. Future work should explore seasonality and utilize diverse CPM ensembles for more reliable precipitation projections.",

          "abstract": "Any sustained space exploration is likely to depend on the Moon and its resources. Understanding lunar mineral deposit potential, particularly for precious metals including Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, and Au (the platinum group elements, or PGE) and their distribution, however, is limited. Pristine endogenous basalts and crustal rocks, including mare basalt meteorite A-881757, indicate a well-mixed lunar mantle with PGE abundances too low to ever be exploitable. Here we show that the most likely location for PGE enrichment is in lunar impact melt sheets. Platinum group element abundances and Re-Os isotopes in samples from lunar impact melt sheets have fractionated PGE enrichments inconsistent with any known impactor compositions and consistent with sulfide-silicate segregation. Models show that basin-forming impacts with large melt volumes (≥10 6 km 3 ) and 0.1–1% impactor contribution provided potential conditions for significant PGE-enrichment, akin to economic levels (~1–5 g/t) in the largest layered intrusions on Earth today.",

          "abstract": "Sunlight-stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence offers potential for assessing phytoplankton physiological status at broad scales detected by satellites, but controls on these signals are poorly constrained. In this study, we present a comprehensive, high-resolution dataset of passive chlorophyll fluorescence alongside potential physical and biogeochemical drivers collected across the Benguela upwelling system and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. The nutrient limitation status of phytoplankton was assessed through 27 onboard bioassay experiments. A consistent and significant difference in light-saturated, passive chlorophyll fluorescence normalized to phytoplankton absorption ( $$F/{{a}_{{{\\mathrm{ph}}}}}_{\\max }^{{{\\rm{passive}}}}$$ F / a ph max passive ) was observed between waters where phytoplankton were either iron or nitrogen limited, with iron limited regions showing threefold higher $$F/{{a}_{{{\\mathrm{ph}}}}}_{\\max }^{{{\\rm{passive}}}}$$ F / a ph max passive compared to nitrogen limited regions. When interpreted alongside the results of the bioassay experiments, we found that neither variability in physical forcing (temperature, mixing, light climate) or phytoplankton community structure could explain the major variability in $$F/{{a}_{{{\\mathrm{ph}}}}}_{\\max }^{{{\\rm{passive}}}}$$ F / a ph max passive . These results provide direct field-based evidence that passive chlorophyll fluorescence is sensitive to phytoplankton nutrient limitation and demonstrates potential for observation at high spatial and temporal resolution using satellite observations.",

          "abstract": "Earthquake swarms are enigmatic seismic phenomena that occur across diverse tectonic settings, from volcanic to intraplate regions, and are often associated with fluid migration, magmatic activity, or stress redistribution. The Northwest Bohemia/Vogtland region is a globally recognized hotspot and natural laboratory for such activity. This study examines the recent activation of an earthquake swarm in the region after a century of dormancy. By integrating high-resolution seismicity patterns and earthquake source mechanisms with models of fluid migration, we provide a detailed reconstruction of the swarm’s temporal and spatial evolution. Our seismicity modeling suggests the activation of a pre-existing fault by natural hydro-fracturing and hydro-shearing under the influence of ascending magmatic fluids, beginning with a high-pressure CO 2 -rich fluid intrusion, followed by transitions to low-pressure hydro-shearing on the fault, likely associated with CO 2 -magma mixtures. Our results emphasize the pivotal role of fluid overpressure and fault zone weakening in controlling swarm dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Many subsurface processes involve transitions in granular material states, from arrested to creeping to flowing. Experiments and frameworks for idealized systems reveal that granular fabrics develop during shearing, co-evolve with applied stress, and govern such transitions. We use microtomography to test whether fabrics at two San Andreas fault sites reflect slip history and whether idealized frameworks extend to nature. Near-surface sediments within the fault zone transition between deformation patterns over the seismic cycle, including bulk/localized grain re-arrangements, individual grain fracturing, and localized zones of fracturing. Aseismic and co-seismic shearing produce distinct preferred grain orientations. Co-seismic fabrics can be preserved after centuries of aseismic strain, aseismic fabrics may be overprinted, and grain size and coordination number influence the fabrics. Idealized frameworks, namely anisotropic critical state theory, frictional jamming, and material memory, can explain our observations, and fault zone sediments likely undergo cycles of memory creation and erasure that influence rigidity spatiotemporally.",

          "abstract": "The cause of the disappearance of the primitive hominin Homo floresiensis from the Indonesian island of Flores about 50,000 years ago is a key question in palaeoanthropology. While the potential roles of climate change and human agency continue to be debated, the history of freshwater availability essential for survival at the type locality, Liang Bua, remains poorly understood. Although speleothem δ 18 O is widely used to reconstruct monsoon rainfall, variations in summer and winter rainfall, with distinct δ 18 O values, can complicate interpretations of mean annual rainfall. Here, we combine speleothem Mg/Ca, a proxy for local rainfall, with δ 18 O to determine annual, summer and winter rainfall amounts concurrent with H. floresiensis and Stegodon , one of its primary prey. Geochemical modelling of the Mg- 18 O system reveals a sustained decline in mean annual rainfall from ~1560 to 990 mm between 76,000 and 61,000 years ago. Critically, summer rainfall decreased to a record low of ~450 mm at 61,000–55,000 years ago, alongside a marked decline in both the abundance and relative proportion of Stegodon remains in the fossil record. These findings increase the likelihood that progressive landscape aridification, and intensified human-faunal competition for dwindling resources, culminated in abandonment of Liang Bua.",

          "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) responses to forest gain and loss are highly asymmetric, with stronger cooling per unit gain than warming per unit loss, particularly in tropical and temperate regions. Although this asymmetry has been documented, the mechanisms underlying its spatial heterogeneity remain unclear. Here we integrate satellite-derived LST data with climate, soil, topography, and vegetation data to show that biodiversity is the dominant driver of spatial heterogeneity in this asymmetry. By stabilizing interannual climate variability, biodiversity promotes young tree growth, whose higher evapotranspiration enhances latent heat cooling—the principal mechanism governing asymmetry in tropical and temperate zones. Biodiversity also increases soil nutrient availability, particularly soil organic carbon (SOC), facilitating young tree establishment and growth and amplifying cooling. This SOC-mediated effect is especially important in boreal regions, where vegetation growth is strongly SOC-limited. Our findings emphasize incorporating biodiversity into Earth system models to improve land–climate predictions under global change.",

          "abstract": "Changing weather is an aspect of global warming potentially constituting a major challenge for humanity in the coming decades. Some climate models indicate that, due to global warming, future weather will become more persistent, with surface-air temperature anomalies lasting longer. However, to date, an observed change in weather persistence has not been robustly confirmed. Here we show that weather persistence in terms of temperature anomalies, across all weather types and seasons, has increased during recent decades in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. This persistence increase is linked to Arctic temperature amplification – the Arctic warming faster than the global average – and hence global warming. Persistent weather may lead to extreme weather, and for many plants such as crops, weather persistence can be devastating, as these plants often depend on weather variations. Hence, our results call for further investigation of weather-persistence impact on extreme weather, biodiversity, and the global food supply.",

However, whether traits can reliably predict ecosystem properties and how trait variations affect the accuracy of these predictions remain debatable. Using data from coastal forests and controlled experiments simulating coastal environmental stresses, we conducted a meta-analysis of 396 data points from global studies to identify key traits for predicting ecosystem properties, including species diversity, biomass production, and soil nutrient dynamics. We tested the reliability of using these traits to predict ecosystem properties based on field data from coastal dwarf forests and non-coastal dwarf forests in eastern China (32 site). Results showed that plant height and basal diameter had greater intraspecific variation and effectively predicted ecosystem properties. These trait variations captured biotic and abiotic processes involved in resource capture, utilization, and stress tolerance, demonstrating that key traits, when selected based on mechanistic understanding, can predict ecosystem properties without being hindered by trait variations. Based on our findings, we propose a simplified framework for predicting ecosystem properties by integrating community cluster traits and environmental proxies for ecosystem function traits contained in key traits.",

Tropospheric responses to Arctic sea-ice loss that are robust across models and separable from internal variability have been revealed, including local warming and moistening, equatorward shifts of the jet stream and storm track in the North Atlantic, and fewer and milder cold extremes over North America. Whilst generally small compared to simulated internal variability, the response to Arctic sea-ice loss comprises a non-negligible contribution to projected climate change.

We find widespread declines, with 70% of ecoregions showing significant reductions, primarily linked to rising air temperatures and thinning snowpacks. Causal analysis demonstrates that air temperature and snow depth exert consistent controls on the number of frozen days. A trend-informed assessment based on historical observations suggests a potential average loss of more than 30 frozen days per year by the end of the century, with the steepest decreases in Alaska, northern Canada, northern Europe, and eastern Russia. Scenario-based analysis indicates that each 1 °C increase in air temperature reduces frozen days by ~6-days, while each 1 cm decrease in snow depth leads to a ~ 3-day reduction.

          "abstract": "Wildfire management strategies in the United States historically have focused on suppression activities, but recent work in wildfire policy and ecology has called for a shift in the management paradigm towards prevention. Suppression however remains the budget priority. We design a survey to measure the U.S. public’s preferences for investing public resources to federal wildfire prevention activities. We consider absolute investment as well as investment relative to suppression. Results indicate the public prefers much greater investment in prevention than federally appropriated levels. While people correctly identify the misalignment, they underestimate the extent of the difference between public and agency priorities. We also examine individual actions to reduce the risk of future wildfires. We explore people’s willingness to voluntarily join a local risk-reduction program to reduce community wildfire risk. We find that a large segment of respondents are not only willing to join but support a mandatory requirement for peers to join. Support for government and local prevention is robust across locations, though wildfire risk and exposure matter at the margin. Overall, results indicate that public priorities better align with the expert advice than current practices by wildfire management.",

Yet research offers limited insight into how societal pressures shape the responsiveness and effectiveness of CSR in this sector. Empirical study is further constrained by selective corporate disclosure, inconsistent datasets, and unreliable interview evidence. To address these challenges, this study applies topic modeling, a form of natural language processing (NLP), to stakeholder communication data. Focusing on the Chilean lithium mining industry from 2010 to 2022, the analysis examines how a leading mining company pursued and operationalized CSR through its annual sustainability reports. The findings show that the company’s CSR efforts appear linked to societal pressures, particularly regulatory fines, activism, environmental scrutiny, and investor demands. Persistent drivers included water conflicts, legal actions, and policy changes. The study also demonstrates that topic modeling offers a useful tool for identifying and tracking CSR priorities over time, yielding insights less accessible through conventional research approaches.",

This article spotlights an underexplored complementary strategy in policy, governance, and legal domains: climate shaming—the use of public condemnation to encourage climate-responsible behaviour among governments, corporations, and their leaders. While shaming has been studied and applied as a regulatory and governance tool in other contexts, only a small but growing body of scholarship has begun to examine its potential in the climate arena. Drawing on multidisciplinary research from the social sciences, the humanities, and law, we review and map the main strands of this emerging literature to show the diverse forms and potential of shaming mechanisms, actors, and messages in the climate domain. Based on this analysis, we identify several gaps in the literature and practice of climate shaming, including explicit regulatory shaming, intergovernmental shaming, shaming of regulators by civil-society actors, and regulatory shaming of industry leaders. We propose expanding the conceptual framework of climate shaming to encompass these neglected dimensions, with the aim of encouraging further research as well as policy and governance experimentation in this evolving field.",

          "authors": "Pardeep Pall, Andrew King",
          "abstract": "Climate projections made using ensembles of model simulations typically present spatial information using ensemble-average changes. However, quantifying and understanding spread in model projections, along with building a picture of different possible climate futures across variables, is critical for meeting decision-makers’ needs. Here we explore projected ensemble ranges in mean and extreme temperature and precipitation metrics and their relationships using simulations from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The range is characterised by ensemble minimums and maximums, along with intermediate percentiles, and heatmaps display the contribution of individual models to the overall global pattern of changes at these points in the range. Furthermore, we examine if the framing of changes, both in terms of a future time slice (2070-2099) and a future global warming level (3 degrees), relative to a historical period (1850-1900), affects interpretation of results. The 2070-2099 time slice exhibits known patterns of change such as Arctic warming, and drying and wetting regions, exacerbated according to the ensemble percentile considered. For extreme temperature metrics, while 25th, median, and 75th percentile changes are relatively evenly contributed to by all models, ensemble-minimum and -maximum changes are instead dominated by only one or two models. In particular, the CanESM5 dominates ensemble-maximum changes by over 40%. Furthermore, the NorESM2-LM dominates ensemble-minimum changes for the coldest night of the year (64%) and contributes largely (23%) to ensemble-maximum changes for the warmest day of the year – which are opposite ends of the most extreme measures we consider. Moreover, for the 3-degrees global warming level, the CanESM5 domination ceases yet the NorESM2-LM domination persists. This has implications for the expression of ensemble ranges in multi-model projections, depending on the framing of the future period, and for the interpretation of what constitutes an outlier model. Thus, we encourage multi-model studies to understand and communicate ensemble spread in their climate projections.",

Utilizing satellite observations from 2000 to 2023, here we show that a significant poleward shift in the multiyear ice replenishment occurs in the north pole region (NPR) of the Arctic (north of 80˚N). The large-scale atmospheric circulation mode, characterized by an extensive and persistent high-pressure (low-pressure) pattern on the Siberia (North America) side, is responsible for the poleward shift of MYI replenishment. Associated with the poleward expansion of the multiyear sea ice replenishment, a significant decline in sea ice thickness over the central Arctic and reduced sea ice volume flux via Fram Strait are identified. Moreover, a strengthened (weakened) connection between summer melting (winter freezing) conditions and MYI replenishment variability is outlined. This indicates that the Arctic sea ice is less resilient to warming than previous reports.",

          "abstract": "In Europe, excessive nutrient pollution in freshwater and marine ecosystems poses a significant threat to human uses of water resources and disrupts aquatic ecosystems, compromising essential ecosystem services. The effectiveness of existing EU policies aimed at mitigating nutrient pollution will be influenced by the combined impact of climate variability and change. It remains uncertain whether current policies will suffice to reduce nutrient pollution to levels compatible with good environmental conditions in freshwaters and coastal waters. This study quantifies nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in European freshwater systems and their delivery to the sea, considering the effects of existing EU policies and climate change up to 2050. Using the GREEN model, we simulated total nitrogen and phosphorus loads from 1990 to 2021 and projected future changes until 2050 using climate projections from 11 regional climate models (EURO-CORDEX) under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Our results indicate that implementing current EU policies—Common Agricultural Policy, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, FitFor55 package for climate neutrality—will reduce nutrient loads to European seas by 2050, with a 10% decrease in nitrogen and 8% decrease in phosphorus loads compared to 2020 values, albeit with significant uncertainty related to climate variability. Regional differences are also explored. Nutrient concentrations in the EU river network are expected to decrease slightly, as well as the potential risk for coastal eutrophication (ICEP index). However, further reductions of 10%–20% beyond existing policies may be necessary to achieve good conditions in large rivers. These reductions could come from improved agricultural practices, nature-based solutions and wetland restoration. Our study suggests that while current measures will lead to improvements by 2050, additional efforts will be required in some regions to achieve good environmental conditions, highlighting the need for integrated nutrient management to avoid imbalances between nitrogen and phosphorus in receiving waters.",

          "abstract": "Larix spp. are the key dominant species in boreal and temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, playing a vital role in the global carbon cycle and ecosystem stability while being highly sensitive to climate change. In this study, we applied an ensemble modeling framework integrating 12 algorithms to assess the potential suitable habitats and centroid shifts of 10 Larix species across the Northern Hemisphere under current and future climate scenarios. Model performance was high (TSS, ROC, and Kappa all &gt; 0.9). Temperature, precipitation, and elevation were identified as the primary environmental drivers shaping species distributions. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in future habitat shifts: some species (e.g., Larix decidua, Larix sibirica, Larix lyallii) are projected to undergo significant habitat contractions, while others (e.g., Larix potaninii, Larix gmelinii var. principisrupprechtii) may experience expansions. For most species, distribution centroids are expected to shift northeastward or northwestward, with more pronounced shifts under high-emission scenarios. These findings reveal the complex response patterns of Larix species to climate change and provide scientific insights for cross-regional forest conservation and adaptive management. We recommend prioritizing conservation of species projected to undergo substantial habitat contraction and safeguarding climate refugia to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",

          "abstract": "Attribution of historical climate changes is particularly challenging for periods before the mid-20th century due to sparse and low-quality observational data, raising questions about which temporal scales best capture the climate system’s response to external forcings and can robustly constrain future projections. To address these issues, this study performs a multi-scale attribution analysis of temperature extremes over the period 1901–2020 and examines the robustness of attribution-based scaling factors across different time scales. Despite uncertainties in the early data, the newly developed homogenized observations show pronounced warming in both cold and hot extremes, along with a lengthening of the growing season during 1901–2020. These trends intensified markedly after the 1950s, with the magnitude of changes approximately doubling for some extreme indices. CMIP6 models successfully reproduce the overall warming trends in observations, although they underestimate the magnitude of changes, particularly in the pre-1950 period. Using optimal fingerprinting, more than 70% of the observed changes are attributed to greenhouse gas forcing, with aerosols offsetting less than 35% of the greenhouse gas-induced warming. Attribution analysis conducted within a large-ensemble model framework across multiple time scales shows that the ranges of best estimates and confidence intervals for scaling factors decrease as the time period lengthens. The century-scale attribution yields the narrowest confidence intervals and most robust best estimates, indicating the most robust detection results. Despite the robustness of century-scale results, scaling factors from 1951–2020 are selected to constrain projections due to more reliable observational constraints. Constrained end-of-century (2081–2100) projections show amplified increases of 20.3–33.1% for most extremes compared to raw projections, highlighting the critical impact of attribution period selection and providing a transferable framework for regional climate risk assessment.",

          "abstract": "Annual or seasonal wildfire burned area has been frequently and successfully estimated by models in fire research; daily area burned (DAB) over a region, however, has never been effectively modeled due to its high variability. This study identified for the first time a strong relationship between DAB and the spatial extent of fire-conducive weather conditions, especially measured by fuel aridity, in Canadian forests. Observations between 2001 and 2023 used to develop the DAB prediction models showed about 126 active burning days per year and an average DAB of 20,788.93 ha nationally, with about two-thirds of these active burning days occurring in summer. The central boreal forests in Canada experienced both more active burning days and higher DAB, while the more extreme DAB occurred in the eastern region. Of the predicted DAB in Canadian forests between 1940 and 2023 using the developed DAB models, 62 days showed a significant increasing trend, averaging about 60.14 ha per year nationally. Such increases were found mainly in the central region, in summer, and between 2000 and 2023. Daily fire activity has also become more concentrated within the fire season, particularly in the eastern region. From 1940 to 2023, the lengths of the periods covering 50% and 90% of annual area burned decreased by 0.12 days and 0.25 days per year, respectively, across the country. Concurrently, extreme DAB events have become more extreme. Over the 84-year period, summer maximum DAB increased by 133.61 ha, number of extreme burning days (days with DAB exceeding the 84-year mean by one standard deviation) increased by 0.36 days, and proportion of area burned within these extreme days increased by 0.33% annually in Canadian forests.",

          "abstract": "Limiting global temperature rise below 2°C requires significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and likely large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). This study assesses the CO2 sequestration and efficacy of two CDR approaches, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE), applied individually and in combination. Using the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2-LM), simulations were designed to ramp up deployment of BECCS and OAE, to an additional area of 5.2 million km² by 2100 for bioenergy feedstock for BECCS, and a CaO deployment rate of approximately 2.7 Gt/year for OAE within the exclusive economic zones of Europe, the United States and China. The combined land-ocean CDR simulation revealed a largely additive carbon removal effect. Over 2030-2100, OAE sequestered 7 ppm of CO 22 with an accumulated 82.3 Gt CaO, achieving a CDR effectiveness of 0.08 ppm (~ 0.17 PgC) per Gt CaO, while BECCS reduced 16 ppm of CO2, with CDR effectiveness of 3.1 ppm per million km² of bioenergy crops. Together, the carbon removal achieved by BECCS and OAE corresponds to anthropogenic CO₂ emissions of 5.4 Gt CO₂/year by 2100, slightly more than 60% of current global transport sector emissions. Notably, the efficiency of BECCS and OAE alone was unaffected by their concurrent deployment. Nevertheless, simulations revealed distinct non- linear interactions, such as declines in land and soil carbon sinks in the combined scenario. Furthermore, all simulations show negligible effects on the global annual mean temperature. These results highlight near-additive CDR responses even under net-negative emissions, but feedback on land and ocean carbon sinks must be considered when designing CDR portfolios. This study provides new insights into CDR portfolio design and Earth system feedback under an overshoot scenario, highlighting both their potential and the need for continued emissions cuts and supportive policies.",

Using high-resolution satellite precipitation data from 1998-2023, this study investigates changes in the spatial inhomogeneity of TC rainfall across China. Results show that TC rainfall inhomogeneity decreases significantly by about 65%, indicating a reduced rainfall in historically high-TC-rainfall areas and an increase in low-TC-rainfall areas. Regionally, this decline is mainly governed by the intra‐regional component in East China, where opposing trends between high- and low-rainfall areas have substantially reduced spatial disparities. In contrast, North China shows a marked increase in TC rainfall, accompanied by increased intra‐regional but decreased inter‐regional inhomogeneity, largely offsetting each other. Other regions exhibit minor or insignificant contributions. These spatial reorganizations of TC rainfall in East and North China are closely linked to the northward migration of TC activity in recent decades, driven by reduced landfalling TCs over Taiwan and Fujian and increased inland penetration of TCs into East and North China. The findings reveal a restructuring of TC rainfall patterns and emphasize the growing regional contrasts in TC‐related hydroclimatic impacts, providing new insights for disaster risk assessments and regional climate adaptation strategies in China.",

          "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, extreme weather is becoming a major threat to global food security. Yet we still lack a good understanding of how these extremes will be distributed across the world’s agricultural lands—particularly across small versus large croplands and pasturelands. In this study, we assess their exposure to extreme weather in a warming world. In a world that is 2°C warmer than today, 25% (11 million km2) of present-day agricultural lands will face over two months of extreme heat, up from 16% today (7 million km2), and another ~2% (5 million km2) will be exposed to a combination of two or more extremes, up from 10% (4 million km2). The total area exposed to prolonged dry conditions and extreme precipitation will remain unchanged (less than 1% or 5 million km2, with increases in some regions balanced by decreases elsewhere), while ~2% less area (2 million km2), down from 7% (3 million km2), will experience a month of frost. Future exposure to extreme weather varies by land use type. Pasturelands will experience prolonged exposure to heat stress, whereas croplands will be exposed to higher excessive rains and heat stress combined. Spatial correlations between farm size and geography indicate potential differences in exposure. Exposure to extreme precipitation and heat stress is highest in small (1-2 ha) and medium (2-4 ha) cropland and pastureland, respectively. These findings offer a preliminary global assessment of how exposure to extreme weather varies by farm size and land use, underscoring the need for tailored adaptation strategies to safeguard food security in a warming world.",

          "authors": "Tanvi Nagwekar, Christopher Danek, Miriam Seifert, Judith Hauck",
          "abstract": "Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) refers to the addition of alkaline material to the surface ocean, which shifts carbonate chemistry towards more oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO 2 . This study compares global OAE with regionally focused deployment in subduction regions of the Southern Ocean, Northwest Atlantic, and Norwegian-Barents Sea. We conducted ensemble simulations using an emissions-driven Earth System Model (ESM) under high- (SSP3-7.0) and low-emissions (SSP1-2.6) scenarios. By 2100, subduction region OAE was nearly as efficient (SSP3-7.0: 0.71±0.03, SSP1-2.6: 0.60±0.04) as global deployments (SSP3-7.0: 0.73±0.01, SSP1-2.6: 0.64±0.03). However, the ESM simulations did not reproduce the efficient vertical carbon transport seen in a previous ocean-only study, as strong internal variability and climate feedbacks to OAE hampered deep ocean carbon storage. The excess ocean CO 2 uptake and atmospheric CO 2 reduction were scenario-dependent (15-19% and 22-41% lower under SSP1-2.6 compared to SSP3-7.0, respectively). The pathways of excess ocean CO 2 uptake and atmospheric CO 2 reduction diverged between the scenarios after the mid-2060s, when atmospheric CO 2 peaked and then declined under SSP1-2.6, with a substantially larger relative land carbon loss in SSP1-2.6 than in SSP3-7.0 for regional OAE deployment. Furthermore, the emissions-driven ensemble simulations showed that climate feedbacks introduced substantial uncertainty in early decades of regional OAE efficiency, posing challenges for near-term Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification. Reviewing our and previous model experiments revealed a strong linear relationship between added alkalinity and oceanic CO 2 uptake and atmospheric reduction, highlighting that first-order effects of OAE on carbonate chemistry are well understood and consistently represented, while the effects of carbon and climate feedbacks (13-20%) and scenario sensitivity are smaller but non-negligible. Overall, our study shows that subduction regions can be a viable option for OAE; however, their efficiency is limited by these feedbacks and scenario sensitivity, which must be accounted for in future regional OAE interventions.",

          "abstract": "Severe coastal and pluvial flooding are both becoming more prevalent due to climate change and urbanization in floodplains. The co-occurrence of these flood drivers is generally assumed to exacerbate the resulting flood impacts, a result referred to as compound flooding. However, few observational or modeling studies have investigated the circumstances under which this occurs. Here, we study the impacts of these combined flood drivers and evaluate the implicit hypothesis of official flood maps, which is that rainfall has a negligible impact on a 100-year coastal flood in terms of the flood depth and flooded area. A coastal system model, configured to capture coastal and pluvial flood drivers, is applied. We evaluate the flooding for different urban landform types, including coastal landfill, convergent areas and other urban terrain, within a model domain covering the Jamaica Bay watershed of New York City. A scenario-based strategy is adopted with a 100-year coastal flood as a control simulation, to which we add a set of realistic scenarios of rainfall data from historical TCs. We also apply a joint probability analysis framework with historical data to evaluate the probability of these compound coastal-pluvial scenarios. Results reveal cases where the pluvial driver compounds the coastal flood through expansion of the flood zone, with a 17% chance of rainfall increasing the flood area by 6-38%, and a 5% chance of an increase of 61-73%. It is rare that floods are significantly deepened but when deepening occurs, it is more common for the convergent zone than for the coastal landfill. These findings quantitatively assess the potential of the pluvial driver to exacerbate flooding, which may influence emergency management strategies such as evacuation plans, shelter arrangements, and related preparedness measures.",

          "abstract": "The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, exerting a significant influence on ocean circulation and marine productivity. In the present climate, positive SAM phases enhance Ekman-driven northward nutrient transport, leading to delayed increases in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the mid-latitude South Pacific. However, the extent to which this relationship will persist under future climate change remains uncertain. Here, we investigate future changes in the SAM–Chl-a relationship using CESM2 Large Ensemble simulations under the SSP3−7.0 scenario. A subset of ensemble members that successfully reproduce observed present-day SAM–Chl-a lag correlations was selected for analysis. In the historical period (1970–2014), Chl-a anomalies in the mid-latitude eastern South Pacific show a distinct peak approximately three months after positive SAM events, associated with enhanced northward nutrient transport. In contrast, future projections (2070–2100) reveal a weakened or absent lagged response, coinciding with reduced westerly wind anomalies and diminished Ekman transport. These results suggest that the SAM’s influence to regulate marine productivity in the mid-latitude South Pacific may decline under continued climate change. This has important implications for future biogeochemical dynamics and highlights the need for high-resolution modeling to better represent fine-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions.&amp;#xD;",

Vertical greenery systems are emerging as multifunctional nature-based solutions to mitigate these issues in space-constrained cities. This systematic review, adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, synthesizes evidence from 34 studies to evaluate Vertical greenery systems effectiveness in stormwater management, factors influencing performance, and barriers to adoption. Results indicate vertical greenery systems can retain 21–87% of stormwater runoff, with modular living walls in tropical climates achieving peak retention under low-intensity rainfall, while Mediterranean and temperate systems leverage optimized substrates and solar-driven evapotranspiration for moderate yet consistent reductions 21–34%. Vertical greenery systems also improve water quality, filtering 60–90% of sediments and pollutants via biofiltration, driven by high root biomass species and layered substrates. Performance hinges on plant selection, substrate composition, and integration with complementary green infrastructure. However, high installation and maintenance costs, substrate degradation under extreme hydraulic loads, frost susceptibility, and policy gaps hinder scalability. Socio-cultural preferences often prioritize aesthetics over hydrological functionality, while knowledge gaps persist in long-term durability and climate adaptability. To unlock vertical greenery systems’ potential, interdisciplinary collaboration, adaptive governance, and financing mechanisms are critical. Future research must prioritize lifecycle analyses, field validations of innovative materials, and policy reforms incentivizing vertical greenery systems integration into urban planning. By addressing these challenges, vertical greenery systems can transcend niche applications to become multifunctional tools for resilient cities, offering co-benefits in biodiversity, heat mitigation, and human well-being alongside stormwater management.",

We quantify the impact of organizations’ fossil fuel use from electricity purchasing and air travel on climate and air quality using a system-level approach, with data from two universities and one corporation based in greater Boston. We use energy system and aviation emission models to estimate marginal emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution precursors, and compare monetized air quality impacts calculated using an atmospheric chemistry-transport model with climate impacts from the same activities. Organizational activities were associated with air quality damages of $88 (54–123)/tCO 2 (electricity purchase) and $265 (192–337)/tCO 2 (air travel), compared to ∼$170–200/tCO 2 in climate damages (2015 USD). Air quality impacts vary spatially, with renewable energy purchases and short-haul flight segments having proportionally more impacts in the US Northeast. Activities with the same CO 2 emissions can have very different overall monetized benefits, suggesting organizations seeking broader sustainability impacts should consider air quality alongside direct climate impacts.",

          "abstract": "Monitoring of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) supports improved understanding of trends, assessment of exposure, and development of strategies to protect public health. However, determining the optimal placement of pollutant sensors is an ongoing challenge, as different sensor configurations may yield varied insights into regional air quality. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that integrates a stochastic advection-diffusion (SAD) model with the Value of Information (VoI) to design a sensor placement strategy for regional PM2.5 monitoring. Predictions from the SAD model are used to compute the VoI based on a cost function that penalizes misclassifications between model-assigned and observed Air Quality Index values. We apply the framework to the Coastal Bend Region of Texas, where increased development is creating new air quality concerns. We compare three weighting strategies: (1) combined weighting, which accounts for both population density and social vulnerability; (2) vulnerability-focused weighting, which emphasizes socially vulnerable communities regardless of population density; and (3) unweighted VoI, which solely focuses on minimizing assignment error without demographic weighting. With a 10-sensor installation, the combined strategy covered areas with 22–88% higher population density than the other schemes, whereas the vulnerability-focused strategy reduced uncovered social vulnerability by 6–19%. Prediction accuracy differed by less than 1.5% across strategies. While differences in outcomes are expected given the distinct objectives, the framework adds value by quantifying these trade-offs and enabling a systematic sensor placement strategy that best aligns with policy goals. The proposed framework is scalable to different sensor types and capable of balancing information gain, population exposure, and social vulnerability, providing a versatile tool to guide sensor network design under resource constraints.",

We argue that these largely temporary temperature effects of methane emissions are apt to be offset by temporary CO 2 removal. Temporally matching offsetting temperature reductions to the temperature impulse of methane eliminates the sizable intertemporal welfare transfers that occur when methane is offset by equivalent permanent CO 2 removals. Assessing equivalence based on avoided economic damages suggests that about 87 temporary CO 2 removals over a period of 30 years are needed to offset 1 t of methane. Agreement on the appropriate quantity of temporary CO 2 offsets is insensitive to controversial parameters such as the social discount rate, climate damages and future emission scenarios. Short-term monitoring periods of 20–30 years are likely to be more credibly enforceable for various nature-based CO 2 removal projects than long-term monitoring requirements.",
