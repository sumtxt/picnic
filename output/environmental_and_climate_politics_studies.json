          "abstract": "Animal Feeding Operations or AFOs, such as beef feedlots, dairy farms, and hog farms, are associated with elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter (e.g., PM 2.5 ). The geographic distribution of AFOs in the United States is not well-documented, hindering efforts to identify affected communities and assess health impacts from this pollution. This study introduces the most comprehensive spatial database of these operations available for the United States, composed of 8763 cattle operations and 6963 hog farms, and clarifies their influence on particulate matter concentrations. Results reveal a high geographic concentration, with just thirty counties containing roughly 25% of all identified feeding operations. PM 2.5 levels are significantly higher in census tracts with these operations than in those without: 28% higher in tracts with cattle operations and 11% higher in tracts with hog farms. Pollution burdens disproportionately affect socially vulnerable, minority populations with limited health insurance coverage, underscoring the need for targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and solar geoengineering (chemtrails) tend to reinforce one another, thereby posing significant challenges to public policy and scientific norms and generating confusion by conflating disparate issues. This paper is based on ongoing ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the United States, Germany, Switzerland, and France since 2015 in these two areas of active conspiracy attention, involving observation of social media pages and blogs, active participation in gatherings, and semi-structured interviews. Here, I adopt a diplomatic perspective, highlighting the reciprocal suspicion between science policy and conspiratorial thinking in a competition between two sets of connections of scientific facts, values, politics, fears, and hopes. The present study suggests that the contamination of the scientific discourse by seemingly unrelated claims in conspiracy theories offers fruitful insights to science communication into how publics make sense of science and technology in the fierce debates surrounding immunization and climate policy.",

          "abstract": "Despite high confidence in the intensification of the hydrological cycle due to global warming, the future spatiotemporal patterns of extreme precipitation remain uncertain. Here we explore how climate change influences the seasonal timing of extreme precipitation events, using daily output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. We show that at latitudes between about 45°N and 75°N in Eurasia and North America, where extreme precipitation typically peaks in summer, climate models project a substantial shift in the seasonal timing of extreme precipitation from summer into the colder seasons, spring and autumn, or even into winter, by the late 21st century. We show that this shift is associated with reduced moisture supply during strong updraft events in summer. These results point towards a need for improved representations of processes determining the change in the moisture availability and simulated vertical winds of the atmosphere as well as for adaptation to higher flood risk in colder seasons.",

          "abstract": "Present-day serpentinization systems, such as that at the Mariana forearc, are prominent sources of reduced volatiles, including molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ), and are considered analogs for chemosynthetic ecosystems on early Earth. However, seepage of serpentinization fluids through mud volcanoes at the Mariana forearc seafloor is defined by high pH, and nutrient scarcity, creating challenging conditions for microbial life. We present geochemical and lipid biomarker evidence for a subsurface biosphere shaped by episodic substrate availability, highlighting microbial persistence across steep geochemical gradients within serpentinite mud. Light stable carbon isotope compositions from diagnostic lipids reveal a temporal shift from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation. Membrane adaptations, including unsaturated diether, acyclic and branched tetraether, and ether-based isoprenoidal and non-isoprenoidal glycosidic lipids, reflect microbial strategies for coping with this extreme environment. Our findings establish the Mariana forearc as a unique serpentinite-hosted biosphere, where life operates at the fringes of habitability.",

          "abstract": "North American beavers ( Castor canadensis ) build dams and ponds that alter streamflow, enhance floodplain water storage, and provide refugia during droughts and wildfires. However, drivers of pond area variability remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the influencing factors that drive pond area and dam length variations using an explanatory modeling approach, after mapping surface water area of beaver ponds and creating beaver pond complexes. Mapped area correlated well with manual delineations (r 2 = 0.89), and additive pond area and dam length across 87 complexes followed a significant log-log scaling relationship. Dam length was the strongest covariate of pond area, while woody vegetation height and stream power index were also influential; together, these covariates explained 74% of the variation. Our results provide an empirical foundation to inform site selection and prioritization for beaver restoration, supporting watershed management, climate resilience and ecological conservation strategies in regions with comparable data availability and landscape characteristics.",

          "authors": "Colm Duffy, Carl Doedens, Róisín Moriarty, Hannah Daly, David Styles, Malte Meinshausen",
          "abstract": "This study critically examines the use of ‘no additional warming’ approaches, such as temperature neutrality (TN), to determine national climate policy on agricultural methane (CH 4 ). The reduced-complexity climate model MAGICC was used to quantify future national warming contributions for Ireland (a country with high per-capita CH 4 emissions driven by large-scale dairy and beef production) under a business-as-usual pathway and three alternative scenarios: (1) TN, (2) a split-gas emission target, or (3) net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. TN implicitly ‘grandfathers’ CH 4 emissions, ‘rewarding’ modest emission reductions even when per capita warming remains high, thereby shifting the mitigation burden and constraining the developmental space for low-income, food-insecure countries. Weaker CH 4 emission reduction ambition, i.e. use of TN at the national level, is often justified on the basis of protecting global food security, because it can avoid ‘emission leakage’ from countries that export livestock products with below-average GHG intensities. However, this study demonstrates such justifications have little merit given that global trade in animal-sourced foods largely benefits wealthy markets, and often relies on imported feed, contributing to indirect land use change. The study concludes that the TN approach is not a robust basis for fair and effective national climate policy, and risks a potentially costly underestimation of both long-term CH 4 mitigation and carbon dioxide removal in the context of national planning for an equitable, sustainable, food secure future.",

          "authors": "Kevin T. Smiley, Ilan Noy, Michael Wehner, Oliver Wing, KayLynn Larrison",
          "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The role climate change plays in increasing the burden placed on governments and insurers to pay for recovery has not been extensively explored and is the focus of this study. This study examines the impacts of climate change attributed flooding on federal disaster aid disbursement in Harris County, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Our approach uses flood models to estimate the amount of flood damages attributable and not attributable to climate change under two climate change attribution scenarios from peer reviewed studies: 20% and 38% more of the rainfall associated with the hurricane was due to climate change. These estimates are combined with census tract-level disbursement data for FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Individual Assistance (IA) part of the Individuals and Households Program. We employ spatial lag regression models with direct and spatial spillover effects to analyze the relationship between a tract’s flood damages – both attributed and not attributed to climate change – and federal disaster aid. We find that both types of flood damage shape federal aid disbursements, but that climate change attributed damages tend to have larger effect sizes (elasticities) especially for IA. Specifically, for a 1% increase in additional climate change attributed damages per household in a census tract (under the 20% scenario), expected NFIP levels in that census tract are 0.26% higher and IA levels are 0.3% higher. Implications center on federal funding in an era of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Climate change has emerged as a major global challenge, impacting various sectors, including supply chains. As climate-related risks increasingly disrupt global supply chains, understanding their effects on corporate behavior is becoming ever more important. This study utilizes panel data comprising 2,090 firm-year observations from publicly listed companies in China between 2009 and 2022 to explore the relationship between supply chain climate risk and corporate green innovation. We develop a supply chain network-based climate risk indicator by applying textual analytics and machine learning to firm disclosures, conducting analyses at the overall, industry-specific, and group levels. The empirical results reveal that supply chain climate risks significantly promote green innovation in firms, with this relationship remaining robust even after multiple checks. Additionally, the study finds that the extent of supply chain digitalization positively moderates this effect. Heterogeneity analysis further shows that state-owned enterprises, high-pollution firms, companies with stronger managerial capabilities, and businesses located in low-carbon pilot cities are more significantly impacted by supply chain climate risks, exhibiting a stronger inclination toward green innovation. This research underscores the importance of addressing climate risks in supply chains as a key driver of corporate green innovation and highlights the critical role of digitalization in enhancing supply chain resilience.",

          "abstract": "As population density and economic activities continue to grow in urban areas, household solid waste (HSW), especially household plastic waste (HPW), has become a pressing issue in Japan. This study aims to investigate the social factors influencing the generation and recycling rate of HSW and HPW in urban Japan. Using panel data from 105 cities across the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, we conducted an actual situation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis. Social factors were categorized into demographic (age, gender, income) and non-demographic factors, including economic, infrastructure-related, and HPW-related policy indicators. The actual situation analysis revealed a rise in HPW and stagnant recycling rates in Japan. Regression results confirmed several previous findings, such as older people generating less HSW and recycling more, and positive correlations between economic indicators and recycling rates. Novel findings include: 1) people aged 20-29 and those with higher incomes generate less HSW but more HPW; 2) females are negatively linked to recycling, possibly due to shifting gender roles; 3) higher power generation efficiency of incinerator facilities is statistically associated with higher HPW generation and lower HPW recycling, suggesting a structural trade-off in cities that focus on energy recovery rather than recycling HPW; 4) HPW-related policy indicators significantly improved both HSW and HPW performance.

          "abstract": "Understanding inequality in groundwater access and cropland ownership is critical for assessing the sustainability and equity of agricultural systems, especially in regions facing climatic and socioeconomic patterns such as drought and cropland consolidation. These two forms of access are deeply interconnected: for instance, cropland ownership often determines who can access and control groundwater. Due to data challenges, however, few studies have quantified groundwater access inequality in the same ways that land ownership has been quantified. Similarly, the regional scale of most analyses to date limits our understanding of factors that shape and modify these interconnections. Our study aims to address this gap by constructing a novel geospatial dataset by matching groundwater wells with cropland parcels across California’s Central Valley. We quantify the magnitude and spatial patterns of groundwater and cropland inequality and examine how it scales with land ownership, crop types, and surface water access. Our results indicate substantial inequality in both groundwater access and land ownership, with the top decile of well owners possessing 46.4% of the region’s total well capacity. These well owners are more likely to allocate groundwater to high-revenue, water-intensive perennials such as almonds and walnuts. Furthermore, large landholders tend to have far more wells, deeper and higher-capacity wells, and greater access to surface water resources. However, we observe consistently wider inequality in land ownership than water access, and larger landowners possess less well depth and capacity per hectare. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of California's historical lack of regulation on groundwater, particularly with respect to inequality in open access vs private property resources. We also consider possible lessons for future groundwater regulation and distribution mechanisms for groundwater rights under California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Prevailing just transition proposals often assume the continuity of colonial land relations and see “greener” industrial development as a pathway to prosperity for all. Our paper aligns with and aims to contribute to emerging scholarship that questions these assumptions. Through a review of interdisciplinary just transition research, we map a distinction between mainstream, critical and reparative approaches to just transitions. Mainstream perspectives, largely rooted in the global north, focus on labour justice, while critical just transition scholarship addresses intersectional injustices and amplifies grassroots perspectives, particularly from the global south. Reparative approaches extend this critique by reckoning with the interconnected historical legacies of colonialism and industrial development, though empirical examples of this approach remain sparse. To differentiate these approaches, we introduce a 5R framework for just transitions—recognition, representation, redistribution, resurgence, and (settler) responsibility—foregrounding Indigenous resurgence as a crucial yet often overlooked element of repair. To illustrate this framework, we draw on a community-directed collaboration with the Tremembé da Barra do Mundaú Indigenous community in Ceará, Brazil. We conclude by inviting environmental and social scientists to consider more historically grounded and relationally reparative just transition approaches. Such approaches are essential, though not sufficient, for realizing the more transformative aims of just transitions.",

          "authors": "Camille Bouvet-Boisclair, Graham K. MacDonald",
          "abstract": "The benefits of crop diversification for key agro-environmental outcomes are well-established, yet the pathways to realizing this diversification at larger scales remain murky. We propose a framework to evaluate possible spatial and temporal crop arrangements that meet specific crop diversity targets by drawing on empirical data across millions of individual crop fields and their recent cropping histories in the U.S. (2015-2022). Specifically, we develop a simple rule-based model to raise crop species diversity to various levels of spatial and temporal crop diversity (driven by crop rotations) already attained by farmers in areas with broadly similar soils and climate (‘attainable diversity’). We demonstrate that small changes on the local scale have sizeable cumulative effects. For example, switching crops in 3.4% of fields (corresponding to 12.4% of U.S. cropland area) in the 75th percentile attainable diversity scenario would raise national-scale crop diversity by over 50% (effective number of crop species increased from 7.6 to 11.5). These simulated changes in crop diversity have clear spatial patterns associated with cropland extent and field size. Finally, we examine how the geographic redistribution of key commodity crops (maize, soybean, and wheat) resulting from these crop switches would influence crop yield and production outcomes. While geographic redistribution has limited influence on yields of these three crops, including some potential yield gains, net national production declines (by ~10-13% in our main spatial diversification scenario) due to their reduced share in the cropland portfolio as minor crop groups expand. By drawing on a pool of crops that are already grown in areas with similar field sizes, climate, and soils, our results can help inform realistic strategies toward national-scale crop diversification—illustrating potential ‘low-hanging fruit’ for crop transitions across different landscapes. Our proposed empirical attainable diversity framework adds nuance around the opportunities and barriers associated with efforts to raise agrobiodiversity.",

          "abstract": "The 35°C threshold-based heatwave (HW) holds particular significance for human health, energy supply and animal welfare, serving as a critical criterion for issuing high-temperature warnings in China. However, the quantified influence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols (AA) on HW days (HWD) and cumulative intensity (HWS) remains underexplored. Here, we investigated these influences based on a threshold adjustment method and optimal fingerprint method. Using observations from 1961–2020, we found that both HWD and HWS experienced a clear increase across most of China, with the largest changes centered in eastern and northwestern China. Bias-corrected CMIP6 climate models successfully reproduced the observed changes as well as the regional differences. Anthropogenic forcing dominated by GHGs was robustly detected, with the influence of GHGs and AA successfully separated. Attribution analysis revealed that GHGs explained about 126.3% of HW changes. Constrained projections indicated that both HWD and HWS would continue to increase until 2050, even under the most optimistic low-emission scenario. Eastern China was projected to experience fast HW increase, likely due to intensified GHG emission combined with anticipated reduction in AA in the future, highlighting the urgency of developing mitigation and adaptation policies.",

          "authors": "Yuna Mao, Jiayi Lu, Yan Zhang, Guocan Wu, Bin He, Kaicun Wang",
          "abstract": "Extreme rainfall seasonality plays a critical role in vegetation growth, agricultural production, and water resource management. Under global warming, increasing attention has been paid to its seasonal shifts and nonstationarity characteristics. In our comprehensive research, we utilized daily precipitation data from approximately 2200 gauge stations across China to investigate the spatial patterns, interannual variability, and long-term changes in the seasonality characteristics of annual maximum daily precipitation from 1960 to 2018. In the northern river basins, such as Hai, Songliao, Yellow, and Northwest River Basins, extreme daily events exhibit lower magnitude but stronger seasonality, accompanied by later timing and less variability in the mean date. Conversely, the southern river basins, such as Yangtze, Pearl, and Southeast River Basins, display the opposite pattern. Trend analysis shows that the mean occurrence date of extreme precipitation has generally advanced across most basins. Changes in the seasonality index reveal a clear north–south contrast: in the Northern basins, seasonality has weakened, implying that extreme precipitation events become more dispersed throughout the year. In the Southern basins, seasonality has strengthened, with extreme precipitation becoming more concentrated. The seasonal pattern of total column water vapor (TCWV) partly explains the earlier timing of extremes, especially in northern and central regions.Notably, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exert a discernible influence on the seasonality of extreme precipitation. El Niño induces delayed extremes in the Huai and lower Yangtze River Basin, but earlier events in the Northwest and Pearl River Basin. Notable reduced SI during El Niño versus La Niña phases, indicating La Niña intensifies precipitation seasonality. This study plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of extreme precipitation events, ultimately promoting resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to weather-related disasters.",

          "abstract": "Describing territorial agro-food systems through nitrogen flows between agriculture, livestock farming, human consumption, and external trade represents a useful basis for assessing the environmental sustainability of these systems. The concepts of circularity and self-sufficiency are often put forward in assessments to complement indicators related to environmental impacts, such as nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), environmental N surplus, N losses. Here, we use these indicators to assess the environmental performance and sustainability of the agro-food systems of 127 regions in Europe in their current state as well as under two alternative scenarios of varying degrees of structural changes designed to reach sustainability. Both scenarios consider the projected European population at 2050, a dietary change toward less animal protein (30% and 20%, instead of 57% for the reference situation, Ref 2015–2019) and are based on the widespread use of organic crop rotations and the banning of fertilizers and feed imports. An Agro-Ecology scenario (AE) exploits crop and livestock production at optimal production capacity in the current agricultural areas of each region, thus maintaining the possibility of external trade, while a Radical Simplicity of lifestyle scenario (RS), limits production to regional requirements, with excess agricultural land set aside for reforestation and rewilding. AE and RS are able to feed Europe and greatly reduce environmental losses (more than 50% for both scenarios), but some not self-sufficient regions necessitate interregional exchanges. Full circularity is theoretically not possible; it increases from 30% (Ref) to 43% (AE). At the European scale, N-food self-sufficiency remains over 1 (2.6 for Ref, 1.6-1.2 for AE and RS), while import dependency of European regions on commercial N-import for food delivery, currently over 2.7 as a mean, drops below 0.1 in both scenarios. The results illustrate the complex relationships between self-sufficiency, circularity, and the environmental impact of territorial agro-food systems.",

          "abstract": "East Kalimantan, the designated site for Indonesia’s new capital, faces rising disaster risks due to rapid urban expansion, deforestation, and ecological degradation. These changes increase the likelihood of multiple, co-occurring hazards—posing serious challenges to sustainable development and disaster management. In response, this study developed a multi-hazard probability assessment using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, focusing on four major disasters: floods, landslides, forest fires, and droughts. By applying hazard-specific environmental variables, empirical threshold values, and bootstrap-based uncertainty analysis, the study produced spatially differentiated risk maps and identified areas with overlapping vulnerabilities. The results show that high-probability zones for floods and landslides are concentrated in the southern and central regions, while forest fire and drought risks are more prominent in the northern and western areas. Overlapping hazard zones, though relatively small in spatial extent, highlight critical regions where compound disaster risks may arise. These patterns suggest the need for region-specific mitigation strategies that reflect the dominant hazard characteristics in each area. Overall, the study provides baseline spatial information that can inform land-use planning and disaster management. The identification of environmental thresholds and uncertainty ranges supports more transparent and evidence-based decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Boreal spring is typically considered the onset phase of ENSO, and extracting reliable precursors during this season is therefore essential for improving ENSO prediction. In this study, the spring precursors of Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño are investigated using a multivariable linear inverse model (LIM) that incorporates sea surface temperature (SST), zonal wind stress (Taux), and thermocline depth (TCD). The results reveal distinct precursors for the two event types: EP El Niño events are preceded by westerly wind anomalies centered east of the dateline, along with widespread thermocline deepening across the central and eastern Pacific, indicating the dominance of the subsurface processes. These westerly wind anomalies excite downwelling equatorial Kelvin waves, which propagate eastward and deepen the thermocline in the eastern Pacific, subsequently inducing positive SST anomalies. In contrast, the precursors of CP El Niño are characterized by westward-displaced Taux anomalies, together with SST anomalies extending westward along the equator and southwestward from the Baja California toward the equator, reflecting the leading role of surface ocean-atmosphere feedback in the early development stage. Among the three variables examined, Taux consistently emerges as the influential precursor for both event types, with the zonal displacement of spring westerly anomalies critically modulating the location and intensity of subsequent SST amplification and ultimately determining the type of El Niño that develops. This study systematically compares the spring precursors of CP and EP El Niño events and highlights the diagnostic importance of Taux anomalies, providing new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying ENSO diversity.",

The dynamics at these forest-savanna boundaries depend on their shapes,&amp;#xD;which influence the spread of fires through the savanna landscape. How these boundaries are&amp;#xD;shaped depends on tree recruitment patterns, which differ between trees dispersed by wind&amp;#xD;and those dispersed by birds.

          "abstract": "Several, more recent global warming projections in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)6 contain extensions beyond year 2100 to 2300/2500. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in these projections shows transitions to extremely weak overturning below the surface mixed layer (&lt; 6 Sv; 1 Sv = 106 m3/s) in all models forced by a high-emission (SSP585) scenario and sometimes also forced by an intermediate- (SSP245) and low-emission (SSP126) scenario. These extremely weak overturning states are characterised by a shallow maximum overturning at depths less than 200 m and a shutdown of the circulation associated with North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation. Northward Atlantic heat transport at 26°N decreases to 20-40% of the current observed value. Heat release to the atmosphere north of 45°N weakens to less than 20% of its present-day value and in some models completely vanishes, leading to strong cooling in the subpolar North Atlantic and Northwest Europe. In all cases, these transitions to a weak and shallow AMOC are preceded by a mid-21st century collapse of maximum mixed-layer depth in Labrador, Irminger and Nordic Seas. The convection collapse is mainly caused by surface freshening from a decrease in northward salt advection due to the weakening AMOC but is likely initiated by surface warming. Maximum mixed-layer depths in the observations are still dominated by internal variability but notably feature downward trends over the last 5–10 years in all deep mixing regions for all data products analysed. This could be merely variability but is also consistent with the model-predicted decline of deep mixing.",

          "abstract": "Groundwater stress, a critical challenge for global water security and food production, has intensified due to the interaction of global change drivers and rapidly evolving local conditions. This paper investigates the individual and combined impacts of water availability, heat, population growth, income dynamics, and technological advancements on global groundwater stress over a historical period from 1997 to 2017. Utilizing the gridded Simplified International Model of agricultural Prices, Land use, and the Environment (SIMPLE-G), the study attributes local changes in water and land use patterns to these key global drivers. Furthermore, it evaluates an alternative, counterfactual scenario in which sustainable management interventions for groundwater resources are implemented over these two historical decades. The analysis quantifies the historical contribution of each global change driver to local groundwater stress and measures the economic benefits of a scenario in which groundwater extraction caps and improved technology adoption began in 1997. We find that implementing a groundwater extraction cap combined with irrigation investment beginning in 1997 could have reduced global groundwater withdrawals by more than 34% by 2017, preserving over 5 trillion cubic meters of groundwater in aquifers, with the greatest reductions occurring in South Asia and the western United States.

          "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) are devastating natural phenomena with considerable socio-economic impacts on coastal regions worldwide. Despite their importance for climate mitigation and adaptation planning, the response of TC activity to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has received limited attention. Here, we examine the influence of CDR on TC activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) using an Earth system model under an idealized CDR scenario. Our results show that the WNP-mean genesis potential index (GPI) does not exhibit hysteresis between the ramp-down (model years 249-279) and ramp-up (model years 0-30) periods. This lack of hysteresis is attributed to a regionally asymmetric GPI hysteresis, characterized by a west-east dipolar pattern. The dipole is primarily driven by changes in vertical wind shear associated with a weakened Walker circulation, which is in turn linked to hysteresis in El Niño-like sea surface temperature patterns. Additional simulations using a higher-resolution atmospheric model confirm these findings, revealing no significant change in the number of TCs over the WNP between the two periods. However, a notable 20.11 % decrease in TC landfall frequency in East Asia is identified, attributed to reduced TC genesis over the western part of the WNP between the two periods. These results suggest that CDR could help mitigate TC-related socio-economic risks, particularly in East Asia.",

          "abstract": "Temperature extreme events, associated with major impacts on various socioeconomic sectors, exhibit trends related to global warming and undergo important variability across different timescales. While attention has been given to seasonal and decadal predictions, there is growing interest in exploring the potential for skillful predictions at interannual timescales. In the current study, we assess the deterministic skill of the CESM2-SMYLE in predicting temperature extremes, globally and in all calendar seasons, up to two years. This 20-member ensemble of 24-month hindcasts enables a comprehensive assessment of interannual predictability since it is initialized quarterly per year. The study evaluates the capability of the prediction system to forecast the number of days belonging to episodes of extreme temperature anomalies, considering such anomalies in all calendar seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) and studying each forecast season independently up to 2 years ahead. In general significant predictive skill is found over many regions (depending on the calendar season). As expected, the skill is higher in the first forecast season and generally decreases over time. However, notable skill persists in some regions even up to forecast-season seven. Importantly, in certain regions, significant skill remains up to approximately forecast-season four, even after removing the externally forced signal as estimated from the corresponding uninitialized historical simulations. This suggests that in certain areas, internal variability contributes to the predictability of temperature extremes even beyond the seasonal timescale. Since these areas are affected by ENSO teleconnections, we also assess the role of ENSO as a source of predictability and we find significant contributions especially for the boreal winter (DJF) and spring (MAM) up to forecast-season four. However, there is evidence that additional sources of predictability may contribute.",

The monitoring of vegetation greening is crucial for assessing ecosystem health, sustaining biodiversity, improving soil health, and providing direction for effective environmental management. However, long-term changes in greening trends are rarely reported due to radiometric inconsistencies among different satellite sensors. Here, we used 12 machine learning (ML) algorithms to perform pixel correction on 42 years of MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GIMMS NDVI data. The models exhibited high accuracy (93%–97%), yielding a robust ensemble R2 of 0.88 at the spatial scale. From 1982 to 2023, global NDVI had an increasing trend (0.0012), particularly in the high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere (&gt; 60°N), with the rate of increase accelerating since 2000. Temperature and water conditions showed significant correlations with greening trends, exhibiting spatially asymmetric effects. In addition, frequent land cover changes (FLCC) promoted the growth of greening trends (~23%), which is linked to enhanced structural plasticity of vegetation. This effect has become more pronounced since 2000, with 92% of such changes occurring during this period. Anthropogenic impact may play a role in driving greening trend reductions, rather than enhancements.",
