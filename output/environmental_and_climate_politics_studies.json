          "abstract": "First Nations’ values are frequently overlooked in public and private sector decision-making. Natural Capital Accounting is increasingly promoted for decision-making but overlooks First Nations’ values, limiting its potential. Here, we present three Australian case studies highlighting the approaches, challenges, and progress made towards integrating First Nations’ values into accounting, aiming to distil lessons and help realize accounting’s potential to achieve transformative change in how decisions affecting First Nations people are made globally. We conclude that collaboration, respecting data sovereignty, and prioritizing First Nations’ voices are needed for comprehensive accounting. We recommend establishing an international working group under the auspices of the United Nations to include recognition of these values in accounting and how this recognition can inform decision-making. Recognizing First Nations’ values in Natural Capital Accounting benefits all by making these values visible and providing First Nations people, literally and figuratively, a “seat at the table” in the decisions affecting them.",

          "abstract": "Driven by the essential role of blue carbon ecosystems in mitigating climate change and by scarce regional data, here we aim to quantify carbon sequestration rates and storage in a Moroccan coastal vegetated ecosystem over time using nuclear approaches. The carbon stocks recorded over the past 60 years ranged from 1.35 to 11.07 Mg C org ha −1 in Merja Kahla and from 3.55 to 54.48 Mg C org ha −1 and from 3.57 to 104.58 Mg C org ha −1 in two cores from Merja Zerga. The highest carbon accumulation rates were observed in the top 5 cm of sediment cores, ranging from 14.60 to 53.08 g OC m −2 yr −1 , suggesting a noticeable increase in recent years. These findings highlight the need to integrate blue carbon ecosystems into national policies as nature-based solutions for mitigating climate change and for enhancing the management and conservation of coastal and marine resources threatened by human activities.",

          "abstract": "Detecting C 4 plants consumption is central to investigating animal ecology, agriculture, dietary transitions, and socio-environmental adaptations, and can be done using carbon isotope analysis. The conventional δ ¹³C threshold used to identify C 4 plant intake does not consider substantial ecological variability across Europe. By analyzing over 4,000 δ 13 C values from archaeological C 3 and C 4 grains, we present a European-wide C 3 grain δ 13 C baseline and establish adjusted δ 13 C threshold estimations for C 4 consumption from the site to the ecozone scale using multicomponent environmental models and ecozone cluster analysis. We show that a fixed threshold lead to under- or overestimation of C 4 plant consumption, particularly in northern/humid and southern/arid regions, where the threshold needs to be revised downwards or upwards by up to 2‰. This refined framework offers a more accurate baseline for interpreting human and animal diet and enhances our understanding of the spread, adoption and consumption of C 4 crops across Europe.",

          "abstract": "Favorable wildfire conditions are increasing in frequency and severity across Europe. Understanding how wildfire drivers vary in space and time is crucial for mitigating wildfire risk under current and future climate conditions. Here, we analyze the hydro-meteorological and land-surface drivers of wildfires from 2001 to 2020 across eight European climate regions and their mountain ranges. Our findings reveal that drought conditions and vapor pressure deficit are the dominant drivers of wildfire activity. These drivers vary by season and region: in Southern and Central European regions, persistent warm and dry conditions in preceding seasons favor summer wildfires, while fall wildfires are influenced by fuel build up in spring that loses moisture during dry and hot summer weather. In Northern Europe, these dynamics occur on sub-monthly timescales. Our results illustrate the critical role of compounding wildfire drivers and emphasize the need for targeted mitigation strategies, especially in the light of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Regional thermochronology provides an important record of crustal exhumation through deep time. However, untangling the myriad of geodynamic, tectonic, climatic and surface processes responsible for long-term upper crustal cooling is often hindered by thermochronology data being conventionally interpreted in a static geographic framework. Here, we present a workflow for interpreting thermochronology data and thermal history models via integration with numerical plate tectonic, mantle convection, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Using a compilation of inverse thermal history models from Central Asia, based on fission-track and (U-Th)/He data, we demonstrate the power of placing thermochronology data in their paleogeographic context to untangle the geodynamic, tectonic and climate drivers of exhumation. This shows that the diachronous Mesozoic-to-recent (230-0 Ma) exhumation history of Central Asia was primarily controlled by reactivation of pre-Mesozoic crustal-scale shear zones in response to plate kinematics and Tethyan subduction dynamics, while dynamic topography and changes in paleoprecipitation played relatively insignificant roles.",

          "abstract": "The source characteristics and melting mechanisms for forearc basalts formed during subduction initiation in the western Pacific plate remain unclear. Here we present new Hf-Nd isotopes and trace element data for the latest erupted forearc basalts collected during oceanic drilling in the Bonin forearc. These basalts have εNd values comparable to mid-ocean ridge basalts but much higher εHf, plotting above the terrestrial array, and elevated Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd ratios that indicate an unusually depleted mantle source. Systematic forward modeling indicates that these basalts cannot have been generated solely from the melting of the asthenosphere; both ~160 Ma and Proterozoic refractory mantle are required to explain the observed Hf-Nd isotope decoupling. This study proposes that the Bonin forearc lithospheric mantle may have formed during ancient events. Rollback of the earliest subducting slab caused substantial thinning of the forearc lithosphere and triggered extensive melting in both the asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle.",

          "abstract": "The quantities of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) carried by magmas affect the style of volcanic eruptions and the evolution of Earth’s climate over geological time. There is growing evidence of volatile-rich primary magmas in intraplate domains such as oceanic islands and continental rifts, with CO 2 contents reaching several percent by weight. In most cases, these high CO 2 contents are inferred but not directly measured, because the volcanic products at the surface are strongly degassed. Here, we report the pre-eruptive CO 2 contents measured in olivine-hosted melt inclusions from Bas-Vivarais (Massif Central, France), a typical continental intraplate volcanic province. These basanitic melt inclusions have unusually high CO 2 concentrations of up to 4.8 percent by weight (3.6 percent by weight on average), among the highest ever measured to date. Such CO 2 -rich primary magmas appear to be the rule rather than the exception in continental intraplate settings and require carbon-enriched mantle sources (1475 to 2923 parts per million CO 2 for Bas-Vivarais). Despite relatively small magma volumes, eruptions of low-silica alkaline magmas in continental intraplate volcanic provinces release large amounts of CO 2 in the atmosphere. Thus, these provinces contribute much more to the global CO 2 flux and to the Earth’s short-term climate than their low magma production rates would suggest.",

          "authors": "Isabel Jorgensen, Dustin Garrick",
          "abstract": "Desert lakes worldwide are being lost to human water diversions and land use change,, creating “sacrifice zones” that benefit distant interests. In the American West, scholarly interest has focused on water diversions by both public and private interests as the primary driver of desert lake decline. However, land use change and its underlying motives are also important as they modify surrounding desert basins and impact local social conditions in ways that cannot be predicted by assumptions that public interests support conservation while private interests support development. How can we move beyond the binary of public and private interests to identify distinct patterns of sacrifice zone formation? Here, we propose a typology that goes beyond the public-private binary to systematically measure landowner motives according to a landowner’s publicness, economic objective, and degree of absenteeism, identifying support-, speculation- and sacrifice-motivated landowners. We test three variants of this typology across eight desert basins with differing conservation trajectories. Our results show that (1) the motives related to mixed-use public parcels strongly shape basin-level summaries of motive in terms of area, underscoring their management importance for overall basin land use; (2) although sacrifice- and speculation-motivated private landowners are few, they hold consolidated estates; and (3) their land use activities likely have disproportionate social and ecological impacts. Case summaries of the dynamics for three representative basins further demonstrate the additional insights that could be generated by applying our typology longitudinally and pairing it with qualitative insights. This typology provides a systematic tool for characterizing landowner motives in sacrifice zones. Future research should focus on longitudinal applications and identifying appropriate indicators of social and ecological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Most studies examining demographic disparities in the distribution of environmental burdens have examined only one burden at a time. Few have examined how multiple burdens are concentrated and distributed among the American population.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Objective: The objective of this study was to examine how multiple (13) environmental burdens are concentrated and how concentrated burdens are associated with where vulnerable populations reside.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Methods: We utilized nationally consistent data from the U.S. EPA’s EJScreen database. EJScreen includes 13 environmental burden indicators and five racial/ethnic and socioeconomic indicators. The concentration of environmental burdens was examined by taking into account both the intensity of individual burdens and the count of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds. Graphical and statistical analyses were used to determine how percentages of vulnerable populations varied as the intensity levels and counts of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increased.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Results: Concentrations of vulnerable populations increase as intensity levels of individual environmental burdens increase and as the number of burdens exceeding specified intensity thresholds increases. In most cases these increases are monotonic and highly statistically significant. Among the five demographic categories examined, the strongest relationships were found for percent people of color, followed by percent with limited English. Weaker but statistically significant relationships were found between other socioeconomic categories and increases in the intensities and counts of environmental burdens.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Discussion: Most prior studies have examined the distribution of environmental burdens one at a time. Until recently, nationally consistent data for multiple environmental burdens were not available. Applying the 13 environmental indicators in EJScreen demonstrates that a strong relationship exists between where multiple burdens are simultaneously concentrated and where vulnerable populations reside. That this relationship is stronger for racial/ethnic categories than for other socioeconomic categories reflects outcomes of a history of public policies that have segregated and disadvantaged certain populations in the U.S.",

          "abstract": "Breathe Providence is a community-scale, low-cost air sensing network based in Providence, RI. The objectives of this project are to contribute towards a more comprehensive understanding of air quality in Providence and support environmental justice, community health, and greenhouse gas reduction goals. Towards these objectives, Breathe Providence developed an integrated sensor network design approach, balancing both community and scientific priorities in the site selection process to maximize 1) community investment and collaboration, and 2) data quality and utility. Enabled by partnerships with community-based organizations, guidance from the Providence Climate Justice Plan, and findings from low-cost sensing literature, Breathe Providence’s site selection strategy operated at both the geographic and host-specific level to prioritize data utility for community members, researchers, and policymakers alike. The two-stage network design process employed a Providence-based Air Quality Vulnerability Index to guide and evaluate network development at a geographic level, and a community-informed definition of “meaningful” to guide it at the sensor host level. The result of these efforts is a network of air monitoring stations throughout Providence that is primarily hosted by community-serving institutions and is weighted towards neighborhoods with higher vulnerability to air pollution. The network successfully represents the priorities of the Climate Justice Plan and community-based project partners on both a neighborhood and sensor host level. Sensor hosts have become meaningfully involved through the co-planning of public events, which have in turn broadened the project’s channels for public outreach. Scientific considerations were largely compatible with community criteria; by supporting data quality and completeness, they supported the broader policy applicability goals stressed by community partners. The site selection process presents an essential opportunity to build relationships and align monitoring priorities; as a result, it better positions networks to yield community-relevant benefits.",

          "abstract": "After more than a decade of academic and policy debate about Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) and their policy implications, the full implementation of the world’s first comprehensive CBA is now imminent in 2026 in the European Union (EU). Simultaneously, several other jurisdictions across the Global North are at various stages of implementing their own CBAs. With CBAs transitioning toward real implementation, it is vital to understand their implications for potentially vulnerable trading partners. To this end, we review the current literature on the economic and geopolitical impacts of the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on the Global South. Through taking stock of peer reviewed and grey literature, we conclude that the EU CBAM is likely to lead to considerable welfare losses in the Global South. The decrease in trade between the EU and the Global South, and the associated economic impact, may in turn have wider implications for the international climate and trade regimes. Although the EU CBAM regulation does not exempt the world’s poorest states, the current upheaval in global trade presents an opportunity for EU policymakers and others considering CBAs to revisit exemption policies or explore alternatives for vulnerable trading partners. We conclude with outlining gaps in the current literature and propose directions for future study.",

          "abstract": "Inequality in the provision of urban green spaces (UGS) poses a growing obstacle to achieving SDGs and building inclusive and resilient urban environments. However, the key drivers of UGS development and the extent to which their relative importance in different urban contexts remain unclear. This study provides a global analysis of the socio-economic, geographical, and climate determinants of UGS inequality across 11528 cities by assessing dynamic changes in UGS against the global average. We find that cities in Asia and Africa (6,414 cities of 78 countries) are generally converging toward the global mean from below, while those in North America and Europe (1,416 cities of 46 countries) gradually lost their relative advantages in UGS development. The relative greenness in 13% of the study cities were mainly influenced by built-up area per capita, in 35% by night lightening index, in 9% by GDP per capita, and in 22% by precipitation. We identified three dominant typologies of drivers: those tied to economic intensity (GDPP), urbanization pressure (Nighttime Light Index), and biophysical constraints (Biome &amp; Built-up Area). These typologies align with urban developmental pathways from take-off to mature stabilization, revealing a spectrum of stage-specific challenges. These findings underscore that effective UGS strategies should be tailored to local contexts, make reasonable use of urban ecological endowments, adapt to climate constraints, and integrate green space planning into the specific stage of urban development.",

          "abstract": "Tree planting is expanding across sub-Saharan Africa, spurred by the demand for tree products and new environmental policies. Identifying key actors is important for land use theory and for determining whether tree planting can improve rural livelihoods while contributing to environmental goals. To date, tree-planting analyses focus on obvious actors: large-scale businesses (plantations) and rural smallholders (woodlots). However, absentee, urban-based domestic investors are also engaged. Using southern Tanzania as a case study, we attribute tree planting across plantations and woodlots then analyze the potential contribution of the absentee landowners (absentee treefarms). We quantified plantations’ extent by creating and manually verifying a spatial database of planted areas (ca. 2019). We estimated woodlots’ extent by performing a bootstrap extrapolation of average woodlot area based on field surveys of 3,436 smallholders across 163 villages. We estimated absentee treefarms’ extent based on interviews with village leaders (n=36). We corroborated plantations, woodlots, and absentee treefarms against total planted tree cover as observed from remote sensing. The plantations database corresponded well to remote sensing (R=0.82), but less so for woodlots (R=0.48). A linear model with only plantations and woodlots explained 38% of the remotely sensed planted tree cover while one that included absentee treefarms explained 54%. Unexplained variation is partly due to omission errors for woodlots: 57% of villages (n = 88) had more woodlots based on interview estimates than based on remote sensing analysis. Villages with far more remotely sensed planted trees compared to interview estimates (11%, n = 17) included absentee treefarm sites. Our findings reveal the role of absentee, urban-based domestic investors in tree planting. More broadly, we show that trees planted in rural areas, even in small patches (5 - 500 ha) are not necessarily owned by rural residents. Land use attribution must incorporate absentee owners. Similarly, funding for tree planting, particularly when intended to alleviate rural poverty, must address who benefits and not just where tree planting occurs. We recommend triangulating remote sensing with field assessments to attribute ownership to improve the equity and efficacy of tree-planting campaigns.",

          "authors": "Soheil Radfar, Parastoo Taheri, Hamed Moftakhari",
          "abstract": "Understanding how tides respond to short-term climate variability and long-term climatic trends is central to projecting future coastal hazards. While past research has focused on tide–surge or tide–river interactions, the relationships among tidal constituents themselves remain unexplored. Here we present the first global analysis of tidal constituent co-variability using tide gauge records available since mid-20th century. For each gauge, we identify the dominant constituent and evaluate its rank correlation with other major constituents (M2, N2, S2, O1, K1, MK3, MS4) using a moving window approach that ensures representing nonlinear interactions in high temporal resolution. Correlations were first quantified over the full observational record to characterize the multi-decadal co-variability across the observation network. Subsequently, comparisons between an earlier period (1950–1980) and a more recent period (1981–2019) were conducted to evaluate the presence of nonstationarity in these relationships. Finally, correlation structures were examined under distinct El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases to assess the extent to which large-scale climate variability modulates these dependencies. Results show that tidal constituents exhibit significant co-variability at roughly one-fifth of stations analyzed, with significant changes over time. Significantly larger number of locations (almost twice) exhibit co-variability in the recent era when compared to the earlier period (especially in the North Pacific). ENSO further modulates these relationships, with distinct patterns found during El Nino and La Nina years. These findings reveal that tidal constituents do not vary independently, but co-evolve under both interannual climate variability and long-term change. Recognizing this overlooked dimension of tides provides new insight into tidal dynamics and has important implications for assessing future compound coastal flooding in a warming climate.",

          "authors": "Bingshu Xu, Linfeng Fan, Guoxiong Zheng, Wolfgang Schwanghart, Chunmiao Zheng",
          "abstract": "Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a severe natural hazard on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, posing a risk to infrastructure safety (e.g., the Sichuan-Tibet Railway) and regional socioeconomic development. However, previous GLOF studies often neglected GLOFs’ return periods when evaluating their magnitudes. In this study, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to quantify the peak discharges and flood volumes of potential GLOFs with return periods ranging from 10 to 500 years for the eastern Tibetan Plateau with over 11,000 glacial lakes. The results indicate that the GLOF peak discharge increases from 0.5×103 m3/s at a 10-year return period to over ~8.6×103 m3/s at a 500-year return period, whereas the flood volume increases from ~1.42×106 m3 to ~20.17×106 m3. Future climate change will likely increase the GLOF magnitude, with peak discharge (100-year return period) increasing from ~3.3×103 m3/s in 2015 to ~3.8×103 m3/s in 2100 under the RCP8.5. We further evaluated the GLOF magnitude along the Sichuan–Tibet Railway and identified railway segments crossing the Yarlung Zangbo, Salween, and Jinsha rivers as high hazard areas, where the projected peak discharge exceeded ~2.5×103 m3/s and flood volume surpassed ~9.1×106 m3 in 2100 under RCP8.5. These results underscore the urgent need to integrate GLOF hazards into infrastructure design and enhance the predictive capacity for potential GLOF impacts on river ecosystems, water quality and landscape evolution.",

          "abstract": "Although national emission control policies have contributed to long-term reductions in PM 2.5 levels, responses across neighboring cities remain heterogeneous, complicating the evaluation of policy effectiveness. This study diagnoses the spatial structure and examines temporal evolution of intercity-scale (tens of kilometers) and neighborhood-scale (a few kilometers) PM 2.5 components, separated from background variation including long-range transport, by applying a recently proposed spatial decomposition framework based on spatial coherence to long-term air quality monitoring network data in South Korea (2016-2023). Within this framework, a hierarchical averaging scheme uses coherence-based neighboring stations to define the intercity-scale variability of background-removed PM 2.5 concentrations. Focusing on the cold season (DJFM), spatial diagnosis reveals dominant intercity-scale contributions in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and neighboring industrialized areas, highlighting the effectiveness of air control zone-based policies. In contrast, neighborhood-scale contributions predominate in high-PM 2.5 stations, particularly in the Southeastern Area (SEA), indicating the need for localized interventions. Temporal analysis reveals a structural transition beginning in 2019/20 DJFM, characterized by simultaneous trend reversals: intercity-scale components shifted from increasing to decreasing in the SMA, an area with intensive urban and industrial emissions, while the opposite occurred in the SEA, a coastal city cluster. This transition coincided with the implementation of the Seasonal PM Management policy and the COVID-19 lockdown. The variations in the intercity-scale component broadly align with residual emission intensities of PM 2.5 and NO x , defined as deviations from national emission trends based on the Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) emission inventory. These results reveal a structural shift in intercity-scale PM 2.5 variability and its linkage to emissions, offering a scalable diagnostic tool for evaluating policy effectiveness and underscoring the need for scale-specific air quality management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Air pollution is the leading risk factor for premature human mortality and poses major challenges for air-quality management because emissions, transport, and health impacts often do not align with political and regulatory boundaries. This study introduces the concept of an airshed, as a reduced-complexity, data-driven approach, to quantify transboundary influences and attribute responsibility for premature deaths across jurisdictional boundaries. Applied to PM 2.5 concentrations in the contiguous U.S., the airshed approach reveals that over half the states are net exporters of annual premature deaths, while roughly one third have zero net cross-state contribution. Although premature mortality has declined by ∼35% from 1998 to 2022, the cross-state contribution to premature mortality has remained steady at 40% nationally. This approach highlights the unequal distribution of both health risk and responsibility across state lines. The findings underscore the need for further regulatory strategies and cooperative mechanisms to address interstate air pollution.",

While aerosols constitute a significant air pollutant that impairs PV generation efficiency, few studies have examined how China's clean air action (CAA) plan has influenced solar PV performance. To address this gap, we employ the PVLIB-Python model to quantify PV capacity factors (CF) and power generation changes across China, due to the CAA plan in China from 2013 to 2020. We find that improved air quality has substantially enhanced PV generation, particularly in eastern China, generating up to 41.3 TWh additional electricity per year, estimated with current PV capacity. The largest increases are in provinces such as Shandong and Henan, with heavier air pollution and higher PV installation. By employing multiple CMIP6 models, we also estimate potential future PV power generation changes in China. We find that with sustainable development and strong climate change mitigation policies, the reduced air pollution and increased solar radiation can potentially increase the PV power generation by 37.4 TWh-52.6 TWh per year by the 2050s, without even considering the newly installed PV facilities.",

          "abstract": "Snow is changing globally. Computationally-intensive snow reanalysis products and downscaled climate model projections allow for the estimation of historical and projected changes in snow over ~4-10 km resolutions, but these resolutions are coarse relative to the scales needed for water supply and flood planning. Fine-scale digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely available but are underutilized to make first-order assessments of snow vulnerability. Here, we leverage DEMs at a 7.5 arc-sec (~250 m) resolution, combining these with historical freezing level height (FLH) estimates from ERA-5 to derive estimates of changes in the snow-receiving area (SRA) and its variability across global mountain ranges. Results show estimated SRA declines in 29% (1.9 million km2) of the global mountain area from 1982-2020; 66% of the mountainous areas had no change over the historical period. At +1.5°C of warming relative to the pre-industrial control, global mountain SRA would decline by 9.5% (1.0 million km2) relative to recent conditions. This loss would be approximately doubled with +2°C of warming. In a +4°C warming scenario, an additional 34% (3.6 million km2) of SRA is lost beyond the +2°C case. Across individual mountain ranges, SRA losses can occur nonlinearly with warming, with some locations that have historically had relatively minor SRA losses at risk of substantially larger losses in warmer climates. Analysis using coarser-resolution DEMs can underestimate or overestimate SRA and its rate of loss, with the largest impacts in relatively warm, low-elevation mountain ranges. Results of this work provide estimates of projected loss in snow-receiving area at policy-relevant warming levels; inform the resolutions needed for process-based snow modeling; identify snow vulnerability hotspots; and provide a new integrated approach to snow vulnerability assessment that is achievable at global scales and highlights potential nonlinearities from recent trends to a variety of future warming scenarios.",

          "abstract": "In the past decade, California has invested over $200 million in direct grants to growers to support the adoption of agricultural practices that save water and/or improve soil health while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ex-post evaluation of agri-environmental outcomes of these grant programs, however, is limited. We use satellite data to monitor changes in field-level consumptive water use and greenness (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), a proxy for agricultural productivity, for the most frequently funded crop-types (almonds, grapes, and walnuts) in two California Department of Food and Agriculture programs. Nearly 600 fields receiving funding during the 2014-2022 period were analyzed using two causal inference methods. Fields that received grants to both upgrade irrigation systems and install irrigation water management sensors showed reduced consumptive water use and greenness by an average of 3.5% and 4.2%, respectively (significant at the 10% level). In contrast, we find that the adoption of only irrigation water management sensors, which are designed to inform irrigation scheduling and management, resulted in an average increase of 4.1% and 4.8% in consumptive water use and greenness respectively (significant at the 5% level). We find negligible effects for either consumptive water use or greenness when both pump efficiency upgrades and sensors were implemented. We further find that grants for compost addition and cover cropping led to small greenness increases of 1.7% and 2.8% respectively (significant at the 10% level) and had insignificant effects on consumptive water use. Our analysis of five agri-environmental program interventions reveals that several practice outcomes may be at odds with stated program goals of reducing water use while maintaining or improving agricultural productivity.",

However, the magnitude of this thermal buffering is strongly influenced by forest structure and management, and remains understudied. Using a comprehensive dataset of in-situ microclimate time series and high-resolution forest inventory data in Finland, we provide the first country-wide estimate of microclimate temperature buffering in boreal forests. We found that only 17% of forestry land has buffered climatic conditions, while in one-quarter of the land, temperature variation is amplified primarily due to low canopy cover in young stands. The microclimatic buffering patterns vary with biogeographical gradients. The extensive impact of forestry on boreal microclimates highlights the enormous potential of forest management to maintain stable temperatures. Prioritizing management practices that preserve canopy cover can help promote buffered microclimates in boreal forests.",

In this study, we present a fragility-based modeling framework to estimate material replacement needs for building components damaged at specific flood depths. We develop fragility curves for each building component using a triangular cumulative distribution derived from expert judgement due to the lack of empirical data on flood losses, especially at the component level. By combining these estimates with life cycle GHG emissions for each component in a Monte Carlo simulation, we derive probabilistic, emissions-based damage curves for single-family residential structures which comprehensively account for uncertainty in the estimates. We then applied these damage curves to estimate the GHG emissions caused by a 100-year flood in two testbed regions in the Mississippi River Valley. Our results show that including the social costs of GHG emissions can increase the valuation of total flood damages by over 6%. Our results also show that flood impact estimates are highly uncertain Our model can be used by planners in cost-benefit analyses of flood risk management projects to show that such projects are more economically efficient than current methods would report.",

          "abstract": "Understanding long-term evolution of groundwater storage (GWS) is critical for water security in High Mountain Asia (HMA), where hydrological systems are heavily dependent on glacier-fed recharges. However, the impacts of climate changes and human activities on historical and future GWS remain insufficiently quantified. Here, we integrate remote sensing, Earth system modelling, and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess historical trends and project future evolutions in GWS across HMA. Remote sensing reveals that approximately 69% of the regions experienced GWS declines during 2003–2020, with annual losses totalling -24.2 Gt, particularly in densely populated and irrigated downstream basins such as Ganges-Brahmaputra and Indus. Using a Transformer-based framework, we attribute 47% of GWS variability to direct climate drivers and an additional 15% to cryospheric processes, while human activities contribute up to 38% of declines. The identified GWS decline in downstream basins along with its intensifying pattern is further corroborated by 2554 in situ groundwater well observations. Our data-driven projections further indicate a sustained climate-induced threat to groundwater sustainability in high-risk basins through the end of the century when maintaining current water-use levels. While cryospheric melt may temporarily offset losses until the 2060s, this buffering effect will diminish over time and lead to accelerated depletion under climate warming. This study demonstrates the value of combining remote sensing with explainable AI to improve groundwater assessment and support climate-resilient water management in high mountain regions worldwide.",

We find that deeper soils experience less intense but longer-lasting heatwaves than shallower ones. Since 1960, soil heatwave frequency, duration, and intensity have increased in all depths, with deeper soils showing greater increases in duration and smaller increases in intensity. These trends have been accelerated recently by ~50% (~100%) in shallow (deep) soils during 1990–2017, relative to 1960–2017. Around 60.4% of China’s croplands are facing increasing exposure to soil heatwaves, especially in major breadbaskets such as the North China Plain.

Results show a significant decrease in typhoon-precipitation contribution to total precipitation across the entire SEA, both in its continental and maritime regions, especially during the boreal summer half-year. This trend persists under heavy precipitation conditions (95th and 99th percentiles). In contrast, based on tracking results, non-typhoon heavy precipitation shows increases in precipitation area but decreases in lifespan intensity, yielding more total precipitation per event. Our findings indicate a shifting hazard regime: a decrease in typhoon-related rainfall is being offset by a spatial expansion of non-typhoon heavy precipitation, introducing a new regional risk. The findings provide critical insights into the change of regional precipitation patterns and have implications for disaster management and adaptation in SEA.",

We find that uncertainties in precipitation projections are substantially larger than those for surface temperature. Integrated precipitation uncertainties are strongly linked to uncertainties in both global and Antarctic surface temperatures, while atmospheric circulation-particularly the Pacific South American (PSA) modes-plays a critical role in regional precipitation patterns of precipitation uncertainties.

          "abstract": "Halogenated Very Short-Lived Substances (VSLS) represent a growing source of chlorine to the stratosphere where they may contribute to ozone layer depletion. Chloroform (CHCl3) is a prominent VSLS with poorly constrained anthropogenic sources that include its unintentional production when wood pulp is bleached for paper production. Recent assessments of the global CHCl3 budget have relied on emission factors (EFs) for the pulp/paper sector derived some 35 years ago when industrial practices where markedly different. Here, we analysed data from the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers of the USA, Canada and Japan. Combined with data on the national number of pulp mills and bleached wood pulp production volume, we derive plausible lower and upper limit EFs. These factors show a downward trend since the early 2000s which we attribute to a continued phase-down in the use of 'elemental chlorine' bleaching in favour of 'elemental chlorine free' bleaching. The derived mean EFs for the period 2000 to 2020, expressed as mass of CHCl3 per air-dried tons of (adt) of bleached pulp, are in close agreement for the regions considered: USA (39.8 ±32 g/adt), Canada (38.6 ±29.8 g/adt) and Japan (30.1 ± 8.6 g/adt). Assuming these factors are broadly representative of other world regions, a mean annual global CHCl3 source of 3 (1-6) Gg/yr from the pulp/paper sector is estimated for the approximate 2000 to 2020 period. We conclude the sector's contribution to the global CHCl3 budget has likely decreased considerably since the 1990s and that the use of older EFs to calculate present day emissions should be avoided.",

Rapid afforestation with commercial tree plantations is transforming fire-prone savannas and grasslands globally and particularly in tropical South America, yet its effects on fire dynamics remain poorly understood. Using hierarchical models, we analysed trends in annual burned area within concentric buffers (1 to 6 km) around each of 44 plantation and 52 grassland sites in Colombia’s Orinoquia region—a savanna grassland forest mosaic undergoing major land-use transitions from the expansion of commercial tree plantations. Plantations reduced burned areas in two ways: order-of-magnitude increases in plantation area reduced burnt area by 15% and plantation sites reduced their burnt area by 2% each year; both results consistent with trees replacing more inflammable grassland vegetation. While the mechanisms behind divergent savanna/plantation fire dynamics remain unresolved and could involve active fuel management and fire response, increased canopy cover or some combination thereof, this study provides spatially explicit, context-sensitive evidence on how land-use transitions interact with fire regimes with direct relevance for grasslands and savanna management and climate adaptation policy in South America.",

The impacts of upcoming extreme climate stressors on future vegetation dynamics are not well understood, even though earlier research has looked at how vegetation responded to a small number of historical extreme climate events. Here, we simulated historical Net Primary Productivity (NPP) (1982-2020) using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford model, identified key extreme climate factors through geographical detector method (GDM), and projected future NPP variations (2023-2100) under different climate scenarios using a partial least squares regression model. Result showed that 72.3% of IM experienced increasing NPP during 1982-2020, with 28.2% showing significant increase, mainly in northeastern and eastern regions. Consecutive wet days, heavy precipitation days, cold nights, and maximum temperature were identified as key contributors to NPP changes using GDM, with explanatory powers of 0.903, 0.781, 0.704 and 0.63, respectively. In southern IM, there were considerable increases in NPP as predicted by the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, while eastern and western regions showed significant decreases exposure to combined extreme climate events. Our study provides the comprehensive assessment of future NPP reactions to combined extreme climate events in IM.

          "abstract": "Nepal’s hydrological regime, shaped by steep topography, monsoon-dominated rainfall, and extensive cryospheric systems, offers a useful testbed for understanding how climate change and human activities are reshaping water resources in mountain regions globally. Despite abundant water sources, Nepal faces persistent water security challenges driven by extreme seasonality, rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and rapid land-use change. In this review, we synthesize current evidence on anthropogenic drivers of hydrological change in Nepal and draw lessons relevant to other data-sparse, high-mountain and monsoon-influenced regions. We find that warming-induced glacial retreat, altered snowmelt timing, and changing monsoon dynamics are intensifying wet-season flood risks while heightening dry-season water scarcity, patterns increasingly observed across the Himalaya, Andes, and other mountain systems. Human activities, including urban expansion, agricultural intensification, hydropower, and extraction of sediments from rivers, further modify river flows, reduce groundwater recharge, and increase vulnerability to extremes. Yet major uncertainties persist, especially concerning high-elevation hydrology, permafrost dynamics, sediment extraction, and the cumulative impacts of expanding infrastructure. Nepal’s pronounced topographic and climatic gradients limit broad generalizations, underscoring the need for region-specific hydrological monitoring and modeling. These challenges mirror global limitations in mountain hydrology, where sparse observations and rapidly changing conditions constrain predictive capacity. By identifying key knowledge gaps and highlighting cascading impacts on agriculture, hydropower, domestic water supply, and aquatic ecosystems, this review emphasizes the urgency of strengthening monitoring networks and integrating uncertainty into water management and climate adaptation strategies. Nepal’s experience offers broader insights for countries facing similar pressures at the intersection of climate change, development, and fragile mountain water systems.",

          "abstract": "Projections of glacier change typically focus on mass and area loss, yet the disappearance of individual glaciers directly threatens culturally, spiritually and touristically significant landscapes. Here, using three global glacier models, we project a sharp rise in the number of glaciers disappearing worldwide, peaking between 2041 and 2055 with up to ~4,000 glaciers vanishing annually. Regional variability reflects differences in average glacier size, local climate, the magnitude of warming and inventory completeness.",
