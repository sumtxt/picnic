          "abstract": "Extreme flooding and prolonged, intensifying droughts have played a critical role in the rise and collapse of preindustrial states and empires worldwide, triggering cascading impacts such as crop failure, famine, and migration that undermined socio-political stability and economic resilience. We present a multicomponent hydroclimatic vulnerability model for crop supply networks to estimate the contribution of climatic stressors as one of several factors contributing to the decline of the late Tang Dynasty in northern China between 800 and 907 CE. We demonstrate that recurrent flooding and prolonged droughts, combined with an unsustainable shift in crop production from drought-tolerant millet to less resilient wheat and rice, led to harvest failures and food shortages during the cooler and drier climatic conditions of the late 9th and early 10th centuries CE. Intensifying raiding from competing polities and climatic extremes further affected grain supplies for the late Tang’s northern military frontier and partly contributed to the sudden decline of the dynasty. Our results emphasize the importance of multicomponent environmental response models to understand historical transformations and provide new aspects of China’s socio-political development during medieval times.",

          "abstract": "Polar Lows are intense weather systems that drive strong exchanges of momentum, heat, and moisture between the atmosphere and ocean, potentially affecting ocean conditions. However, their small scale and short duration make them poorly represented in climate numerical models. Here, we use sensitivity experiments to assess the impacts of Polar Lows on the global ocean. Their effects vary regionally, depending on both Polar Low frequency and ocean structure. In the Northeast Atlantic, wind associated with Polar Lows enhances oceanic heat loss and vertical mixing, while precipitation has a minor opposing effect. In the Labrador and Irminger Seas, both wind and precipitation contribute similarly to horizontal heat transport, and their opposing effects largely cancel, reducing the net impact. In the Southern Hemisphere, despite frequent Polar Lows, strong background winds minimize their influence. These findings highlight regional variability in Polar Low impacts and offer insights for improving their representation in climate models.",

          "abstract": "The ocean absorbs about 25% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, with this uptake regulated by acid-neutralizing anions collectively termed alkalinity. Most seawater alkalinity originates from the weathering of aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals on land, whose dissolved products are transported to the ocean by rivers, a slow process that causes carbon dioxide removal to lag behind emissions. Here we present geochemical evidence showing that fine-grained glacial sediments mobilized by coastal erosion undergo rapid seafloor weathering. While aluminosilicate weathering is largely balanced by secondary clay formation (reverse weathering), carbonate dissolution yields a significant net release of alkalinity to coastal waters. Because more than two-thirds of the global coastline was formerly glaciated, ongoing deglaciation and erosion may enhance alkalinity fluxes, providing a previously unrecognized shortcut in the global carbon cycle. As this enhanced flux is ultimately driven by climate warming, it may act as a negative feedback that helps moderate future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.",

          "abstract": "The European Union recently adopted ReFuelEU Aviation as a regulation to stimulate the use of alternative aviation fuels. We explore how this affects the climate impact of European aviation and its alignment with notions of successful climate change mitigation. Using stock-and-flow modelling and lifecycle assessment, we analyse the role of hydrogen in decarbonising the aviation system. We find that the adoption of alternative fuels alone does not guarantee successful mitigation, since the resulting temperature change can vary widely (2.2-8.9 millikelvin estimated by 2070) and most scenarios exceed CO 2 -based targets. Although alternative fuels can greatly reduce CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 impacts—with hydrogen-powered aircraft yielding the largest reductions—persistent air traffic growth drives the near-term use of fossil resources and the long-term scale of non-CO 2 effects. Therefore, we recommend reassessing aviation climate targets, including the consideration of non-CO 2 effects in budget-based targets and stronger incentives to reduce near-term fossil kerosene use.",

          "abstract": "Warming can alter the temporal stability of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in grasslands. However, it remains unclear how ANPP stability responds to long-term warming. Through a 10-year in-situ manipulative warming experiment conducted in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found warming initially enhanced ANPP stability and the positive effects of warming on ANPP stability tended to decline as the duration of the experiment was extended. Increased community height primarily enhanced ANPP and its stability under warming. However, declining sedge cover and reduced ecosystem carbon and water use efficiency under prolonged warming increased annual ANPP fluctuations, thereby negating the positive effects of warming on ANPP stability. Our findings provide the evidence that carbon and water use efficiency crucially maintain ANPP stability under long-term warming. These results highlight the necessity of a continuous long-term monitoring of ecosystem responses to warming.",

          "abstract": "Reservoirs collectively contribute 1–2% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, although individual emissions can vary widely. While emission models have considerably advanced our understanding of the lifetime carbon impacts of reservoirs globally and offer means to inform judicious planning, their widespread adoption is hindered by high manual processing requirements, uncertainties, and linkages to geospatial drivers that can be obscure for planners. Meanwhile, simpler Tier 1 methods fail to capture variability across individual reservoirs and can overestimate national emissions by 50% compared to model-based estimates. Here we introduce an automated and transparent framework for large scale reservoir emission assessments and planning with spatially-explicit emission models to address key limitations in current approaches. By applying our framework to strategic hydropower expansion in Myanmar, we show how emission models can support low-carbon reservoir development at large scales. Our results show that the proposed methodology can yield a hydropower strategy for Myanmar that eliminates 0.94 MtCO 2e in emissions (1% of national total), conserves 239 km 2 of forest and arable land, and reduces the number of barriers in lower river reaches from 28 to 7.",

Here we integrate satellite radar observations with advanced modeling to provide the first national-scale assessment of peatland subsidence across China. Using multi-year deformation data and a suite of environmental and anthropogenic predictors, we reveal widespread subsidence with pronounced regional hotspots, particularly in the Zoigê Plateau, Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau, and Daxing’an Mountains. Subsidence was closely linked to precipitation variability, drought severity, peat depth, and livestock density, indicating the combined influence of climate and human pressures. Projections under future climate scenarios suggest an increasing extent of subsiding peatlands, with more than 65% of China’s peatland carbon stock located in vulnerable areas. These findings highlight the compounded risks to peatland resilience and underscore the urgent need for region-specific and scenario-informed conservation strategies.",

We employ a methodological framework to identify key factors affecting emission factors of individual coal mines, estimate provincial production-weighted average emission factors, and assess their associated uncertainties using bootstrap simulations. The findings reveal distinct geographic patterns in emission factors, with higher values observed in the Southwest (e.g., Guizhou and Sichuan), while the North and Northwest regions (e.g., Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang) exhibit comparatively lower emission factors. Mine production shifts from high-emitting provinces to low-emitting regions resulted in total coal mine methane emission reduction after 2016.

          "abstract": "How coastal forest productivity varies with local nutrient availability and water supply remains a knowledge gap under climate change. In a two-decade field experiment manipulating fertilization and density in coastal pine forests, we show that a decade of growth enhancement by simulated sedimentary nutrient inputs has resulted in a striking reversal in growth and increased mortality risk as drought and sea level rise progressed. Recent groundwater salinization has further triggered a shift from nutrient to water limitation, causing severe stomatal closure and decoupling of tree carbon–water balance, which induces a negative intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE)–growth relationship. Higher tree iWUE predicted sharper tree growth declines, and both nutrient enrichment and high stand density amplified this feedback, increasing the risk of hydraulic failure and mortality. These results suggest that a transient nutrient-stimulatory effect could drive further coastal forest degradation due to heightened belowground saltwater stress under sea-level rise.",

Here we examine the economic incentives for the extent and type of land conversion needed to scale up fuel production from a mix of cellulosic feedstocks and quantify its greenhouse gas intensity. We show that even with the availability of marginal non-cropland, there will be incentives for converting cropland to produce energy crops as the price of sustainable aviation fuel increases. But contrary to expectations, we find that scaling up fuel production by converting more cropland and more non-cropland from existing uses to energy crops lowers its net greenhouse gas intensity, due to high soil carbon sequestration rate of energy crops, even after considering land use change emissions.The potential savings in emissions are larger than the foregone soil carbon accumulation benefits from keeping that land in current uses.",

          "abstract": "Rare-metal granites and pegmatites are enriched in critical metals, such as lithium (&gt;5000 ppm), relative to conventional granites in the crust (&lt;100 ppm). The petrogenesis of lithium-bearing pegmatites has been historically associated with the high-degree fractional crystallisation of parental granites. However, the extent of lithium enrichment during this process remains debated due to uncertainties concerning the partitioning behaviour of lithium between minerals and felsic melts. Alternatively, lithium enrichment in granitic pegmatites may reflect the composition of their crustal source. To test the anatectic origin of rare-metal granites and pegmatites, partial melting experiments were performed on variably enriched metasedimentary rocks (100–800 ppm lithium). The experiments produced felsic melts with a lithium content of 180–2200 ppm and constrained mineral-melt partition coefficients for granitic systems. Trace element modelling demonstrates that high-grade granite-related deposits (&gt;5000 ppm lithium) are sourced from the anatexis of enriched crustal rocks (&gt;300 ppm lithium), followed by the moderate fractional crystallisation of the partial melts.",

This study defines foreign direct investment as a foreign investor’s ownership stake in a mining project and examines how it affects diversification and supply risks of critical materials for emerging energy storage. Here we propose the supply risk index and maps global production of natural graphite, manganese, sulfur, molybdenum, and vanadium across 205 regions/territories globally. Results reveal that among material production in 2020, foreign direct investment controlled 31.3% of manganese, 27% of natural graphite, 29% of molybdenum, 27.3% of vanadium, and 14% of sulfur. The proposed index treats foreign direct investment-controlled production as investors’ domestic production and reveals that increasing foreign direct investment reduces supply risks. The findings highlight the importance of diversifying material production via foreign direct investment to reduce dependency on a few dominant countries and strengthen supply chains of critical materials.",

          "abstract": "Clouds are an important component of our climate system with their life cycle significantly influenced by ice formation. Measured ice concentrations in clouds often exceed the number of ice nucleating particles, a discrepancy attributed to secondary ice processes. However, these processes are not well understood or quantified. One such process, drop fragmentation upon freezing, involves significant uncertainty regarding the number of produced ice particles. Here we identify the occurrence of this process by combining in situ and remote sensing observations during a case of refreezing rain. By categorizing the in situ imagery, we estimate that between 1.2 and 6.1 secondary ice crystals are produced per drop. Drops between 0.5 and 1 mm in diameter were found to be particularly prone to breakup. These results highlight the effectiveness of droplet fragmentation and provide valuable insights for improving the representation of this process in atmospheric models.",

          "abstract": "The world’s energy supply depends critically on hydraulic fracturing (HF) to access otherwise uneconomical resources. Unfortunately, HF also has the potential to induce larger earthquakes – with some projects being prematurely terminated because of perceived earthquake risks. To de-risk HF, we use a suite of statistical tests to discern if some physical process has restricted the growth of earthquake magnitudes. We show that all stage stimulations at both UK PNR-1z and Helsinki St1 indicate bound fracture growth, implying a more controllable operation. Contrastingly, stimulations at Utah FORGE and UK PNR-2 sequentially transitioned into unbound fault reactivation. The problematic stages (that ultimately led to the termination of PNR-2) are clearly distinguishable. We postulate that our research can discriminate fracture stimulation from fault reactivation, contributing to the de-risking of HF operations worldwide. Our statistical tests provide a framework for model falsification, which can guide physical insights into the bounding processes.",

Given the energetic nature of eruptive processes, direct observation is limited, making the study of deposits and pyroclast textures essential for understanding eruption dynamics. Experimental constraints therefore provide a vital contribution to improving hazard assessment. We performed tumbling experiments using pumice lapilli from the Laacher See eruption (Eifel, Germany) to investigate ash generation and pyroclast shape evolution. Before and after each experimental step, samples were sieved, and the volume and four morphological parameters (axial ratio, convexity, form factor, solidity) of 100 clasts were measured. Most shape change happened before the first 15 min (first experimental step) and produced up to 48 wt.% ash. We frame our analysis in terms of effective relaxation timescales, whereby pyroclasts display a decelerating rate of shape change towards a time-invariant morphology. This quantification of the susceptibility of porous pyroclasts to changes enhances our understanding of transport processes from clast generation to sedimentation.",

          "abstract": "Crop cultivation occupies substantial areas of land globally, contributing to biodiversity loss. In the context of globalization, the transnational flow of biodiversity loss footprints caused by international crop trade has raised questions about the distribution of ecological responsibility. However, most existing research tends to attribute such loss exclusively to either consumers or producers, which overlooks a more equitable perspective that integrates both parties’ responsibilities. By drawing upon welfare economics, this study allocates the biodiversity loss arising from crop trade between producers and consumers. We developed a high-resolution distribution map illustrating the allocation of export-induced biodiversity loss among consumers and producers. We also trace the origin of biodiversity loss allocated to consumers. These findings provide a basis for global ecological compensation initiatives and assist policymakers in optimizing land-use strategies.&amp;#xD;",

The Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) officially provides a 60% subsidy for SIPs under a demand-driven program. This study assesses (i) SIP subsidy delivery and adoption processes, and (ii) utilization patterns and their drivers, using a household survey of 630 farmers and a phone survey of 404 SIP owners.&amp;#xD;In practice, farmers contributed only 4% of total SIP costs on average, as local governments frequently topped up AEPC’s subsidy, making SIPs nearly free. While this boosted affordability, the scheme is only weakly progressive: large farmers also benefit from near-complete subsidization, raising equity and fiscal concerns. The applicant pool is dominated by educated, wealthier, and socially advantaged groups, while marginalized farmers are often excluded due to weak information and institutional gatekeeping. Utilization is moderate, with SIPs operating around 745 hours annually—well below their technical potential. Breakdowns, long repair delays (averaging 110 days), and missing after-sales services reduce use. Training in operation and maintenance increases utilization by 38%, while cultivation of water-intensive crops also drives higher use. Transparent communication of the full subsidy package, progressive cost-sharing to prioritize smallholders, and stronger investment in training and rapid-repair services are essential. Without such reforms, the program risks under-utilization and elite capture of subsidies, undermining SIPs’ transformative potential for agricultural resilience and low-carbon growth.&amp;#xD;",

          "abstract": "As the Indo-Pacific warm pool expands in a warming climate, the probability of an MJO event successfully propagating through the Maritime Continent (MC) is projected to increase by 29.3% by the late 21st century under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. This enhanced propagation is facilitated by a zonal asymmetry in moistening during warm pool expansion. Moisture increases more rapidly over equatorial zone compared to off-equatorial regions over the western-central Pacific, near the east expanding boundary of the warm pool. As a result, the moistening rate preceding MJO convection, which is linked to the intensified equatorward moisture gradient, outpaces the growth rate of MJO amplitude, which depends on total column moisture there. This differential establishes more favorable thermodynamic conditions for eastward propagation of MJO events from the MC into the western Pacific under global warming. By the end of the century, the emergence frequency of MJO convection over the western Pacific is projected to rise by 36%. In consequence, the intraseasonal variations of precipitation extremes induced by the large-scale MJO convection over the western Pacific may become more pronounced in future climate scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a potential approach to limit global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise, buying time for mitigation. Yet, concerns persist that SAI may substantially reduce Asian monsoon (ASM) rainfall, a vital water resource for nearly half of the global population. Using idealized simulations from six climate models participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (GeoMIP6), we show that both greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and equatorial SAI lead to an overall reduction in ASM rainfall, primarily through thermodynamic effects associated with decreased atmospheric moisture as GMST cools. Importantly, equatorial SAI produces no extra drying over the ASM region compared with GHG mitigation for the same magnitude of GMST cooling. Relative to a baseline with comparable GMST, all six models show no substantial drying over the ASM region beyond internal variability. A major part of the inter-model spread arises from differences of the changes in meridional insolation gradient, which may depend on the spatial distribution of aerosols. Smaller (larger) insolation reductions over the ASM region relative to the equator favor enhanced (suppressed) ascent air motion and rainfall over the ASM region, a relationship confirmed by single-model simulations with aerosol injections at varying latitudes. These results suggest that well-designed SAI deployment strategies could minimize risk of monsoon failure.",

          "abstract": "Surface ozone (O₃) pollution poses well-documented threats to global ecosystems and public health. While stratospheric intrusion is regarded as an important source of surface O₃, its contribution to O₃ concentrations is typically small compared to local near-surface photochemical processes. However, a severe O₃ pollution event occurred in China's Pearl River Delta region with O₃ concentrations increasing by 28.2 μg/m³ during September 2–4, 2024. Our HYSPLIT model analysis indicates that the maximum contribution of stratospheric origin air masses can reach 71.0% due to a distant-source transport of stratospheric intrusion caused by super typhoon YAGI. Distinct from conventional localized stratospheric intrusion, this distant-source transport, driven by a typhoon and mid-latitude systems, enables vertical transport and horizontal delivery exceeding 2,000 km, with typhoon-induced subsidence completing the grounding of stratospheric O₃. These findings reveal a new dynamic mechanism of vertical downward transport for stratospheric mass and underscore the necessity of joint prevention measures against stratospheric intrusion. Failure to elucidate the mechanisms against the backdrop of a projected increase in super typhoon events may lead to a severe underestimation of stratospheric intrusion contributions to tropospheric ozone pollution.",

          "abstract": "The pan-Arctic region is experiencing rapid climate change under global warming, with Arctic Amplification occurring at a rate 2-3 times faster than the global average. This study investigates the climate responses in the Pan-Arctic region under carbon dioxide removal (CDR) scenarios using nine CMIP6 models from the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP). Our results reveal significant hysteresis and asymmetric responses in both temperature and precipitation during CO₂ increase and decrease phases. The multi-model mean shows that when CO₂ concentrations return to pre-industrial levels, the pan-Arctic region retains a warming of approximately 1.5°C and increased precipitation of about 0.1 mm/d compared to initial conditions. Notably, temperature and precipitation changes in the pan-Arctic at peak CO₂ are approximately twice the global average. We identify substantial inter-model uncertainties, primarily driven by divergent representations of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) responses and associated North Atlantic cooling patterns in the ramp-up period. Two models (CESM2 and NorESM2-LM) simulate particularly strong AMOC weakening during the ramp-up phase, resulting in reduced warming and wetting trends across the pan-Arctic. Similar persistence of warmer and wetter conditions is found under the moderate CDR scenario SSP126. These findings highlight the irreversible nature of Arctic climate change even under aggressive CDR scenarios and emphasize the need for improved representation of Arctic processes in climate models to reduce uncertainties in climate projection and mitigation strategy design.",

          "abstract": "Denitrification represents a major nitrogen loss pathway in agriculture, reducing plant N uptake, lowering crop N use efficiency, while emitting the potent greenhouse gas N2O. However, due to methodological challenges, field measurements of N2 emissions remain rare, leaving denitrification losses poorly characterised across most cropping systems and comprehensive N budgets lacking. This constrains parameterization and validation of biogeochemical models, impeding efforts to forecast denitrification losses under changing conditions and design effective mitigation strategies.&amp;#xD;This study (i) reviewed the current literature on field-based N2 measurements, (ii) tested the ability of five different models to accurately simulate denitrification losses, and (iii) simulated denitrification losses from agricultural soils in Germany using gridded and point-based modelling frameworks.&amp;#xD;Results show that field studies suitable for model calibration remain scarce and mostly limited to temperate systems. Simulated cumulative N2 emissions varied widely between models, ranging from 0.89 to 6.07 kg N ha⁻¹, far below the observed N2 emissions of 21±3 kg N ha⁻¹. The ratio of N2O to (N2O+N2) emitted (RN2O), a key determinant of the climate impact of denitrification, was not only strongly overestimated by all models but also exhibited considerable variations, ranging from 0.056 to 0.707, compared to the measured ratio of 0.006. Models also failed to capture expected responses of RN2O to environmental drivers. For Germany, simulated average N2 emissions from agricultural soils ranged from 1.7 to 14.5 kg N ha⁻¹yr-1, with corresponding RN2O ranging from 0.18 to 0.59. Spatial patterns of emissions also differed significantly across modelling frameworks, reflecting large structural uncertainties. &amp;#xD;These findings highlight that both N2 emissions and RN2O remain poorly represented in current models, severely limiting our ability to establish reliable N budgets and develop targeted N management strategies. Coordinated advancements in field-based measurements and modelling are urgently needed to improve the representation of denitrification in biogeochemical models.",

          "abstract": "Dryland ecosystems around the world support high biodiversity and extensive pastoralism, but the drivers of landscape change are often poorly understood. Reductionistic understandings have tended to overemphasize livestock impacts and support restrictive interventions, which can ironically undermine synergistic relationships between pastoralism and biodiversity. Within a collectively-titled pastoralist landscape in Laikipia, Kenya, we built on long-term research to examine spatial relationships between locally-varying livestock use intensity and patterns of vegetation change over a 26 year period. We integrated remote sensing, field vegetation measurements, and pastoralist expert accounts of vegetation change to map vegetation transitions and their spatial distribution. We triangulated between multiple lines of inference, including classifications of vegetation community types and transitions, maps of varying livestock use zones and topography, qualitative analysis of expert explanations of vegetation change, and NDVI times series, to infer the contributions of grazing intensity and other drivers to the observed vegetation transitions. First, the most salient landscape change was the loss of two Euphorbia spp. canopies in ~22% of the study area; with elephants largely driving the loss of one species, and climate being a probable driver of loss of the other. Second, approximately 40% of the area experienced some degree of shrub encroachment. Spatial comparisons with livestock use zones indicated that shrub encroachment was more likely driven by fire suppression and/or climate. Third, there was ~26% decrease of area supporting moderate or dense herbaceous vegetation cover. These decreases were primarily associated with increasing temperature, woody encroachment, and higher livestock pressure in areas that both formerly supported Euphorbia spp. canopies and also experienced year-round livestock use imposed through conservancy policy. We recommend integrative triangulation between multiple epistemologies to understand how landscape changes in dryland ecosystems are driven by complex, interacting drivers such as spatio-temporal climate variability, megaherbivores, fire suppresion, sedentarization, and changing livelihoods.",

Yet, simulating unprecedented events, i.e. events which are more extreme than observed in historical datasets, remains challenging. To some extent, anticipating such events is possible by accounting for the full range of climate variability. Using a 525-year synthetic dataset from a seasonal reforecast archive, this study uncovers potential unprecedented storm surge events for European and Mediterranean coastlines, focussing on their magnitude, spatial extent and seasonality. We identify Germany, the Netherlands and western UK as hotspot regions that could experience unprecedented storm surge levels that are more than half a meter higher than historical events. Spatially unprecedented extreme peak surges, affecting more provinces within a 3-day time window than previously recorded, may impact up to 49% of the provinces, with simultaneous effects in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic regions. Additionally, countries including the Netherlands, Germany and the UK may experience at least one temporally unprecedented surge during the summer months. Understanding these different dimensions of unprecedented events represents a significant advance in our knowledge of coastal flood risk in Europe and supports improved coastal flood risk management decisions, including enhanced flood defence standards, disaster risk management and planning of coastal operations.",

          "abstract": "Amid accelerating forest degradation and climate warming, afforestation is increasingly regarded as a strategic intervention to reconfigure land–atmosphere energy exchange. However, most existing studies have predominantly emphasized direct biophysical effects, namely surface cooling resulting from forest replacement of non-forest cover, while largely overlooking the indirect regulation caused by environmental feedbacks during forest expansion. To address this gap, a dual-pathway analytical framework was proposed to diagnose afforestation-induced changes in land surface temperature ( LST ). Within this framework, a ‘zero-impact line’ was defined to represent the LST response solely from forest cover conversion, and the indirect effect amplification index ( τ ) was introduced to quantify the magnitude and direction of indirectly driven LST variation. Results indicated that each 1% increase in forest cover reduced LST by 0.029 °C–0.036 °C through direct effects ( DE ). In the early stages of forestation, τ reached 187%, 227%, and 242% in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, respectively, revealing that indirect feedbacks can equal or exceed DE , thereby amplifying the overall cooling outcome in the subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests of Southwest China.",

          "abstract": "Recent papers on planetary and safe Earth System boundaries have proposed a limit of 0.25 for regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) in South Asia (SA) with a zone of uncertainty of 0.25 to 0.50 to avoid major disruptions to regional hydrology. These values are based on expert judgement, and a rigorous model-based confirmation of these boundary values is lacking in literature. In this paper, we address this important research gap using idealized climate model simulations. We analyze the response of the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation when the regional mean AOD is increased from the current value of 0.14 to the proposed planetary boundary values of 0.25 and 0.5. Our simulations confirm that a regional AOD of 0.25 could indeed lead to drought conditions (&gt;10% mean precipitation reduction) in India, while an AOD of 0.5 reduces Indian summer monsoon precipitation by about 19%.The reduction in the summer monsoon precipitation is driven by both fast adjustments (rapid adjustment of the atmosphere to aerosol radiative forcing) and slow responses (responses to changes in sea surface temperature). The rapid adjustment to anthropogenic aerosols, predominantly sulfates, involves enhanced atmospheric stability, subsidence, and suppressed cloud formation and precipitation. The slow response involves zonal surface temperature gradients between the North Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean leading to changes in the Walker circulation, anomalous subsidence over South Asia, and a decrease in monsoon precipitation. Enhanced aerosol loading over South Asia reduces monsoon precipitation, regardless of aerosol composition, though the magnitude of reduction depends on whether the aerosols are primarily reflective or absorbing. Our findings confirm and highlight the risk of major disruptions to regional hydrology in South Asia when regional aerosol loading exceeds the boundary values. Future studies should assess the robustness of our results using other climate models and for other monsoon regions.",

          "abstract": "Mining is a rapidly expanding driver of tropical deforestation, yet the scale of its offsite impacts on deforestation and degradation at biome scale remain poorly quantified, especially across Sub-Saharan Africa. We focus on understanding these national-scale mining impacts in Côte d’Ivoire, which is a global biodiversity hotspot within the Upper Guinean Forests that has lost &gt;80% of its forest cover since 1960. We combine high-resolution land-use maps with a staggered Difference-in-Differences approach, to assess deforestation and degradation dynamics after mine openings in the Côte d’Ivoire tropical moist forest zone between 2001–2020. We identify 446 mining clusters, which together directly caused the loss of 5,631 ha of forest. We estimate that the total effects extended far beyond mine sites, causing an additional 4.8 percentage-point (PP) increase in deforestation within 5 km over 10 years compared to unmined areas. Crucially, for every hectare of deforested land directly cleared for mining, 163 ha were deforested for other, indirect end uses — primarily agricultural and urban expansion linked to mining activity. There was little evidence of significant increases in forest degradation triggered by mining. Our results demonstrate that the true environmental impact of mining vastly exceeds the mine footprint itself and underscores the grave threat that mining poses to moist tropical forests. We recommend the urgent development of national policies and revisions to the mining code to acknowledge the wide area of effect that mining creates, and embedding mitigation to minimise spillover impacts into adjacent forests.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to high levels of air pollution and extreme heat stress has been individually linked to significant health and economic problems in India. However, not much is known about the threats resulting from the co-occurrence of these hazards, which have common meteorological drivers. In this study, we perform a country-wide joint risk analysis at the district level, examining the risks of chronic exposure to the joint extremes of particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5 , mass of particles smaller than 2.5 µm in diameter) and heat stress (wet bulb globe temperature, WBGT) in the presence of geophysical and socioeconomic vulnerability. We find that northern, central, and eastern India are at alarming levels of joint risk, potentially exposing 61% (~842 million) of the population and 56% (~1.84 million km²) of land area. Spatially differentiated drivers of joint risk are high levels of PM 2.5 in northern India, high heat hazards in northern and eastern India, and high vulnerability in the central and eastern states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. Region-specific response actions for long-term risk mitigation include reducing emissions from residential and agricultural biomass combustion and industrial coal-burning sources as well as addressing the challenges of housing, healthcare delivery, and economic conditions in central and eastern India. A coordinated policy framework aimed at tackling individual hazards is vital to alleviating these joint risks.",

          "abstract": "Wildfires are widely known to increase atmospheric pollutant concentrations, deteriorating air quality. However, several studies have reported that wildfires can also reduce the concentrations of certain gaseous species. This study investigated the impacts of smoke plumes from wildfires that occurred in late July 2014 in Siberia, Russia, on downwind gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ozone (O3). The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was employed for air quality simulations, and wildfire emissions were obtained from the Fire INventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Wildfire-induced CO, VOCs, and O3 were transported to Northeast China (NEC), the Yellow Sea (YS), and the Korean Peninsula (KP), resulting in elevated pollutant levels in these downwind regions. Interestingly, despite the transport of plumes, surface-level NOx concentrations over NEC, YS, and KP even decreased. Such reductions were not evident near the Siberian source areas but became apparent after the plumes reached the NEC region. In these regions, NO was removed through reactions with wildfire-induced VOCs (84.54 %) and NO3 radicals (13.18 %), while NO2 was primarily depleted by O3 (90.08 %) or converted into organic nitrates via reactions with VOCs (9.92 %). We found that the observed reductions in NOx concentrations were attributable to anthropogenic sources, as the reduction patterns varied depending on the level of anthropogenic NOx emissions in the sensitivity experiments. These results suggest that wildfire-driven NOx concentration changes in downwind regions cannot be fully explained by wildfire emissions alone. This study underscores the importance of accurately characterizing anthropogenic emission sources in regions affected by smoke plume transport to predict changes in gaseous pollutant concentrations following wildfire events. We expect that this study will enhance future wildfire-related research by improving the prediction of the spatial distribution and atmospheric behavior of gaseous pollutants.",

          "abstract": "Reservoirs are designed to mitigate water and energy crises during droughts, yet their conditions—such as fullness and fluctuations during drought remain underexplored. In particular, our understanding of how these conditions are related to reservoir function, size, location, climate, and socio-economic context remains limited. Here, we assess the storage conditions of 6,634 global reservoirs during major river basin-scale droughts using Normalized Storage (NS; storage-to-capacity ratio). River basin-scale drought spells were identified using a 6-month Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during 1998-2018. Our results show that reservoirs in Asia had the lowest NS levels during droughts compared to other continents. Reservoirs in Africa and Asia exhibited the largest fluctuations, with median NS fluctuations of 34% and 37%, respectively. Large-capacity reservoirs demonstrated greater resilience, whereas smaller reservoirs fluctuated more. Irrigation reservoirs had the lowest NS levels (49%) and the greatest NS fluctuations (33%). Reservoirs in dry climate remained the least filled, with irrigation reservoirs consistently showing the largest fluctuations across all climate zones. We find that reservoirs located in economically stronger countries tend to maintain higher storage levels (61% vs. 46%) and lower fluctuations (23% vs. 33%) during droughts. Furthermore, almost 40% of all reservoirs exhibited a significant (p-value&lt;0.05) correlation between NS and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), highlighting the association between large-scale climate variability and reservoir storage dynamics. Overall, our study provides valuable observational insights that can guide targeted management strategies and contribute to sustainable, long-term water governance.",

          "abstract": "Many studies have examined the climatology of individual types of impactful weather systems such as cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms, with some recent studies also considering compound weather systems where more than one type occur at the same time and location. Here we examine compound weather systems based on environmental diagnostics of cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms applied to global reanalysis data for the first time based on multiple decades. Occurrence frequencies are mapped for each type of compound weather system from 1979 to 2020. Results for the double weather system types show that the cyclone and front combination mostly occurs in high-latitude ocean regions, whereas the cyclone and thunderstorm combination as well as the front and thunderstorm combination mostly occur in midlatitude land regions. The triple weather system type of the cyclone, front and thunderstorm combination is rare but tends to occur near the midlatitude east coast and adjacent maritime region of each continent. Thunderstorm-related compound weather systems have occurrence frequency maxima around 35°S and 35°N for ocean regions, with larger occurrence frequencies in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, whereas for land regions these occurrence frequencies are smaller in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. Long-term trends indicate more thunderstorm-related compound systems in some tropical land regions and midlatitude locations near the east coast of each continent, as well as changes in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics consistent with cyclones moving poleward. This dataset and methodology are also intended to be useful for future studies relevant to a range of disciplines, such as for insight on drivers of hazardous rain, wind and ocean waves through this framework of compound weather systems in regions through the world.",

          "abstract": "Climate velocity—the speed and direction species must move to track climate change—is often estimated without accounting for vegetation-driven microclimatic variation. Using mechanistic microclimate models parameterized with three-dimensional maps of topography and vegetation structure, here we show that microclimate heterogeneity reduces the magnitude and alters the direction of climate velocity for maximum and minimum temperatures. For understory-dwelling organisms, the magnitude of maximum temperature velocity was halved and generally oriented towards areas with dense vegetation. For canopy-dwelling organisms, the magnitude of maximum temperature velocity was nearly zero, with vectors oriented vertically downward. These results demonstrate that vegetation complexity produces localized microrefugia, enabling short-term persistence of species under warming conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to integrate fine-scale habitat heterogeneity into predictions of climate resilience and highlight the value of structurally complex forests in providing microclimatic refugia.",

Here, applying a time-of-emergence methodology to observed physical and biogeochemical variables, collectively referred to as compound climatic impact-drivers, we show individual and compound ocean state changes have become increasingly prominent globally over the past 60 years. In particular, observations show the simultaneous emergence of compound climatic impact-drivers in regions spanning the subtropical and tropical Atlantic, the subtropical Pacific, the Arabian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. We highlight extensive exposure of different ocean layers to compound emergence, characterized by significant intensity, duration and magnitude. These results provide a comprehensive framework and perspective to illustrate the ocean’s vulnerability to pervasive and interconnected changes in a warming climate.",
