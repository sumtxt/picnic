          "authors": "Chiara Vanalli, Marino Gatto, Renato Casagrandi, Daniele Bevacqua",
          "abstract": "Climate change is strongly impacting agriculture, reducing crop production and shifting the geographic distribution of suitable areas for crop cultivation. To safeguard future global yield and feed a growing world population, the migration of crop production areas to new suitable sites represents a way to adapt to a changing climate. Here, we aim to identify the ecological niche of agricultural Prunus species, namely peach, plum, almond, apricot and sweet cherry, and examine their expected future shifts under climate change. For each of the five species, we selected from the literature processed-based phenological models for dormancy break, blooming and fruit ripening, whose fulfillment determines whether an area is suitable for crop cultivation. We simulated the current pheno-suitability across Europe and validated the estimated niches with occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We then implemented the phenological models to predict potential shifts in the suitablity niches under future climate change scenarios. Historically, the ecological niche of Prunus species spans mid-low European latitudes, while higher latitudes fail to satify the forcing requirements for blooming and fruit ripening. In the future, this constraint is expected to become less restrictive with a northwards expansion of the suitable areas. However, this will be contrasted by a contraction of the niche at low latitudes due to dormancy break failures. While bridging established mechanistic knowledge on the climatic effects of plant phenological traits with citizen science observations, our work brings new insights into how fruit crops will respond to global warming.",

Here we present evidence for widespread phreatomagmatic volcanism at the Reykjanes Ridge north of ~63.2°N, derived from high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetry, and seafloor imagery. Our data indicate a first-order depth control on eruption style: effusive volcanism dominates below ~300 m, producing hummocky edifices with strong seismic attenuation, whereas shallower depths favour Surtseyan eruptions, forming smooth volcanic cones with flanks comprising stratified, outward-dipping seismic reflections. When eruptions occur close to the water–air interface, flat-topped volcanoes form, some emerging as ephemeral islands before being submerged by storm wave base erosion. Our results show that Surtseyan eruptions have been a dominant and recurrent process along the Reykjanes Ridge north of ~63.2°N since the Last Glacial Maximum.",

Although being associated with a variety of processes, data availability of continuous redox measurements in permafrost soils is scarce. Here, we provide a unique dataset covering three years of soil redox potential measurements, obtained from a monitoring approach at three research sites near Fairbanks, Alaska. Redox potential pattern in the permafrost soil active layer showed large seasonal differences, with reducing conditions in the short summer/autumn to largely oxidizing conditions in winter and spring. However, conditions for methane production were at no time recorded in the three years. Especially the freezing and thawing had substantial impact on the redox status, highlighting that assessment of redox conditions in permafrost soils should be extended beyond the typical summer observation periods.",

While species diversity is recognized as a key driver of ecosystem functioning, its effect on autumn senescence remains poorly understood. To address this gap, here we integrated field observations from Northern China and global remote sensing data to investigate grassland autumn senescence. Our analyses reveal that higher species diversity accelerates autumn senescence, even after controlling for climate and soil factors. Mechanistically, this relationship is mediated by resource allocation strategies: enhanced species diversity promotes the allocation of resources to belowground biomass, thereby reducing aboveground resource availability and triggering earlier senescence. Our findings highlight a negative relationship between species diversity and the timing of autumn senescence in semi-arid grasslands, which facilitates increased carbon allocation to belowground compartments and accelerates the seasonal carbon cycle, offering critical insights into global carbon flux exchange under future climate warming.",

          "abstract": "Although the early tectonic regime of the Earth remains debated, it is generally accepted that the geodynamic system underwent a notable transition during the Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic. Here, we establish the metamorphic database for the North China Craton, comprising 446 valid data (83 Neoarchean and 363 Paleoproterozoic), which are categorized into high, intermediate, and low types based on the thermobaric ratio (T/P). This framework is used to investigate the thermal history, tectonic evolution, and the initiation of plate tectonics during this period. The results show that the North China Craton is dominated by high and intermediate T/P metamorphism, with only limited low T/P metamorphic records appearing in the late Paleoproterozoic. The Neoarchean–Paleoproterozoic thermal evolution of the North China Craton is overall consistent with the global thermal evolution trend, suggesting a transition from ancient-style plate tectonics to modern-style plate tectonics. The Paleoproterozoic metamorphic T/P curve exhibits relatively lower thermobaric ratios at 2.0–1.95 Ga (~1.97 Ga) and ~1.80 Ga, corresponding to two orogenic events: the collision and amalgamation of internal blocks within the North China Craton, and its final incorporation into the Columbia supercontinent. Furthermore, this study links the evolution of plate tectonics with Earth’s solid–surface systems, providing new insights into material circulation processes.",

          "abstract": "Streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin, USA has decreased proportionally more than precipitation in the recent multi-decadal drought. The causes are debated. Understanding how precipitation, and seasonal temperature, vegetation, and evapotranspiration dynamics affect streamflow is essential. Here we use causal inference with historical data to identify surface runoff efficiency drivers. Runoff efficiency increases in years with higher precipitation and snow accumulation accompanied by cooler spring temperatures and delayed vegetation phenology, which generally attenuates biomass accumulation. Conversely, runoff efficiency decreases in years with lower precipitation and snow accumulation, or warmer springs, when vegetation activity and productivity are accelerated or amplified. Summer temperature, often identified as a driver of higher evaporation and aridity, does not emerge as statistically significant. Years with extreme phases of winter-spring precipitation have distinct atmospheric circulation patterns and associated sea surface temperatures, indicating the influence of larger-scale climate drivers on the Basin’s precipitation and runoff efficiency dynamics.",

Here we analyzed 130 coral reef food webs across the South China Sea, constructed from environmental DNA surveys integrated with trophic interactions. We grouped the food webs into surface-water, bottom-water and sediment habitats. Our analyses reveal pronounced structural differences among habitats: surface- and bottom-water webs exhibit significantly higher connectance and nestedness, whereas sediment webs are more compartmentalized. Using linear mixed-effects models, we find that temperature and productivity interact in nonlinear ways to shape food-web properties. In surface waters, higher temperature together with higher productivity tends to increase connectance, whereas in deeper waters the same conditions tend to lengthen trophic pathways and reduce stability. These results suggest that future environmental change may influence pelagic and benthic reef food webs in contrasting ways.",

          "authors": "Vito Frontuto, Gian Luigi Revelli, Silvana Dalmazzone",
          "abstract": "Global trade in agricultural and livestock commodities plays a significant role in driving deforestation, as land-use changes in producer countries often supply consumption in distant regions. Although numerous studies have quantified deforestation embodied in traded products, much less is known about the underlying economic and institutional factors that explain why some countries export or import more of it than others. This study addresses these questions by examining the determinants of embodied deforestation in international trade flows. Drawing on Factor Endowment Theory, we test whether income levels, land availability, and institutional quality influence the distribution of embodied forest loss between exporting and importing countries. Using a gravity model estimated through Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML), we assess how GDP, distance, trade composition, and governance shape embodied deforestation patterns in agricultural and livestock commodities. Results highlight a prominent role of GDP per capita as a driver of deforestation: a 1% increase in per capita GDP is associated, on average, with a 0.28% decrease in deforestation embodied in exports, but with a 0.88% increase in embodied deforestation imports, reflecting an outsourcing of land-use pressures. While developing countries embody comparatively more deforestation in their exports, higher-income importing countries increasingly shift the environmental burden of their consumption to other regions through imports. Domestic consumption factors, such as higher per capita meat demand, are also positively associated with embodied deforestation inflows: a 1 kg increase in yearly meat consumption per capita is linked to a 1.8% rise in embodied deforestation inflows. Overall, the findings highlight the structural asymmetries of global trade and underscore the responsibility of affluent nations in driving deforestation beyond their borders. They also suggest that both production- and consumption-side policies are needed to mitigate embodied deforestation in high-impact commodity sectors.",

          "abstract": "Methane (CH4) from China’s underground coal mines is a significant warming source and a priority for near-term mitigation. Yet mine-level inventories remain uncertain because publicly available measurements are sparse, outdated, and inconsistent. We assemble a 2011–2023 mine-level database of methane emission factors (EFs) by integrating the national coal-mine gas assessment with provincial disclosures and other sources. We harmonize definitions and impute missing data (10–30% for key predictors; 23% for relative gas emissions) using a random-forest multiple-imputation framework incorporating geological and operational predictors and propagating uncertainty. The database reveals pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, with a 92% reduction in small mines despite broadly stable national capacity. National production-weighted EFs declined from 5.39 kg/t in 2011 to 4.24 kg/t in 2020 as de-capacity policies retired high-emission mines and operational upgrades reduced intensities, and then rebounded to 4.78 kg/t in 2023, mainly due to higher production in provinces with above-average EFs, with a possible contribution from deeper mining. A persistent north–south gradient remains, and provinces dominated by coking coal exhibit systematically higher emissions. Selective non-disclosure by high-gas mines may introduce non-random missingness and bias the upper tail downward. Uncertainty analysis shows larger absolute but smaller relative errors for high-gas mines, with total uncertainty dominated by model generalization. The integrated dataset enables targeted mitigation at mine and provincial levels and provides a transparent basis for prioritizing high-emission and high-uncertainty regions. It highlights the need for standardized reporting, targeted measurements, and continuous updates to strengthen China’s coal-methane governance and NDC-aligned policy design.",

This study investigates whether the “hot” Earth system models (ESMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), whose past warming trends are typically greater than the observations, tend to overestimate future temperature and precipitation changes across the global maize harvesting areas. By applying an emergent constraint (EC) approach to 30 ESMs, we assess the future mean and extreme temperature (ΔTave and ΔTmax) and precipitation (ΔPave and ΔPmax) changes during maize growing seasons. We find that ΔTave, ΔTmax, and ΔPmax averaged over the global harvesting regions are significantly correlated with the past global mean temperature trends, indicating that hot ESMs tend to overestimate the future changes in these variables. ECs reduce the inter-ESM variances in these projections by 43%, 39%, and 18%, respectively. Notably, the regions with the highest maize production, such as the USA and China, are projected to experience the greatest increases in ΔTave and ΔTmax. The fraction of the global maize production exposed to historically rare high temperatures increases substantially in the raw projections but is moderated when ECs are applied. These findings suggest that the use of hot ESMs may lead to overestimated impacts of climate change on maize and that EC methods offer a robust pathway for refining impact assessments.",

          "authors": "Yulu Li, Gang Zhao, Qiuhong Tang, Richard Iestyn Woolway",
          "abstract": "Lake hot events (months with abnormally high lake surface water temperature) and dry events (months with abnormally low lake surface extent) can individually cause significant stress to lake ecosystems. When these events occur simultaneously, as compound hot-dry events, their impacts can be even more severe, particularly in dryland regions. Yet, their frequency, long-term dynamics, and driving factors remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage model-derived lake surface water temperature and satellite-derived surface area datasets to identify and analyze hot events, dry events, and compound hot-dry events in 2,338 lakes across global drylands from 1985 to 2020. We find that the occurrence of compound hot-dry event has significantly increased in 520 lakes, while 240 lakes have shown a significant decrease. Hot events and dry events individually increased in 1,007 and 767 lakes, respectively. Furthermore, in most lakes, the temporal changes in compound hot-dry events are primarily driven by changes in dry event frequency, rather than hot events or their co-occurrence. These findings underscore the growing compound stress on dryland lake systems and emphasize the need for targeted adaptation and resilience strategies.",

          "abstract": "Southwest China (SWC) has experienced a significant drying trend in recent decades, which poses considerable challenges for ecosystems, agriculture, and water resource management. While human activities and internal climate variability are recognized as important factors, their relative contributions and the underlying mechanisms in driving this drying trend remain unclear. Using detection and attribution analysis with multi-model ensemble simulations, this study reveals that anthropogenic aerosol forcing is the dominant driver of the recent accelerated drying in SWC, accounting for 77% (46% to 107% for one standard deviation) of all forcing. A reduction in aerosol emissions in Europe triggers an atmospheric wave train and results in a cyclonic anomaly in the upper troposphere over SWC, which suppresses upward motion and leads to less precipitation. Concurrently, an increase in aerosols over China results in local cooling and anomalous downward motion, creating conditions conducive to drought. Our findings highlight the substantial influence of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on regional climate change.",

          "authors": "Ratu Keni Atika, Tim Werner, Kazuyo Matsubae",
          "abstract": "Global demands for Nickel—a key energy transition metal—have notably risen in recent years, positioning Indonesia as the world’s major supplier. Nickel in Indonesia occurs in laterite ore deposits, and is extracted with open-pit mining, a process which induces land transformation of high carbon stock biomass sources such as forests. This study investigates the spatial and temporal impacts of nickel mining on land cover and biomass carbon stock by combining satellite imagery assessment with a national dataset of land cover class and biomass carbon stock data from the national Forest Reference Emission Level (FRL) dataset. Focusing on the concession area between 2013 and 2022, 217 nickel mining concession areas within Indonesia were analyzed. Our results revealed that nickel mining activities induced 53% of the forest land transformation within the concession area. By 2022, approximately 6.9 million tCO2 were emitted from the land use induced by nickel mining activities, more than double the amount in 2013. If continued unabated, the trend could reach 7 to 12% of the allowable Nationally Determined Contribution target in Indonesia for the land use sector in 2030. Moreover, we observed delays in the official recognition of mining areas in the national land cover map, which relies on manual visual interpretation and potentially leads to misclassification. Additionally, several instances of mining outside officially designated concession zones were detected, indicating governance gaps and regulatory compliance issues. These findings highlight the need for disclosure by mining companies and stronger governance in monitoring and regulating mining extraction activities to address the environmental cost of the energy transition.",

          "abstract": "Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, pose a significant threat to millions of people worldwide each year. Considering the relationships between the emergence of these diseases and anthropogenic climate change, it has become imperative for health authorities to maintain detailed surveillance of key environmental variables that can trigger epidemic episodes. While disease transmission is generally conditioned by multiple socio-economic factors, environmental suitability for vectors and viruses to proliferate is a necessary—although not sufficient—condition that needs to be closely monitored. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD;To this end, the Aedes-borne dIsease Monitoring of Environmental Suitability (AIMES) system improves on the disease transmissibility framework of AeDES, the most up-to-date system of this kind in the current literature. AIMES broadens both the temporal and spatial scope of its predecessor, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of the environmental suitability index. It provides continuously updated monthly historical values derived from multiple observational references, enabling a robust quantification of the observational uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Over the last twenty-five years, global environmental politics has considered forests mostly as resources or carbon sinks (REDD), focusing on private modes of governance or failures of global negotiations and their reconfiguration within the climate arena. However, there is limited critical engagement with forests and even less scholarship that recognizes forests as entanglements between human and nonhuman. For several Indigenous peoples and traditional populations, forests and other ecosystems represent more than resources or carbon sinks; they are living beings, sacred spaces, or relational entities. This article presents foresting—an ontological turn toward alternative ways of knowing and being. This piece is a provocation inspired by Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars, artists, and activists who live with, know, and write about forests differently. Through teasers from different parts of the globe, the article highlights entangled lifeways to inspire us to forest our thinking and practices, opening the field to unconventional epistemologies and ontologies and enriching it with more nuanced understandings of relationships with the more-than-human.",

          "abstract": "This article makes the case for a deeper integration of historical perspectives into the study of global environmental politics (GEP). A review of the Global Environmental Politics journal’s first twenty-five years reveals how, despite its multidisciplinary ethos, history remains marginal to the research agenda that characterizes its output. The article identifies three uses of historical perspectives that can enrich GEP scholarship. First, historical methods help establish more reliable knowledge of the past and provide historical perspective to contemporary debates on how to tackle environmental problems. Second, historical approaches promote greater reflexivity in the use of social scientific frameworks, for example, when it comes to historical periodization and identifying relevant political agency. Third, history highlights the inherent temporality of our knowledge of the past and our social scientific theories. The article concludes with a call for greater engagement with environmental history to broaden GEP’s theoretical horizon and presents historicization as essential to fostering a more self-reflective, critical, and temporally grounded understanding of GEP.",

          "abstract": "In the inaugural issue of Global Environmental Politics, three scholars debated how social movements could or should address the role of resistance in environmental politics. In this essay, we revisit and renew dialogue around the scholarship of resistance for environmental politics. This intervention serves to reignite discussion and scholarship about resistance in our current conjuncture. We suggest that environmental research should address the tumultuous, turbulent, and ruinous times for environmental concerns and environmental institutions through leveraging the concept of resistance and should engage studies of resistance using an increased focus on multiscalar geographies, intersectional critiques, and collaborative potentials of coalitions and scholar-activist praxis. Doing so will not only make resistance studies in the present moment a more relevant and serious focus of inquiry and practice but will also give relevance to studies of environmental politics in the face of backsliding and backlash more generally.",
