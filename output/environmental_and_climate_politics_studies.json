          "authors": "Konstantina Karatzoudi, Todd Denham, Terje Aven",
          "abstract": "The disclosure of climate-related risks is central to the approach to addressing the vulnerability of the financial system to both physical and transition risks. The public disclosure is a crucial aspect of this, as climate risks are systemic and interconnected, particularly from the perspective of global and national financial institutions. A cornerstone of the current approach is advocating for climate risk disclosure by companies, through the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This paper argues that such an atomized regime is insufficient for addressing systemic risks or serving the broader public interest, as the TCFD framework primarily emphasizes private benefits. Using a conceptual and literature-based methodology, this study critically examines existing disclosure approaches and highlights their limitations in capturing systemic interdependencies and long-term vulnerabilities. In response, we propose a conceptual framework for climate risk disclosures that centers on public sector engagement, governance alignment, and public good considerations. Our analysis suggests that integrating public sector disclosures is essential to bridge current gaps, enhance systemic resilience, and support a more inclusive and comprehensive response to climate-related financial risks.",

          "authors": "Avril Horne, Andrew John, Keirnan Fowler, Ziqi Zhang, Rory Nathan",
          "abstract": "Water scarcity is a growing global challenge, with climate change exacerbating pressures on water security and allocation. Increasingly approaches such as stress testing, scenario neutral methods and decisions scaling are being suggested to identifying system vulnerabilities by systematically varying climate inputs to better understand the system response and thresholds of impacts. However, applying such approaches to large river basins presents technical challenges in making the computational process tractable. This study develops a novel, rapid-assessment method to stress test water allocations in large, complex river basins, applying it to the Southern Connected Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. The method combines stochastic climate projections, rainfall–runoff modelling, and statistical allocation modelling to evaluate how changes in precipitation, temperature, and runoff affect water availability and allocations. We assess the implications of spatial differences in climate, runoff response, and allocation policy across major rivers in the basin. Our results highlight substantial spatial variation in climate sensitivity and demonstrate that water allocation policy plays a critical role in mediating climate impacts. Among the three factors examined, the structure of the water allocation policy had the greatest influence on system robustness (i.e. is the inherent capacity of a system to withstand a range of conditions). This is particularly evident in the Murray reservoirs, where two different allocation systems produce markedly different outcomes under climate change. The approach offers a scalable framework for evaluating climate risks to water resources in regulated river systems worldwide, and an additional tool for rapid assessment of water allocation impacts in large river basins.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is destabilizing Arctic landscapes by accelerating permafrost degradation, leading to more frequent slope failures, especially during summers. Summer is also the high touristic season for nature-based tourism in the Arctic, attracting visitors unfamiliar with permafrost-related risks. In this context, the Yukon, West Greenland, and Svalbard face both intensifying permafrost degradation and growing summer tourism, making them relevant cases for examining the intersections between permafrost and tourism. While studies and adaptation strategies prioritize local communities, they tend to overlook tourists, a growing demographic in permafrost regions. This tourism growth puts additional economic and safety burdens on local communities. It is argued that tourism should be more fully integrated into adaptation strategies to permafrost degradation and to that end, we propose three recommendations: stronger dialogue with tourism actors; target audiences for improved risk communication; integrate risk communication on permafrost degradation in tourism development goals. Overall, we claim that the inclusion of tourism in adaptation strategies will further contribute to Arctic communities’ resilience.",

          "abstract": "The concept of land-use intensity has been widely used to quantify human impacts in terrestrial systems, yet such approaches fail to capture the cumulative effects of land use on connected river networks. Here, we introduce the Land Use Intensity Index for Stream Ecosystems (LUIS), a spatially explicit, hydrologically informed index that integrates crop-specific inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides with river network structure. To evaluate the relationship between agricultural pressures and water quality, we used logistic regression and a random forest classification model to assess overall ecological status and biological quality elements across Germany. Pesticide pressure showed the strongest association with ecological status, exhibiting the highest effect sizes, R² values, and predictor importance across both low- and high-order streams. These associations were especially pronounced in low-order streams and the central highlands, likely due to their limited dilution capacity and direct exposure to runoff. Phosphorus showed secondary relevance, particularly in higher-order streams, while nitrogen’s effects were less distinct. LUIS is a valuable tool for assessing the compound-specific and combined pressures of agricultural land use on stream ecosystems. Its mechanistically informed yet conceptually flexible framework provides a solid basis for future development and integration into operational monitoring and management contexts.",

          "abstract": "Human activities are expected to delay the next glacial inception because of the long atmospheric lifetime of anthropogenic CO 2 . Here we present Earth system model simulations for the next 200,000 years with dynamic ice sheets and interactive atmospheric CO 2 , exploring how emissions will impact a future glacial inception. Historical emissions (500 PgC) are unlikely to delay inception, expected to occur under natural conditions around 50,000 years from now, while a doubling of current emissions (1000 PgC) would delay inception for another 50,000 years. Inception is generally expected within the next 200,000 years for emissions up to 5000 PgC. Our model results show that assumptions about the long-term balance of geological carbon sources and sinks has a strong impact on the timing of the next glacial inception, while millennial-scale variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation influences the exact timing. This work highlights the long-term impact of anthropogenic CO 2 on climate.",

          "abstract": "The floor of deep summit craters is often obscured, hindering monitoring and limiting understanding of the dynamic processes within it. At Lascar Volcano, a sudden eruption in December 2022 was accompanied by lava emplacement. We employed satellite and drone imagery to generate high-resolution point clouds, optical and thermal orthomosaics through photogrammetry. Quantitative morphological analysis revealed an initial crater floor uplift from lava extrusion, followed by rapid subsidence that reduced nearly half the volume and formed a central funnel-shaped depression. To investigate surface deformation linked to internal structure evolution, we experimentally simulate lava dome extrusion and subsidence in a scaled 3D-printed mold. The analogue experiments reproduced a funnel-shaped structure consistent with satellite observations and demonstrated the extrusion along divergent faults followed by piston-like subsidence accommodated along convergent faults. The structural pattern constrains underlying conduit geometry and provides insights into dome emplacement dynamics and magma withdrawal mechanisms in upper conduits.",

Here, we analyze 45 years of climate data and global models to quantify trends in the key drivers—air temperature, humidity, radiation, wind speed, and cloud cover—that determine the atmosphere’s drying power. We find that evaporative demand has increased worldwide, indicating a stronger atmospheric thirst, except in South Asia, where it has declined. There, widespread irrigation has increased soil and air moisture, enhanced cloud formation, and reduced sunlight reaching the surface, counteracting the global signal. These contrasting trends reveal how human water use can locally reshape the climate’s influence on the water cycle.",

          "abstract": "Marine calcifiers support ecosystem services, including shell fisheries and coral reefs. Constraining the saturation state of the calcification media of these organisms is essential to understand the response of biomineralisation to environmental change. Here we synthesise aragonite over variable pH, saturation state, temperature, and in the presence of simple biomolecules. We show that the lithium/magnesium distribution coefficient, relating aragonite and precipitation fluid compositions, is significantly affected by precipitation rate but not by temperature or pH. Precipitation rate reflects saturation state and temperature, so lithium/magnesium of biogenic aragonite can be used to calculate mineral precipitation rate and, if the precipitation temperature is known, to reconstruct calcification medium saturation state. Applying the distribution coefficients to a published calcifier dataset indicates that calcification media saturation state is ca . 9 to 13 at 18–30 °C and ca . 6 to 10 at 10–18 °C. Coral calcification media saturation state varies between ocean sites, species, and reef zones.",

          "abstract": "Instability at volcanic edifices poses significant hazards, yet the processes driving rock weakening, particularly on steep, eroding flanks, remain poorly understood due to limited accessibility. Hydrothermal alteration is a key factor in weakening volcanic rocks, contributing to edifice destabilization and flank instability. La Fossa cone (Vulcano, Italy) provides an ideal setting for this study, with accessible hydrothermal alteration at the crater rim and similar alteration along inaccessible flanks that have a recent history of mass wasting. Here, we developed an integrated methodology combining drone photogrammetry with in situ Schmidt hammer testing to derive an empirical alteration-to-strength relationship for the crater rim and applied this knowledge to alteration sites on inaccessible flanks. An alteration map was generated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to aid our classifications. This map was used to transpose over 1000 Schmidt hammer measurements (R-values ranging from 10.5 to 82), creating a thematic strength-alteration map. Results indicate a ~50% reduction in relative rock strength correlating with areas of degassing and hydrothermal activity, which coincides with past mass-wasting events. This integrated approach offers a transferable workflow for assessing volcanic slope instability, with direct applications to hazard monitoring and early warning systems.",

Here, we use a combined online numerical water tracer and circulation nudging approach in the Community Earth System Model to track the sources of water vapor beyond its initial sources. Trends in boreal summer large-scale circulation have driven moistening of the Arctic over recent decades, having a large impact on the Arctic radiative budget, accounting for 94% of the strengthening water vapor radiative feedback. We identify two key regions supplying the Arctic water vapor feedback: Northeast North America and western/central Eurasia. In both regions, anticyclonic circulations over the southwest Atlantic and eastern Europe move moisture from the tropical oceans poleward to high latitude land through precipitation in winter and spring. During summer, evapotranspiration over land releases this water vapor, and it is transported by winds into the Arctic. We refer to this sequence of terrestrial moisture storage and release as the land capacitor effect. Thus, the impacts of circulation changes on poleward moisture transport and land-atmosphere interactions over high latitudes represent the underlying mechanisms of the recent moistening and warming in the Arctic.",

This study combines multi-proxy records from the Northwest Borneo Trough over the past 30 kyr with transient climate simulations, reconstructing tropical western Pacific hydroclimate during Heinrich events and Bølling–Allerød warming. Results show contrasting responses: Heinrich events saw stronger winter monsoons bringing northern moisture for Borneo’s orographic rain, while Bølling–Allerød warming initiated central Pacific El Niño-like conditions tied to Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet retreat beyond a critical threshold and subsequently sustained by insolation minimum, combined with Southern Hemisphere forcing, leading to regional dryness/seasonal aridity. We demonstrate dual high-latitude controls on western Pacific variability during Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles: hemispheric thermal gradients and ice-sheet topography. These findings reveal the links between ice sheets, insolation, and western Pacific El Niño-like conditions, offering valuable insights into long-term El Niño-Southern Oscillation dynamics and future behavior.",

We characterized their concentrations and polymer composition in size-fractionated particulate matter collected in Leipzig, Germany, using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Total concentrations of plastic particles &lt;10 µm averaged 0.6 ± 0.2 µg/m 3 , with fine and coarse fractions contributing equally. Tire wear particles dominated, accounting for about 65% total plastics, followed by polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. These polymers correlated strongly with carbonaceous aerosol markers, indicating co-emission and atmospheric mixing. Exposure and risk assessment suggest that inhalation of approximately 2.1 µg of these airborne plastic particles per day may increase cardiopulmonary mortality by 9% and lung cancer mortality by 13% in humans. By integrating exposure, risk assessment, and analytical data, these findings highlight the need for global policy action, emphasizing the value of region-specific research for air quality and public health initiatives.",

Here we present a well-dated diatom record from Shuanghu Lake in the Altai Mountains, spanning the past 2400 years with a ~ 20-year resolution. This record, together with elemental data, vegetation cover reconstruction, and historical emission records from upwind Europe, enables us to examine the response of lake ecology to natural climate change and human activities. Our results indicate an ecological shift around 1870 CE, primarily due to lake acidification and eutrophication induced by the transport and deposition of European air pollutants. These findings suggest that even extremely remote lakes may experience ecological shifts driven by hemispheric-scale anthropogenic influences, providing valuable insights for ecologically sustainable development from a long-term and global perspective.",

However, the mechanisms driving this process in tectonically stagnant regimes remain ambiguous. The heavy sulfur isotope (δ 34 S = 2.0–2.4‰) composition of troilites in the newly-discovered 4.2 Ga high-Al basalt from the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin indicates the incorporation of surficial degassed 34 S-enriched crustal materials into the mantle. Numerical simulations of the SPA-forming impact and the induced mantle convection show that uplifted molten crustal materials are exposed to vacuum for about one hour, leading to degassing and enrichment of 34 S, then transported to depths greater than 200 km to provide a hybrid mantle source for high-Al basaltic magmatism. Our integrated petrological geochemical numerical study provides the mechanistic validation of impact-driven crustal recycling on the Moon, fundamentally advancing our capacity to decode early crust–mantle evolution in terrestrial bodies within the inner Solar System.",

          "abstract": "Methanesulfonic acid, a key oxidation product of dimethyl sulfide, plays a crucial role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle and is an important contributor to aerosol growth and cloud condensation nuclei formation in remote marine and polar atmospheres. Its role is particularly significant in the Southern Ocean, where particle concentrations are low and biogenic sulfur emissions help shape cloud properties. Here, we focus on an eight-day period during the austral summer along coastal East Antarctica marked by elevated gaseous MSA that coincided with persistent katabatic outflow. By combining our ship-based observations, back-trajectory analysis and thermodynamic modelling, we show that this outflow brings biogenically dominated, highly acidic aerosols with elevated gaseous methanesulfonic acid produced by evaporation from aerosol particles. Although a decrease in relative humidity can enhance this process, aerosol acidity is identified as the primary driver. Our findings highlight the strongly acidic nature of Southern Ocean aerosol and provide new insights into processes involved in the marine sulfur cycle. Acidity-driven MSA evaporation should be considered when using dimethyl sulfide oxidation products to evaluate and improve atmospheric chemistry and climate models.",

However, its impact on precipitation intensity remains unclear, hampering dynamic monitoring on water erosion. Here we combined remote sensing, reanalysis data, and coupled land-atmosphere model to address this knowledge gap. Results observed an increasing trend in spring precipitation accompanied by earlier leaf-out across temperate China. The simulations isolated the phenological impacts and attributed it to the enhancement of nonerosive precipitation. The mid-temperate semi-humid region exhibited the largest increase (3.03 ± 3.66 mm) in response to 14-days leaf-out advancement. Conversely, erosive precipitation declined in sparsely vegetated areas (&lt;50% cover), sharpening the heterogeneity of moisture gradient. Elevated convective available potential energy promoted more frequent precipitation, inhibiting the deep moisture accumulation required for erosive downpours. Simulated erosive precipitation also declined in temperate summer and autumn. Findings highlight vegetation’s role in precipitation redistribution beyond surface interception, requiring conservation planning to consider bidirectional vegetation-climate feedback.",

This study examines two grid-integration strategies: Supplier-Managed Charging (SMC), which gives utilities control over charging timing, and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), which transforms BEVs into distributed energy storage resources. Using a discrete choice experiment with 1,356 current BEV owners, we quantify how program attributes influence enrollment decisions. Using multinomial logit models, results suggest that SMC participants predominantly value operational flexibility and recurring payments while V2G participants prefer monetary incentives, indicating a willingness to provide grid services for compensation. Through simulation analysis, we identify program \"attribute equivalencies\" that quantify changes needed in attributes to achieve equivalent enrollment levels. These findings can be used in the design of market mechanisms and policy frameworks that accelerate BEV integration into future energy systems.",

          "abstract": "We present Sweden’s first comprehensive National Nitrogen Budget (NNB), quantifying reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs, outputs, and intersectoral transfers across eight key subpools, including agriculture, energy, industry, and waste. For the reference year 2015, we estimate that approximately 848 kt N entered Sweden in reactive forms, primarily through import of goods, “import” of air pollution from upwind areas outside Sweden, and from nitrogen fixation. We estimate that 269 kt Nr is annually released to atmosphere or hydrosphere as a pollution, while 311 kt N is converted back to inert N2 gas. The analysis identifies nitrogen losses to the environment, and opportunities for improved nitrogen use efficiency across sectors. The Swedish NNB is compared to calculations done for Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

          "authors": "Dianti Farhana Kamasela, Shinichiro Fujimori, Tomoko Hasegawa, Saritha Sudharmma Vishwanathan",
          "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is a key nature-based solution to mitigate climate change. Previous studies have highlighted its potential and the role of improve management practice, but many relied on static land-use assumptions or limited spatial data, overlooking socio-economic and climate-driven changes that affect land availability. This study assessed the global SOC sequestration potential of cropland and bioenergy land under three land-use pathways: business-as-usual (BAU), a sustainable food system (FOOD), and a 2°C climate target (2Degree). Our results show that both climate and food policies may influence SOC sequestration through land-use changes. Under the 2 °C scenario, large-scale expansion of bioenergy crops could increase SOC stocks by about 7% (~9 Gt CO2). In contrast, the FOOD scenario achieves only modest SOC gains, slightly lower than BAU (−1.59 Gt CO₂). This because dietary shifts reduce pasture demand but do not significantly change cropland area, and bioenergy deployment is limited. While plant-based diets improve food system efficiency and reduce emissions, their SOC benefits are indirect and depend on how freed-up land is used for mitigation, such as afforestation or bioenergy production. Regions with significant bioenergy expansion—such as Latin America, reforming economies, and OECD/EU countries—show the highest SOC gains. Regions with large cropland areas, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, contribute 70% of the global potential. Moreover substantial SOC potential can be realized at a cost below $100 per ton of CO₂, highlighting SOC sequestration as a feasible and economically viable climate mitigation strategy.

          "authors": "Mostafa Khosh Chehreh, Carlo De Michele",
          "abstract": "Droughts significantly impact socioeconomic systems globally. As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, drought is characterized through various indices - meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological- each capturing different aspects of the phenomenon. This diversity has led to growing demand for integrated drought monitoring tools that offer a more holistic understanding of drought conditions. Traditionally, newly developed composite drought indices are assessed through the comparison with existing indices. However, this model-by-model validation approach does not necessarily reflect real-world accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed – from comparative validation among indices to impact-oriented evaluation - emphasizing the capacity of drought indices to capture actual societal and environmental consequences. In this study, we propose a novel drought index derived from deep learning, evaluated through an impact-oriented lens using drought-induced economic losses as the primary performance metric. The index is computed using advanced deep learning techniques and a range of drought-related variables. To enhance model accuracy and robustness, we employ different self-supervised learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and variational autoencoders. The analysis utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2024) for Italy, integrated with economic loss records from the EM-DAT database. Each model's performance is assessed based on its ability to estimate potential economic losses caused by drought. The proposed framework allows users to select the most suitable index based on a guided analysis, balancing data collection effort and predictive reliability.",

Despite their importance, prior assessments of their effectiveness have yielded inconsistent results. The objective of this study is to systematically assess the effectiveness of heat prevention plans in reducing heat-related mortality risk across Europe.&amp;#xD;We analysed daily mortality and mean temperature data from 102 locations in 14 European countries between 1990 and 2019. Using data from national experts, we identified the year of HPP implementation and categorised their development class. A three-stage analysis was conducted: (1) quasi-Poisson time series models were used to estimate location-specific warm-season exposure-response functions in three-year subperiods; (2) mixed-effect meta-regression models with multilevel longitudinal structures were employed to quantify changes in pooled exposure-response functions due to HPP implementation, adjusted for long-term trends in heat-related mortality risks; and (3) the heat-related excess mortality due to HPP was calculated by comparing factual (with HPP) and counterfactual (without HPP) scenarios. Estimates are reported by country, region, and HPP class.&amp;#xD;HPP implementation was associated with a 25.2% [95% CI: 19.8% to 31.9%] reduction in excess deaths attributable to extreme heat, corresponding to 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3 to 2.4] avoided deaths annually per 100,000 inhabitants. This equates to an estimated 14,551 [95% CI: 10,118 to 19,072] total deaths avoided across all study locations following HPP implementation. No significant differences in HPP effectiveness were observed by European region or HPP class.&amp;#xD;Our findings provide robust evidence that HPPs substantially reduce heat-related mortality across Europe, accounting for temporal changes and geographical differences in risks. These results emphasise the importance of monitoring and evaluating HPPs to enhance adaptation to a warming climate.",

          "abstract": "The blast furnace process accounts for over 90% of global iron ore-based steel production and remains a major contributor to CO 2 emissions. This study investigates the variability in operations across the global blast furnace fleet and its impact on CO 2 emissions. Using plant-level data from 2011 to 2021, we find that variation in the composition of inputs results in emissions ranging from 1.20 to 2.08 tons of CO 2 per ton of hot metal (tCO 2 /tHM) globally, driven by differences in fuel and reductant consumption and operational strategies. Our estimates suggest global emissions could have been lower by 2.8%—and up to 9.8%—if each furnace operated at its historical or national minimum CO 2 emissions intensity. We use furnace-level data to find even greater variation within and across individual furnaces at the national level, estimating potential for CO 2 emissions reductions of 5.8% to 15.2% in the United States. These findings suggest substantial latitude to incentivize plants to reduce CO 2 emissions without new capital investment, by up to an estimated 1.36 billion tons of CO 2 cumulatively across the global blast furnace fleet from 2011–2021. It further underscores the limitations of relying on 'best available technology' or country-specific emissions factors in policy and planning efforts.",

The Pesticide Load Indicator (PLI), developed in Denmark in the 2000s, offers a transparent and policy-relevant framework for assessing pesticide risk. Although it has successfully supported Denmark's national strategies for over a decade and is drawing attention in other EU countries, several methodological limitations hinder its broader applicability. This letter identifies five such limitations and proposes corresponding updates to enhance the indicator's scientific robustness and scalability across the EU: (1) consistent hazard assessment across compartments, (2) precautionary treatment of missing data, (3) updated hazard metric selection, (4) harmonised normalisation procedures and (5) a statistically grounded weighting protocol. These methodological updates aim to establish a harmonised PLI (HPLI) suitable for EU-wide policy applications, such as fiscal instruments (e.g. differentiated taxation based on hazard levels) and pesticide risk assessments.",

          "abstract": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) represented a milestone in U.S. industrial policy that transformed the clean energy manufacturing landscape in the United States. Two of the principal goals of the IRA were to onshore clean energy manufacturing and to make supply chains more resilient to geopolitical shocks. This article presents data for the solar and battery supply chains to assess what progress had been made toward these goals before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) called many IRA provisions into question. The results revealed significant successes, but also persistent challenges in building these supply chains. While the U.S. was slated to produce 61% of expected solar module demand in 2025, it would have produced only 37% of the cells and 11% of the ingots and wafers needed for those modules. In batteries, the U.S. could have realistically produced 100% of expected cell demand in 2025, but announced projects accounted for only 47% of the cathode, 23% of the anode, and 24% of the precursors. U.S. supply would have slightly increased as a percent of expected demand in 2030, but the situation would have remained broadly the same. There are four implications of the analysis. First, it demonstrates the difficulties of onshoring, especially in upstream components. Second, it shows that expected U.S. production would not have squeezed out other countries but rather would have created global demand-pull. Third, it reveals that Biden's tariffs would have likely increased the cost of U.S.-made panels and cells. We propose an alternative policy instruments for achieving supply chain and manufacturing goals.",

          "abstract": "Against the backdrop of global climate change, the superposition of extreme sea level events and long-term sea-level rise poses a severe threat to coastal regions. However, there is currently a lack of large-scale and detailed quantitative assessments for building losses caused by sea-level rise. This study takes 14 coastal provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions) in China as the research area. By integrating extreme sea level data, a digital elevation model, and building data, and by utilizing Python scripts and ArcGIS Pro software, this research quantitatively assesses the spatial distribution characteristics of land inundation and building loss under the combined effects of storm surges and tides, aiming to advance the quantitative study of building inundation exposure in coastal areas. The study finds that under sea-level rise resulting from a 100 year return period of extreme climate, the total potentially inundated area in China’s coastal provinces reaches 49 366.22 km 2 . Among these areas, buildings in 93 cities face varying degrees of inundation exposure. The losses are primarily concentrated in economically developed regions such as Jiangsu and Guangdong. In some areas, the potential density of inundated buildings exceeds 200 buildings/km 2 , which, coupled with high housing prices and dense construction, leads to extremely severe economic losses. The results of this study emphasize that adaptive protection measures based on local conditions should be formulated to mitigate the comprehensive threats of sea-level rise induced by extreme weather.",

          "abstract": "Moose ( Alces alces ) are a cold-adapted species that may be vulnerable to overheating at relatively low temperatures in winter. Moose have two main strategies for thermal regulation: shifting activity patterns and selecting habitat that provides thermal refuge. In this study, we compared how moose use these two strategies in response to winter temperature across their latitudinal range. First, we used hidden Markov models to delineate encamped and traveling movement states for five populations of GPS-collared moose in relation to time of day, temperature, and snow depth. Next, we used step-selection functions to determine influential covariates of encamped locations. As air temperatures and snow depths increased, moose from all populations were more likely to remain in an encamped, relatively stationary state. All moose became less diurnal and more nocturnal at high temperatures, although the magnitude of changes in activity varied by population. Encamped northern moose selected shrubby habitat that presents foraging opportunities, whereas encamped southern moose selected for coniferous forest that provides poor forage but offers shade in southern regions. The only moose population to select for lower temperatures also experienced the warmest winter on record during our study period, which may explain this population's low overall activity rates. Our results indicate that moose along their southern range extent are responding to elevated mid-winter temperatures by initially altering activity patterns and subsequently selecting for potential thermal refugia at the expense of foraging habitat, while northern moose were unlikely to shift habitat selection based on temperature unless faced with an anomalously warm winter. As climate change is implicated in range contraction and population declines, our findings suggest that high winter temperatures may be causing moose to not only reduce overall activity but also to forgo preferred foraging habitat in favor of prioritizing thermal refuge, thus forcing a trade-off between nutrition and thermoregulation.",

          "abstract": "Phytoplankton blooms are an increasing concern for lake and reservoir management due to their rising frequency, intensity, and negative impacts on water quality and ecosystem functioning. Influenced by global change factors like climate change and intensified land use, especially urbanization and agriculture, these blooms are expected to become more common worldwide. Despite extensive research on bloom dynamics, mechanisms, and toxicity (notably of cyanobacteria), there is no comprehensive synthesis of their effects on ecosystem services. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of 48 studies globally documenting the impacts of phytoplankton blooms on key ecosystem services: fisheries, drinking water supply, and recreation. In fisheries, blooms cause significant losses primarily through fish mortality and habitat degradation, with toxins also reducing fish activity. Drinking water services experience serious disruptions, sometimes requiring costly treatment upgrades, while consumer complaints about taste and odor are common. Recreational activities suffer from swimming bans, decreased site attractiveness, and health risks. Toxic cyanobacterial blooms were the most frequently reported and damaging, though non-toxic algal blooms also cause notable problems. While some studies mention potential benefits of non-toxic blooms, these are limited and highly context-dependent. Our review also underscores the value of including grey literature alongside peer-reviewed studies to capture a fuller range of bloom impacts. Finally, we compiled cost estimates from various contexts, providing a benchmark for assessing the economic burden of phytoplankton blooms. The diversity and severity of impacts call for proactive, adaptive management strategies to mitigate disruptions and safeguard ecosystem services in lakes and reservoirs facing growing bloom pressures.",

While previous studies highlight perceptions of these regulations as a unilateral European imposition that marginalizes Global South stakeholders, the regulatory agency of CSOs in producing countries remains underexplored. We develop an analytical framework for studying this agency across different stages of accountability. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in Brazil, we show how diverse Brazilian CSOs largely support mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence regulations. Despite differing political agendas and experiences with transnational governance, they shape outcomes by participating in lawmaking, improving traceability and monitoring, and contributing to enforcement. Although long-term effects remain uncertain, we identify two intermediate consequences: mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence has fostered institutional innovations in Brazil and strengthened collaborations between international and national CSOs.

We analyze the trail of documents leading to the opening of the continental shelf for DSM exploration and exploitation. Focusing on the impact assessment and the associated science and expert reports, we use translation as the analytical lens to explore how science and expert knowledges are transformed for policy use. We find strong patterns of a certainty–uncertainty dichotomy, indicating a tension between various uncertainties and the need for certainty to legitimize the opening. We show how uncertainties are transformed through the structure and content of the document trail, exemplifying a type of translation that we term mitigization.

A growing body of academic scholarship seeks to understand this new frontier in global climate governance. What is missing, however, is a deeper analysis of the relations of power that affect the adoption of supply-side policies, such as bans, moratoria, and phaseout policies, whose success is critical to addressing climate change. To provide this, we first identify the main aspects and dimensions of supply-side climate policies and why they are important. Second, we explore the forms of power that “close down” supply-side climate policies, focusing in turn on the power of fossil capital, the geopolitical power of fossil fuels, and the cultural power of fossil fuels. In each case, we propose ways in which countervailing forces can “open up” supply-side climate policies to disrupt incumbent power and unlock the potential of alternative energy futures beyond fossil fuels.",
