          "authors": "Benjamin K. Sovacool",
          "abstract": "Extreme heat is a potent and progressively worsening public health problem confronting West Africa, where heat stress remains “a silent killer”. Most heat deaths occur in cities, driven by the urban heat island effect. In wealthier cities, air conditioning is the primary means of adapting to extreme heat, but Sierra Leone has one of the lowest electricity access rates in the world, making this climate intervention unaffordable and unreliable. One novel intervention to extreme heat is “Surface Cooling Technology” or “Surface Radiative Thermal Management” (SRTM). STRM interventions, unlike climate mitigation or adaptation, can produce very fast results, they do not involve politically difficult legislation, and they can involve modular and lower-risk technologies. This study explores the history, benefits, and challenges of one STRM pilot project, Mirrors for Earth’s Energy Rebalancing (MEER) in Freetown, Sierra Leone. MEER relies on a form of direct cooling technology to reduce urban heat by increasing albedo and infrared emissivity. To provide community benefits, MEER also makes furniture out of recycled PET bottles, which they give away at no cost so people can sit in the shade beneath the mirrors, alleviating exposure to extreme heat. The study is based on a qualitative research design involving: (a) site visits across Freetown ( N = 8), including three “slums” or informal settlements where they are putting mirrors and reflective surfaces to the greatest potential use to help vulnerable women and children; (b) N = 28 semi-structured interviews including community residents and members of local government; (c) a community survey, and (d) document analysis. In laying out the case study of MEER, the study aims to address a neglected focus on climate interventions to heat in urban areas in Sierra Leone and highlight the daily lived experiences of the poorest and most vulnerable residents of a city who struggle with extreme heat conditions.",

          "authors": "Paola López-Muñoz, Íñigo Capellán-Pérez, Óscar Carpintero",
          "abstract": "Well-being impacts of climate change, particularly on human integrity (Health) and living conditions (Place), are severe but often underrepresented in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). When included, these impacts are typically modelled using simplistic top-down approaches, while bottom-up representations linking hazards to impacts, which offer high transparency and process detail, are largely overlooked. Recent trends connecting IAMs with the Impact, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IAV) community offer an opportunity to improve the representation of well-being damages. Here, we conduct a scoping review resulting in a mapping of 37 modelling studies, revealing a diverse range of approaches, with variation in hazards, impacts, and modelling choices. Key gaps include weak representation of inequality, a lack of multi-channel assessments, and an overrepresentation of northern regions. We propose a roadmap to enhance climate impacts representation on Health and Place in IAMs, using improved data and large-scale multiregional models to generate results that better support decision-making.",

          "authors": "Yuwei Hu, Chunzai Wang",
          "abstract": "Under ongoing global warming, global coastal upwelling systems are increasingly recognized as potential thermal refugia from marine heatwaves, owing to their ability to transport colder subsurface water to the surface. Here we hypothesized that the upwelling (downwelling) concurrent with marine heatwaves would restrict (deepen) their maximum depth. Mixed-layer heat budget analyses using satellite and reanalysis datasets revealed an intrinsic connection between the seasonally varying upwelling system and marine heatwaves over the Greater Bay Area of China. Notably, upwelling driven by local monsoons and coastal topography appears to limit the vertical extent of marine heatwaves, modulating transitions between surface and subsurface events. Our findings provide a distinct perspective on the role of coastal upwelling in shaping the vertical structure of marine heatwaves. While upwelling regions may still serve as thermal refugia under continued warming, their buffering effect is likely more pronounced for subsurface or bottom marine heatwaves than for surface events.",

          "abstract": "The eruption of Hunga volcano on 15 January 2022 was an exceptional event in the satellite era. Record-breaking heights of the volcanic plume were reported, a large amount of water was injected into the stratosphere and a broad spectrum of atmospheric waves were detected. Here, we use satellite measurements to show that a transient ring of small ice particles (~2 μ m) formed around the plume. We hypothesize that the ice ring was generated by the passage of an atmospheric wave triggered by a pressure pulse at the surface corresponding to a violent explosion that occurred during the 15 January 2022 eruption sequence. The passage of the atmospheric wave produced a transient rarefaction in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere, which in turn led to oscillations in ambient temperature. Due to the supersaturated state of the atmosphere with respect to ice, ice particles formed in the wake of the radially propagating atmospheric wave, allowing an exceptional opportunity to study ice particle growth via vapour deposition. This atmospheric phenomenon serves as an important natural experiment that reveals the time scale on which ice particles nucleate and grow given an abrupt perturbation in ambient temperature.",

          "abstract": "Glacier melt sustains water discharge from mountain basins during droughts, but ongoing glacier retreat threatens this fundamental capacity. Here, we assess the response of glaciers in the Southern Andes to one of the most severe, persistent, and extensive droughts on record in South America (2010-present), and to projected end-of-century megadroughts. Using glacio-hydrological numerical simulations, we show that despite a mean annual precipitation deficit of 36%, glacier runoff in 2010-2019 remained almost unaltered compared to the preceding decade (2000-2009), sustained by a 10% loss of total ice volume. However, simulations of future glacier evolution indicate that annual and summer glacier runoff could decline by up to 20 ± 11% and 48 ± 6%, respectively, during end-of-century megadroughts compared to pre-2010 levels. Our results project a weakening of the glacier’s buffering role against precipitation deficits during extreme droughts, increasing water scarcity for ecosystems and livelihoods in the mountain regions of South America.",

          "abstract": "Rapid Arctic warming accelerates the erosion of permafrost coasts rich in terrestrial organic carbon (terrOC). Once released into the ocean, terrOC can degrade or get buried in shelf sediments, yet its transport pathways and fate remain poorly understood. We collected permafrost material, sediment and surface water along the Canadian Beaufort Sea coast, fractionating samples by density (cut-off 1.8 g/cm 3 ) and size (38, 63 and 200 µm) before performing geochemical and microscopic analysis. Our results show that ~43% of terrOC is trapped in low-density fractions, mainly as vascular plant debris. Surprisingly, this material is trapped within shallow (0-5 m) waters where waterlogging and large particle size increase its density and settling velocity. Less than 10% is transported to deeper waters (30-55 m), indicating that the shallow coastal zone acts as a trap and biogeochemical reactor. These findings challenge the source-to-sink paradigm and highlight the overlooked and undersampled ( &lt; 6% of pan-arctic shelf data) nearshore zone.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity hotspots often coincide with regions along subduction zones where tectonic activity continuously make and break geographic connections promoting biological diversification and speciation. A puzzling biodiversity hotspot is the northern Caribbean islands that contain endemic terrestrial and freshwater biotas mainly evolved from South American colonizers that dispersed during the Cenozoic. However, tectonic reconstructions have always assumed a mostly inactive and coherent eastern Caribbean plate, such that migration routes must either have been overwater, or through an inner-plate land bridge. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that the northeastern Caribbean region underwent tectonically induced uplift, subsidence and large-scale block rotations questioning the assumed plate coherency. Here we present a plate reconstruction including these novel constraints and reveals how tectonic and volcanic activity along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone have established a transient land corridor connecting South America and the Greater Antilles from ~45 to 25 Ma ago offering a new avenue to explain Caribbean biotic interchanges and diversification.",

Yet soil organic carbon precursors are usually ignored in alpine assessments. We examined 363 samples from dominant Himalayan ecosystems and determined the distribution of microbial necromass carbon and plant detritus carbon in 0-30 cm soil and their responses to land use changes. Plant detritus carbon was 6.75 times greater than microbial necromass carbon and dominant across soil depths and ecosystems. Microbial biomass carbon strongly influenced soil organic carbon precursors. Plant detritus carbon exhibited greater sensitivity to land use change than microbial necromass carbon and decomposed preferentially, thus, buffering against fluctuations of the stable soil organic carbon fraction. Our results highlight plant detritus carbon’s key role in maintaining soil organic carbon persistence and suggest that incorporating both residual carbons and land use responses into Earth system models could improve future soil organic carbon projections.",

          "abstract": "The Lower Mekong River Basin faces growing challenges in deploying variable renewable energy under intensifying hydroclimatic extremes. To evaluate these impacts, we develop an integrated modeling framework that links an energy expansion model with a synthetic streamflow generator. The results indicate that severe extended periods of low flows (10,000-year events) reduce hydropower output by 24.3 ± 8.7 terawatt-hour (−13.7% ± 4.9%), increasing wind capacity requirements by 10.6 ± 12.5 gigawatts (1.15% ± 1.36%) and raising system-wide costs by 8.7 ± 3.2 billion U.S. dollars. Conversely, extended periods of high flows of similar severity boost hydropower generation by 23.3 ± 9.2 terawatt-hours (+ 13.1% ± 5.2%), decreasing wind capacity needs by 9.3 ± 11.7 gigawatts (1.02% ± 1.27%) and lowering system costs by 7.8 ± 3.0 billion U.S. dollars. Prolonged drought conditions accelerate wind development to sustain decarbonization, while surplus flows from floods may delay investment—introducing long-term uncertainty for energy system resilience. These findings underscore the need for proactive, region-specific strategies to ensure resilient and sustainable energy transitions under intensifying hydroclimatic extremes.",

          "abstract": "Long-term time series of coastal bathymetric data are indispensable for analysing morphological resilience to climate change. Despite the increasing popularity of utilizing high-resolution digital elevation models for coastal management, potential errors in analysing the long-term trend of bed elevation change from historical datasets have attracted little attention. Here, we demonstrate that inconsistency in the spatial resolution of small-scale topographic features characterized by sharp bathymetric gradients could produce errors in the mean elevation that in individual years could exceed the sea level change rate and result in a statistically significant bias in the trend of the mean elevation. Neglecting this inconsistency may lead to a misconception of coastal resilience to sea level rise. We provide an analytical method to identify such inconsistency in bathymetric datasets and a homogenization method to minimise the errors. Our methods are broadly applicable for analysing time series of geospatial data and quantitative assessment of data consistency.",

          "abstract": "Basaltic melts may variably disaggregate macrocrysts (large crystals) from crystal mushes during the assembly of magma bodies beneath ocean-island volcanoes. The entrained macrocrysts modulate the crystallinity, density, and rheology of magmas, parameters that control magma system architecture and eruptive dynamics. However, the timescales, drivers, and consequences of inconstant crystal mush incorporation into carrier melts require quantification. Here, we use a suite of plagioclase-rich basalts to show that the entrainment efficiency (the ability for melts to disaggregate and entrain macrocrysts from crystal mushes) is temporally variable on inter-eruption timescales at ocean-island volcanoes. Macrocryst cargoes are predominantly out of equilibrium with their carrier melts in both chemistries and mass proportions (ratios of different macrocryst phases). Geochemical and petrological evidence reveals that macrocryst mass proportions are established in a density-stratified melt-rich reservoir shortly before eruption, whereas the absolute crystallinity is a function of crustal physics, likely driven by fluctuations of annual-to-millennial melt supply. Variations in entrainment efficiency explain several universal, but enigmatic, features in oceanic volcanic systems, such as decoupled crystallinity–temperature–time relationships and the dearth of plagioclase-rich basalts at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges. Systematically studying temporally constrained eruptive products offers a unique window into the evolution of crystal-rich magma storage zones.",

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are seeing wider adoption, and their positive impact on carbon dioxide and non-volatile soot particle emissions is well-established. However, the effects of the reduction in fuel sulfur content on volatile particle emissions and contrails are unknown. This study presents observations from in-flight measurements of emissions and contrails of an Airbus A350-900 burning fuels with different sulfur contents. We find a reduction in volatile particles and contrail ice crystals for low-sulfur fuels. For higher fuel sulfur contents, our findings demonstrate an additional contrail ice particle source through activation of sulfate aerosols. Our data-driven results need to be consolidated by in-flight observations with different fuels and engines. Eventually, climate impact estimates as well as regulations should account for the modulating effect of the fuel sulfur content on contrail ice particle numbers.",

          "abstract": "Accurate methane (CH 4 ) emission estimates from Arctic and boreal wetlands are essential for reducing global budget uncertainties but are hindered by poorly constrained wetland distribution and classification. We assessed how land cover map resolution and thematic detail influence these estimates. Using very high spatial resolution land cover maps (≤2.5 m) with five to seven harmonized classes and 4–50% wetland coverage, we estimated CH 4 emissions across seven Arctic and boreal sites in North America and Eurasia. Resampling to coarser resolutions (up to 5 km) revealed that CH 4 flux estimates remained within 13% error when resolution was ≤25 m pixel size. At resolutions coarser than 1 km, four of seven sites shifted from net CH 4 source to sink, due to misrepresentation of wetland extent in heterogeneous landscapes with small, fragmented wetlands. Thematic detail also proved critical, as fens—high CH 4 emitters—were disproportionately underrepresented in coarse (&gt;1 km) maps relative to other wetland types. We also show that existing global or circumpolar land cover maps tend to misrepresent wetlands, either overlooking smaller features or overestimating coverage in wetland dominated areas. Our findings indicate that coarse-scale land cover datasets are unsuitable for estimating CH 4 budgets in these regions, where high spatial resolution and biogeochemically relevant land cover classes are essential for reliable CH 4 emission upscaling.",

          "abstract": "Extreme heat poses a growing public health risk, yet understanding real-time, population-level human response remains a major challenge. This study leverages Google Trends search activity (2016–2024) across 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas to quantify digital responses to heat. Using generalized additive models, two key response metrics are identified: a temperature 'threshold' that triggers public concern and a 'slope difference' that measures the intensity of the subsequent reaction. The analysis first establishes that a city’s median climate primarily determines its baseline threshold, while the variability of climate governs the slope difference, both reflecting long-term adaptation to local conditions. After accounting for these climatic effects, the study finds that socioeconomic factors explain a significant portion of the remaining variance in digital heat responsiveness. Specifically, the climate-adjusted threshold is higher in cities with greater social vulnerability, indicating a dangerous delay in awareness. This interplay creates five distinct urban typologies, revealing that temperate coastal cities exhibit a highly reactive pattern while arid inland cities show a response buffered by modern infrastructure. These findings uncover a critical disconnect wherein the populations most at risk are often the last to digitally engage with the threat. This digital proxy provides a new, near real-time method for monitoring public risk perception, offering a vital resource for developing more equitable public health interventions against the escalating threat of extreme heat.",

          "abstract": "In the Amazon, climate and land use change are expected to intensify risks from weather disasters, posing major challenges to people and ecosystems. Yet, how weather disasters already affect the peoples of Amazonia remains understudied. To quantify regional impacts, we compiled and analyzed reports on weather disaster category, frequency, human, and economic impacts from 2013 to 2023 across five Amazonian countries. We counted 12,541 disaster reports, affecting up to &gt;3 million Amazonians and &gt;100,000 pieces of public infrastructure in a single year. There were disproportionate concentrations of landslides in the Amazon-Andes of Ecuador, and fires associated with agricultural management and sometimes land grabbing in the Orinoco-Amazon ecotone of Colombia and along the southern Arc of Deforestation of Bolivia and Brazil. We argue that weather disaster impacts in the Amazon are underreported because: 1) data from four Amazonian countries could not be obtained, 2) cross-country reporting was not standardized and 3) it varied such that virtually all heatwave and most drought data came from Brazil, despite published evidence that both disaster types are present throughout the region. Disaster impacts are already significant, underscoring the need for transboundary policies on land use, local adaptation strategies for communities and infrastructure, and coordinated regional efforts to share and update weather disaster management plans. Developing consistent, accessible, and interoperable datasets across the region is fundamental to building a comprehensive understanding of weather-related disasters in the Amazon and to informing effective public policies that strengthen prevention, response, and adaptation efforts.. These findings and recommendations provide a basis for discussing regional climate hazards at CoP30 in Belém do Pará, Brazil, in November.",

Latin American cities exhibit some of the world's highest urban PM 2.5 levels, yet studies on neighborhood-level PM 2.5 exposure and associated disparities in the region are limited.&amp;#xD;Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional ecological analysis of 53,041 neighborhoods across 340 cities in eight Latin American countries, leveraging the SALURBAL dataset. Annual PM 2.5 concentrations were derived from satellite data and linked to socioeconomic and urban characteristics. A multilevel model analyzed associations between neighborhood PM 2.5 levels and neighborhood-and city-level characteristics.&amp;#xD;Results: The median annual neighborhood PM 2.5 concentration was 18.49 µg/m³. Among 256 million residents, all live in neighborhoods with ambient PM 2.5 concentrations that exceed the 2021 WHO guidelines (5 µg/m³). Variability was greatest between cities (54.3% of total variance), but substantial within-city variation (26% of variance) was observed. Higher neighborhood PM 2.5 levels were associated with higher neighborhood educational attainment (Mean difference [MD] comparing top to bottom tertile =0.17), higher neighborhood intersection density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile =0.17), and older cities (MD comparing top to bottom tertile =1.45). Lower neighborhood PM 2.5 levels were related to higher neighborhood population density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile =-0.55), more greenness (MD comparing top to bottom tertile =-0.76), and larger distance from city centers (MD comparing top to bottom tertile =-0.86).&amp;#xD;Conclusions: Neighborhoods with higher PM 2.5 concentrations tended to have greater educational attainment, more intersections, and be located in older cities, while lower concentrations were associated with denser populations, more green space, and greater distance from city centers. Our findings reveal important within-city heterogeneity in PM 2.5 and the factors associated with it, suggesting strategies to mitigate air pollution within cities.",

          "abstract": "As data-driven weather forecasting models increasingly come in operational use, questions of fairness and equitable access to forecast improvements are gaining urgency. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for evaluating outcome-based fairness in global data-driven forecasts, drawing on principles from the algorithmic fairness literature. Specifically, we focus on two criteria: statistical parity (i.e., comparable improvements across protected groups) and conditional independence (i.e., no dependence of improvements on protected variables). Using ECMWF’s AIFS model as a case study and IFS HRES as a baseline, we assess whether forecast improvements are equitably distributed across different income groups and population densities. We find that although AIFS provides substantial overall improvements in forecast skill, these gains are unevenly distributed: on average, wealthier and more densely populated areas are more likely to experience forecast improvements, violating group fairness and conditional independence criteria. We conclude by discussing how fairness-aware loss functions could be incorporated into data-driven weather forecasting systems and argue for a broader integration of fairness considerations into model development and evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Peatlands in Southeast Asia regularly experience fire due to clearance of forests and drainage for agriculture and plantation development. Fire represents a mainstay for rural communities managing tropical landscapes, but these can lead to uncontrolled ‘wild’ fires that pose a major threat to people and the ecosystem, leading to a cycle of increased susceptibility to fire and increased vulnerability of people and peat ecosystem to future fires. Using an exposure-sensitivity-adaptive capacity framework, we constructed indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of peatlands and communities to fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) and used these indicators to calculate the social and ecological vulnerability of peatlands and communities to fires. We operationalized this framework and defined spatial indicators which we used to construct three indices of vulnerability (ecological vulnerability, social vulnerability of burning, and social vulnerability smoke-haze). Our assessment found peatlands with high ecological vulnerability on eastern Sumatra (Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra), southern Kalimantan (Central, South Kalimantan), and East Kalimantan. Majority of these provinces overlapped with sites of high social vulnerability for burning (North Sumatra, Riau, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan) and high social vulnerability for smoke-haze (Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan). As districts play an important role in land use decisions and fire mitigation efforts, we identified the top six districts that had high numbers of villages with high ecological and social vulnerability scores. Hotspot analyses showed that ecological vulnerability hotspots were co-located with social vulnerability hotspots but clusters of social vulnerability hotspots for burning did not completely overlap with social vulnerability hotspots for smoke-haze. Our vulnerability assessment of peatlands and villages is the foundation for an important tool for policymakers at multiple governance levels to identify high ecological and social vulnerability to peatland fires and channel aid and mitigation efforts where they are most needed.",

          "abstract": "The global agrifood system is central to many challenges humanity faces today. Despite significant growth in total production, it fails to ensure food security for all, drives biodiversity decline, and majorly contributes to climate change. Research on agrifood-system burdens often focusses on the national level and isolated burdens, ignoring their systemic complexity. We address this knowledge gap by combining global subnational datasets proxying four key dimensions of agrifood-system burdens: environmental footprint, climate change, income poverty, and malnutrition. We map global hotspots of co-occurring agrifood-system burdens for 2017. We overlay these with data on ambient population counts, agricultural areas, farm size distributions, and lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples to identify spatial correspondence between people in vulnerable contexts and food production regions facing these burdens. We further assess countries’ relative burden against their inequality and governance indicators. Burden hotspots occupy many regions worldwide, especially in low-income, (sub)tropical regions. Single burdens occupy regions harbouring about 5 billion people (~66% of the global population) and 1.8 billion ha of agricultural lands (~40%), while multiple burdens occupy regions with about 1.9 billion people and 470 million ha agricultural lands. Environmental footprint is the strongest contributor to these burden profiles. Regions with traditionally marginalised communities (i.e., small-scale farmers and Indigenous peoples) disproportionally face multiple burdens. Agrifood-system burdens are more prevalent in countries with higher economic inequality and poorer governance. Burden profiles vary substantially within and between countries, necessitating regionalised and context-specific policies for effective, bundled, and targeted solutions. Addressing agrifood-system burdens can also synergise with tackling other current global challenges, like biodiversity loss and environmental justice.",

          "abstract": "Fossil fuel energy infrastructure poses health risks for local communities, primarily due to the presence of air pollution emissions and other hazards. There is also evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in the siting of this infrastructure for select components. However, population counts and demographic composition near fossil fuel energy infrastructure have not been systematically characterized across all types, supply chain stages, and predominant fuel types. Here, we construct a dataset of 25 elements of fossil fuel energy infrastructure and characterize the populations living near this infrastructure (defined as within 800 m [∼0.5 mile] or 1.6 km [∼1 mile]). We estimated that 46.6 million people in the contiguous U.S., representing 14.1% of the population, live within 1.6 km of at least one piece of energy infrastructure, with racial/ethnic disparities observed across nearly all stages of the supply chain. End use infrastructure has the most people residing within 1.6 km, with 20.9 million people, followed by extraction (20.3 million), and storage (6.16 million). Storage infrastructure has an average of ∼2,900 people living within 1.6 km of each element; end use infrastructure has an average of 1,900 people residing within 1.6 km of each element; extraction infrastructure has an average of 17 people residing within 1.6 km of each element. Almost 90% of the population near end use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure are in urban areas. Our results represent a substantial population in the U.S. that is potentially exposed to hazards that are not well-characterized, with unknown cumulative impacts, and which constitute a major environmental justice issue.",

          "abstract": "Background: As climate conditions intensify fire seasons, human exposure to wildfire smoke becomes more significant, posing health risks and disrupting emotional and social well-being. Academic literature exploring how people perceive and respond to wildfire smoke has grown rapidly in the past decade. We conducted this systematic review to understand the theoretical models and disciplinary focus of existing research, examine the application of behavioral theories to smoke protection behaviors, and identify emergent themes and research gaps. Methods/Design: Following PRISMA standards, we systematically reviewed papers focusing on individual-level human perception or behavioral responses to wildfire smoke events. We extracted information on eight psychosocial factors across three theoretical levels: intrapersonal (cognitive processes), interpersonal (social influences), and contextual factors. Results: Our review of 39 studies reveals an emerging field concentrated in the Western US and dominated by public health perspectives. Only 10 studies employed explicit theoretical models. Smoke exposure evokes strong emotional responses and significantly disrupts daily routines. We found complex relationships between psychosocial factors: while people generally recognize smoke as threatening, the relationship between threat perception and protective action remains complex, with mixed findings regarding past experience and coping appraisal. Social networks play a paradoxical role, providing crucial support during smoke events while being disrupted by smoke-induced isolation that prevents normal social gathering. Social norms around smoke protection remain underexplored. Socially vulnerable populations are underrepresented despite facing heightened exposure risks. Discussion: We identify significant research gaps regarding emotional responses, social norms, and community-level interventions. Enhanced understanding of wildfire smoke responses can improve interventions and policies to promote public health and community adaptation to wildfire smoke.",

          "abstract": "The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations requires scalable and effective carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies. Pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) relies on the pyrolysis of biomass and the non-oxidative use of biochar, e.g., in soils.Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) captures CO2 by forming dissolved bicarbonate. In addition to CDR, both methods may offer soil improvement as a co-benefit. However, their interaction and combined CDR potential remain largely unexplored.Here, we investigate their individual and combined effects on carbon dynamics in a temperate agricultural soil. Using the process-based LiDELSv2 model calibrated against data from the lysimeter experiment, we simulate 1,000-year impacts of applying 4.2 wt% wood biochar (WB), 2 wt% basanite rock powder (RP), their co-application, and co-pyrolyzed material (rock-enhanced biochar, RE-biochar) on soil organic carbon (SOC), net primary production (NPP), net CO 2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and calcium (Ca2+) leaching in a northern German sandy soil. Biochar alone led to the highest increase in SOC and achieved a modeled NEE of -200 g C ha-1 yr-1 per ton of biochar throughout 1,000 years, acting as a long-term carbon sink.Co-application and RE-biochar increased SOC too, but to a lesser extent. Rock powder alone reduced SOC by 7%. Although RP enhanced Ca2+ leaching, this did not result in net CO2 removal. Ecosystem respiration and NPP remained stable in the long term.Our results suggest that, when accounting for assumed application rates, biochar is the primary driver of long-term soil-based CDR, while ERW provides only minor co-benefits. This highlights the need to tailor interventions to specific soil and climate conditions.",

          "authors": "Zhi Li, Steven Gorelick",
          "abstract": "Flooding stands as one of the world’s most devastating natural hazards, accounting for lost lives, economic damage, and ecosystem degradation. Over the past five decades, flood inundation models have emerged as essential tools for flood forecasting and risk management. Through an analysis of publications from 1970 to 2023, this review provides a foundational understanding of state-of-the-science flood model developments. The evolution of flood models in recent decades has been marked by significant technological advances, including enhancing traditional numerical modeling approaches and deploying them with widespread use of large-scale simulation and satellite remote sensing. The field has matured substantially over the past 50 years, and it seems to have reached an inflection point at which major research is poised to progress. The most ambitious research directions are those that involve coupling flood models with models in diverse fields and involve: 1) atmospheric sciences to construct a two-way coupled flood-land surface-atmosphere model, 2) epidemiology to assess the health impacts of floods, 3) economics to help develop a flood model damage footprint framework to quantify financial harm to those who occupy urban and agricultural land, 4) ecology to evaluate and quantify flood-induced ecological damage, 5) further development of groundwater flooding, glacial lake outburst flooding, sedimentation-induced flooding, plus investigation of the joint impact of multiple compounding flood types, 6) responsible advancement of AI-based flood models, 7) greater assimilation of multiple data sources that include high resolution satellite and drone imagery, crowdsourcing, and video data. Building on the broad foundation of flood-modeling research conducted over many decades, these eight avenues offer promising opportunities to further address the combined challenges of escalating climate, land-use, and demographic changes.",

          "authors": "Jiechun Deng",
          "abstract": "Increased CO2 and anthropogenic aerosols (AA) coexist in the atmosphere with opposite radiative effects. Their resultant climate responses may not fully offset each other, leading to some nonlinear changes, particularly in summer precipitation over East Asia (EA). However, how the coexistence of CO2 and AA causes the nonlinear effect on EA precipitation remain unclear. Through analyses of fully coupled model simulations, this study shows that when both forcings are included, the precipitation over North China in July–August decreases less than the linear combination of the changes induced by individual forcings, indicating a nonlinear increase of precipitation. These nonlinear changes over EA likely originate from the Arctic and North Atlantic region. Specifically, the Arctic sea-ice sensitivity to the CO2-induced warming is higher than that to the AA-induced cooling, leading to a large increase of sea ice concentration over the East Siberian-Beaufort Seas in the nonlinear effect. This can excite an anomalous atmospheric Rossby wave propagating southeastward into the North Atlantic, which increases low cloudiness to cool the surface over the midlatitude North Atlantic. This cooling subsequently generates an anomalous Rossby wave train pattern across Eurasia with two branches propagating toward EA. The concurring circulation changes over EA ultimately result in nonlinear precipitation changes there. This study suggests that the nonlinear climate response in the high latitudes can remotely induce nonlinear changes in the lower latitudes, and highlights the need to consider nonlinear effects in analyzing externally forced climate changes over EA.",

Large-scale assessments of soil organic carbon development in arable land are affected by the scarcity of reliable time series of soil organic carbon monitoring data and often fail to replicate observed trends or appreciate any effects induced by changes in soil management.&amp;#xD;This study quantifies C loss from contemporary soil management on specialist crop farms in the EU and the potential societal benefits from C sequestration potential and avoided C loss due to improved management. Our analysis is based on an evidence pool of 214 independent long-term time series of soil organic carbon measurements spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and soil types, and considers the implementation of reduced tillage, organic amendments, soil cover during winter, and crop rotations.&amp;#xD;Overall, we estimate the potential for C sequestration from improved soil management on specialist crop farms, representing 40 % of all the arable land in the EU, to be 48 (±15) million tonnes CO2 equivalents yearly, which corresponds to 17 % (±8) of the target for additional carbon removals in the soil and forest sinks under the Fit for 55 package. In addition, our results show high spatial variability in C losses due to current soil management practices and potential C sequestration from improvements. The annual climate-change mitigation value per unit of land with improved management shows a four-fold variation across countries, with Finland exhibiting the highest value and Cyprus the lowest. This demonstrates that a C payment eco-scheme should be adjusted spatially to achieve cost-effective soil organic carbon sequestration in arable soils in the EU.",

          "abstract": "Meeting Paris Agreement targets increasingly points to a need for Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. While CDR seems promising, the associated uncertainties are not well known. One unexplored aspect is whether the uncertainties in CDR and transient climate response to cumulative CO 2 emissions (TCRE) are coupled to any degree, e.g. some CDR method could have lower carbon removal potential if TCRE is high. In this paper, we quantify the coupled uncertainties between TCRE and the CDR of ocean alkalinity enhancement and reforestation. To do so, we used a perturbed parameter ensemble with the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model. These results were fed to train Kernel Flows-based model emulators, which in turn were used, together with observational data, to carry out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to characterize Bayesian posterior distributions. It turns out that ocean alkalinity enhancement results in slow but steady CDR, with temperature reduction nearly linearly related to the amount of carbon removed. CDR with ocean alkalinity enhancement is also only weakly dependent on uncertain climate system parameters and TCRE, indicating ocean alkalinity enhancement is a reliable CDR method with respect to the coupled uncertainties between its removal potential and TCRE. CDR of reforestation slows down after 50 years, and its temperature reduction from biogeochemical effects is offset by the warming biogeophysical effects, as reforesting pastures lowers albedo. Moreover, CDR by reforestation shows a strong dependency on uncertain climate system parameters and negatively correlates with TCRE, implying that it is less reliable as a CDR method. We argue that CDR potential, timescale of CDR, and uncertainty coupling between TCRE and CDR should all be considered when designing robust climate change mitigation portfolios.",

Through a integration of satellite data and in-situ bio-optical measurements, we reveal a counterintuitive ecological response to TC \"Chaba\" in 2022 that challenges conventional understanding. While satellite-detected Chla concentrations increased and phytoplankton division rates accelerated following TC passage, we surprisingly documented simultaneous declines in phytoplankton biomass and carbon-to-chlorophyll (C:Chl) ratios. Our analysis demonstrates that physiological regulation, rather than biomass accumulation, dominated high-Chla zones during and after TC disturbance, with C:Chl anomalies contributing over 60% to elevated Chla areas. This research presents a paradigm-shifting scenario: phytoplankton biomass began accumulating initiated pre-TC, yet increased loss rates during/after TC actually reduced phytoplankton biomass despite enhanced division rates. The fundamental decoupling between TC-induced Chla enhancement and phytoplankton biomass dynamics we document has profound implications for oceanic carbon cycling models and climate predictions, necessitating a recalibration of how we interpret satellite Chla signals in storm-affected marine ecosystems.",

This study proposes an analogous ensemble algorithm based on historical best-track data to quantify TC track uncertainties in the along-track (AT) and cross-track (CT) directions. The results reveal a strong latitudinal variation in the dominant direction of uncertainty: AT uncertainty is larger near the equator and within the mid-latitude westerlies, whereas CT uncertainty increases in recurvature zones. Moreover, the ratio of CT to AT uncertainty exhibits a negative correlation with TC translation speed. A comparable anisotropic pattern of track uncertainty is also identified in multi-model ensemble forecasts, indicating that the state-dependent preferred direction of position variability is a natural characteristic of TC track predictions. These findings provide the global-scale quantification of intrinsic anisotropic TC track uncertainty and highlight the importance of representing anisotropic uncertainty in probabilistic risk assessment and operational forecasting.",

However, the extent to which phytoplankton feedback influences ENSO remains unclear. Chlorophyll in phytoplankton warms the upper ocean by absorbing solar radiation, and this effect weakens during El Niño and strengthens during La Niña, yet its overall impact is not well quantified. Using a simple nitrogen-based Nitrate–Phytoplankton–Zooplankton–Detritus pelagic model, here we show that phytoplankton concentration anomalies significantly dampen ENSO by cooling sea surface temperature by 0.69 °C during El Niño development and warming it by 1.09 °C during La Niña, with mean amplitudes of 1.71 °C and 1.42 °C, respectively. This may partially contributes to the amplitude asymmetry of ENSO, and accounts for 16.8% of total shortwave radiation-related damping during El Niño and 17.4% during La Niña. Our offline modeling approach successfully isolates this direct heating effect by excluding indirect dynamical effects of phytoplankton to physical variables.",

          "abstract": "Accurately quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the farm level is crucial for agricultural decarbonisation, yet doing so remains challenging – particularly for smaller farming operations that lack resources for comprehensive data collection. To address this gap, we present a new framework to predict farm-level direct emission intensities (tCO2e/£) from a minimal set of input variables. Our approach leverages a unique and comprehensive dataset that integrates survey based GHG audits from 482 farms across the United Kingdom (UK) with financial transaction data, obtained through a collaboration with a major high-street bank and a leading UK charity promoting sustainable agriculture. By combining granular farm-level emissions metrics with financial records, we demonstrate that a limited set of input variables focused on the highest impact areas – particularly dairy and beef cattle intensities – yield robust predictions that can explain up to 91% of the variation in farm-level emissions. Although this model does not replace the depth and specificity of established carbon calculators, it provides a pragmatic, scalable alternative for emissions reporting. It offers farms a clear entry-point to carbon accounting and provides financial institutions with a data-efficient method for more accurate assessments of the environmental impact of their agricultural portfolios.",

          "abstract": "Climate warming in the Arctic is very strong compared to other regions on Earth. Arctic winter climate and cryosphere conditions are changing towards more frequent mild spells with precipitation as rain followed by the formation of basal ice on the frozen ground, particularly in Gulf Stream influenced climates as in Svalbard. Such conditions encapsulate tundra plants in ice for several months, which is assumed to reduce land surface greenness due to plant damage. We investigated whether extensive basal ice (presence and thickness) and increased summer temperatures (growing degree days) from in-situ time-series impact satellite-derived land surface greenness (magnitude and timing of growing season maximum Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) in Svalbard from 2013 to 2023, a decade with record breaking summer temperatures and many icy winters. We found lower maximum NDVI values when basal ice was present only at higher elevations (Estimate: -0.0119, 95% CI: -0.0207 to -0.0031). We further found an eight-day advance in the timing of maximum NDVI (Estimate: -7.56, 95% CI: -14.81 to -0.31) with basal ice presence in the region which was characterised by spatially and temporally extensive basal ice. Ice thickness, in contrast to presence, or growing degree days did not influence the magnitude or timing of maximum NDVI. Taken together, our findings indicate that basal ice presence could become a driver of vegetation change in the High Arctic as climatic extremes intensify, which could alter tundra greenness over larger landscapes and ultimately influence Arctic food webs.",

          "abstract": "Prescribed fire has emerged as an essential ecosystem management practice for maintaining forest health and mitigating wildfire risks. However, its spatio-temporal patterns and potential impacts on water quantity and quality remain poorly understood compared to those of wildfires. By analyzing the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database (1982 to 2022), we characterized distinct regional, seasonal and interannual dynamics of large prescribed fires relative to wildfires across the conterminous United States. We found the Southeast dominated the national prescribed fire regime, accounting for 78.6% of total prescribed fire occurrences and 70.7% of total burned area. Seasonally, prescribed fires primarily occurred in the spring, contrasting with wildfires that peak in autumn, particularly in the West and Southwest. Prescribed fires in the Southeast increased significantly from the early 2000s, peaking around 2010, then temporarily declined, whereas wildfires in the West exhibited an overall upward trend with substantial interannual variability. Our synthesis of studies from 1969 to 2024 showed that prescribed fire generally reduced evapotranspiration, but increased surface runoff through alterations of vegetation structure, rainfall partitioning, soil properties, and flow generation processes. Additionally, prescribed fire influenced water quality by modifying soil nitrogen dynamics, dissolved carbon, erosion, and sediment transport. These impacts varied depending on burn frequency, intensity, terrain, climate, and post-fire recovery conditions and were typically minor compared to those from wildfires. We developed an adaptive framework to guide prescribed burning by balancing its ecological and hydrological benefits and risks, aiming to support sustainable forest management, reduce wildfire risk, and protect water resources.",

          "authors": "Eklavya Tiwary, M. Juerchott, Andreas Oschlies",
          "abstract": "“Acid downwelling” is a proposed marine CDR method, which describes the idea of electrochemically splitting open ocean surface water into an alkaline solution to remain at the surface ocean and cause additional ocean CO2 uptake, and into an acidic solution that is pumped down into the deep ocean for disposal via vertical pipes. In this study, we simulate idealised large-scale acid downwelling in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity with different acid injection depths and downwelling intensities and find a maximum mCDR potential for continuous acid downwelling (0.25 Pmol yr-1) of 320 Pg C until the end of the millennium under an extended RCP 4.5 CO2 emissions scenario. However, the acidity temporarily stored at depth resurfaces primarily around the Southern Ocean via ocean circulation and causes regional CO2 outgassing. Furthermore, too intense downwelling of warm surface water leads to an increase in ocean interior temperatures causing further Earth system feedbacks and accelerates the re-emergence of downwelled acidity to the surface. However, the extent to which this re-emergence causes CO2 outgassing into the atmosphere is emissions scenario dependent. This study highlights that large-scale ocean circulation, the investigated time frame and the future CO2 emission scenario all need to be considered in order to determine the mCDR potential of acid downwelling.",

          "abstract": "Eastern Europe experienced a pronounced warming trend in the summer of 2024, with average maximum temperature anomalies reaching 3.35°C in June and 3.73°C in July, and minimum temperature anomalies averaging 2.17°C in June and 2.60°C in July, significantly exceeding the 1991-2020 climatological baseline. Moreover, three distinct heatwave events were identified: June 3rd-11th (9 days), June 17th-July 1st (15 days), and July 6th-21st (16 days), highlighting the prolonged and intense nature of the heat stress. Seasonal forecasting systems (GCFS, SEAS5, and Météo-France) consistently demonstrated the capability to predict above-climatological-mean temperatures over the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly the Balkan Peninsula, showcasing robust regional warming trend capture, though with variations in accuracy across lead times. The accurate prediction of subtropical influences, as evidenced by consistent positive temperature anomaly forecasts over North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, underscores the forecasting systems' capacity to represent large-scale circulation patterns, yet the predictive skill for midlatitude blocking events and their spatial extent remains subject to limitations and model-specific variations. Despite the inherent limitations in long-range meteorological predictability, particularly concerning heatwave timing and location, the study emphasizes the critical imperative for continued refinement of seasonal forecasting models to enhance societal resilience against the escalating impacts of climate change, particularly through improved representation of synoptic atmospheric drivers.",

          "abstract": "China’s successful implementation of two phases of stringent clean air actions from 2013 to 2020 (Phase I: 2013-2017; Phase II: 2018-2020) has substantially reduced PM 2.5 concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA)—one of China's most polluted regions. However, the specific role of regional transport in this improvement remains unclear. Here, we investigated the drivers of PM 2.5 mitigation in the BTHSA and systematically quantified the contribution of regional transport during 2013-2020, by conducting multi-scenario analysis using a combination of a bottom-up emission inventory and a chemical transport model with an embedded source apportionment module. The simulated regional average PM 2.5 concentration across BTHSA declined by 56.1% from 2013 to 2020, primarily driven by anthropogenic emission control (78.1%), with decrease in local emissions, intra-regional transport, and extra-regional transport beyond the BTHSA contributing 49.0%, 32.9%, and 18.1%, respectively, while the remaining 21.9% of the decline was attributable to meteorological variability. Nevertheless, the relative importance of these drivers shifted, with local contributions declining while cross-city regional transport intensified and surpassed local abatement in Phase II, where intra-regional transport remained dominant, but the influence of extra-regional transport rose markedly to 1.4 times its Phase I level. Spatially, emission reductions in Hebei and Shandong contributed the most to regional PM 2.5 decline, representing over 50% of the transport-related improvement. Trends in regional contributions to Beijing, the core city of the BTHSA region, suggest the need for dynamically adjusting joint control policies, expanding coordinated mitigation efforts to extra-regional cities in Southern Shandong, as well as to key regions like the Yangtze River Delta. These findings underscore the growing importance of regional transport in air quality improvement and support more adaptive regional collaboration strategies moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Globally, peatlands store twice as much carbon as forests. Conservation of these ecosystems is vital in preventing the return of massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. With climate boundaries of ecosystems shifting, choosing to restore wisely has never been more important. We set out to assess how climate boundaries of peatlands in Europe may shift with climate by 1) deriving relationships between peatland distributions and climate variables and 2) using these relationships to project peatland distributions into the future based on two climate change scenarios: one scenario in line with the Paris Agreement (SSP1-2.6) and a scenario predicting 3.0 degrees warming by 2050 (SPP5-8.5). We found that climate conditions for peatlands to exist may remain best in Northern Scandinavia, the Western islands, and higher elevations within the European mainland. In contrast, climate suitability for peatlands will significantly decrease through most of Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe. Under 3.0-degree warming, 92% of all functional peatlands will face less suitable climate conditions by 2050. Moreover, the proportion of peatlands that occur under unfavorable climatic conditions will almost triple from 6% to 15%. Our findings imply that conservation and restoration of peatlands in future climates will be most effective in areas with peatlands that will remain close to the center of their climate niche: meaning parts of northern Scandinavia, Ireland, Scotland and at higher elevational ranges.",

Here we combine machine learning-based projections of five historical European heat waves under present or future global temperatures with empirical exposure–response functions to quantify the potential for extreme heat events to generate mass mortality. For example, if August 2003 meteorological conditions recur at the recent annual global temperature anomaly of 1.5 °C, we project 17,800 excess deaths across Europe in one week, rising to 32,000 at 3 °C. This mortality is comparable to peak COVID-19 mortality in Europe and is not substantially reduced by climate adaptation currently observed across Europe. Our results suggest that while mitigating further global warming can reduce heat mortality, mass mortality events remain plausible at near-future temperatures despite current adaptations to heat.",
