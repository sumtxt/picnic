          "authors": "Hao Zhang",
          "abstract": "Global value chains (GVCs) have connected firms in complex networks within and across national borders. However, political economy models often assume away production linkages and thus fail to explain pervasive and diverse trade coalitions cutting across industries and firms. I develop a GVC‐centered framework where production linkages through a common foreign partner foster interdependent preferences and collective action for trade liberalization. For empirical tests, I compile firm‐to‐firm supply chain networks, construct direct measures, and estimate various network models. I find that US firms with GVC linkages tend to lobby together, lobby on the same bill, and hire the same lobbyist. Furthermore, GVC linkages among lead firms increase collective lobbying through trade associations. Finally, I show that GVC linkages predict the formation and depth of preferential trade networks. These results provide microfoundations for new coalitional politics under GVCs and challenge the common assumption about industries and firms as isolated political actors.",

          "authors": "Amanda Clayton, Boniface Dulani, Katrina Kosec, Amanda Lea Robinson",
          "abstract": "Women's inclusion is now the norm in global and local initiatives to combat climate change. We examine how women's representation affects climate deliberations using the case of community‐managed forests in Malawi. We run a lab‐in‐the‐field experiment randomly varying the gender composition of six‐member groups asked to deliberate on policies to combat local overharvesting. We find that any given woman has relatively more influence in group deliberations when women make up a larger share of the group, a change driven by men's assessments of women's influence. Women's presence also shifts the content of deliberations toward prospective solutions for which women have socially recognized expertise (cooking and replanting). Despite these changes, women and men do not prefer different deforestation policies, and women's presence does not meaningfully affect group decisions. Our work demonstrates how women's presence shapes climate deliberations but also calls into question claims that women's inclusion will necessarily affect climate decisions.",

          "authors": "Daniel Gibbs",
          "abstract": "I study a political agency model where a reelection‐seeking politician chooses when to make policy and a voter learns about the politician's competence from its timing, substance, and outcome. It takes time for the politician to receive information about which policy is in the voter's best interest and for the effect of policy to be observed. Due to perverse electoral incentives, politicians engage in three behaviors that limit electoral accountability. First, politicians hedge by delaying policy to hide potential policy failure from voters. Second, politicians pander late in the electoral cycle where they cannot credibly campaign on the success of an unpopular policy. Third, in the hope of producing visible policy success, politicians gamble by making a prompt policy choice when it is in the voter's best interest to delay. I show how politicians use these behaviors strategically in response to different contingencies and study their implications for electoral accountability.",

          "abstract": "Authoritarian survival theories maintain that dictators distribute rents to elites who can control the masses. Yet, it is unclear how dictators choose beneficiary elites. We argue that elites centrally placed in their locality’s family network enjoy greater influence on other community members and, thus, are more likely to be co-opted through distribution. We test this argument by compiling a novel dataset of Paraguayan family networks that we link to families who illegally benefited from public land grants from 1954 to 2007. Using a difference-in-differences in reverse design, we find that local families with higher network centrality were more likely to receive these grants during the 1954–88 dictatorship. We also show more affiliations with the ruling Colorado Party and incidents of repression—indicators of social control—in localities with more central families before 1989. Our work shows that family ties can serve to build authoritarian ruling coalitions.",

          "abstract": "State legislatures are critical policymaking bodies, yet recent studies suggest that elections rarely hold state legislators accountable for their representation and voters generally know little about legislative politics. Would state legislatures function differently if voters had access to more information about legislative politics? Leveraging the haphazard overlap of newspaper markets and legislative districts, I construct and validate a measure of legislative press coverage in all 49 partisan state legislatures for the years 2000–2022 that is plausibly uncorrelated with other district-level variables. Drawing on this large-scale dataset, this article traces the impact of press coverage on state legislative voters, elections, and, ultimately, representation. I find that robust local press coverage substantially augments down-ballot voter engagement, the electoral return to ideological moderation, and the incumbency advantage. Once in office, I further document that state legislators who receive stronger press coverage work more for their constituencies and diverge less from their district’s median voter. Overall, these results suggest that state legislators would be more moderate, representative, and productive were local press coverage strengthened.",

          "authors": "SALAM ALSAADI",
          "abstract": "Contrary to the conventional view that minority regimes are vulnerable to breakdown, many of these regimes exhibit remarkable durability. From 1900 to 2015, minority autocracies that exclude a single majority ethnic group (e.g., regimes in Bahrain, Syria, and Apartheid South Africa) remained in power twice as long as other autocracies. This article argues that this durability is rooted in their unique ethno-political configuration, which enables them to foster a largely unconditional loyalty due to the ruling minority’s fear of being subjected to majoritarian rule. Such loyalty endows them with an exceptional capacity to withstand major challenges by fostering in-group demobilization and policing, pro-regime countermobilization, and coethnic elite loyalty. This article employs a multi-method approach, using a novel dataset of minority regimes and a case study of Bahrain based on original interviews. The findings highlight the conditions under which ethnic group loyalty can play a central role in autocratic survival.",

          "abstract": "While scholars document associations between competing parties’ policy disputes and citizens’ cross-party hostility, that is, affective polarization, we lack causal comparative evidence of how different types of ideological disagreements shape partisan affective evaluations. We investigate this issue with a priming experiment across ten Western publics, which prompts some respondents to answer questions inviting them to discuss debates over either cultural or economic issues versus a control group that receives a non-political prompt. Respondents in the economic and cultural priming conditions expressed greater distrust of out-partisans, and, among respondents who received cultural priming, those who discussed immigration in their open-ended responses expressed far more distrust towards opponents – an effect driven by right-wing respondents who discussed immigration. These findings provide comparative evidence that economic and cultural debates cause affective polarization, with immigration as a primary cultural driver.",

          "abstract": "Authoritarian legacies affect democratic party development through two channels: authoritarian successor parties and the degree of party institutionalization of both ruling and opposition parties from the autocratic era. We argue that when highly institutionalized ruling parties survive democratization they then use their organizational advantage to stymie the development of other parties. Alternatively, when authoritarian elites form well-organized parties in proximity to democratization, democratic-era party institutionalization of all parties increases. Second, post-transition party institutionalization is positively related to the degree of institutionalization of parties under autocracy. Using a unique dataset of party institutionalization, we find support for our arguments, concluding that democratic party institutionalization increases where the party institutionalization under autocracy was high and where reactive authoritarian successor parties survive democratization. We also find evidence for our mechanisms in an analysis of the quality of post-transition elections – ruling parties which survive democratization use their power to undermine clean elections.",

          "abstract": "Historically, extremist parties have engaged in a process of parliamentary disruption, violating the rules of interaction and slowing down the lawmaking process. How can democratic parties respond and counter parliamentary erosion? I propose a typology of the policies of parliamentary defense that includes targeting individual politicians and collective responses that change parliamentary or electoral rules. I explore the demand of political parties for different policies of parliamentary defense and the conditions under which legislative majorities in support of such policies come about. Empirically, the article examines the responses of mainstream democratic parties to parliamentary disruption in Weimar Germany (1918–1933) and Third Republic France (1919–1940).",

          "abstract": "Citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently communicate grievances to the government. While there is some evidence that governments respond to such petitions, little is known about the nature of this responsiveness: can petitions influence resource allocation and yield tangible improvements to citizens’ livelihoods? To answer this question, we assemble a novel panel of housing-related petitions to the government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and all housing constructed between 1945 and 1989. Exploiting the timing of the largest housing program in 1971, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to show that construction was targeted at regions with higher rates of petitioning. We then use a variance decomposition method to benchmark petitions against objective indicators of housing need. Our results suggest that petitions allow citizens to meaningfully influence the allocation of public resources. The paper contributes to nascent scholarship on responsiveness in non-democratic regimes by linking responsiveness to tangible improvements in citizens’ livelihoods.",

However, this relation can be mitigated by an individual’s level of political tolerance, which fosters greater openness to support reconciliation despite strong religious convictions.",

          "abstract": "Extant research posits that nonviolent campaigns increase security force defection during dissent, thereby improving their success rates over violent campaigns. Yet empirical evidence remains limited and mixed. We argue that this is partly due to overly aggregated measures of disloyalty that mask important variation. To address this, we disaggregate security force disloyalty both theoretically and empirically. We contend that nonviolent and violent strategies impose distinct costs on security forces—related to repression, fighting, and exit—which shape the likelihood of different forms of disloyalty. Our findings reveal that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to trigger large-scale loyalty shifts, but their effects are confined to specific types of disloyalty. Specifically, nonviolent strategies increase the likelihood of shirking, vocal support for opposition campaigns or criticism of the regime, and withdrawal of regime support. By contrast, desertion and side-switching are more likely during violent campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Legislators use parliamentary speeches to communicate with their relevant audiences. However, we know little about how they adapt their communication styles to public opinion dynamics and political context. Bridging the literatures on parliamentary speech and strategic use of vagueness in political campaigning, I explore whether legislators modulate the concreteness of their speeches when public opinion on policy is divided, conditional on the public and party‐level policy salience and proximity to elections. I use a dictionary‐based method to measure the concreteness of parliamentary speeches in the European Parliament's plenary (2009–2019). The results show that when public opinion is divided, legislators reduce the concreteness of their speeches if they concern matters that are salient to the citizens. In contrast, when speaking on policies that have a higher relative importance to their parties, they use more concrete language even in the face of a divided public. These findings suggest that strategic vagueness is relevant for political actors beyond communication in electoral context.",

In this letter, I examine their impact on one of the most consequential functions of political parties: the candidate selection process. Focusing on Mexican state legislators, I analyze how pre‐electoral coalitions shape incumbent renomination decisions. I outline a multi‐stage process in which parties assess district characteristics, incumbent attributes, and the electoral competition. Using fixed‐effects penalized maximum likelihood logistic regression, I find that parties prioritize different factors at different stages. The results show that while vote share and candidate characteristics do not influence renomination decisions in coalition districts, they are crucial in determining whether a party retains nomination rights. In contrast, in non‐coalition districts, candidate characteristics play a key role in renomination decisions. These findings demonstrate how coalition dynamics can reshape parties' renomination strategies.",

          "authors": "Lukas Rudolph, Franziska Quoß, Thomas Bernauer",
          "abstract": "Supplying society-wide public goods often depends on site-specific provision. Yet, (perceived) localized provision costs may at times outweigh localized individual benefits and thus lead to “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY-)opposition (e.g., when trying to set up energy, transportation, social, or, in our case, communication infrastructure). Accurate estimation of the level of NIMBY-opposition per se is analytically challenging because general attitudes towards provision and NIMBY-motivated opposition are intertwined but need to be distinguished and because site selection can be endogenous to local support/opposition. We conducted an experiment that addresses these challenges, focusing on public attitudes toward 5G antenna placement in Switzerland. Using original data from a population-representative sample of Swiss residents ( $$N=5,035$$ ), we observe a population split on the question of 5G network expansion. We survey-experimentally revealed actual 5G antenna locations around respondent homes to a sample largely unaware of these locations beforehand. This information increased individuals’ worry over proximity to antenna sites and reduced support for 5G rollout, with such effects becoming stronger with closer proximity. Differentiating respondents with ex ante higher perceived costs/lower perceived benefits and lower costs/higher benefits from provision, the former are more opposed to 5G rollout, regardless of distance. In contrast, the latter exhibit particularly pronounced NIMBY attitudes. This allows for unexpected political coalitions that, in our case, could affect majority support. In additional experiments, we show that NIMBY attitudes translate into a higher willingness to pay for opposition in close proximity to new provision sites—but this could potentially be mitigated by scenarios where citizens decide under a veil of ignorance.",

          "abstract": "Politicians' personality is believed to play a central role in their electoral success. It is unclear, however, how important different traits are to voters and how the impact of personality compares to that of other well‐studied individual characteristics of politicians, such as gender, age, and political experience. Drawing on evidence from three studies—an observational study ( N = 4543), a survey experiment ( N = 1031), and a preregistered conjoint experiment ( N = 4313)—conducted in Belgium, Canada, and Israel, we demonstrate that citizens value some traits (e.g., conscientiousness) more than others (e.g., extraversion) when choosing candidates. We also show that the relative effect of politicians' personality is greater than that of other individual characteristics. These results highlight the central role of elite personality in our understanding of voting behavior.",

          "authors": "Nick Nelson, Darrin Hodgetts, Kerry Chamberlain",
          "abstract": "The centrality of information and communicative processes in influencing and contributing to the beliefs held in a populous has, historically, made the media one of the key networks of power and influence in society. The rapid expansion of social media platforms has revolutionized how media power is wielded to influence how political, economic, and social issues are mobilized, understood, and addressed. Understanding how this process occurs is, thus, important, but methods for achieving this understanding continue to evolve. This article draws on a large corpus of material (2473 Tweets and associated metadata) produced by the Russian state media Twitter account, @RT_Com, as one part of a broader campaign to influence the Western response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. We identified five overarching narratives that @RT_Com developed to influence its target audience: No Russian invasion; the West is threatening Russian security; Ukraine is part of Russia; Russia will utilize nuclear weapons to protect its sovereignty; and economic, political, and social insecurity in the West. Drawing on Aristotle's rhetorical framework, this article presents a process analysis to understand how these narratives were developed into means of persuasion. The findings provide new insights into the processes of persuasion in contemporary society.",

          "authors": "Alberto Stefanelli, Bruno Castanho Silva",
          "abstract": "With both affective polarization and populism on the rise in several countries, many have proposed a link between the two phenomena. Yet, research offers little direct evidence on whether populist individuals are more polarized than their mainstream conunterparts. This paper aims to fill this gap by using data from 37 elections in 31 countries to provide a comparative account of the relationship between populism and affective polarization at the individual level. Contrary to common assumptions, resuts show no significant difference in affective polarization between more and less populist individuals. Instead, we identify a curvilinear relationship wherein both individauls who strongly endorse or reject populist ideas exhibit high levels of polarization, with substantial variations across countries. Furthermore, we find that populism is associated with a general disdain for all political parties rather than just rival parties. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that populism is asymmetrically associated with affective polarization. We also provide evidence that ideological extremism, rather than populism, is more consistently and strongly associated with affective polarization in a large number of advanced democracies.",

          "abstract": "Emotions and their sociopolitical impact have received increasing scholarly attention. However, it remains largely unclear whether emotional expression within surveys is subject to social desirability bias. By drawing on impression management theory and the disclosure decision model, I argue that emotional expression is likely prone to social desirability bias in interviewer-administered survey modes and test my hypotheses on mixed-mode ANES data. The findings demonstrate that respondents significantly underreport negative emotions—anger and fear—when interviewed face-to-face as compared to online. Furthermore, positive emotions, such as hope and pride, are not exempt from biased reporting related to interview mode. These results highlight the risks of estimating emotions and their salience by either relying on interviewer administration or combining survey modes.",

          "authors": "Marc Hooghe, Dieter Stiers",
          "abstract": "There are few clear-cut examples of countries that have abolished or introduced compulsory voting. When the Netherlands abolished the system in 1971, Irwin (1974) documented how this led to a sharp reduction in voter turnout, especially among young people, women, and those with little political interest. Flanders, the largest autonomous region of Belgium, abolished compulsory voting in October 2024, and we accessed panel data collected before and after the event. We replicate Irwin’s analysis because electoral participation in the region decreased by almost 26 percentage points. Remarkably, our results are similar regarding the effect of gender and political interest, but we do not find a significant effect of educational level. Therefore, the normative argument that abolishing compulsory voting leads to more inequality based on education is not supported by our results. We do not find substantial consequences for the average policy input.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how switching to a mixed electoral system affects the level of women’s representation in national parliaments compared to the original system. Political science theories suggest that the type of electoral system influences the level of female representation in parliaments. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that changing to a mixed system will bring changes. We combine two levels of analysis. First, we closely examine six countries that have shifted from majoritarian or proportional systems to mixed systems to assess the impact on women’s representation in parliaments. To ensure that changes in women’s representation are not merely a result of global trends, we compare each country’s share of women in parliament with a country of similar culture and the same initial electoral system, but where the electoral system has not changed. Second, we conduct a large global crossnational comparison using multivariate regressions to examine the broader effects of adopting mixed systems. As expected, our findings show that moving from a majoritarian electoral system to a mixed system increases women’s representation in parliaments. However, unexpectedly the findings show that moving from a proportional system to a mixed system does not decrease women’s representation in parliaments.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies the legacy of European colonial rule for economic freedom in former colonies. I find that current levels of economic freedom in former colonies are directly related to the level of economic freedom of their colonizers. This association can be seen as early as the time of independence. I also find that additional European settlement from colonizers with high (low) economic freedom contributes to (detracts from) the overall economic freedom of their colonies. These results are robust to selection on unobservables and to controls for geography, climate, natural resource endowments, colonizer identity, settlement patterns, and precolonial characteristics. The difference in modern-day economic freedom associated with being colonized by the freest colonizer instead of the least free implies a predicted increase in modern-day per capita income of up to US$10,000.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workplace has significant political implications. How can we understand perceptions of both personal job risks and opportunities, given each may affect political attitudes differently? We use an original, representative survey from Great Britain to reveal; (i) the degree to which people expect personal AI-based occupational risks versus opportunities, (ii) how much this perceived exposure corresponds to variation in existing expert-derived occupational AI-exposure measures; (iii) the social groups who expect to be AI winners and AI losers; and (iv) how personal AI expectations are associated with demand for different political policies. We find that over 1-in-3 British workers anticipate being an AI winner (10%) or loser (24%) and, while expectations correlate with classifications of occupational exposure, factors like education, gender, age, and employment sector also matter. Politically, both self-anticipated AI winners and losers show similar support for redistribution, but they differ on investment in education and training as well as on immigration. Our findings emphasise the importance of considering subjective winners and losers of AI; these patterns cannot be explained by existing occupational classifications of AI exposure.",

          "authors": "Nils B Weidmann, Mina Rulis",
          "abstract": "Recent events on university campuses show again that academic institutions often constitute breeding grounds for political mobilization. This also applies to autocratic countries, where political protest has been found to be more likely to occur in university cities. However, research so far has failed to address the question of which universities are more likely to see protest. In this paper, we focus on the disciplinary composition of universities in autocracies. We argue that non-STEM disciplines traditionally attract more progressive students, cover more politically sensitive topics, and oftentimes study the determinants of successful mobilization. Therefore, they should be more likely to serve as focal points for political protest. We test our expectations in a large-scale comparative analysis, using fine-grained data on the composition and location of academic institutions in autocracies combined with event data on political protest. We find that political activism is more likely in cities with institutions focused on arts and humanities, which points to the potentially transformative role of these disciplines even in severely constrained political settings.",
