          "authors": "Andreas Albertsen, Carl Knight",
          "abstract": "Philosophical accounts of discrimination distinguish the question of what discrimination is from the question of its wrongfulness. This article addresses these two questions in the context of anti-homeless hostile design of public spaces. Regarding the first question, all forms of anti-homeless hostile design amount to discrimination, with typical cases (for example, anti-homeless spikes or benches) being direct discrimination, but with some cases (for example, CCTV not intended to target the homeless) being indirect discrimination. Regarding the second question, it is argued that all major accounts of the wrongness of discrimination identify the usual, directly discriminatory hostile design as wrongful on account of its harmful or disrespectful character. Most accounts also consider the less common indirectly discriminatory hostile design to be possibly wrongful, especially given the severe disadvantages faced by the homeless in contemporary cities.",

          "authors": "Hauke Licht, Ronja Sczepanski",
          "abstract": "Politicians appeal to social groups to court their electoral support. However, quantifying which groups politicians refer to, claim to represent, or address in their public communication presents researchers with challenges. We propose a supervised learning approach for extracting group mentions from political texts. We first collect human annotations to determine the passages of a text that refer to social groups. We then fine-tune a transformer language model for contextualized supervised classification at the word level. Applied to unlabeled texts, our approach enables researchers to automatically detect and extract word spans that contain group mentions. We illustrate our approach in two applications, generating new empirical insights into how British parties use social groups in their rhetoric. Our method allows for detecting and extracting mentions of social groups from various sources of texts, creating new possibilities for empirical research in political science.",

          "abstract": "In Africa, missionaries used schooling to gain adherents. We study how historical missionary activity shaped long-run education and political development across regime types. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to Catholic missionaries generated by their territorial administration system. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that proximity to historical diocese headquarters generally led to an increased presence of Catholic missionaries, as well as long-term positive effects on Catholic identity and educational outcomes. The effects on political outcomes vary by regime type. Only individuals exposed to greater historical missionary activity in open anocracies—relative to those in democracies and closed anocracies—are more likely to participate in politics. Moreover, they are also the only ones who are more engaged, supportive of democratic institutions, and disenchanted with the state of democracy and incumbent in their countries.",

          "abstract": "How do formal institutions emerge and change after a civil war? Complementing explanations focused on distributional conflict and the promotion of post-war peace and democracy, we argue that ideology plays a central role in shaping the most fundamental formal institution: the constitution. Using data from 153 civil wars between 1944–2016, we find that in the post-war period: (1) Victorious revolutionary socialist (RS) and secessionist rebels are more likely to promulgate new constitutions; (2) Victorious incumbents are more likely to adopt constitutional amendments; (3) Non-Maoist RS rebels enact constitutions with more symbolic content and rights compared to the incumbent or other victorious rebels. We illustrate the mechanisms behind these findings with a comparative analysis of multiple constitutional transitions in Cambodia. Our results underscore the importance of research on ideology and armed conflict as groups with ambitious goals for social transformation remain a powerful force for political change worldwide.",

          "abstract": "We argue that the growing devolution of power to local authorities in European countries in the past four decades or so should lead to a growing influence of local politics and politicians in national politics. Specifically, we claim an incumbency effect across difference levels of politics, whereby parties that control a majority of seats in local councils have an advantage in national elections. To test this claim we employ an original dataset of 62 national elections results from 15 European countries at locality level and pair it with data on previous local elections. To overcome endogeneity issues, we employ a regression discontinuity design in which we focus on parties that barely win or barely miss a majority of seats in local councils. The estimated local effect gives incumbent parties an advantage of roughly one percentage point. This local council advantage benefit primarily parties that are not in national government.",

          "authors": "Mehmet Yavuz",
          "abstract": "In this study, I investigate how crises affect the ideological claims of authoritarian regimes. While existing studies emphasize the significance of ideological legitimation claims for the consolidation of authoritarian regimes, they do not examine whether the intensity and usage of these claims change after a crisis. I address this gap by utilizing the competitive authoritarian regime of Turkey before and after the July 2016 coup attempt. I use a novel dataset of President Erdoğan’s speeches and combine various text-as-data tools, including word embeddings, dictionary-based measures, and topic modeling, with an interrupted time series analysis. The results suggest that the coup attempt led to a short-term increase in the intensity of ideological claims and a long-lasting increase in the ideological framing of regime outsiders in Erdoğan’s speeches. These results demonstrate that crises transform the ideological claims of authoritarian regimes by reshaping how and to what extent such claims are used.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies in the United States and Europe have documented a growing divergence in voting behaviour and political attitudes between cities and the countryside. However, we still lack systematic evidence on the extent to which this urban-rural divide is also affectively polarised. To shed light on this, we advance the concept of place-based affective polarisation, which we define as the difference between in-group and out-group affect in relation to place-based groups. Drawing on original survey data from nine European countries, we show that place-based affective polarisation is substantial along the urban-rural divide and associated with strong feelings of place-based resentment and identity. Furthermore, we find that higher levels of place-based affective polarisation correlate with support for GAL parties (green, alternative, libertarian) among urbanites and support for TAN parties (traditional, authoritarian, nationalist) among ruralites. Overall, our findings point to a strong political cleavage between urban and rural areas in several European countries.",

          "authors": "Alex Yu-Ting Lin",
          "abstract": "How do states compete for status—i.e., an elevated position in the international order? Conventional wisdom suggests that states do so by enhancing their own status, such as by joining selective international institutions or winning wars. I theorize and test another strategy: reducing their competitor's status through delegitimation. By spreading information about the target's failure (i.e., character assassination), delegitimation can undermine the target's status in the eyes of third-party states and subvert the target's ability to form coalitions with said third-party states. I test my theory through a survey experiment in Canada, wherein select respondents were exposed to Chinese information campaigns about US failure in the Middle East. Exposure to delegitimation reduces the respondents’ assessment of US status, in turn reducing their (1) support for Canada to participate in joint military exercises with the United States and (2) assessment of US credibility in multilateral trade negotiations. I contextualize these results through a case study of Chinese delegitimation of US policy in Africa and its impact on African countries’ alignment with the United States. My analysis highlights the changing character of war: the mechanisms and effects of information warfare, including America's psychological operations, China's “three wars,” or Russia's active measures.",

          "authors": "Evgeny Roshchin",
          "abstract": "This article investigates how the concept of the international community was rhetorically constructed in public diplomatic discourse and endowed with both agential status and moral authority. It argues that this conceptual innovation emerged during a critical juncture in the 1920s–1930s, amid debates on collective security within the League of Nations. In response to acts of aggression that undermined the newly established international order, diplomats employed contested notions of “crime” and “punishment” to characterize state behavior. In the League's debates over the first international sanctions, references to extra-legal moral principles were used to bolster both the legitimacy and efficacy of the legal regime. Since the principle of sovereign equality precluded any single state from claiming moral authority, diplomats instead innovatively portrayed the international community as a fictive agent endowed with superior moral standing. This rhetorical move helped legitimize calls for punishing aggressors. Adopting a historically informed constructivist approach, the article illuminates how conceptual transformations within the normative order unfold through diplomatic practice. It shows how diplomatic forums can serve as platforms for conceptual innovation with lasting impact on public discourse on world politics.",

          "authors": "Maria A Lotito, Christopher W Shay, Michael A Rubin",
          "abstract": "Under what conditions do states sponsor foreign nonviolent campaigns (FNCs) seeking to overthrow incumbent regimes? While political ideology plays a role, motivating liberal democracies to support (typically pro-democratic) campaigns, we argue strategic and material factors—specifically geo-political alignment and economic dependence—are central to explaining state sponsorship of FNCs, often overriding ideological and normative factors. A potential sponsor, whether democratic or autocratic, is unlikely to support FNCs when doing so jeopardizes a strategic partnership with the target regime, which may retaliate against the sponsor. Additionally, democracies are particularly deterred from supporting FNCs when the target regime can retaliate economically, such as by disrupting trade or other vital economic ties. To test these arguments, we leverage data from the External Support for Non-violent Campaigns Dataset, which documents global instances of state support for non-violent campaigns from 2000 to 2014. Consistent with our theory, we find that liberal democracies make up the vast majority of sponsors, but also that geo-political alignment between potential sponsor and target regime is strongly and negatively correlated with the provision of support. Moreover, economic dependence on the target reduces the likelihood of support among liberal democracies.",

          "abstract": "Political militias are active in most civil wars, yet their impact on peace processes is largely overlooked. Building on principal-agent logic, we argue that the incentives to delegate violence to political militias have downstream consequences for the likelihood of peace negotiations. On one hand, battlefield violence by militias can complicate the bargaining. On the other hand, the higher use of civilian victimization by political militias may backfire, eventually bringing international pressure on the unwilling parties to agree to talks. We combine data on peace negotiations between government-rebel dyads with data on militia activities in Africa. We find that militia violence against government and rebel forces is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of negotiations. When militias target civilians, however, mediated peace talks with third-party involvement become more likely. We complement these findings using fine-grained data in a focused case analysis of Sudan and South Sudan.",

          "abstract": "While government corruption is often cited as a reason for poor military performance, little empirical attention has been devoted to understanding how governance structures influence corruption’s impact. To address this gap, we introduce a theory of how corruption undermines military efficacy in armed conflicts, arguing that regime type plays a critical role in shaping the impact of corruption on military performance. We focus specifically on public sector theft and embezzlement on fighting effectiveness. This type of corruption brings especially pernicious effects as it stokes morale problems among military personnel and weakens oversight of fighting effectiveness. To test our theory, we examine the outcomes of all lethal military interstate disputes (MIDS) and intrastate armed conflicts through 2014. Bridging the comparative politics and military effectiveness literatures, our results offer greater insight into how autocratic policies hinder armed forces as well as the need for stronger civilian oversight to ensure battlefield efficacy.",

We conducted experiments to assess whether well-known strategies for fighting misinformation are effective for this understudied yet particularly vulnerable population. We evaluate the impact of digital media literacy tips on migrants’ ability to identify false information and their intentions to share migration-related content. We find that these interventions can effectively decrease migrants’ intentions to share misinformation. We also find suggestive evidence that asking participants to consider accuracy may inadvertently influence their sharing behavior by acting as a behavioral nudge, rather than simply eliciting their sharing intentions. Additionally, the interventions reduced trust in social media as an information source while maintaining trust in official channels. The findings suggest that incorporating digital literacy tips into official websites could be a cost-effective strategy to reduce misinformation circulation among migrant populations.",

To address this question, we embedded a preregistered experiment in a nationally representative survey that was fielded the week before the 2024 US Presidential Election. The main experimental treatment provided information that some immigrant groups tend to favor Donald Trump and the Republican Party. This information reduced support for immigration among Democrats and increased support for immigration among Republicans. Our findings suggest that immigrants’ political identities impact public support for immigration. They also suggest that Trump’s apparent gains among immigrant voters in the 2024 election have the potential to reduce partisan polarization over immigration in the future.",

          "abstract": "Violence against social activists is a global phenomenon, increasingly prevalent in democratic and conflict-affected states. Violence targeting women activists, in particular, highlights the intersection of gender-based discrimination and the risks associated with activism. We theorize that the killings of women activists reduce both women’s motivation to run for office and voters’ willingness to elect women candidates, driven by fears of further retaliation from armed groups and a demand for protective masculine norms in politics. Using novel fine-grained data on violence against activists, we demonstrate that the killings of women activists in Colombia decrease women’s candidacies and lower voter support for women in mayoral elections. Additional analyses suggest that women’s visibility during peace negotiations and prior territorial control by left-wing FARC rebels mitigated this effect, emphasizing how variation in gender norms can alter the political consequences of violence. Our findings reveal that considering the gender of victims offers important insights into how exposure to political violence influences democratic elections.",

          "abstract": "Election denial is a popular tool used by election losers to challenge democratic processes, often with harmful consequences for political stability. While some research suggests that actual fraud serves as a focal point for protest, other work emphasizes citizens’ perceptions of fraud and partisanship. This study contributes to the debate by pointing to a possible mechanism for why fraud perceptions and partisanship might matter more for protest mobilization. I argue that local elite endorsement of election denial plays a crucial role in amplifying and localizing national narratives of stolen elections, making them more resonant within specific communities. I test this argument using the case of the 2020 US presidential election, where the widespread election denial narrative by President Trump led to highly uneven patterns of pro-Trump protests across the country. Using novel data on protest activity based on anonymized cellphone records and the timing of public endorsements of fraud claims by members of Congress, I demonstrate that local elite support for election denial significantly increased protest mobilization within their districts, particularly in districts already primed for dissent. This study sheds light on the democratic risks posed by election denial, showing how elite-driven disinformation can intensify and localize mobilization, even in the absence of credible claims of electoral fraud.",

          "abstract": "How and why do incumbents use local elections as tools for subverting democracy and establishing party dominance? Integrating literatures on political violence and decentralization, this article argues that incumbents use violence to engineer non-contestation among opposition actors in local elections. Drawing on the strength of local networks, incumbents prioritize their own strongholds for such violence, leading candidates to withdraw and resulting in uncontested seats. I explore this argument with data on local elections from West Bengal, a state in India that has held local elections since the 1970s but where competition is spatially uneven, resulting in a significant number of uncontested seats. The theoretical expectations are tested with disaggregated data on competitiveness and uncontested seats for 3,000 local electoral units. The article finds that increased violence against the opposition in an electoral unit leads to seats going uncontested in that unit. I complement these findings with 60 qualitative interviews from political elites and non-elites, which indicate that violence is an important means through which incumbents engineer non-contestation. These findings have important implications for research on political violence and subnational authoritarianism, particularly in understanding the emergence and persistence of subnational authoritarianism in decentralized countries.",

          "authors": "Juan Masullo, Krzysztof Krakowski, Davide Morisi",
          "abstract": "How does crime influence democratic attitudes and behaviors? Existing research offers conflicting answers: some argue that crime fosters antidemocratic preferences, while others suggest it increases democratic engagement. To reconcile this paradox, we conceptualize democracy as a multidimensional system with distinct components that can be decoupled. We distinguish between different (anti)democratic preferences tied to core democratic principles and argue that contextual exposure to crime may heighten support for undemocratic enforcement measures without eroding commitment to procedural democracy. To test this, we conducted a large online survey ( N = 3108) in Brazil – a country profoundly affected by various forms of crime – using two embedded experimental protocols. Our findings show that crime exposure increases support for unlawful enforcement practices, such as police overreach and vigilante justice, while leaving attitudes toward military coups, executive aggrandizement and support for democracy as the best form of government largely unaffected. Understanding this nuanced relationship is especially important in contexts where crime is pervasive and politically instrumentalized. That exposure to crime leads citizens to tolerate breaches of the rule of law in the name of public safety is deeply concerning. Yet, our results offer cautious optimism: support for undemocratic enforcement does not necessarily undermine broader democratic commitments.",

          "abstract": "As in many federal countries, subnational politics is the cornerstone of Argentine political careers, and the Congress is a central point for multilevel politics. Although existing literature shows that local politics influence the behavior of congressmen, their effect on committee appointments has been scarcely studied. This article examines the committee assignments of former mayors and governors in the Argentine Congress from 2011 to 2019. We find that being a first‐time legislator with prior experience as a mayor and coming from provinces with large public sectors, competitive party systems, and small district magnitudes positively influence the chances of being appointed to distributive committees, that is, those whose benefits can be more easily disaggregated into specific geographic constituencies. Our findings enhance the understanding of the connections between the federal legislative branch and local executives, and they highlight the importance of distributional theory in analyzing committee membership.",

          "abstract": "Congress relies heavily on congressional staff to function and, as such, members have raised alarms about staff departures and their impact on the institution's capacity. We examine patterns of congressional staff exit to understand the severity of this problem. We document differences in departure rates among staff from certain demographic groups, as staff diversity shapes substantive representation. Using comprehensive congressional staffing employment data over the past two decades, we show turnover rates vary by race and gender, with minorities more likely to exit their positions and women, despite being less likely to be promoted, more likely to stay. Lastly, while overall turnover rates are high, we find that staff with higher education and committee experience (whose departures are more likely to affect brain drain) are more likely to remain in Congress. These results hold important implications for ongoing policy reforms and for descriptive representation in congressional policymaking.",

          "abstract": "The 60‐vote end‐debate threshold is a key institution in the United States Senate. Most winning coalitions require 60 votes, effectively giving veto power to a minority of senators. But do supermajority debate rules necessarily translate into minority veto power? We examine this in state legislatures, where there is far more variation in whether chamber rules require a majority or a supermajority of legislators to cut off debate. Across multiple analyses and data sources, we fail to find systematic evidence that supermajority debate rules are associated with several outcome variables, including the size of bill passage coalitions, news coverage of obstruction, and the success of major proposals. The lack of evidence indicates that, in many cases, debate rules do not translate into legislative “pivots” and that case‐specific knowledge is necessary for understanding the influence of legislative rules.",

          "abstract": "Existing work documents how senators use their official communications to explain their Washington activities and build support in the district. However, relatively little remains known about how senators communicate about one of their most important constitutional duties—providing advice and consent on Supreme Court nominees. In this paper, we investigate how senators discuss Supreme Court nominations with their constituents, focusing on one common rhetorical strategy: highlighting the descriptive traits of nominees. Using a new dataset of press releases about nominee race and gender, we demonstrate that senators of both parties frequently discuss the descriptive traits of nominees. Next, we systematically investigate the determinants of this rhetoric, finding that shared characteristics with the nominee, copartisanship, and institutional position predict discussion of descriptive representation. Then, we use the CES to demonstrate the impact of these messages on constituent evaluations of senators; we find a modest boost in using such messages. Finally, we conduct a preliminary investigation of discussion of nominee religion using our framework. Our findings provide important insight into how senators use rhetorical appeals to appeal to constituents and make the case for diversity in governing.",

          "abstract": "The degree of party control of parliamentary debates influences which MPs take the floor. However, we do not know whether floor access rules matter also for the content of speeches. Drawing on a corpus of speeches delivered in bill debates in the Italian lower house over 10 years, I investigate how variation in floor access rules across comparable debates shapes MPs' geographical representation in their legislative speeches. The findings reveal that open‐access rules increase the intensity of geographical representation compared to when parties allocate speaking time, pointing to a tension between party control and dyadic representation. Additionally, this study demonstrates that the effect of open rules on geographical representation is consistent across MPs with different electoral incentives and degrees of alignment with party leadership, as well as across topics varying in their potential for geographical representation.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the dynamics of voter information seeking during real-world election campaigns, a crucial yet relatively underexplored area of political behavior. Drawing on theories of information processing, I propose a model of information seeking driven by the need to resolve informational deficits, shaped by two fundamental party-level characteristics: incumbency status and programmatic change. Firstly, I expect voters to seek information more actively about opposition parties than about governing parties, as the former lack the highly visible track record of governing parties. Secondly, voters tend to seek more information when established non-governing parties undergo a significant programmatic reconfiguration. To empirically test these hypotheses, I compile a unique dataset comprising Google search data related to the main political parties of 11 liberal democracies between 2004 and 2023. The results reveal that voters consistently demonstrate a greater propensity to search for information about opposition parties than incumbent parties during election campaigns, particularly when the opposition implements substantial programmatic changes. These findings have crucial implications for understanding how voters search for political information about political parties in real-world electoral competitions and how party-level characteristics can drive this behavior.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among Make America Great Again (MAGA) activists during the 2020 presidential campaign, we explore the status dynamics behind the appeal of Donald Trump’s right-wing populism. While existing explanations emphasize partisanship, economic anxiety, racial resentment, rural identity, and media polarization, we underscore a less-explored explanation for Trump’s core support: it is a status-based social movement. We find that Trump’s activists are not simply voters responding to policy preferences or culture-war appeals but are also participants in a grassroots social movement organized around a shared perception of lost honor, declining esteem, and institutional disrespect. To make this argument we use the concept of the symbolic politics of status to explain how political conflict extends beyond contests over material distribution or moral values to include battles over whose values and lifestyles are considered worthy. For MAGA activists, reclaiming lost status means seeking public affirmation for identities they feel have been unfairly denigrated. The MAGA movement blends grievance with joy, cultivating pride, belonging, and celebration alongside anger at elites. By centering status in our analysis, we offer an integrative framework that connects material, cultural, and emotional motivations into a broader account of MAGA as a right-wing social movement grounded in grassroots populism.",

          "abstract": "Evidence of partisan bias questions the ability of citizens to form meaningful judgments of the functioning of government and hold the government accountable. Existing work demonstrates that incumbent and opposition supporters consistently diverge in their evaluation of government performance regarding the national economy, security, and highly polarized policy issues. We argue that in a polarized environment, partisan bias applies not only to citizens’ evaluations of macro-policy outcomes but also to citizens’ evaluations of mundane tangible public services, such as education, health, policing, and transportation. We provide rigorous empirical evidence for this hypothesis using the case of Israel during the two dramatic, hyper-polarized government changes in 2021 and 2022. The data include two repeated cross-sectional survey datasets: A large seven-wave survey study and an administrative survey dataset by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics. Our robust findings question the ability of citizens to hold their government accountable for public service performance, a fundamental feature of democratic theory.",

          "abstract": "Rising global and local inequalities make prejudice based on social class an increasingly pressing issue, yet it remains underexplored in psychological literature. Across three studies run in Poland, we apply the Dual‐Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice and find that Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)—a preference for social hierarchy—predicts classism positively, but Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)—a preference for social order—serves as a negative predictor and a buffer to the effects of SDO. In Study 1 ( N = 529), RWA and SDO differentially and interactively predicted social distance toward the poor in a nationwide Polish sample. In Study 2 ( N = 382), an affective measure of prejudice was applied in a longitudinal design to show that stable levels of RWA and SDO, rather than their fluctuations, are responsible for this interactive effect. In Study 3 ( N = 468), SDO predicted social distance via affective classism, and RWA moderated this indirect effect. Results of three studies suggest that authoritarianism may not only be associated with lower classism but also limit the hostile potential of social dominance.",

We examine this hypothesis for protest behavior in the West Bank. Since 1967, civilian Israeli settlements have been established here, making salient stark local inequalities. Across two primary and four secondary data collections ( N = 8360), exploiting geographical coordinates, we show that proximity to settlements increased the relative likelihood of participating in higher‐risk political action (between +41% and +82%) at the cost of moderate protest (−30% to −36%), flanked by corresponding attitudinal shifts. Effects were spatially limited to a 3‐kilometer distance, time‐insensitive, and validated through separate administrative data on protest events during the same ten‐year observation period. Moreover, the shift toward high‐risk protest engagement was not associated with past negative contact—instead, we find support for the perceived collective injustice mechanism, ruling out several socio‐psychological alternatives. Salience of group‐based moral outrage can shape political behavior in settings of violent asymmetrical conflict.",

Much of the literature on parties and the committee system in legislatures examines which members serve on which committees.

I show that parties in the US Senate use matching mechanisms, like those used in school choice and the medical residency match. Republicans and Democrats use two distinct matching mechanisms, such that canonical theories of parties cannot apply equally to them. The Republican mechanism is strategyproof, whereas the Democrat mechanism incentivizes politicians to manipulate their reported preferences. Leveraging matching theory, I make theoretical predictions; corroborating them with archival correspondence and committee requests/assignments data.",

To explore this, we focus on online dating, using a conjoint experiment with 3,000 UK participants to isolate the effect of partisanship from other traits. Our findings indicate that the influence of partisanship is on par with conventional criteria like physical appearance, yet tolerance for opposing views plays an even stronger role. We also find imporant partisan asymmetries: both groups favour co-partisans, but Labour supporters are twice as likely to do so. Counter-stereotypic profiles reduce bias among Conservatives but heighten it among Labour supporters.",

After months of boasting about the military campaign in Ukraine, Kremlin propagandists admitted certain military defeats and began to blame senior military command. I explain the change by reference to propaganda, asymmetric information, and informational autocrats. The propagandists could not conceal the defeats because war bloggers and military barons were disseminating information while mobilization was signaling lack of military progress, both of which reduced information asymmetries. Meanwhile, mobilization imposed costs on the public and incentivized increased monitoring of the war, threatening to undermine support of Putin, Russia’s informational autocrat. In response, Putin’s regime successfully shifted blame to military command, enabled by information asymmetries regarding the actions and structure of the military, which prevented the public from holding Putin accountable.",

The primacy of ballot initiatives addressing issues salient to younger demographics, such as marijuana legalization and reproductive rights, varied across states, allowing for the statistical comparison of ballot initiative types by state and generational standing. By analyzing data from the 2022 election, this research extends prior studies, focusing on the role of ballot measures in mobilizing youth voters to test whether these mobilizing effects hold for a new generation entering voting age, as well as whether these effects persist for Millennials as they age into different life stages. Leveraging the Census Bureau’s Community Population Survey (CPS) November Voting Supplement File, this study models the impact of youth-salient ballot measures on voter turnout across different generational cohorts. The results reveal a significant association between the presence of youth-salient ballot measures and increased turnout among Millennial and Generation Z voters generally, and particularly for younger female voters. These findings show that when young voters are given the opportunity to vote on issues that are salient to them, they participate at higher rates.",
