          "authors": "Juan Felipe Campos-Contreras, Camilo Nieto-Matiz, Luis L. Schenoni",
          "abstract": "How do state interventions targeting illicit economies influence armed violence? Using Colombia as a critical case, we argue that aerial spraying of coca crops exacerbates violence by destabilizing local power dynamics and disrupting interactions among armed actors, civilians, and the state. Using municipal-level data from 2000 to 2015, we find that aerial spraying increases overall levels of violence in affected areas. Aerial spraying, we find, propitiates retaliatory violence against the state, stimulates turf wars between armed organizations, and produces civilian victimization. Moreover, we show that paramilitaries and criminal organizations respond more sharply to aerial spraying, escalating retaliation against the state and violence against civilians. By contrast, insurgent violence remains more consistent, driven by ideological goals and largely independent of eradication efforts. These findings reveal how fleeting large-scale interventions can inadvertently fuel conflict by altering the strategic equilibria of violent actors in illicit economies.",

          "authors": "Alon Yakter, Liran Harsgor",
          "abstract": "Popular willingness to compromise is an important step for conflict resolution. A key argument suggests that improving expectations about the prospects of peace can increase public support for concessions. Yet a competing view, anchored in broader debates about preferences and expectations, suggests that prior ideological dispositions motivate biased future expectations rather than vice versa. This tension, however, remains understudied in violent conflicts. In this study, we leverage rich survey data from Israel to disentangle the causal relationship between expectations and preferences for compromise in a long-standing conflict. Using two decades of aggregate monthly series and two exogenous shocks to peace expectations, we find that changes in prospective expectations do predict subsequent shifts in support for compromise. We find no contrary evidence for a null, opposite, or heterogeneous relationship. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the interrelations between expectations and preferences and provide insights into their implications for conflict resolution.",

          "abstract": "How are we to interpret the rising popularity of right-wing populist and outright authoritarian parties in European democracies? Commonly, elections are seen as handing a mandate to their winners. So, are such forces increasingly receiving a mandate from voters to carry out their policies? This article reviews three recent books ( Authoritarianism and the Evolution of West European Electoral Politics by Erik R. Tillman, Democracy Erodes from the Top by Larry M. Bartels, and Voters under Pressure by Ruth Dassonneville) and argues that the mandate interpretation strikes out. These books illustrate how politicians shape “mandates,” how “mandates” can be ignored by those in power, and how the party system and the electorate are not structured (anymore) in a way to allow for genuine mandates to emerge.",

          "authors": "Christian Oswald",
          "abstract": "Conflict forecasting has seen two recent developments: a shift to predicting continuous variables and a debate about the value of structural and procedural variables. This paper contributes to these efforts and proposes the category of salience variables in the form of Google Trends and Wikipedia data. Internet searches can be precursors of conflict intensity as a result of for example an increase in protests, violent behavior, or public announcements. Data are readily and openly available, updated in real time, and provide global coverage which makes it ideal for near-real time forecasting. Prediction targets are the number of security-related incidents and battle-related, non-state, and civilian casualties. I demonstrate the value of salience variables using various out-of-sample windows and performance metrics on the country- and province-month level. I find evidence that salience variables have considerable predictive power, outperform other commonly used variables, and are thus a valuable addition to the conflict forecasting toolkit.",

          "abstract": "Does U.S. military assistance affect domestic patterns of political violence? Military aid can improve the recipient country’s military capacity, but also create an incentive for prolonging conflict to secure future assistance. This moral hazard can manifest by geographically displacing conflict away from military strongholds while demonstrating an aggregate country-wide decrease in levels of violence. I analyze U.S. military assistance to Pakistan and find that aid can decrease the aggregate level of political violence in the short run. However, this short-run decrease is accompanied by a displacement of violence away from military headquarters. The discontinuity created by the sudden withdrawal of U.S. military assistance after Pakistan’s nuclear program, followed by its resumption post-9/11, lends causal purchase to my results, as does the historical location of military headquarters that were established by colonizers and have persisted in post-independence Pakistan.",

          "abstract": "Radical right behavior and support for radical right parties have increased across many countries in recent decades. A growing body of research has argued that, similar to the spread of other extremist behaviors, this is due to an erosion of political norms. This suggests that re-stigmatizing radical right parties might be an effective way of countering their growth. We use a survey experiment in Spain that compares the effectiveness of three theory-driven interventions aimed at increasing political stigma against a radical right party. Contrary to expectations, we fail to validate the efficacy of vignette-based attempts at stigmatization, instead identifying some backlash effects. Methodologically, our findings underscore the importance of validating treatments, as we show that simple attempts at re-stigmatization can produce null or opposing effects to their intended purpose. Theoretically, our results support the idea that normalization is a “one-way street,” in that re-stigmatizing parties is difficult after a party has become normalized.",

          "abstract": "To understand the evolution of party-based populism, reliable and valid measurement is essential. This article presents the second wave of the Populism and Political Parties Expert Survey, capturing populism with a continuous, five-item multidimensional latent construct in 312 political parties across 31 European countries in 2023. We validate the approach through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Item Response Theory (IRT). The IRT findings confirm the discriminatory power of the five items, while CFA results establish strict measurement invariance from 2018 to 2023, allowing for cross-temporal comparisons. Substantively, we show that radical right parties remain the most populist, followed by the radical left, with both nativism and left-wing economic stances as robust predictors of populism. Overall, average populism levels declined from 2018 to 2023, largely due to decreases among parties with weaker nativist and authoritarian tendencies.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the extent to which local incidents of political violence reshape political competition. Specifically, the extent to which they influence party system fragmentation. It draws on data from over two thousand municipalities in Mexico across three consecutive elections (2018, 2021, and 2024), as well as on a series of generalized least squares models with random effects and clustered standard errors. These show that political violence significantly suppresses party system fragmentation, and that this suppressive effect intensifies over time. The study argues that political violence functions as a ‘shadow institution’ that mimics the effects of formal electoral rules by altering the costs, risks, and incentives of political participation. In all, this study highlights the need to account for both temporal dynamics and informal coercive pressures when analyzing the structure and evolution of party systems.",

Constituency juries would be made up of randomly selected citizens from an electoral constituency who exercise oversight over that constituency’s elected representative. Elected representatives would be required to give a regular account of their actions to the constituency jury, and the jury would have the power to sanction the representative. In addition to this general model of constituency juries, I offer a more specific institutional design that shows how the general model can be operationalized and realistically incorporated into existing representative governments. In contrast to lottocratic proposals that replace elections with sortition, constituency juries are a promising way to combine the two to address the oligarchic tendencies of elections in representative government.",

The research develops a framework for assessing the accessibility of political parties. The research finds evidence of activity in a small number of parties but finds relatively little evidence to suggest that parties are prioritizing this issue, especially when compared with the participation of other social groups.

          "abstract": "Forecasting of armed conflicts is a critical area of research with the potential to save lives and mitigate suffering. While existing forecasting models offer valuable point predictions, they often lack individual-level uncertainty estimates, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. Several approaches exist to estimate uncertainty, such as parametric and Bayesian prediction intervals, bootstrapping, quantile regression, but these methods often rely on restrictive assumptions, struggle to provide well-calibrated intervals across the full range of outcomes, or are computationally intensive. Conformal prediction offers a model-agnostic alternative that guarantees a user-specified level of coverage but typically provides only marginal coverage, potentially resulting in non-uniform coverage across different regions of the outcome space. In this article, we introduce a novel extension called bin-conditional conformal prediction (BCCP), which enhances standard conformal prediction (SCP) by ensuring consistent coverage rates across user-defined subsets (bins) of the outcome variable. We apply BCCP to simulated data as well as the forecasting of fatalities from armed conflicts, and demonstrate that it provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across various ranges of the outcome. Compared to SCP, BCCP offers improved local coverage, though this comes at the cost of slightly wider prediction intervals.",

However, few studies have explored how to use these tools for data extraction. Instead, researchers interested in extracting text from poorly formatted sources typically rely on optical character recognition and regular expressions or extract each item by hand. This letter describes a workflow process for structured text extraction using free models and software. I discuss the type of data best suited to this method, its usefulness within political science, and the steps required to convert the text into a usable dataset. Finally, I demonstrate the method by extracting agenda items from city council meeting minutes. I find the method can accurately extract subsections of text from a document and requires only a few hand labeled documents to adequately train.",

          "authors": "Bryan McLaughlin, Nathaniel Geiger, Pedro H. P. Rocha",
          "abstract": "Americans are increasingly unwilling to talk about politics with out-partisans. One potential barrier to such cross-cutting partisan conversations may be partisans’ tendency to stereotype out-partisans as lacking the deliberative traits necessary to have a productive conversation (i.e., partisan deliberative bias ). Here, three studies examine the presence of partisan deliberative bias, its relationship to cross-cutting political talk, and potential pathways to reducing partisan deliberative bias. Study 1 (two-wave panel; Wave-2 N = 695) provides evidence that partisans perceive out-partisans possess less deliberative traits than in-partisans and these perceptions are related to reduced cross-cutting political talk (at Time 2). Study 2 (experimental; N = 417) provides evidence that exposing individuals to more examples of out-partisans who display deliberative traits (vs. anti-deliberative traits) leads to increased perceptions that out-partisans possess deliberative traits, which is associated with greater willingness to engage in a political conversation. Study 3 (experimental; N = 825) provides evidence that a deliberative bias-correcting intervention can reduce stereotypes about out-party members’ deliberative traits. Further, findings from an alternative model that includes in-group favoritism suggest that perceptions of deliberative traits are significantly related to cross-cutting political talk even when accounting for affective polarization. Findings across all three studies are similar for Republican and Democratic participants. Taken holistically, these results highlight the prevalence of partisan deliberative bias, suggest that such bias reduces cross-cutting conversations, and provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to address this bias.",

Using a survey experiment conducted with a representative sample of Portuguese voters, it finds that voters' support for legally enshrined due process rights is conditional on their partisan alignment with the corruption suspects. Specifically, respondents exhibit greater support for due process protections for in‐party than for out‐party suspects, with out‐party derogation prevailing. By focusing on public attitudes towards legal fairness and horizontal accountability, these results expand our understanding of the role of partisan loyalties in accountability for corruption beyond their better‐known role in electoral processes.",

          "title": "Large Language Models Are Democracy Coders with Attitudes",
          "authors": "Nils B. Weidmann, Mats Faulborn, David García",
          "abstract": "Current political developments worldwide illustrate that research on democratic backsliding is as important as ever. A recent exchange in Political Science &amp; Politics (February 2024) highlighted again that the measurement of democracy remains a challenge. With many democracy indicators consisting of subjective assessments rather than factual observations, trends in democracy over time could be due to human biases in the coding of these indicators rather than empirical facts. This article leverages two cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for the coding of democracy indicators from the V-Dem project. With access to huge amounts of information, these models may be able to rate the many “soft” characteristics of regimes at substantially lower costs. Whereas LLM-generated codings largely align with expert coders for many countries, we show that when these models deviate from human assessments, they do so in different but consistent ways. Some LLMs are too pessimistic and others consistently overestimate the democratic quality of these countries. Although the combination of the two LLM codings can alleviate this concern, we conclude that it is difficult to replace human coders with LLMs because the extent and direction of these attitudes is not known a priori.",

          "title": "Introducing the American Women Political Leaders’ Operational Codes Dataset",
          "authors": "Baris Kesgin, Katherine Graham McCormick",
          "abstract": "Although women leaders assume prominent national offices in the United States (and the world), one of the well-established specializations in political science and psychology (i.e., leadership studies) is inundated with male-centric benchmarks. This research often relies on a reference group to develop leaders’ profiles in comparison to other elites. They are predominantly populated, however, with male leaders. This article suggests a remedy and introduces a women leaders reference group for operational code analysis, which is a quantitative approach measuring leaders’ beliefs about politics. We gathered American women leaders’ speeches from the Iowa State University Archives of Women’s Political Communication. Using an automated content analysis, we developed a norming group exclusively for American female politicians in national politics. Whereas our findings indicate noticeable differences and suggest similarities with existing reference groups, we aspire to initiate a conversation and hope that more data will follow and shed more light on women leaders. This reference group can serve as a crucial tool in providing contextualized political-personality profiles of American women leaders and also provide an illustrative example to bridge leadership and gender studies in advancing the study of women leaders in the United States (and beyond).",

          "title": "The Albatross: Student Loan Debt and Support for Joe Biden in the 2024 Election",
          "authors": "William Harrison, Jacob Smith",
          "abstract": "Student debt heavily shapes the life decisions and outlook of those living with it. This article examines the relationship between undergraduates’ views of President Joe Biden’s actions on student debt and their support for him in the 2024 election prior to his dropping out of the race. Using a representative survey from a large private university in the Northeast, we assess how student views of Biden’s handling of student loan relief correlated with voting intentions among registered student voters. Our analysis reveals that students who believed the Biden administration adequately addressed student debt were significantly more likely to support him compared to those who believed he had done too little. Additionally, our findings suggest that whereas increased student debt relief could have bolstered Biden’s support among liberal and very liberal students, its impact on moderate and conservative students was more limited. This study highlights the electoral implications of student debt relief policies, particularly in shaping young voters’ preferences, and it underscores the potential for targeted economic benefits to influence voter behavior in a highly polarized political environment.",

          "authors": "Abigail A. Matthews, Rachael K. Hinkle",
          "abstract": "Judges, like all of us, possess multiple intersecting identities. Drawing on social identity theory, we examine how gender, race, and partisanship jointly influence judicial citation practices. We hypothesize that in-group favoritism motivates judges to preferentially cite peers with whom they share salient identities, and that this effect intensifies as the number of shared identities increases. Using an extensive dataset of discretionary citations from search and seizure cases between 2000 and 2010, we find that sharing a single identity yields no significant effect. However, as the number of shared identities increases, so does the probability of citation. Judges who share race, gender, and partisanship exhibit a 25% higher probability of citation relative to those with no shared identity. These findings highlight the cumulative impact of intersecting identities on judicial influence and behavior, emphasizing that diversity is critical for the development of legal precedent and the law.",
