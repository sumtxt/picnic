          "authors": "Coskun Saglik",
          "abstract": "Migration simultaneously addresses labor shortages and fuels perceptions of social threat, often framed negatively in political and public discourse. This study examines the reactions of American and German YouTube users to issues of migration and immigration by focusing on user comments through thematic and discourse analysis. The thematic analysis identified five dominant themes in both contexts: security concerns, economic impacts, cultural and identity issues, political blame or radicalization, and humanitarian perspectives. While American users emphasized border security, illegal migration, labor market competition, and leader-centered blame, German users focused on systemic crises, welfare debates, and radical political solutions. Discourse analysis revealed a polarized “us versus them” rhetoric in both countries. American comments frequently employed metaphors of illegality, invasion, and economic burden, often tied to partisan blame and leader references (e.g., Trump, Biden). German discourse more strongly associated migration with terrorism, crime, and loss of state control, often echoing far-right rhetoric and showing higher prevalence of hate speech. Overall, while both societies share concerns over security, economy, and identity, their discursive constructions differ. The U.S. discourse frames migration as an immediate and partisan issue, whereas German discourse positions it as a systemic crisis and cultural conflict. These findings highlight how digital public spheres reproduce national anxieties, shaping migration debates as struggles over identity, sovereignty, and social order.",

          "authors": "Sushil Sharma, Bhimsen Devkota, Devaraj Acharya, Surendra Giri",
          "abstract": "This study explores the academic performance of left-behind children (LBC) and non-left-behind children (NLBC) along with their mutual comparison. Employing a cross-sectional survey method, data were gathered from grade five students of the Kaski District of Nepal through cluster sampling techniques encompassing all five local bodies as a cluster. The sample comprised 784 children representing 43 schools including 392 from LBC and an equal number from NLBC. The schools were selected through systematic random sampling (SRS) with children further selected through probability proportionate sample to size (PPS). The application of the Mann–Whitney U test revealed minute differentials in academic performance across subjects such as Social Studies, Science, English, Mathematics and overall between LBC and NLBC. These variances, quantified through effect sizes (r) below the threshold of 0.1, denote a state of nominal effects. Moreover, an exploration of parental migration scenarios encompassing both parents on migration, father on migration, and mother on migration uncovered minor disparities in academic performance, with effect sizes signalling practical insignificance. This study places a prominent emphasis on the fundamental role of parental support and active involvement in shaping academic accomplishments, presenting the perspective that both LBC and NLBC can attain academic excellence when nurtured appropriately. In its broader implications, this research informs targeted intervention strategies and support frameworks, predicting a holistic development pathway and seamless integration of these children within the evolving educational landscape of Nepal.",

          "authors": "Myung Ah Son, Jiwon Yun",
          "abstract": "What does it mean to remit to a country you would never return to? This article examines remittance practices of North Korean defectors in South Korea, who, despite being isolated from their country of origin, continue to remit. We conceptualize North Korean defectors as isolated migrants who have extremely low possibilities of visiting or returning home and face great difficulties when communicating with their family members. Inspired by scholarship that examines the social meaning of remittances for the migrants, we argue that the isolation from the country of origin has the effect of highlighting the affective and moral dimensions of remittances for the individual migrants. Through in-depth interviews with 24 defectors in South Korea, we illustrate how remittances serve as retainers of relationship, allowing defectors to maintain family ties. Remitting also helps to resolve the feeling of “sin” that comes with leaving their family in North Korea. These meanings evolve into affective and moral pressures for North Korean defectors, who respond by prioritizing short-term incomes for remittances over long-term investments to aid their resettlement in South Korea.",

          "authors": "Kevin J. A. Thomas, Ricardo Henrique Lowe",
          "abstract": "This study uses data from the US Department of State and other sources to examine inequalities in the use of visas to regulate population mobility to the United States. The results showed that between 2006 and 2021, visitor visa rejection rates were higher for applications submitted in the Global South than in the Global North. For example, the top 15 countries with the lowest rejection rates were mostly wealthy states in the Middle East and Europe. On the contrary, two-thirds of the top 15 countries with the highest rejection rates were in Africa. Results from mixed-effects regression models indicated that visa rejection rates in Africa were more than double those in Europe. These differences were not explained by disparities in economic, demographic, and social factors. Sensitivity tests further suggested that regional disparities were not explained by higher visa overstay rates in non-European than in European countries. Additionally, the results showed that there were differential patterns of responses to visa approvals across regions. In Africa, increases in visa approvals were followed by increases in visa rejections the following year. However, increases in visa approvals elsewhere, especially in Europe, were followed by decreases in visa rejection s. Overall, the study demonstrates that visas regulate migration in ways that make it more difficult for people in the Global South than the Global North to enjoy the benefits associated with travelling to the United States. Moreover, they suggest that this disparity cannot be explained by country-level variations in overstay rates and other socioeconomic factors.",

          "authors": "Amanda Bisong",
          "abstract": "This commentary explores the complex and often overlooked consequences of the European Union's (EU) migration externalization agenda, both within the EU and in its cooperation with third countries. Externalization is frequently presented as a pragmatic tool to manage migration and alleviate pressure on the EU's internal systems. However, it has introduced ripple effects within the EU, manifesting in policy fragmentation, legal tensions, institutional overstretch, and political contestation. The commentary reflects on six articles comprising the special issue on “The rippling effects of European migration governance in Africa. The articles analyze how externalization policies reshape power relations, reinforce authoritarian practices, and intersect with historical tensions, particularly in border regions, contributing to unintended consequences on the ground. The commentary also reflects critically on the broader research landscape, highlighting the urgent need for more inclusive and collaborative knowledge production. It argues that current research structures limit equitable partnerships and the ability to generate grounded, context-sensitive insights. In light of shifting geopolitical dynamics and growing influence of alternative global actors, the article calls for future research that interrogates the normative and institutional transformations driven by externalization.",

          "authors": "Alina Satmari, Remus Crețan, Denisa‐Maria Birău",
          "abstract": "Recent studies on postsocialist postmemory have underscored the importance of understanding how this form of memory operates among younger generations. This study analyzes the manifestation of postmemory and the associated emotional responses to the 1989 Romanian Revolution among young people in Timișoara, the city where the uprising began. Drawing on the frameworks of lieu de mémoire and collective memory, the research explores how this historical event, which involves affective spaces and transmitted narratives, is internalized by Generations Y and Z. We employed two brief Q‐surveys conducted during the Revolution's commemorative periods in 2019 and 2024, with emotions analyzed using an adapted version of Plutchik's Wheel and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). The findings indicate that youth postmemory is characterized by symbolic empathy, with dominant emotions being sadness, solidarity, and gratitude. While the 2019 analysis found no significant overall emotional differences between Generations Y and Z, the 2024 model for Generation Z revealed that family involvement significantly inhibited anger, decreasing the likelihood of reporting it. These results confirm that memory experience is stratified by contextual and familial factors and provide a novel generational comparison of postmemory emotions concerning the 1989 Revolution. The study underscores the necessity of continuous monitoring to prevent the deterioration of this crucial collective memory. The findings demonstrate that postmemory is an inherited coping strategy that facilitates Generation Z's conscious and functional engagement with a complex historical legacy, rather than succumbing to passive emotional burdens.",

          "abstract": "This article examines return plans of forcibly displaced persons from Ukraine in Czechia, which has one of the highest relative shares of Ukrainian refugees in population. It draws on data from two rounds of cross‐sectional surveys conducted in 2022 ( N = 1037) and 2023 ( N = 350), including a panel subsample ( N = 116). Using exploratory network analysis and structural equation modelling informed by the theory of planned behaviour, the study captures the complexity of drivers and mechanisms underlying refugees' decision‐making. Empirically, it moves beyond the predominantly descriptive literature on Ukrainian refugees' return plans. Theoretically, it advances understanding of how (forced) migration aspirations are formed. Findings challenge the assumption that return plans decline naturally with time and integration. Instead, shifts in perceived control over return drive individual‐level changes over time, while social norms, particularly family pressures, strongly influence cross‐sectional variations. These psychosocial drivers and return plans are shaped more by attachment to Ukraine (emotional, social, identity‐related and material) than by integration levels or hardships in Czechia, including policy restrictions on refugees' well‐being. Our findings support the need for balanced return policies that acknowledge social ties, enhance perceptions of return feasibility and offer flexible pathways to prevent return from being seen as irreversible.",

          "abstract": "Amid rapid urban transformation across the Global South, gentrification is widely understood as a product of large‐scale urban regeneration jointly driven by state and market forces. This study employs a big data‐integrated approach to empirically confirm that urban regeneration in Beijing significantly contributes to gentrification, yet the impacts vary notably across different implementing entities. Projects implemented by governments and local government financing platforms (LGFPs) generally show minimal gentrification effects, suggesting stronger protection of public interests in urban regeneration. In contrast, market‐oriented projects lack effective mechanisms to achieve equity goals. Regeneration‐induced gentrification exhibits a concentric spatial pattern, with its impacts being stronger within the Sixth Ring Road than in peripheral suburban areas. However, within the innermost core area (within the Third Ring Road), urban regeneration tends to suppress gentrification, reflecting the government's policy orientation and the involvement of public capital in promoting public welfare and reducing population density in the city's core. This study reveals the differentiated socio‐spatial impacts of urban regeneration under distinct implementation approaches, offering new empirical evidence and perspectives for understanding gentrification in the context of the Global South.",

          "abstract": "Population loss is one of the main challenges facing smaller island communities in Europe. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of population challenges in two island communities: one in Croatia and one in Norway. These two island communities have been struggling with slow, but very long‐term population decline. They have also both experienced an economic upswing in recent decades, resulting in fairly large numbers of labour immigrants coming to the islands. However, the large‐scale labour immigration resulted in differing long‐term outcomes. The island community in Norway has been able to reverse the population decline by retaining labour immigrants, while the Croatian one has not been able to do so. We provide explanations for the diverging outcomes, focusing on the nature of employment possibilities, the housing market, and immigrants' social networks. The findings are relevant to broader discussions on the role of immigration in demographic revival, as well as the potentials and limitations of labour and lifestyle migration for population increase on small islands.",

          "authors": "Sezen Savran Penbecioglu",
          "abstract": "This article examines the lifestyles of people who have migrated from Türkiye's major metropolitan centres to Muğla province, analysing how their social, economic and spatial conditions change as a result of relocation. Drawing on semi‐structured interviews with 30 migrants, the analysis traces three interconnected phases of migration: the decision to relocate and adaptation, the adjustment to everyday life in the new setting, and the efforts to establish spatial permanence. Migration was found to be motivated by dissatisfaction with metropolitan life, including the increasing densities, socially disconnected lifestyles, long and exhausting commutes, and limited access to open spaces. Relocation decisions were noted to be driven by pre‐migration imaginaries centred on autonomy and proximity to nature, shaping both the expectations and post‐migration practices of the respondents. Many of the respondents reported improvements in time management, mobility and social interactions, as well as easier and more frequent engagement with natural environments. Yet these positive experiences were offset by such challenges as rising housing costs, limited infrastructure, seasonal fluctuations and uneven integration. Efforts to attain spatial permanence were therefore marked by uncertainty. Only a few of the respondents were actively considering moving again, while many remained undecided, suggesting that permanence is conditional rather than assured. This ambivalence intersects with a broader paradox: as the appeal of nature‐oriented lifestyles grows, former desirable rural destinations begin to experience densification and urbanisation. Overall, the study conceptualises lifestyle migration as a negotiated temporal process that reshapes individual trajectories and rural geographies in Türkiye.",

          "abstract": "With the rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICTs), there has been a growing interest in the effect of the internet on internal migration. This study contributes to the emerging literature by exploring the relationship between internet use and internal migration at different spatial scales in contemporary China. Using longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we find that internet use facilitates long‐distance inter‐provincial migration, a result robust to individual fixed effects and instrumental variable estimations. In contrast, no significant effect is observed for short‐distance inter‐county migration. Further analyses show that the duration of internet use has a positive non‐linear effect on inter‐provincial migration with diminishing marginal effects. Moreover, the impact of different online activities is also heterogeneous: frequent engagement in socializing and entertainment activities significantly facilitates inter‐provincial migration, while study, work, and e‐transaction activities show no significant impact. Consistent with this, latent class analysis (LCA) of respondents’ internet use behaviors indicates that the latent class, “work users”, shows no significant difference from non‐internet users on migration, whereas “hyper‐users”, “leisure users”, and “inactive‐users” exhibit a significantly higher likelihood of migrating. Finally, the analysis of potential channels elucidates how internet use influences migration through information acquisition and the strengthening of family ties. This study contributes to the growing body of literature by providing new insights into the role of internet use and technology in general in internal migration from a micro‐level perspective.",
