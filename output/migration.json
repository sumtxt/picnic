          "authors": "Matthew Light, Leonid Kosals",
          "abstract": "The former Soviet Union's restrictions on citizens' foreign travel or emigration were notoriously draconian. Yet what replaced them in the fifteen independent states of the post‐Soviet region has not been well analysed. Outside the Baltic republics, the monolithic and prohibitive policies of the Soviet past have given way to a patchwork of restrictions with more complex motivations reflecting the diversity of contemporary Eurasian states. However, while many more people in the region can travel abroad when they wish, exit remains a privilege, rather than an enforceable right. Post‐Soviet states' exit policies increasingly resemble those in other primarily authoritarian contexts around the world, albeit somewhat marked by Eurasian regimes' high levels of both coercive capacity and informality and the weakness of labour and the left. We conclude that the USSR's fixation on preventing exit was historically exceptional as a policy on foreign travel, rather than paradigmatic, and severely limited the regime's own migration policy options. In a paradox, the relaxation of blanket prohibitions has only increased the post‐Soviet state's freedom to tailor restrictions on exit to its interests far more effectively than the USSR ever could.",

          "authors": "Roderick Galam",
          "abstract": "Over a 15‐year period beginning in 2006, the European Commission (EC), through the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), inspected Philippine compliance to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), which governs globally the training, certification, and watchkeeping of seafarers. This article examines the EC as a regulatory actor, approaching it through the lens of regulatory intermediation. Drawing on interviews and analysis of documents, reports, and secondary literature, it identifies a confluence of interests among the regulator, intermediary, and target as a vitally important element that led to an outcome beneficial to all but especially the EU and the Philippines. The Philippines implemented the most consequential reforms ever undertaken in its maritime administration and education infrastructure, resulting in the EC's continued recognition of the certificates of Filipino seafarers that guaranteed their continued employment on European Union (EU)‐flagged ships.",

          "title": "The Social Psychology of Kafala: Structural Inequities, Intersectional Harms and Host Society Narratives in Lebanon",
          "authors": "Rhea Al Riachi, Jasmin Lilian Diab",
          "abstract": "This study explored the mental distress experienced by migrant domestic workers (MDWs) in Lebanon under the Kafala (sponsorship) system, adopting a dual lens that considers both workers' lived realities and the host society's social‐psychological processes. Drawing on intersectionality and social psychology, the analysis examines how intersecting forms of discrimination, rooted in race, gender, class and legal status, combine with crisis contexts, such as Lebanon's economic collapse and the Beirut port explosion, to deepen psychological harm. The study interrogated the cultural narratives, moral hierarchies and ingroup/outgroup dynamics that normalise or obscure these conditions, situating the Lebanese Kafala regime within broader regional labour migration systems. Findings reveal a cyclical dynamic in which legal precarity, racialised labour hierarchies and societal attitudes reinforce both structural abuse and social invisibility. While MDWs mobilise coping strategies including solidarity networks, digital mobilisation, religious practices and community‐based initiatives, these remain constrained by systemic exclusion from national services and persistent stigma. The study argued that meaningful reform requires dismantling both the legal architecture of Kafala and the social‐psychological mechanisms that sustain it, coupling structural change with culturally responsive psychosocial interventions and regional labour governance reforms.",

          "title": "Reintegration of War‐Fleeing Ukrainians After Their Return to Ukraine",
          "authors": "Jussi S. Jauhiainen",
          "abstract": "This article examines the reintegration experiences of Ukrainians who fled the country to the European Union (EU) following Russia's 2022 invasion and subsequently returned while the country was still at war. Employing a mixed‐methods approach—including surveys, semi‐structured interviews and field observations in Ukraine—the study focuses on the experiences of returnees. By 2025, over 1.2 million Ukrainians had returned from abroad, predominantly women and children from the EU but also from other countries. Return trajectories varied: some returned shortly after displacement, motivated by a strong sense of belonging and sustained ties to Ukraine, while others remained abroad longer and encountered more complex reintegration processes. Most returnees resettled in their original regions, and many found employment quickly amid wartime labour shortages. Although patriotic sentiment intensified during displacement, trust in Ukrainian public institutions remained low. Return was often marked by a decline in life satisfaction and mental health, underlining the psychological challenges of reintegration under war conditions. The study highlights the urgent need for evidence‐based reintegration policies that respond to returnees' lived realities that are crucial for Ukraine's recovery, resilience and social cohesion.",

          "authors": "Karen Anne S. Liao, Marta Bivand Erdal",
          "abstract": "Research on spatial and social mobility intersections often foregrounds the role of migration in struggles for improved socioeconomic positions. Inspired by im/mobility scholarship and growing interest in voluntary immobility, this article considers the role of staying in the interactions between migration and upward social mobility. Drawing on 106 family history interviews with middle-class urban residents in Hanoi, Manila, Karachi, and Mumbai, we develop “comfortable immobility” as an analytical window to ask: How do spatial and social immobility matter for understanding this relationship? We analyze comfortable immobility as an active phase in migration and social mobility processes across three interrelated dimensions. First, as a subjective, embodied experience, participants’ descriptions of being and becoming comfortably middle-class reflect a voluntary immobility characterized by geographical and socioeconomic stasis, emerging as a social mobility outcome. Second, comfortable immobility is relationally produced as family members’ intertwined histories of moving and staying, and their interdependent relations, shape upward social mobility trajectories. Third, we examine how comfortable immobility builds on family histories while becoming a social mobility strategy shaping family futures, enabling aspirations and possibilities for moving and staying. Our analysis illuminates how staying may matter both as an outcome and as a strategy in urban middle-class families’ social mobility trajectories, thus contributing to rebalancing attention toward moving and staying in studies of the social-spatial mobility nexus. The article suggests that “comfortable immobility” speaks to debates on social change from varying Global South vantage points, while engaging with immobility conceptualization in migration studies more generally.",

          "authors": "Nahyun Han, Denis Kim",
          "abstract": "This article examines the contentious representation of Yemeni refugees in South Korea to demonstrate that it reflects racialization rather than straightforward Islamophobia. It argues that the relationship between religion and racialization is complex and nonlinear, challenging conventional assumptions that treat religion as a direct or uniform basis for racialization. Drawing on the framework of compressed modernity, the study shows how Korea’s unique socio-religious context challenges linear Western models of secularization and calls for a rethinking of how religion helps constitute racial categories. Religion-based actors in Korea simultaneously function as both racializers and anti-racializers, depending on how their identity has been shaped differently by Korean historical trends and multiple religious traditions. These findings urge reconsideration of religious neutrality in global refugee regimes and call for context-sensitive approaches that recognize religion’s role in both racializing and anti-racializing refugees as observed in Korea’s process of compressed modernity.",
