          "title": "From social to intangible remittances: toward a comprehensive framework of remittances",
          "authors": "Janine Isabelle Pinkow-Läpple, Judith Möllers",
          "abstract": "Levitt’s ground-breaking concept of social remittances has inspired many empirical studies in migration research, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. Most fundamentally, the interpretations of what social remittances are have multiplied, posing the risk of reducing the term to little more than a catchphrase. To address this issue, this paper undertakes a systematic review of various conceptualisations of social remittances. We identify four primary areas of divergence within the existing literature on social remittances: the scope of the concept, i.e. the delineation of its boundaries, the underlying process of how social remittances are acquired and transferred, the spatial dimension of these transfers, particularly their direction, and the classification of subtypes of social remittances. Taking this as our starting point, we propose advancing Levitt’s original concept towards what we will term intangible remittances. Our advanced concept accounts for the multidimensionality of intangible remittances and provides essential clarifications in terms of delineation and terminology. Additionally, we put forward a fine-grained typology of different subtypes of intangible remittances, categorising them based on their content (that might be economic, environmental, political, or socio-cultural) and form (knowledge, normative structures, or practices). In summary, we provide a comprehensive framework of intangible remittances that not only integrates other emerging concepts, such as political remittances but also seamlessly aligns with the broader superordinate concept of remittances.",

          "abstract": "Migrant deservingness, the criteria by which host populations assess migrants' entitlement to rights, resources and social acceptance, plays a critical role in shaping public opinion on immigration. Drawing on the CARIN framework, this study examines Turkish citizens' attitudes towards immigration through latent profile analysis on 788 participants (52% female, M age = 34.1 SD = 13.6). The analysis identified four attitudinal profiles: Pragmatic Conditionalists, Humanitarians, Cultural Protectionists, and Exclusionists, each reflecting varying levels of support for or opposition to migrants based on perceived deservingness. Further analyses revealed significant differences across profiles in nationalism, religiosity, political ideology, perceived realistic and symbolic threats, social distance, contact quality and affective responses towards migrants. Exclusionists exhibited the highest perceived threats, social distance, and nationalism, whereas Humanitarians displayed the most inclusive attitudes. The findings contribute to immigration attitude research by clarifying how host populations categorise migrants, influencing social cohesion and policy.",

          "abstract": "Guestworker schemes have increased in geographical extent and numerical importance in the twenty‐first century. In the southern hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand developed schemes primarily drawing workers from small Pacific island states to meet horticultural needs. Proponents of guestwork pointed to a triple win for farmers, workers and source countries, couched in economic terms. In small Pacific states, such economic gains were less evident at workers' household level, while growing numbers of participants created increased social problems for workers' households and source countries, evident especially during and after the COVID‐19 pandemic. Increased demand for workers in destination states and new geopolitical tensions in the region enabled Pacific states to demand structural changes to the schemes that would remedy social costs. However, Antipodean schemes retained the structural problems of guestworker schemes elsewhere, but emphasised by skill losses, a permanently temporary precariat, and impacts affecting the entirety of small states that challenge the simplicity and ubiquity of ‘Triple win’ discourses.",

          "abstract": "This study used an interpretive research method to assess the effectiveness of policy reforms in ensuring safe migrant labour from Indonesia, a major sender of low‐skilled workers. The findings indicate that inadequate implementation infrastructure can exacerbate human rights abuses rather than prevent them. While the central government emphasises official protection mechanisms, local governments lack physical and human resources for effective implementation. Furthermore, structural dependence on market‐savvy sending agencies has emerged. The study suggests that Indonesia's labour migration policy needs to shift from a framework of detailed regulations to a flexible mechanism more in line with implementation capacity and market realities and recommends the establishment of public support centres, the standardisation of cost structures, the expansion of skills certification systems, and the strengthening of public‐private partnerships.",

          "authors": "Ilka Vari‐Lavoisier",
          "abstract": "Most immigrants have entered the UK as students in the last decades—and student mobility is on the rise worldwide. Is student mobility inherently distinct and different from other sources of migration? Currently, the literature on student mobility remains largely disconnected from core migration studies. To inform both scholarly and policy debates, this paper examines the respective contributions of scholarship and self‐funded students to overall migration to the UK, both in the short and long term. Utilising comprehensive administrative data, including an exclusive panel dataset obtained from UK authorities, the author shows that (1) self‐funded students have become a significant source of immigration into the UK; (2) the majority of international students leave within 6 years, but a fifth stay in the UK for more than 10 years; (3) stay rates vary by country of origin and source of funding, with a higher proportion of self‐funded students from poorer countries staying in the UK for 10 years or more, as compared to scholarship students or students from richer countries who are more likely to leave. In other words, while student migration has outnumbered other work or family migration in the last decade, it remains mostly temporary. Only 2% of former international students transition to citizenship within 10 years. Most students leave the UK, potentially contributing to the circulation of knowledge and knowhow across borders, as well as fostering valuable transnational ties.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of wage inequality among immigrants in the United States, a topic often overshadowed by discussions on the effects of immigration on native workers. Utilizing a unique dataset specifically created for this research, we calculate wage inequality using the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index, offering a nuanced analysis of trends across education levels, industries, and immigration policies. The findings reveal a sharp rise in wage inequality among immigrants post-2013, surpassing overall wage inequality in the United States for the first time in 2023. High-skilled sectors, particularly IT, demonstrate a stabilizing effect on wage disparity, while low-skilled immigrants face growing wage gaps exacerbated by stringent visa policies and economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our econometric analysis highlights the dual role of minimum wage policies, which increase wage inequality in the short term but reduce it over the long run. This study emphasizes the need for inclusive immigration policies that address within-group disparities and enhance equity in the labor market.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the political participation of undocumented Mexican immigrants residing in the United States in Mexican external voting. As international mobility of people has increased globally, scholarly attention has grown concerning how overseas citizens engage in electoral processes in their countries of origin. However, previous studies based on traditional survey methods may have yielded biased results due to the underrepresentation of undocumented immigrants, who are less likely to enroll in survey company panels due to concerns about the potential compromise of their identities. To include this hard-to-reach population and conduct representative sampling, our research employs a method called respondent-driven sampling (RDS), which permits the surveying of a population devoid of a sampling frame. Our analysis of the Mexican case demonstrates that a lack of electoral information, lower levels of education, and heightened distrust of the Mexican government are associated with diminished electoral participation.",

          "authors": "Frans van Poppel, Peter Ekamper, Lenny Stoeldraijer",
          "abstract": "Various areas around the world have been identified as areas with significantly higher proportions of centenarians than elsewhere. These so‐called ‘blue zones’ are assumed only to be found in geographically and/or historically isolated regions with more traditional lifestyles. Our objective is to find out whether areas with exceptional high numbers of centenarians can be found in the Netherlands. We use a long historical perspective analysing Dutch birth cohorts 1812–1923. We compiled a unique database of all centenarians (7074 men and 29,144 women), who died between 1912 and 2023 or were still alive in 2024. We examine long‐term national trends using the extreme longevity index (ELI). We use spatial clustering techniques to examine regional differences. We assess to what extent place of birth is indicative of the places where centenarians have spent their life. We investigate the relationship between ELI and municipal characteristics using spatial autoregressive models. From around birth cohort 1875 onwards ELI strongly increased up to 164 (male) and 813 (female) centenarians per 100,000 births for birth cohorts 1890–1923. High ELI clusters are found in the rural more isolated southwest and northeast, but also in the urbanised west of the country. At the municipal level both the proportion of Catholics and infant mortality were negatively related with ELI. The proportion of workers in agriculture was positively related with ELI. The effects became stronger over time.",

          "authors": "Nils Witte, Floris Peters",
          "abstract": "In the growing body of research on immigrant naturalisation, migrants from high income countries have received scant attention in their own right because of their relatively low baseline citizenship acquisition rates. Established theories predominantly explain why they would not naturalise, yet in absolute terms, many do. To better understand those exceptional cases, this article focuses specially on determinants of naturalisation of migrants from high income countries, relying on a unique probability‐based survey of German emigrants augmented with country‐level information from GLOBALCIT and the V‐Dem project ( N = 1876). In line with the notion that their original citizenship provides substantial mobility rights, including the opportunity to return to a stable, wealthy country, dual citizenship toleration is a strong predictor of their naturalisation intentions. Because the instrumental value of an additional citizenship is so low for migrants from high income countries, subjective aspects like emotional attachment to the host country and emotional detachment from the origin country matter as well. Finally, interest in host country politics and elements of participatory democracy in host countries are also associated with naturalisation intentions.",

The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) has been a key framework for understanding these shifts, with alternative theories focusing on economic, cultural, and gender‐related factors. Despite extensive research, the geographical dimension of these changes remains underexplored, in particular a detailed spatio‐temporal analysis of the determinants of their spatial dynamics from their onset. This study fills this gap by examining the spatial dynamics of nonmarital births in Belgium over the last 50 years at the municipal level and by tracing the evolution of key explanatory variables. Using spatial modelling, we find a significant spatial diffusion effect, i.e. that nonmarital birth rates in a municipality are influenced by rates in neighbouring municipalities from previous periods. This finding highlights the importance of geographical proximity as a key determinant of family change, alongside socioeconomic factors. In addition, the study identifies the factors driving these spatial dynamics, quantifies their relative impact, and systematically ranks them across time. It suggests that different theoretical frameworks are relevant to explain the different stages of the diffusion process. Our findings emphasize the need to integrate multiple theoretical perspectives to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the family changes.",
