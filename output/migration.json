          "authors": "Cathy Conrad Suso",
          "abstract": "This paper views migration management campaigns through the lens of involuntary immobility and containment development, which aim to geographically localise Gambian desires and imaginations, to the extent that they are being subjected to border controls that discriminate and dehumanise irregular migrants. Migration Information Campaigns (MICs) advocate a sedentary bias that positions Gambian migrants with the injustice of migration departheid, whereby Western states intentionally implement a racialized mobility regime. I present the results of ethnographic field work undertaken in The Gambia, West Africa during the period 2018 through 2022. Border externalisation measures in all their forms are having dire consequences for the youth of the Gambia. So‐called development is cloaked in containment development initiatives, which are benefiting few and damaging to many. MICs have been documented to be ineffective, and the respondents in this study say the same. Expanding beyond their ineffectiveness, however, is the perpetuation of global mobility injustice, which hasn't clearly been articulated in the literature. Against the backdrop of Gambians pleading for more open visa acquisition, the EU is far more likely to spend their time and money working on campaigns to do just the opposite: keep Gambians at home. Gambian youth are making choices to take dangerous routes to Europe and other international destinations because visas are elusive and their economic prospects at home remain bleak. The discrepancy between MICs and the wishes of Gambian youth to migrate and the associated injustice they feel is presented. This work therefore contributes to the recent and growing literature on migration departheid and mobility justice.",

          "title": "Unlocking the Potential of Multicultural Migrants: Cultural Brokering Scale Development and Validation",
          "authors": "Davina Vora, Stacey R Fitzsimmons, David C Thomas",
          "abstract": "Migrant employees have knowledge, skills, and abilities that may not be recognized by organizations or countries. Typically, they have knowledge of, identification with, and internalization of more than one culture. This allows them to support international knowledge flows and facilitate intercultural social networks by engaging in cultural brokering — the act of facilitating interactions across cultures. In a series of four studies employing qualitative and quantitative methods, we developed and validated a context-general assessment of cultural brokering. The result is a scale assessing the frequency of five cultural brokering behaviors: interpreting culturally based behavior, teaching others about a cultural group, mediating between cultures, advocating for a cultural group, and advising people across cultures. Since this scale is not limited by organizational context, it can be used to assess and leverage cultural brokering across a wide range of settings that would benefit from cultural brokering, including multinational enterprises (MNEs), international nongovernmental organization (NGOs), and intergovernmental associations.",

          "title": "Africa's Migration Transition: A Long-Run Historical Perspective",
          "authors": "Michiel de Haas, Ewout Frankema",
          "abstract": "Popular and political concerns about accelerating migration from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are often framed through migration transition theory, which posits that as poor regions develop, migration rates first rise and later decline after surpassing a certain development threshold. SSA is widely viewed by scholars, pundits, and policymakers as the region where migration rates have only just begun to climb the upward slope. Adopting a long-run historical perspective, we revise this image in three respects. First, although migration out of SSA has recently increased, Africans overall have not become more migratory since colonial times. The share of Africans living abroad was high in the 1960s, reflecting the legacy of large-scale interterritorial migration during the colonial era. Second, voluntary mass migration within Africa expanded rapidly in an era that is not typically regarded as “developmental,” after the abolition of slavery in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Large numbers of voluntary migrants, often extremely poor by historical standards, moved toward zones of cash-crop production and mining, and later increasingly to urban destinations. Third, we argue that the recent surge in extracontinental migration reflects a shift in destinations within a much longer migration transition rather than its early stage. This shift was driven by narrowing spatial opportunity gaps within Africa, growing hostility to intra-African migration in the context of nation building, and the simultaneous expansion of capabilities and opportunities for migration beyond the continent.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how intersectional ideologies and experiences of marginalization affect the extent to which African Americans support or oppose the marginalization of LGBTQ+ communities. We posit that awareness of the race-gender positionality of African American women, as well as the unique positionalities of other marginalized African American subgroups, is critical to understanding the conditions under which Black Americans embrace LGBTQ+ rights and communities. Using the Black respondent subsample of the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Study, we test the extent to which intersectional theories explain African American cross-group consciousness with LGBTQ+ persons and support for LGBTQ+ rights and communities. In doing so, we distinguish multiple mechanisms through which identity intersections affect African American 1 political attitudes, and we find that, though intersecting marginalized identities can be critical to fomenting African Americans’ support for the rights and concerns of LGBTQ+ communities, not all intersections lead to a more inclusive Black politics.",

          "abstract": "This study examines intergroup bias among members of the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland—a high-status ethnolinguistic minority group. Drawing on social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, the study explores ingroup favoritism and identifies key predictors of individual-level bias. Using survey data from 1,096 Swedish-speaking Finns, the study uses trait-based evaluations of both ingroup and outgroup members. Results show that intergroup bias is prevalent, particularly in the form of ingroup favoritism for positive traits. Analyses reveal that strong ethnolinguistic identity and perceived intergroup threat significantly predict higher levels of bias, while language identity, Finnish language proficiency, and intergroup contact show no consistent relationships. These findings suggest that even in socially stable and egalitarian contexts, perceived threats to group identity can sustain intergroup bias.",

BEPS draws on Black political thought to challenge dominant epistemologies that prioritize disembodied rationality and abstract ideological commitments over lived, felt, and corporeal political experiences. Rather than treating the body as an inert vessel or secondary site of politics, BEPS argues that the body is central to the ways Black people negotiate, contest, and reconstitute power in lived political contexts.",

Based on fieldwork with two LGBTIQ+ organizations and in-depth conversations with trans applicants in Belgium, this article demonstrates the need for a grounded, intersectional understanding of their gender identity, gender expression, and migration status. The applicants’ encounters with a variety of discourses and practices expand their understanding of transness as a category of protection and vulnerability. In addition, the applicants’ transness constantly intersects with their refugeeness, forcing them to navigate new isolations and discriminations instead of enjoying the freedom they expected to find. This article not only shows how interconnected and fluid transness and refugeeness are, but how this affects the lived experiences of trans refugees, and how they strategically learn to adapt their self-identification and -presentation to the gendered, racialized, and classed structures of their country of arrival.",

          "title": "Navigating the Belt and Road, and Beyond: Education‐Migration and Aspirational Pathways Among Internationally Mobile Chinese Young People in Southeast Asia",
          "authors": "Kris Hyesoo Lee, Yi′En Cheng, Sivarin Lertpusit, Yun Ge, Brenda S. A. Yeoh, Kong Chong Ho",
          "abstract": "Chinese student mobilities within Asia have expanded significantly amid the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and shifting geopolitical conditions. This paper examines Chinese youth studying in two prominent Southeast Asian destinations—Thailand and Singapore—to understand how their aspirations intersect with macro‐structural forces to shape differentiated mobility pathways. Drawing on interviews with 59 participants, we explore three interrelated themes: (1) how geopolitical and geoeconomic developments reconfigure opportunity structures for Chinese youth; (2) how students navigate enduring hierarchies within the regional and global landscapes of higher education; and (3) how transregional education spaces reshape future‐making projects under conditions of heightened uncertainty. Our findings reveal that in Thailand, the BRI has widened access to regional education‐migration opportunities for Chinese youth by expanding institutional linkages and legitimising alternative mobility routes. In contrast, Chinese students in Singapore rarely frame their educational choices through the BRI, instead mobilising other forms of capital within established hierarchies of international education. Despite the emergence of diversified intra‐Asian pathways beyond traditional Western destinations, students' aspirations remain structured by stratified geographies of higher education and calibrated to broader geopolitical dynamics. By foregrounding the interplay between macro‐structural forces and individual mobility projects, this paper highlights how diversified yet hierarchical aspirational pathways are forged within an evolving transregional educational landscape.",

          "title": "Considering the Key Household Member: Migration as a Household Head's Livelihood Choice and Income Growth Trajectory in Rural China",
          "authors": "Yiqing Gan, Yuying Tong",
          "abstract": "The debate over whether migration serves as a viable livelihood strategy for enhancing rural household economic development has persisted for decades. Existing research is limited by three key shortcomings: neglecting the roles of key household members, oversimplifying the dichotomy between migrants and nonmigrants, and adopting a static view of household income without considering its growth trajectory. This study addresses these gaps by employing growth curve models and analyzing six waves of data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) spanning the period from 2010 to 2020. We examine how the livelihood choices of rural household heads—farming, local nonfarm work, and migration—affect household income growth trajectories. Our findings indicate that the livelihood choice of the household head is a significant predictor of household income growth. Although migrant‑headed households typically enjoy an economic advantage, the beneficial effects of migration for this depend on the household's life stage, with younger and female‑headed households and those undertaking short‑term migration experiencing more substantial gains. Extending the migration period has minimal effect on accelerating the rate​ of household income growth. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between migration and rural household economic well‐being in China, thereby advancing the literature on development and gender equity in migrant‐sending areas.",

          "title": "Widening Regional Economic Disparities and Fertility Decline in South Korea: A Cross‐Level Analysis",
          "authors": "Kyungjae Lee, Seongwoo Lee",
          "abstract": "Regional economic disparities and fertility decline have intensified concurrently in South Korea, yet few studies have directly examined their relationship. This study investigates how widening regional inequality, a spatial form of socioeconomic stratification, influences fertility outcomes by applying Yitzhaki's relative deprivation index. Using spatial panel models with two‐way fixed effects for 229 districts from 2015 to 2021 and multilevel models of married women aged 19 to 49 from the 2020 Population and Housing Census, the analyses consistently demonstrate negative associations between regional disparity and fertility. In the spatial panel analysis, growth in disparity reveals a significant negative effect on crude birth rates, while the multilevel models confirm that regions with sharper increases in inequality recorded fewer births per woman. These findings suggest a potential mechanism through which the demographic–economic paradox operates and provide empirical support for extending relative deprivation theory to the regional scale.",

          "title": "Camp Time: Heterochronies in ‘Other Spaces'",
          "authors": "Melissa Gatter",
          "abstract": "Contemporary global apartheid is built upon temporal discord, with refugee camps playing a central role. Yet camp studies have largely neglected the temporal dimensions of displacement, leading to reductive notions of time in the camp as a paradox of permanent temporariness. This article examines two types of 21st century campscapes based on ethnographic research in archetypal humanitarian‐run camps in Jordan and privatized city shelter camps in the US to illustrate the temporal work that camps do in caring for and controlling people on the move. Mapping camp timescapes through Foucault's heterochronies, it argues that camp time is not merely a protraction of temporariness but a collection of futureless temporalities not meant to converge with national time outside the heterotopia. This article contributes to critical camp studies an analytical framework of camp time that exposes an intentional wasting of camp residents' time in a global project of temporal Othering.",

          "authors": "Line Lindgaard Andersen, Can‐Seng Ooi, Merete Schmidt",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates the social dynamics of rural regions and how these dynamics link to efforts to attract and retain creative talent. Research on talent attraction and in particular retention of in‐migrated talent in peripheral regions is still limited. Based on a case study in the Cradle Coast region of Tasmania, Australia, we argue that, although local stakeholders are working towards attracting more creative talent, they are also reproducing dynamics that work against job creation and retention on various levels, such as promoting quietness or prioritising social embeddedness, and long‐term ties to the region. These dynamics are hard to address as they are tied up in social values and notions of what constitutes the good life in a rural setting.",
