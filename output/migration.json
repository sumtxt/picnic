          "title": "Analysis of unemployment hysteresis of country groups for migration policy: PANIC fourier evidence",
          "authors": "Ahmet Tayfur Akcan, İdris Yagmur, Murat Ergül, Ali Rauf Karataş",
          "abstract": "One of the most important reasons for international migration is unemployment, along with economic concerns. Domestic and international migration movements generally take place from regions with high unemployment to the regions where unemployment is low. Therefore, analyzing the labor market is important for predicting and directing migration movements. The World Bank grouping of countries includes 47 country groups according to their geographical and income status. In our study, the unemployment hysteresis of 48 groups, which includes the average of these 47 country groups and the world in general, has been analyzed. For the analysis of the unemployment hysteresis, six different variables were used: total unemployment rate, female unemployment rate, male unemployment rate, youth unemployment rate, youth female unemployment rate, and youth male unemployment rate. For analysis of unemployment hysteresis, the Fourier PANIC panel unit root test, which entered the literature in 2023, was used. Significant results were obtained for country groups. The results of the analysis show that the unemployment hysteresis is valid for total unemployment worldwide, while the natural rate hypothesis is prominent for youth and young males. While hysteresis is observed in total and male unemployment in low- and middle-income countries, the natural rate hypothesis is generally valid in high-income countries; however, hysteresis persists in female unemployment. Therefore, at the global level, encouraging controlled and need-driven migration movements from regions where the unemployment hysteresis is valid to regions where the natural rate hypothesis is valid, can contribute to reducing imbalances in labor markets. At the national level, selective labor transfer policies, taking into account labor market needs, can be implemented from regions with high unemployment hysteresis.",

          "authors": "Lorena Izaguirre, Tanja Bastia, Matthew Walsham, Pedro Pablo Cortés",
          "abstract": "While the integration of an intersectional perspective marks a significant advance in gender and migration literature over recent decades, this scholarship remains heavily dominated by studies focusing on South-North migration. Consequently, despite growing attention to gender within South-South migration from both researchers and policy-makers, key research areas applying an intersectional lens remain neglected. In this paper, we identify three such areas that remain significantly under-explored in South-South migration research: sexuality, disability, and ageing. We argue that migration scholarship in general, and gender and migration scholarship in particular, need to urgently move to encompass all types of migrations, including regional, South-South migration, as well as broaden the languages of the publications that are taken into account in the mainstream gender and migration literature. In this article, we put forward a framework for advancing the research agenda on intersectionality in South-South migration, one which departs from the common focus on English-speaking countries and publications. We take a first step towards implementing this approach by including publications in Spanish and Portuguese.",

          "authors": "Netta Moshe, Dan Miodownik, Shaul R. Shenhav",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the interactions of forced migrants with state actors in transit countries at critical decision nodal points (DNPs) along their journey—defined as turning points where migrants make decisions about resuming mobility or altering the course of their journey. Granted official legal power by the state, transit state actors operate on the ground in various ways using their power. Nevertheless, their roles in the decision-making as experienced by forced migrants have been studied very little. We examine the journey narratives of forced migrants originating from Eritrea and Sudan. We quantitatively identify and analyze spaces of mobility, immobility and DNPs, within their trajectories. The findings demonstrate that state actors in transit countries can serve as integral and concrete journey components that shape migration outcomes. The study concludes by presenting two insights into (i) the directionality of influence (enabling versus halting journey plans) and (ii) the encounter space (direct-official spaces versus indirect spaces).",

          "authors": "Ruth Vollmer, Clara Schmitz‐Pranghe",
          "abstract": "This article analyses the interactions between inequalities and reintegration assistance, looking at the examples of Serbia and Kosovo. It proposes an approach for examining the reintegration assistance practices of frontline providers by (a) viewing them through the lens of street‐level bureaucracy acting mainly on behalf of the returning state and (b) as locally situated agents within the networks of their own distributive relations and embodying their own social positioning. Street‐level implementers play an active role in shaping outreach, effectiveness, and sustainability of reintegration assistance, not always in the intended ways. This article traces their navigation of institutional, organisational, and relational contexts, internalised social norms, and perceptions of social divisions, as well as the micro‐dynamics of asymmetrical interactions during service delivery. It finds that strategies applied by street‐level assistance providers have ambivalent but rather minor effects on pre‐existing inequalities. Even though they often naturalise prevalent social divisions, the interactions and allocation of assistance are determined more by their practical experiences, availability and type of support, as well as general programme design and working conditions. The inability to bridge the mismatch between available support and needs can even endorse inequality‐normalising perceptions.",

          "authors": "Aija Lulle, Russell King, Eralba Cela",
          "abstract": "Whilst the mainstream literature on return migration focuses on issues of the reintegration of younger returnees, their families and linkages to development, attention to older returnees remains scarce. In this Special Issue, we shift focus to the diversifying realities of return in older age by extending debates on the theory and practice of return and non‐return in older age. We argue that research on return migration and ageing needs to be examined in various contexts across the globe. Such research is needed both theoretically and empirically to illuminate the potential of human wellbeing in increasingly larger populations of ageing migrants who decide to return or not, or live their lives in‐between, with considerable consequences for themselves, their relatives, and the states and places where they live (trans)locally. The Special Issue contributions push forward this debate by critically interrogating the concepts of preparedness, aspirations and capabilities. We examine these established concepts in return migration theory in a new light through wider questions of identity, the relevance of narrativity, emotions, active agency, and complex processes of transnational return and decisions not to return.",

          "abstract": "This study examines Qatar's NGO‐driven humanitarian aid framework for Syrian refugees in Türkiye, focusing on structural, cultural and strategic challenges in delivering sustainable support. Through thematic analysis of interviews with Qatari NGO and Syrian civil society stakeholders, key issues such as resource constraints, administrative fragmentation, cultural barriers and the need for tailored strategies are identified. Findings show that while Qatar's aid efforts effectively address immediate needs, bureaucratic complexities, regulatory challenges and inconsistent funding impact project sustainability and efficiency. Additionally, cultural norms within Syrian refugee communities highlight the importance of culturally sensitive operations. Integrating insights from foreign aid and Islamic social financing, notably zakat – a form of Islamic almsgiving – the study proposes a framework for overcoming these challenges. In aligning humanitarian relief with resilience‐building initiatives and culturally attuned approaches, Qatar's NGOs can enhance their impact on Syrian refugees' empowerment. This research contributes to discussions on foreign aid frameworks, stressing the need for cohesive, culturally informed strategies to achieve sustainable humanitarian outcomes.",

          "authors": "Mathias Lerch, Philippe Wanner",
          "abstract": "Demographic and economic consequences of international migration in high‐income countries depend on the patterns of flows, which have changed profoundly since WWII. We investigate how the increase in highly skilled migrants shaped the geography of flows, the age, sex and family composition and the international mobility of immigrants in Switzerland between 1966 and 2019. The large‐scale circulation of predominantly male migrants from neighbouring countries in the 1960s transformed into a more permanent inflow alongside a dominance of women and families originating from all over the world in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, the turn of the new Century was marked by a renewed regionalization, ageing and masculinization of immigration, which is focusing on urban agglomeration centres and again characterised by high levels of international mobility. These changes were associated with the rise in highly skilled migration and call for a re‐interpretation of the societal consequences of recent flows.",

          "abstract": "These Methods Note analyzes the feasibility of conducting panel surveys with migrant populations in Latin America, which is characterized by increasingly vulnerable migration flows and complex migration trajectories. Since evidence shows that the migration event is an attrition factor in panel surveys, we reflect on methods to minimize its impact and recommend how other researchers could adopt our applied method. We took three steps to accomplish this. First, we compared the sociodemographic profiles of respondents of Venezuelan origin who participated in the 2018 Ethno-Recent Immigration Survey (ENIR) in Uruguay, focusing on those who were recontacted in the ENIR's second round in 2021 versus those who were not. Second, we conducted a multivariate analysis by estimating logistic regression models to predict the probability of being contacted in the ENIR's second round. Finally, we systematized our observations of which factors enabled participants to be recontacted in the second round, thereby determining strategies to allow future studies to recontact participants. Our results indicate that, in addition to the informants’ individual attributes, it is imperative to consider the characteristics of their social networks to facilitate recontact.",

          "authors": "Ying Ho Kwong",
          "abstract": "The literature on Hirschman's exit-voice dynamics has long argued that voice (protests) is more likely to be selected in public affairs. In nondemocratic regimes, however, the cost of voicing out is high so citizens opt for exit (emigration). This study identifies individuals who engage in “voices after exit” as “migrant influencers” who emigrate overseas for criticizing their home government. It analyzes prodemocracy influencers in Hong Kong, revealing that 70.7% (29 out of 41 YouTube channels) have chosen to emigrate overseas due to increasing political restrictions in recent years. In the post-National Security Law era, commentary on Taiwan politics has become more constrained. This study analyzes 1,414 YouTube videos outside Greater China to examine how migrant influencers frame (1) cross-strait relations, (2) Taiwan's domestic politics, and (3) Taiwan's future prospects. The findings show that influencers physically distant from Hong Kong adopt more radical stance against China. Drawing on the concept of “long-distance nationalism,” the study concludes that distance from their original location and perceived equal rights protection in their new location foster a sense of personal safety and obligation to criticize home authorities openly. This article presents preliminary findings to further explore the concept of migrant influencers.",

          "abstract": "The displacement of approximately eight million Ukrainians throughout Europe since February 2022 has had a significant impact on migration governance, and sparked important discussions within migration research. Leveraging novel data from the “Voice of Ukraine” (VOU) survey — a multifaceted longitudinal study of Ukrainian refugees deployed since June 2022 — we examine the migratory and socio-economic trajectories of this community in exile. We posit that the demographic characteristics of Ukrainian refugees, and the asylum and integration policies enacted by European countries of settlement, shape variation in migratory decisions as well as integration outcomes. Our initial analyses of the VOU data show a surprising migratory sedentariness following an initial sorting across Europe. They also reveal a potential association between policies and socio-economic integration tied to housing, education, employment, and personal finances. Our work sets the stage for further exploration of the interplay between refugee attributes and the legislative frameworks of host nations, shedding light on broader dynamics of forced displacement.",

          "abstract": "While the study of international migration has benefited from the use of direct surveys to measure aspirations to migrate, little attention has been paid to potential sensitivity biases that could lead to measurement errors (i.e., underreporting) when eliciting irregular migration intentions. In contexts where migration through irregular pathways is clandestine, dangerous, and concealed from family members to avoid interference, prospective migrants may hesitate to disclose their true intentions. Thus, the question arises: Are direct survey estimates underreporting intentions to migrate through irregular pathways? This article presents evidence from a double-list experiment in rural Central Ethiopia in 2022. Drawing on a sample of 5,302 respondents, this study compares estimates of intentions to migrate irregularly obtained through a traditional direct question vs. a less intrusive double list experiment. While the main results indicate no significant differences between the double list experiment and the direct question in the prevalence of irregular migration intentions, further analysis reveals heterogeneous sensitivity biases with respect to respondent subgroups. Taken together, the results suggest that direct measures of irregular migration intentions can be reliable.",

This article traces the roles of housing aid in displacement and in the search for solutions to displacement. We draw on the case of Sri Lanka’s Northern Muslims’ internal displacement in 1990, with its protracted history. We build on data from 2021 to 2022, long after the 2009 end of the civil war, which provides insight into how IDPs in different locations reflect on the roles of housing aid for return and staying. We find that the location and iteration of housing aid, or housing aid modalities, are crucial for understanding people’s reflections and choices in protracted (internal) displacement. Housing (aid) clearly intertwines with livelihood opportunities, security, and ethno-political landscapes. By integrating attention to translocal realities with the emergent nature of solutions, where displaced populations’ agency concerning housing aid comes to the fore, this article contributes to urgent debates on possible ends to displacement.",

          "authors": "Ruth Nattermann",
          "abstract": "This article discusses the German-Jewish politician Toni Sender (1888–1964) as a female leader within the international governance of refugee issues during the second post-war period. The contribution challenges the traditional androcentric view of the post-war refugee regime and leadership composed of European(-Jewish) men. It highlights Sender’s lived refugee experience and her role as a female expert within international organizations such as UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the 1951 Refugee Convention, considering its gendered and political context. By drawing on primary sources, including Sender’s autobiography and diaries, documents from the UNHCR archives and reports by UNRRA that offer important insights into contemporary refugee governance, the article argues that Sender’s humanitarian leadership was shaped by her identity as a former refugee, a Jewish woman, and a socialist, who conceived refugee relief and law as forms of corrective justice and important preconditions for peaceful societies based on equal rights.",

          "authors": "Elisabeth K. Kraus, Nadja Milewski",
          "abstract": "Gender patterns in migration processes and in migrant fertility are a growing research field. We contribute to this literature by examining refugees, an understudied group in demographic research. Our theoretical framework is informed by theories of migrant fertility and migration processes. Using data from the 2020 survey ‘Forced Migration and Transnational Family Arrangements—Eritrean and Syrian Refugees in Germany’ (TransFAR), we conduct sequence analysis and multivariable event‐history analysis. We examine transitions to first births among women and men who were childless when leaving their country of origin (Eritrea or Syria), as well as transitions to subsequent births for those who were already parents upon departing. Our results show that women have higher transition rates to first births compared to men, while men have increased rates to subsequent births. The likelihood of a first birth increases during prolonged transit periods and, in particular, after arrival in the destination country (Germany). The chances for a subsequent birth are highest after arrival in Germany, after an initial phase of very low fertility. While we found no significant differences by country of origin among women, men from Syria have greater higher‐order birth risks than Eritrean men. Our findings indicate that the stage in the migration trajectory and gendered couple migration patterns play the most significant role in refugees' fertility behaviour.",
