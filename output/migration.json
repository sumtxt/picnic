          "title": "Qualification as a key criterion? An analysis of Germany’s labour migration policy",
          "authors": "Jennifer-Louise Robinson, Thomas Groß",
          "abstract": "In Germany’s labour migration discourse the notion of skilled workers is pervasive, as evidenced by the title of the 2020 Skilled Immigration Act and its extension in 2023, framing migration primarily in terms of migrants’ qualifications and labour-market relevant skills. This article analyses the significance of this qualification criterion which is expressed in German migration law by the requirement for third-country nationals to hold a formal qualification recognised in Germany, in order to obtain residence and work permits. Therefore, it highlights a selectivity mechanism in migration policy within broader debates on how to analyse the functioning of selective systems – moving beyond a purely economic framing of demand- and supply-driven models. It does so by first analysing the development of German migration policy based on bilateral agreements towards a qualification-based policy, which has opened up to non-academically trained workers, particularly in recent years, and by secondly examining migration channels that do not require formally recognised qualification. The analysis shows that while formal qualifications remain a central criterion in German labour migration policy, a significant share of labour migration from third countries – understood as migration for the legal purpose of employment – occurs through pathways that waive this criterion. The one-sided focus on skilled labour immigration therefore does not reflect the complex reality of migration to Germany.",

          "abstract": "This article studies how domestic and international remittances respond to weather shocks in Mexico and whether local violence affects the use of remittances as insurance. I use a novel combination of state-level, administrative, survey, and remotely sensed panel data to investigate these questions. Estimating a gravity model that accounts for network characteristics and potential spatial dependence, I find that remittances are selective, responding positively to drought but negatively to violence. The negative impact of violence is even larger in areas experiencing drought, suggesting that households facing violence are especially vulnerable to weather shocks as they are less able to cope using remittances. I further unpack the costs of both drought and violence by studying spillovers from neighboring states. I find that the degree of violence in neighboring states magnifies the main impact, motivating regional policy approaches.",

          "abstract": "Using Colombian Vital Statistics, this study compares birth outcomes between Venezuelan migrant mothers who recently resided in Venezuela and Colombian mothers following the death of Hugo Chávez. While rates of low birth weight are similar, Venezuelan migrants face significantly higher risks of pregnancy loss, with fetal deaths rising sharply relative to their Colombian counterparts. Key contributors include inadequate healthcare coverage, pregnancy-related conditions, and limited medical assistance during delivery. Although the data do not capture when migration occurred during pregnancy, most fetal deaths happen early in gestation, suggesting that these outcomes likely reflect in-utero exposure to deteriorating living and healthcare conditions in post-Chávez Venezuela, compounded by the stress of displacement. The findings highlight the critical role of prenatal care and living conditions in ensuring healthy pregnancies and underscore the need to look beyond live-birth outcomes when assessing infant health among vulnerable migrant populations.",

          "abstract": "The regional distribution of immigrant populations in Western countries has changed over the last decades. Such changes are usually explained by changes in immigrants’ initial settlements and/or their subsequent internal migration patterns. This Research Note draws attention to a third factor: emigration. When immigrants in urban areas are more prone to emigrate than their rural peers, this contributes to a less urbanized immigrant population. Using Norwegian data, this study follows the immigrant cohort who arrived between 2000 and 2013, grouped by their immigration category, during their first 10 years after arrival in Norway. The results show how emigration from the most urban areas has contributed to a less urbanized (remaining) immigrant cohort. For some immigrant groups, this de-urbanizing emigration has outweighed the urbanizing effects of internal migration.",

          "abstract": "A large body of research shows that members of Congress disproportionately represent the interests of copartisans and affluent Americans. Is there also racial disparity in representation? I draw on three standards of political equality—proportionality, race-conscious egalitarianism, and pluralism—and assess the extent to which minority representation satisfies each. To do so, I match roll-call votes in the U.S. House of Representatives to survey data fielded prior to each vote (2006–2016) and use multilevel regression and poststratification to estimate racial subgroups’ opinions. I then examine how closely House members’ voting aligns with these opinions, focusing on districts where White and minority preferences differ. My analysis rules out “coincidental representation’ driven by similar opinions across groups and accounts for how much of each racial group’s national population resides in each district. Among districts where racial group opinions differ, I find strong support for the proportionality over the race-conscious egalitarian standard: Racial minority representation is substantially greater in majority–minority districts than in those that are not. However, I find strong evidence for the race-conscious egalitarian standard among Democratic legislators and moderate evidence for the pluralist standard among all legislators, as voting tends to align with racial minority opinion on explicitly race-targeted bills.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies urge deeper debate on memory and social justice in postcommunist Central and Eastern Europe. One of the harshest events in communist Romania was the deportation from the Romanian‐Yugoslav border to the Bărăgan Plain. By analyzing 27 interviews from www.deportatiinBaragan.ro , we examine how memories of deportation unfolded. Most trauma stemmed from the adaptation of the deportees to the hostile Bărăgan environment. Many deportees died; survivors suffered illness, carried trauma, and struggled to adapt on returning home. As the postsocialist state has done little to address these wounded place‐based memories, the study suggests social justice steps that could help heal the memories.",

          "authors": "Jae Hyun Park",
          "abstract": "The Korean word jari means a place, but also a seat, social position or space, according to the context. In interviews with Burmese refugees returning from South Korea (hereinafter Korea) to Myanmar, this word was used to express the challenges of return after nearly 20 years. Mostly men in their 40s−50s, they initially arrived in Korea as migrant workers and were later recognised as refugees for their political activities against the military government. When returning to Myanmar from the 2010s after the NLD (National League for Democracy) resumed power, it was difficult to find a jari in politics, not having ‘earned their right’ by suffering with activists who remained in Myanmar. Since they engaged in diasporic political activities instead of working, they did not return with money expected by families of migrant workers. Instead, they made alternative jari in education, community organisation or social enterprises through their transnational social networks and their social, political and economic remittances from Korea. This paper is based on qualitative research in Korea and Myanmar in 2018 using life‐story interviews, participant observations and researcher reflexivity. This paper used jari , a political, relational, emotional and dynamic conceptualisation of place to present the refugees' ideas of place when they returned. An alternative to state‐centric views of refugee repatriation, their relationship to a jari was the basis of the process in building livelihoods and belonging on return.",

          "authors": "Sarah Jane D. Lipura, Hyein Ellen Cho, Eva Richards",
          "abstract": "Despite the popularity of the Philippines as a study destination for Korean students, this study finds that Korean student returnees from the country face persistent discrimination and devaluation of their qualifications and linguistic competencies at home. Wedding perspectives from Bourdieu's theory of capital and Said's imaginative geography, this paper adapts the concept of spatial stigmatisation to frame how capital conversion as a means to social reproduction is a complex process that is mediated by the discursive (de)valuation of destinations of study as spaces accorded with differential symbolic values. Conceptually, it argues for a geographic view of capital to foreground broader spatial hierarchies that shape the recognition and transferability of capital across borders. Empirically, it sheds light on the after‐study lives of Korean student returnees from a nontraditional destination whose realities are often hidden under dominant discourses that link study abroad outcomes with capital acquired from the Anglophone West and positive return experiences. By paying attention to Korean student returnees from the Philippines—an underrepresented topic within both international student mobilities and Korean study abroad literature—the paper similarly broadens the scope for deploying comparative research on return experiences across different spatialities, deepening at the same time understanding of the complex interactions between place, space and capital within the context of study abroad.",
