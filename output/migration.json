          "title": "“When they return home they do nothing for half a year”: opposing remittances and articulations of Romanian migrant labour in agriculture",
          "authors": "Remus Gabriel Anghel, Lucian Vesalon",
          "abstract": "Food security is becoming increasingly problematised, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, or by the crisis in the global grain markets induced by the war in Ukraine. How out-migration and return change agriculture in different countries of origin, including Eastern Europe, is less understood in connection to such crises. In this paper we look at the ways in which agriculture and its labour regime change under the impact of international migration in two geographical areas in Romania, the Transylvanian Highlands and Banat. We analyse how two types of actors return to Romanian agriculture and how they occupy different labour positions: small-scale entrepreneurs and seasonal workers. Unlike much research on migration and development depicting migrants as agents of positive change, we consider social remittances as contested. We advance the notion of “opposing remittances” to account for how migrants differently reflect on their migration experiences and how class-based relations, marginalisation and racial inequalities affect social remittances related to labour. Ultimately, this paper reveals how inequalities are entangled in return migration in agriculture, and how contingent migration experiences contribute to the variegation of social remittances.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how securitized governmentality shapes Czech migration policy, particularly for Vietnamese migrants. Grounded in a humanizing approach and drawing upon the Paris School securitization theory and governmentality, this research explores how security‐driven logics become embedded in institutional practices, shaping migration governance and restricting legal pathways. Through interviews with migration professionals from the Czech Ministry of the Interior, municipalities, integration centres, and NGOs, this study reveals contrasting institutional perspectives. The Ministry of the Interior frames Vietnamese migration as a security risk, linking it to illicit brokerage networks and justifying restrictive policies. Treating integration as secondary, it prioritizes control measures; NGOs and local actors highlight how exclusionary policies push migrants toward informal community structures for support. This dynamic creates a self‐reinforcing cycle of securitization, rooted in the interaction between securitized institutional logics and community dynamics. This study demonstrates how these interactions shape migration governance, reinforce exclusion, and deepen migrant vulnerability.",

          "abstract": "States increasingly use education to engage diasporas, yet sustained transnational educational programmes remain understudied despite their potential to illuminate how migration governance adapts over time. Focusing on Turkey's Open Education Faculty (AÖF) in Germany, we combine administrative enrolment records (78,138 student‐year records; 32,155 students) with documentary and media analysis to trace participation, institutional design, and policy framing over four decades (1982–2023). We identify five phases, showing a transformation from economic credentialing oriented toward first‐generation male workers to a predominantly digital platform increasingly used by later‐generation, mostly female learners seeking knowledge tied to culture and identity. Programme choices shifted from economics/business toward theology and sociology. We propose a ‘capability‐mediated engagement’ framework: programme durability depends on adapting to evolving capabilities that members value across life‐course and integration contexts. The findings challenge zero‐sum integration models, suggesting transnational education can complement host‐country belonging.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth F. Cohen, Cyril Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Many countries of the Global North depend on the economic benefits of migration even as their citizens and leaders evince ever more open opposition to immigrants settling and becoming citizens. One result of this misalignment of interests and goals has been the proliferation of visa statuses that commit their bearers to not seeking permanent settlement or citizenship and offer them very few rights. Many scholars have debated whether and in which ways short‐term migration may be normatively problematic, and in particular, exploitative. In this paper we add to existing critiques of temporary migration regimes as unjust and materially exploitative the claim that such schemes exploit not just the labor and other material contributions of short‐term immigrants, but also the social capital they build by necessity when they are in residence.",

          "authors": "Melissa Watanabe Mata",
          "abstract": "The term “Women of Color” (WoC) has seen a marked rise in usage, yet little is known about how it functions as a coalitional identity with political significance. I argue that WoC operates both as a descriptor and an identity. As a descriptor, it resembles a panethnic label for nonwhite women. When adopted as an identity—the focus of this study—it may carry deeper significance connected to its progressive roots. Scholars often categorize all racially diverse women as WoC based on presumed experiences of oppression. However, this assumption overlooks variation in race-gendered discrimination shaped by factors such as appearance and class. Women who are perceived as white or those with lighter skin tones, for example, may not experience racialization in the same ways as other nonwhite women. Given the label’s association with liberal political views and its emphasis on “color,” some women may choose not to adopt it or may be uncertain about their inclusion. Using 2020 CMPS data, this study builds on WoC scholarship by incorporating Asian women and compares their experiences and attitudes to those of Latina and Black women. Results show that the majority of Asian women identify as a WoC and report high levels of WoC-linked fate. Among Asian women, personal experiences with discrimination and empathy toward other marginalized groups are especially important in WoC identity formation. WoC-linked fate also demonstrates political relevance across all three groups, showing a positive relationship with support for undocumented immigrants and the #MeToo movement.",

          "authors": "Sara Cosemans, Robbe Himpe",
          "abstract": "After Pinochet’s military coup in 1973, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) coordinated the resettlement of thousands of refugees from Chile. An unusual destination was Romania, which admitted the largest number of refugees in communist Eastern Europe. Yet this symbolic gesture soon proved unsustainable: by 1977, nearly 450 of the 1,500 Chileans resettled in Romania had fled again, seeking asylum in Western Europe. This article traces this ‘second escape’ and examines how UNHCR responded to this secondary movement. It first reconstructs the international effort to resettle Chileans across the Iron Curtain and highlights Romania’s strategic motivations. It then explores how deteriorating conditions led to renewed flight. Finally, it analyses UNHCR’s reluctance to acknowledge the program’s failure. The article argues that, under High Commissioner Sadruddin Aga Khan, resettlement became a tool of Cold War diplomacy—expanding UNHCR’s global footprint at the expense of its protective mandate.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the formation and evolution of intersectional solidarity among LGBTIQ+ civil society organizations in Berlin responding to the war in Ukraine. Drawing on qualitative interviews with representatives from twelve organizations, we analyze how these groups mobilized to support queer Ukrainian refugees. Our theoretical contribution lies in advancing the concept of ambivalent intersectional solidarity, which captures the tensions and exclusions that arise even within seemingly unified solidarity efforts. We argue that solidarity cannot be assumed to be inherently inclusive simply because actors share one or more axes of identity (e.g., queerness). Instead, we show how intersectionality—as both a lived experience and an analytic lens—reveals the contested nature of solidarity in contexts marked by historical trauma and geopolitical asymmetries.",

          "authors": "Moli Gu, Shuangshuang Tang, Liyue Lin",
          "abstract": "Rural migrant women in China face dual structural constraints stemming from gender norms and the household registration ( hukou ) system during the urban settlement process. However, the influence of shifts in gender role attitudes on settlement intentions remains insufficiently examined. Drawing on survey data collected in Nanjing, this study employs binary logistic regression and moderation analyses to examine the associations between attitudinal shifts and both long‐term residence intentions and hukou transfer intentions. The findings reveal a general trend towards the modernization of gender role attitudes among rural migrant women in urban contexts, alongside stronger hukou transfer intentions than long‐term residence intentions. Compared with women whose gender role attitudes have regressed, those whose attitudes remain stable exhibit significantly higher levels of both long‐term residence and hukou transfer intentions, while progressive shifts in gender role attitudes are associated with a greater propensity to express hukou transfer intentions. Moreover, social embeddedness and relational networks moderate the relationship between shifts in gender role attitudes and hukou transfer intentions. These results highlight the importance of promoting the modernization of gender role attitudes, reducing institutional barriers to integration and alleviating family caregiving burdens as essential strategies for enhancing the settlement intentions of rural migrant women.",

          "title": "From Commonplace Diversity to Relational Hybridization: Everyday Interculturalism in Rome's Banglatown",
          "authors": "Andrea Pelliccia",
          "abstract": "This article explores the social transformation of Rome's Banglatown, located in the Torpignattara neighbourhood, as a case of everyday interculturalism. Through ethnographic fieldwork with the Bangladeshi diaspora, it examines how diversity is lived, negotiated and reconfigured in the spaces of daily interaction. Building on the concept of ‘commonplace diversity’, the study highlights how routine public encounters—especially in schools, parks and local commerce—foster recognition and coexistence, while often stopping short of deeper intercultural intimacy. The analysis reveals a gendered dynamic in which Bangladeshi women, particularly mothers, act as informal socio‐cultural brokers in the public sphere, while men remain largely confined to ethnic networks. Crucially, by introducing the notion of relational hybridization , the article demonstrates that second‐generation children are more likely to shift intercultural relations into the private and affective sphere, cultivating friendships and emotional proximity across ethnic lines. These practices do not merely intensify existing ties but alter the social meaning of difference by relocating interculturality into domains of intimacy. These children generate hybrid forms of belonging that challenge both community conservatism and societal exclusion. The article argues that Banglatown is not simply a site of demographic concentration, but a relational space where diversity is enacted and reshaped from below. It contributes to contemporary debates on urban interculturalism by foregrounding affective infrastructures, generational shifts and the everyday labour of living with difference.",

          "authors": "Anle Cheng",
          "abstract": "Understanding the settlement intentions of female migrants is crucial for promoting inclusive and sustainable urbanization, yet existing studies often lack a gender‐sensitive and multi‐level analytical framework. Drawing on ecological systems theory, this study integrates spatial analysis and interpretable machine learning to examine the spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of female migrants' settlement intentions in China. Results show that settlement intentions are unevenly distributed, with northern and northwestern regions showing higher intentions than southern regions. The meso‐system (workplace and family context) exerts the most pronounced influence on settlement decisions. Short‐distance migration and higher local minimum wages consistently strengthen women's willingness to settle. By contrast, accumulated household difficulties and elevated crime levels substantially weaken settlement intentions. Notably, several influences are nonlinear: moderate working hours enhance settlement willingness, but excessive hours quickly erode it, and air pollution becomes a decisive deterrent once the AQI exceeds 100. These findings suggest that female migrants' settlement decisions emerge from the balance between economic security, family sustainability, and urban livability, underscoring the need for gender‐sensitive and place‐based policy interventions.",

          "title": "Ruth Glass: London's Gentrification Urban Visionary",
          "authors": "Chris Hamnett",
          "abstract": "This paper analyses the contribution made by Ruth Glass to our understanding of gentrification and class change in London. It argues that not only was she remarkably ahead of her time in identifying and naming this important new phenomenon over 60 years ago, but that her discussion of the social and housing market impacts of gentrification have proved to be remarkably prescient. Although gentrification has taken many new forms which she could not have anticipated, she located gentrification as a process of social class and housing change which has subsequently transformed the physical and social structure of London and many other major cities. The paper examines her writing from 1964, 1973 and 1989 and highlights its continuing relevance in the context of the subsequent social and housing market changes in London and other cities.",

          "title": "Housing Conditions, Neighbourhood Area and Life Satisfaction in Older Age",
          "authors": "Elena Pirani, Maria Veronica Dorgali, Valentina Tocchioni, Alessandra Petrucci",
          "abstract": "This study contributes to the literature on environmental influences on individual life satisfaction in older age, by offering novel empirical evidence from Italy, a country marked by rapid population ageing, a difficult homeownership regime and pronounced territorial inequalities. We jointly investigate various aspects of the living environment, both the indoor characteristics of the housing—its stability, adequacy and affordability—and the outdoor features of the immediate neighbourhood environment—its liveability and accessibility. We offer evidence that housing adequacy, friendliness of the neighbourhood environment and accessibility to public services are the most relevant aspects for older Italians' life satisfaction. Nevertheless, various aspects of the living environment proved to be important, highlighting the importance of adopting a multidimensional and integrated approach. In addition, despite well‐known North–South differences in Italy, we did not find substantial variations across Italian macro‐areas in this link. Conversely, the city type of residence does appear to matter, underscoring the need to conduct territorial analyses at a finer spatial scale that surpasses the traditional North–South divide. By placing our analysis within the literature on environmental effects on ageing, this study provides empirical evidence that can inform policy about interventions to enhance housing and neighbourhood conditions for elderly individuals, promoting friendly communities and well‐designed urban spaces to support active ageing.",
