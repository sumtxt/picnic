        "title": "Viral Market Formation: Symbolic Consumption, Platform Virality, and the Labubu Phenomenon",
        "authors": "Pahul Sachdeva",
        "abstract": "This paper examines how contemporary consumer trends emerge, accelerate, and consolidate market value through processes of symbolic consumption and platform-mediated virality. While existing research has explored diffusion of innovations and social contagion, less attention has been paid to how culturally ambiguous objects transform into powerful market signals through participatory meaning-making. Using the recent Labubu phenomenon as a qualitative case study, this paper develops a conceptual framework for understanding how digital platforms, identity signaling, and memetic repetition interact to produce rapid consumer adoption. Drawing on literature from consumer behavior, cultural sociology, and attention economics, the analysis situates Labubu not as an isolated trend but as an illustrative example of broader dynamics shaping contemporary markets. The paper contributes a theoretical model of viral market formation and offers implications for marketers, researchers, and platform strategists seeking to understand cultural acceleration in digitally mediated environments.",

        "abstract": "The credibility revolution in psychology and related sciences contributed to the adoption of large-scale research initiatives known as Big Team Science (BTS). BTS has made significant advances in addressing issues of replication, statistical power, and diversity through the use of larger samples and more representative cross-cultural data. However, while these collaborations hold great potential, they also introduce unique challenges related to their scale. Drawing on experiences from successful BTS projects, we identified and outlined key strategies for overcoming diversity, volunteering, and capacity challenges. We emphasize the need for clear role definitions, structured and preregistered workflows, centralized project management, and transparent decision documenting to prevent common pitfalls. Ultimately, we call for reflection on the strengths and limitations of BTS to enhance the quality, generalizability, and impact of research across disciplines. This work complements existing BTS guides by offering experientially-grounded, discipline-specific strategies and addressing underexplored logistical, ethical, and epistemological challenges in large-scale collaborations.",

        "authors": "Kai Jappe Sandbrink, Laurence Hunt, Christopher Summerfield",
        "abstract": "In mammals, neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex respond to action prediction errors (APEs). Here, using computational simulations with deep neural networks, we show the that this error monitoring process is crucial for inferring how controllable an environment is, and thus for estimating the value of control processes (meta-control). We trained both humans and deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents to perform a reward-guided learning task that required adaptation to changes in environmental controllability. Deep RL agents could only solve the task when designed to explicitly predict APEs, and when trained this way, they displayed signatures of meta-control that closely resembled those observed in humans. Moreover, when deep RL agents were trained to over- or under-estimate controllability, they developed behavioural pathologies matching those of humans who reported depressive, anxious or compulsive traits on transdiagnostic questionnaires. These findings open up new avenues for studying both healthy and pathological meta-control using deep neural networks.",

        "authors": "Jasmin Richter, Josefine Haugen, Vasiliki Paparoidami, Rolf Reber",
        "abstract": "Prior research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce effective persuasive messages. One reason why LLM-generated messages are persuasive could be that they are easy to read, which could enhance their credibility and likability. This paper examines the reading ease, perceived truth, and likability of persuasive messages produced by GPT-4o compared to messages authored by human lay writers. Although human-written messages were objectively easier to read, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that readers perceived LLM-generated persuasive messages as easier to read, as more truthful, and liked these more than human-written messages. Experiment 3 showed that this pattern was replicated when we matched the objective reading ease of LLM-generated and of human-written messages. Experiment 4 replicated these results when we additionally matched the arguments of LLM-generated and of human-written messages thereby controlling for the prototypicality of the arguments. Our findings suggest that the ease with which human readers can understand text generated by LLMs could contribute to its persuasiveness. We discuss these results in context of a predictive coding account of language comprehension according to which humans constantly predict the continuation of a text while reading, which resembles the way LLMs generate text.",

        "abstract": "The Bhagavad Gita an ancient Indian scripture and a spiritual guide to millions from diverse populations and cultures, address existential dilemmas that remain relevant across time and context. Its teachings extend beyond the spiritual domain, offering practical philosophical and psychological insights in promoting well-being. Objective: The objective of this research was to explore Samatvam (equanimity) as a pathway to psychological well-being (PWB). Method: Thematic analysis of the principle of Samatvam (equanimity) as expounded in the Bhagavad Gita, was carried out to conceptualize psychological well-being through the lens of equanimity. Result: A psychological well-being (PWB) framework that holds potential in universal application in diverse cultures and populations is developed. The Samatvam based framework is further examined in relation to well established psychological well-being (PWB) theories. This model highlights the cultural versatility and psychological foundations of Samatvam based framework promoting psychological well-being. Conclusion: Future empirical research is recommended to validate and operationalize this framework in diverse populations and cultures.",

        "title": "Why Does Paid Parenting Leave Terminology Matter?: Implications for Policy Design, Monitoring and Comparative Research",
        "authors": "Alzbeta Bartova, Thordis Reimer, Gerardo Meil, Pedro Romero-Balsas",
        "abstract": "Paid parenting leave (PPL) policies have become a central pillar of contemporary welfare states, supporting gender equality, labour market participation, child well-being, and long-term social sustainability. As these policies have expanded in scope, duration and objectives, however, the terminology used to describe them has evolved unevenly across countries, international organisations, databases and academic research. This Policy Brief argues that terminology is not merely a semantic or technical issue, but a core element of governance and knowledge production. The concepts used to name, classify and aggregate parenting leave entitlements shape how policies are designed, monitored, evaluated and compared. Inconsistent terminology weakens cross-national comparability, obscures policy effects and undermines evidence-based policymaking. Drawing on a comprehensive review of international regulations, comparative databases, national terminologies and academic research, the brief demonstrates that traditional distinctions between maternity, paternity and parental leave no longer adequately capture the diversity and complexity of contemporary leave systems. While diversity in national terminology is both inevitable and normatively meaningful, the absence of a harmonised comparative framework has become a major obstacle to effective monitoring, policy learning and research synthesis. The brief concludes that harmonisation of terminology at national level is neither feasible nor desirable, but that harmonised terminology for comparative and monitoring purposes is essential. It proposes the systematic use of an umbrella concept of parenting leave, disaggregated by entitlement type, while always retaining national legal terms and contextual specificity.",

        "abstract": "Despite the Netherlands’ reputation for transparency, public sector corruption and integrity violations remain persistent issues, particularly in transport security environments. This article reports insights based on an exploratory qualitative case study of airport policing of corruption by the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar) at a regional Dutch airport. Grounded in a theoretical understanding of corruption as a socially constructed and discursively mediated phenomenon shaped by institutional logics, professional identities, and operational constraints, we draw on in-depth interviews with KMar officers (N=12) and participant observations (N=3) to deliver a “thick” description of how airport KMar officers perceive, define, and make sense of the nature of corruption, and how this perception affects their work practices in policing corruption. Two distinct logics – socially-reinforced moral licensing and integrity-draining demands – constitute this process of social construction, leading to blind spots in policing and paradoxical moral hazards for officers to engage in corruption. These novel insights expand prior research on the process of social construction of corruption and corruptibility in security forces, with important implications for theory and practice.",

        "authors": "Peter Fallesen, Andreas Nielsen Hald, Frank Eriksson, Gert Martin Hald",
        "abstract": "Divorce is prevalent and often leads to adverse social outcomes among divorcees and their children. Digital platforms offering online post-divorce help may provide scalable, affordable, and accessible support for divorcees during this transition. The study examined the long-term effects (five years) of a post-divorce targeted digital mental health intervention on divorcee’s labor market attachment and income. Participants (n=1,856) were divorcees from a nationally administered randomized controlled trial (RCT) tracked over a five-year period post their RCT participation using Danish national register data. Cumulative and by-year effects of treatment on labor market income, weeks on sick leave benefits, weeks on welfare benefits, and share of year unemployed were obtained using linear and count models. The study protocol was preregistered. Over the follow up period, participants in the treatment group spent fewer weeks on sick leave benefits and accumulated higher labor market income. By-year estimates for labor market income passed preregistered significance levels, but accumulated effects estimates and estimates for sick leave benefits did not. Digital health interventions may be a low-cost, high scalability way to address negative life consequences of divorce. However, more—and higher powered—research projected are needed to obtain better knowledge of their full potential.",

        "abstract": "Purpose – This study examines the de-escalation techniques police officers employ during everyday encounters with civilians and assesses how the use of these techniques varies when civilians exhibit different emotional and behavioral states. Design/methodology/approach – We systematically analyzed body-worn camera footage from 82 real-life police-civilian interactions in the Netherlands, coding 35 distinct de-escalation techniques. Using Firth’s logistic regression with cluster bootstrap, we assessed differences in technique use for interactions involving civilians showing intoxicated, incomprehensible, or heightened emotional behavior, compared to interactions with civilians not exhibiting these behaviors. Findings – Officers employed the full range of de-escalation techniques, most frequently utilizing communication strategies. The use of specific techniques varied with the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states. For 22 de-escalation techniques, the odds that officers use them proved to be either significantly higher or lower in the investigated types of interactions. Sixteen techniques were specific for one type of interaction (e.g., civilian showing incomprehensible behavior), while six were significant for more than one type of interaction. Most differences were observed in interactions with civilians exhibiting heightened emotional behavior, where, for example, the odds of officers remaining calm were higher compared to interactions with civilians not showing such behaviors. Originality/value – Few studies have examined officer de-escalation techniques in real-life interactions using body-worn camera footage. This study advances our understanding of what de-escalation entails in daily practice and how officers adapt their techniques to the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states.",

        "abstract": "Background: Improving students’ diet is a public health priority, yet interventions often fail to address the structural barriers students face, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. This study aimed to assess how students involved in a co-creation process (i.e. a student citizens’ assembly) conceptualise and prioritise solutions to improve students’ access to healthier, more climate-friendly diets. Methods: This participatory research took place at a French university (Sorbonne Paris Nord) located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. A student citizens’ assembly was conducted with the aim to co-create concrete proposals that would enhance students’ access to sustainable diets and physical activity. The assembly involved 27 students randomly selected among a pool of volunteers. Over three days in November 2024, students received awareness-raising and training, deliberated among themselves then with institutional and local stakeholders, and formulated proposals. For each proposal, students were asked to rate anonymously their approval on a 10-point scale. Proposals related to diet (i.e. not physical activity) were analysed a posteriori using two complementary frameworks: the DONE framework classifying determinants of diet (individual, interpersonal, environmental /policy) and the FAO dimensions of sustainable diets (health, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural). Results: Overall, 31 proposals were formulated, of which 77% targeted environmental and policy determinants of diet (e.g. institutional regulations, university policies, food assistance solutions, improved food affordability and availability, food labelling). Other proposals referred to individual (19%) and interpersonal determinants (3%). In addition, 39%, 29%, 23% and 10% proposals addressed the health, socio-economic, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively. Mean approval ratings (SD) for each proposal ranged from 6.7 (4.0) to 9.7 (0.9), with a mean (SD) value for all proposals of 8.6 (0.7). Proposals addressing the socio-economic dimension received the highest approval ratings (mean [SD] 9.0 [0.6], vs 8.4 [0.6], 8.4 [0.8] and 7.9 [0.4] for the health, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively). Conclusion: The predominance of environmental and policy measures targeting economic access to food highlights the importance of co-creation and its value to align interventions with participants’ needs and expectations. One major challenge that warrants further investigation is the capacity of stakeholders to implement such proposals, and to evaluate their effectiveness.",

        "authors": "Daniel Karlsson, Alison Gerber",
        "abstract": "This article examines the influence of entrepreneurialism on the self-conceptions and practices of contemporary artists, highlighting the interplay between traditional artistic values and emerging entrepreneurial norms. We explore the sociological processes through which precarious labor markets and entrepreneurial discourses have reshaped artistic subjectivities. Artists today navigate fragmented careers marked by overwork, uncertainty, and excessive self-promotion, while simultaneously reinterpreting ideals like autonomy, creativity, and authenticity through entrepreneurial lenses. We underscore the ambivalence artists experience in engagements with entrepreneurialism: some embracing it as a pathway to fulfillment, while others critique its alignment with market logics. By situating entrepreneurialism within broader cultural and structural contexts, we reveal the ways that it naturalizes precarious conditions and reinforces individual responsibility for success. Ultimately, this work calls for critical engagement with the entrepreneurial spirit that shapes modern art worlds and emphasizes the need to address structural inequalities in creative industries.",

        "abstract": "Ce mémoire d'Habilitation à la Maîtrise d'Œuvre en son Nom Propre (HMONP) interroge le positionnement professionnel du jeune architecte dans un contexte économique post-crise de 2008, marqué par la précarisation de la commande et le dumping d'honoraires. L'étude s'articule autour de la dichotomie entre l'exercice libéral indépendant (« audace ») et l'intégration au sein de grandes structures de bureau d'études (« acceptation ») . L'analyse repose sur une immersion professionnelle au sein du groupe AREP, filiale de la SNCF spécialisée dans l'aménagement des gares et pôles d'échanges. L'auteur y examine les spécificités juridiques et opérationnelles d'une maîtrise d'œuvre (MOE) intégrée à la maîtrise d'ouvrage (MOA), régie par un « contrat cadre » dérogeant partiellement à la loi MOP. Le document détaille les mécanismes de ce monopole ferroviaire face à l'ouverture progressive à la concurrence européenne et la restructuration d'AREP en société holding (SAS) pour diversifier ses marchés. Au travers de projets de mise en accessibilité des gares franciliennes (Boussy-Saint-Antoine, Yerres), le mémoire met en évidence la complexité des rapports contractuels impliquant de multiples maîtres d'ouvrage (SNCF, RFF/SNCF Réseau) sans mandataire unique, entraînant une dilution des responsabilités et des conflits de gestion. Une réflexion prospective est également menée sur l'évolution technologique de la profession, notamment l'impact du Building Information Modeling (BIM), des Smart Cities et les risques d'« ubérisation » du métier d'architecte via les plateformes numériques. En conclusion, l'auteur définit son projet professionnel en valorisant l'expérience acquise au sein d'une grande structure comme un vecteur d'acquisition méthodologique (« boîte à outils ») indispensable avant un retour vers l'exercice libéral, prônant une éthique fondée sur la rigueur et la responsabilité sociale.",

        "abstract": "Dans le contexte de l'ouverture à la concurrence du marché ferroviaire européen actée en 2010, ce document examine les mutations nécessaires des infrastructures françaises, en prenant pour cas d'étude la gare Montparnasse. Alors que le modèle historique de la SNCF se voit confronté à de nouveaux impératifs de compétitivité et de rentabilité, l'étude propose une analyse comparative avec le système ferroviaire japonais, privatisé dès 1987. L'auteur met en lumière la stratégie des opérateurs nippons qui, par une diversification massive (immobilier, commerce, services) et une densification urbaine autour des nœuds ferroviaires, ont transformé les gares en véritables centres de vie urbains. L'analyse se concentre ensuite sur les spécificités de la gare Montparnasse : son évolution architecturale complexe, sa relation verticale avec la Tour Montparnasse, son manque de connexion au réseau RER et son isolement relatif dans le tissu parisien. En transposant les réussites du modèle japonais — notamment l'intégration des fonctions de transport et de consommation — ce travail explore les pistes d'une redéfinition de la gare Montparnasse. L'objectif est de démontrer comment le passage d'un simple lieu de transit à un pôle multimodal dense et diversifié peut répondre aux enjeux économiques de la libéralisation tout en palliant les ruptures urbaines héritées de l'urbanisme de dalle.",

        "authors": "Lorran Luiz de Oliveira Neves",
        "abstract": "Este artigo investiga a crise epistemológica estrutural que atravessa as teorias econômicas, principalmente as contemporâneas na qual essa crise se agravou, tanto na ortodoxia quanto na heterodoxia. Argumenta que a incapacidade recorrente de prever, explicar ou evitar crises sistêmicas não decorre de falhas técnicas pontuais, mas de problemas metodológicos muito mais profundos, a começar pelo recurso frequente a meta-axiomas, o núcleo duro da metodologia econômica, e em torno desse núcleo duro uma segunda camada frequentemente orbitada por argumentos circulares, tudo isso dando base para as elaborações teóricas que então se diferenciam, ortodoxas e heterodoxas. Como parte dessa forma mais externa a matemática geralmente aparece como mais um recurso retórico à disposição da teorização. A análise se direciona em três direções: (i) o Teorema de Sonnenschein‑Mantel‑Debreu (SMD), cuja prova pode ser entendida como a impossibilidade lógica de derivar comportamento racional agregado a partir de preferências individuais racionais, e sua consequência na microfundamentação de teorias macroeconômicas, (ii) na Teoria Monetária Moderna (MMT) e (iii) na possibilidade ou não da planificação econômica na sociedade capitalista. Analisamos os limites de discursos modernos e realistas como o socialismo de mercado, a economia do projetamento e a nova economia do projetamento e como, em última instância, mesmos esses discursos mais modernos ainda carregam fundamentações baseadas em argumentações circulares e antigos meta-axiomas. Por fim, a partir disso, concluímos a impossibilidade da planificação econômica em uma sociedade capitalista, apesar desses discursos, argumentos e propostas e apesar da possibilidade de superação da sociedade capitalista e da planificação econômica não capitalista nesse processo.",

        "abstract": "Transgender individuals who do their gender in ways that allow them to pass as cisgender (i.e., who appear to others to be 'not trans') are theorised to hold a 'passing privilege'. Using matched survey and register data on the population of transgender individuals who have changed their legal sex in Denmark, we investigate the relationship between passing and outcomes related to mental health, social life, and education and the labour market. Our findings confirm that higher levels of passing are associated with increasingly favourable outcomes across all domains. Individuals who pass to a high degree report less life dissatisfaction, fewer suicidal thoughts, less social isolation, and fewer difficulties in daily life settings. Higher passing is also associated with substantial educational and labour market advantages, including increased employment rates, particularly for trans men. While trans men and trans women place similar importance on passing, and often face similar privilege increments when passing to a higher degree, trans men are much more likely to pass at high levels and thus to enjoy the privileges associated with passing.",

        "abstract": "Population-level research on intersex individuals has been impeded by the difficulty of identifying this population in large-scale data. In this paper, we develop a novel strategy for identifying intersex individuals using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in population-wide health registers. Applying this approach to Danish data spanning 1994-2022, we provide the first population-level examination of the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders in the intersex population. We identify intersex traits in 1.6% of the Danish population - rising to 2.5% among the 1994-2022 birth cohorts, for whom diagnostic data cover the entirety of their lives. We disaggregate the intersex population into six subgroups based on the type of intersex-related diagnoses and examine the risk of fourteen clusters of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across all subgroups, the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially elevated relative to the endosex population, although specific risk profiles vary: some subgroups show broad elevations across disorder categories, whilst others exhibit more selective patterns. These patterns persist after controlling for age and assigned sex, as well as after the inclusion of sibling fixed effects. Our findings highlight the need for mental health support tailored to individuals with intersex traits. Our ICD-based identification strategy addresses longstanding methodological barriers to intersex research and offers a replicable approach for population-level research beyond mental health and across contexts with comparable health data.",

A sequential approach has been taken to understand the inception of the garments business in Bangladesh and how it has grown over the years with the support of various internal and external factors. A major growth in business has been observed in the 1990s but the business also faced major hurdle in the year 2004 when Multi-Fiber agreement was phased out.

        "authors": "Riccardo Palumbo, Alessandro Bortolotti, Pier Luigi Sacco",
        "abstract": "Prospect theory's characteristic patterns (loss aversion, reference dependence, and nonlinear probability weighting) have generally been interpreted as cognitive biases, i.e. as evidence of bounded rationality. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding these phenomena through the lens of active inference and the free energy principle. We argue that prospect theory's central features are consistent with computationally efficient solutions to decisionmaking under uncertainty within the thermodynamic constraints of neural computation. Loss aversion implements adaptive precision-weighting of prediction errors, allocating greater computational resources to negative deviations that threaten survival. Reference dependence implements efficient predictive coding, transmitting only surprising deviations from expectations. Probability weighting reflects optimal precision allocation across the probability range when maintaining full Bayesian representations would exceed metabolic budgets. This framework is supported by converging evidence: neuroimaging studies show unified value coding with asymmetric precision for losses; pharmacological manipulations reveal dissociable neurotransmitter systems for value encoding versus loss sensitivity; and metabolic manipulations including hypoxia, glucose depletion, and circadian mismatch modulate prospect theory parameters in predicted directions. Developmental evidence shows that children display probability weighting patterns opposite to adults, with gradual transformation through experience pointing at calibration rather than to genetic determination. We propose that prospect theory patterns reflect how biological systems navigate uncertainty under fundamental energetic constraints, with implications for understanding decision-making architecture and reconceptualizing rationality.",

        "abstract": "We analyse focus group discussions and free-text survey responses from a multi-stakeholder consultation conducted after the October 2023 publication of the proposal Towards Responsible Publishing by cOAlition S. The proposal calls for a systemic reform of scholarly communication by reducing barriers to knowledge dissemination, promoting early sharing of outputs through preprints, and shifting peer review to an open, post-publication model. We focus on how different stakeholder groups –such as researchers, infrastructure providers, academic institutions, and publishers –perceive obstacles to the large-scale, coordinated reform envisioned in the proposal. We interpret these accounts as articulations of collective action problems, shaped by entrenchment of many actors in existing academic reward systems and established commercial revenue models that make transitions toward a more economically sustainable scholarly communication system difficult, even where many actors see the principal need for change. This approach highlights the extent to which stakeholder perspectives align or conflict. It also underscores the performative nature of discourse about collective action problems in scholarly communication: by articulating challenges to reform, participants simultaneously construct, reinforce, or contest their own roles within the system, which directly influences their collective capacity to act.",

        "authors": "Benoît de Courson, Willem Frankenhuis, Daniel Nettle",
        "abstract": "People in situations of poverty tend to heavily discount the future. Despite robust evidence, the theoretical literature lacks satisfying models to explain why. Existing theories often invoke urgent needs to explain impatience, this intuition is not sufficient: in persistent poverty, one may need resources tomorrow as much as today. We show that previous models assume that poverty is temporary and improvement is expected, and predict discounting only under this condition, which is rarely realistic. Here, we present the first model showing that time discounting can be rational in persistent poverty. We propose a two-period model in which basic needs are captured by a 'desperation threshold' -- a critical resource level above which agents aim to stay. In four stylized scenarios, we show analytically that agents discount the future near the threshold and are patient at intermediate resource levels. In line with the empirical record, time discounting increases on both sides of the threshold, while risk taking is polarized -- higher below the threshold, lower above. Unlike existing accounts, our explanation does not rely on assuming a future improvement in financial situation. Rather, it predicts a U-shaped effect of future expectations, with greater time discounting if the future will be either much better or much worse than the present, which can reconcile economic theory with ethnographic findings. Our findings suggest that addressing material scarcity directly, rather than attempting to alter future orientation, may be the most effective way to reduce time discounting and align behavior with true preferences.",

        "authors": "Malinda L. Price-Utter",
        "abstract": "This manuscript presents an anonymized, longitudinal qualitative single-case dataset documenting digitally mediated obsessive relational intrusion (ORI), symbolic manipulation, and covert pursuit behaviors within contemporary social media environments. The primary evidentiary window spans November 2023 through May 2025, with documentation and analysis concentrated across 2024–2025. The case is reported from the perspective of the primary target and applies a structured analytic approach that distinguishes (a) observable digital behaviors (e.g., timestamps, posts, interactions, and platform activity) from (b) interpretive analysis grounded in repeated patterns, timing relationships, symbolic consistency, and escalation dynamics observable across time and platforms. The dataset is organized as a structured case file consisting of an executive summary, preface, and methodology section outlining documentation procedures and interpretive criteria; contextual background establishing relevant relational and digital history; a master timeline organized around correlated activity and post-response timing relationships; and appendices addressing recurrent tactic clusters, including sexual objectification, identity manipulation, covert account proliferation, fantasy-based framing, and probability-based reasoning relevant to assessments of intentionality. All identifying details—including names, locations, venues, and searchable lyrical content—have been anonymized or paraphrased to preserve privacy while retaining evidentiary and analytic integrity. This work is shared to support sociological research, interdisciplinary scholarship, advocacy, and public understanding of technology-facilitated forms of relational harm that may remain socially and institutionally difficult to recognize due to plausible deniability and indirect communication architectures. It is not presented as a legal claim or criminal allegation, but as a high-resolution longitudinal dataset illustrating how digitally mediated ORI may be sustained through symbolic intrusion and psychological presence without continuous direct contact. The full anonymized case file is available as an accompanying dataset via OSF.",

        "authors": "Achai Deng Genevieve Alor, Li Xiaojing, Tharcisse Ndayipfukamiye",
        "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines whether perceived military skills transferability (PMST) influences entrepreneurial intention (EI) in a post-conflict economy. Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory, it tests entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) as a mediator and perceived environmental hardship as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted with 270 working-age adults across three regions of South Sudan (Juba/Central Equatoria, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal) between July and October 2025 using paper-based and online questionnaires. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression and PROCESS-based mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1) with 5,000 bootstrap resamples. Findings: PMST is positively associated with EI. ESE mediates this relationship (indirect-only): the bootstrapped indirect effect is significant and the PMST→EI direct effect becomes non-significant when ESE is included. Perceived environmental hardship weakens the positive PMST–EI relationship. Resilience is positively related to EI but does not moderate the focal relationship. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference and self-reports may introduce common method bias. Future research should use longitudinal and comparative designs and examine behavioral outcomes (e.g., business start-up). Practical implications: Reintegration and entrepreneurship programs should combine skills-recognition and ESE-building (e.g., mastery-based training and mentoring) with ecosystem interventions that reduce contextual constraints. Social implications: Supporting entrepreneurship among individuals with military experience may contribute to livelihood recovery, inclusion and reintegration in fragile settings. Originality/value: The study integrates perceived skills transferability, cognitive mechanisms and contextual constraints to explain entrepreneurial intention in a fragile, post-conflict economy. Type of paper: Research paper. Keywords: perceived skills transferability; entrepreneurial self-efficacy; entrepreneurial intention; environmental hardship; resilience; post-conflict; fragile economy.",

        "abstract": "Theory of Ideological Hegemony and the Imperial Phase of Capitalism offers a groundbreaking synthesis of Marxist, Gramscian, and Althusserian theory to explain how ideology, power, and global capitalism reproduce themselves through modern state and supranational institutions. In this wide-ranging study, Aleksandar Korolija develops the original concept of the imperial ideological apparatus—a framework that connects the structures of global finance, political power, and transnational institutions such as NATO, the IMF, and NGOs with the formation of contemporary ideological systems. Combining philosophical precision with historical analysis, the book explores how class domination is maintained not only through economic coercion but through the cultural and ideological mechanisms of the global order. Drawing on Marx, Gramsci, and Althusser—while critically engaging with other critical authors—Korolija demonstrates how the transition from the nation-state to the imperial phase of capitalism transforms the function of ideology itself. This theory connects the formation of hegemony in the classical Marxist sense to the reproduction of global capitalist power in the 21st century. This is an excerpt with two out of six sections.

        "abstract": "Political possibilities are shaped by how a problem is defined. When it comes to the environmental crisis, the defined contours of growth, development, and scarcity drive the conversation in predetermined directions.

When outlined as categories liable to be influenced by culture, context, and power structures, their study can serve as a searching tool that illuminates complex dynamics. Environmental education influences and is influenced by the prevailing discourses in environmentalism. The discourse privileged by the curriculum's language frame depends on the text's location, who it is aimed at, and the concomitant priorities. In this exploratory paper, practitioners working in the fields of environmental education (EE) pedagogy, teaching, curriculum design, and activism were interviewed. The idea was to get a sense of what people in different fields working towards the common goal of better care for the environment and an ethic of sustainability had to say about the EE curriculum. What was their vision for it, and what was the reality they had encountered in these technology-driven, fast-paced times? Special attention was paid to interlocutors' thoughts on the significance of the words and language used in the curriculum.",

Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, this study situates summer melt within the broader college-choice process by comparing summer melters with students who follow through on their intentions, those who never intend to enroll, and those who enroll without prior intent. Socioeconomic differences in summer melt are closely tied to earlier disparities in progressing toward college intent, and summer melters’ academic and behavioral patterns across high school vary more than those of college-intending enrollees. These results highlight the value of viewing summer melt as one point among several at which students reconsider their postsecondary plans, as well as the need for conceptual models that incorporate ongoing, rather than discrete, decision-making in the transition to college.",

Existing theories emphasize bureaucratic resilience, but shocks that generate workplace dysfunction and threaten professional identity may affect the stability of bureaucratic labor.

Using comprehensive data on congressional staffers from 2008-2022, we find increased turnover in Democratic offices relative to Republican offices. Subsequent staffing patterns also shifted: Democratic offices experienced declines in observable human capital (legislative experience and educational attainment) and increased reliance on temporary staff. These changes were further accompanied by reductions in the racial and gender diversity of congressional staff. Taken together, these findings suggest that workplace disruptions can degrade institutional capacity by reshaping the composition and continuity of the congressional workforce.

However, it is unclear whether this is due to intrinsic motivations or electoral incentives. We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to analyze ethnic minority representation in the UK Parliament. By comparing white MPs who narrowly beat minority candidates to minority MPs who narrowly beat white candidates, the RDD controls for electoral incentives since it holds constant constituency factors correlated with a minority parliamentary win. Analyzing over 1 million parliamentary questions and speeches, we find that minority MPs are more likely than white MPs to discuss issues important to ethnic minorities. Additional evidence suggests that narrowly elected MPs face similar electoral incentives and that minority MPs representing minorities face reelection penalties. Our findings are consistent with the idea that minority substantive representation is driven at least in part by intrinsic motivations.",

Across 4- to 9-year-old American children (N = 161, Mage = 7.07, 56.1% racial majority, 43.9% racially marginalized, 81 girls, 80 boys), and adults (N = 174; 56.1% racial majority, 43.9% racially marginalized, 136 women, 35 men, 3 non-binary), children and adults expressed awareness of group-based disparities in mobility, with some evidence of intersectional reasoning.

In many cases, these rules are sufficient for a complete, compact, and compelling power analysis for treatment effects and interactions.

While they have been consistently shown to be beneficial for vocabulary acquisition, the efficacy of multimodal input in scaffolding text comprehension is less clear. Conflicting findings have also been reported in terms of the relationship between comprehension and attention to pictures as measured by eye tracking. In this pre-registered study, we provide further empirical evidence to this research base by testing a new population, adult beginners, and by including a reading-only, no-image condition as the baseline. In a counterbalanced within-subject design, 65 learners of Spanish were exposed to different parts of a story on an eye tracker under three experimental conditions: Reading Only (RO), Reading + Image (RI), and Reading + Image + Audio (RIA). Results revealed that comprehension was higher in the RIA and RI than in the RO condition, indicative of the usefulness of the audio and/or the image. The number of looks at the images was higher in the RIA condition, confirming that the audio allowed readers to attend to the pictorial information provided. Attention to the image, however, positively predicted comprehension scores only for the RIA condition.",

        "abstract": "We examine multilevel models applied to intensive longitudinal (IL) designs. Many measurements in IL research are influenced by measurement error, which can compromise the consistency of estimates obtained through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). While previous research has addressed the impact of measurement error in broader multilevel contexts, its effects on statistical power—particularly in relation to cross-level interaction effects—have not been thoroughly explored. This study aims to clarify the relationship between measurement error and statistical power by deriving analytical formulas for the asymptotic bias and precision matrix of the MLE of fixed effects in multilevel models that account for additive measurement errors and autoregressive [AR(1)] within-person errors. Furthermore, we analyze how different sources of measurement error affect the standard errors of fixed effects estimates and the overall statistical power, specifically when both time-varying and time-invariant predictors are measured with error. We also investigate the estimation properties of the MLE of the fixed effects, assuming autocorrelated measurement errors in the response variable. Our findings show that measurement error in predictors leads to downward bias in the MLE of fixed effects. In contrast, the MLE estimates of fixed effects remain unbiased when there is autocorrelated measurement error in the response variable.",

        "authors": "James E Bartlett, Gaby Mahrholz, Emily Nordmann",
        "abstract": "Since the replication crisis came to widespread attention in psychology, there has been significant progress in reforming research practices to be more open and reproducible. However, the integration of these principles into teaching—particularly assessment—has lagged behind. While many open educational resources (OERs) have been developed to support the teaching of open science, fewer efforts have focused on embedding open science into how students are assessed. This tutorial addresses that gap by offering a series of practical, scalable strategies for integrating open and reproducible science into psychology education through assessment. We argue that to normalise open science, students must not only learn about its principles but be assessed on their understanding and application of them. Drawing on examples from our undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and the wider literature, we outline a range of assessment strategies aligned with curriculum standards and pedagogical evidence. These include incorporating pre-registration and registered reports, evaluating reproducibility through code and data submission, engaging students in peer review and code review, and integrating open science concepts into essays, multiple-choice exams, and final dissertations. We highlight that even small changes at the course level can promote open science, and that educators should approach implementation flexibly, recognising it as a continuum rather than a binary shift. Importantly, we also stress the need to avoid framing open science as overly technical or inaccessible, which may discourage student engagement. By embedding open and reproducible practices into assessment design, educators can support the development of critical, ethical, and transparent future scientists. While the examples provided are drawn from psychology, the strategies are applicable to a wide range of data-driven disciplines.",

This article argues that beyond moment-to-moment (micro) and ultimate-outcome (macro) predictions, medium-term “mesoscopic hypotheses” dominate spectator activity. These concern the unfolding, intersection, and temporary resolution of plotlines and character arcs. We propose a three-level (micro–meso–macro) model of engagement, showing through series like Grey’s Anatomy, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones how viewers focus on the “middle game.” Genres shape distinct hypothesis patterns, while fan speculation amplifies mesoscopic focus. This framework clarifies how serial narratives sustain pleasure and interest without definitive closure.",

In light of this, this article proposes a conceptual typology that allows for a more granular and nuanced analysis of the asymmetrical impact of AI in creative labour. To do so, this article develops a threefold conceptualization of contractual relations, forms of automation, and workflows. Regarding contractual relations, we differentiate between formal, informal, and platform-mediated creative labour. In forms of automation, we identify four dominant uses: automation as replacement, automation as augmentation, human-extended automation, and control. Finally, we define three types of workflows: artisanal, industrial, and informational. This typology is guided by the concept of distributed agency. As such, we attempt to overcome the dichotomic opposition between agency and control that characterises much of the research that examines the relationship between digital technologies and creative labour. Instead, we acknowledge that agency is distributed between practices, artifacts and social structures, and that this distribution is not evenly negotiated. Furthermore, the proposed conceptual typology can be operationalized for empirical research and we hope it will prove useful to better capture the conditions under which AI is shaping creative labour under late capitalism.",

        "abstract": "This essay reflects on divergences and overlaps across two approaches — the industrial and the artistic — in current debates about generative AI and creative practices. We articulate some key differences between the two through the semantic variances in four keywords: technology, creativity, skill, and authorship. These keywords continue to be essential vocabulary in present interdisciplinary investigations into the impact of generative AI on creativity and creative work. In the artistic field, characterised by the notion of “the artworld”, creative practices hold relative autonomy from economic considerations. From the industrial perspective, the “creative industries” occupy a position between the artworld and the economic world — that is, creative practices are simultaneously subject to artistic considerations and the market logic of cultural production. We argue that by foregrounding the specificities in how the two approaches differ and by tracing shifts in the meanings of particular words used in the communication and critique of the uses and effects of generative AI on the production of creative media, we move towards a more nuanced perspective that is sensitive to disciplinary, institutional, and conceptual disparities.",

        "authors": "Qianying Wu, John O'Doherty",
        "abstract": "In recent years, the study of the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior has gained significant attention within the field of neuroeconomics. During this time, core ideas and theoretical frameworks developed through the study of decision-making and learning in non-social contexts have been adapted and extended to social contexts. New paradigms have been introduced to measure social behaviors, new models and theories have been proposed to explain these behaviors, and experimental evidence has accumulated to validate these theories and elucidate the neural substrates underpinning social computations in humans. This chapter highlights recent advances in the study of social processes using a neuroeconomics-based approach, focusing on important findings through computational modeling and neuroimaging methods. We begin by outlining the neural structures involved in processing various social rewards. Next, we discuss how values are computed and represented in the brain when making decisions that involve other people’s outcomes. We then examine the motivations behind these decisions, in two specific cases: altruistic and fairness-driven, decisions. Finally, we explore how individuals update their knowledge and beliefs about whom they interact with, and how they should interact - a process known as social learning. We categorize social learning into two broad types: learning about others and learning from others.",

In this paper we document a large class gap in career progression in one occupation—U.S. tenure-track academia—using parental education to proxy for class background. First-generation college graduates are 10% less likely to be tenured at an R1, are tenured at institutions ranked 11% lower, earn 3% less, and report 5% lower job satisfaction, than their former Ph.D. classmates (from the same institution and field) with a parent with a non-Ph.D. graduate degree. Neither selection out of academia nor different preferences explain this gap; differential research productivity also plays little role. Instead, likely drivers are differences in cultural and social capital. We also find a class gap in career progression for Ph.D.s who work in industry, suggesting this phenomenon generalizes outside academia. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

We compare the results to MMRs from the Sample Registration System (SRS), a nationally representative group of demographic surveillance sites. We estimate 256 maternal deaths (95% CI [222, 295]) per 100,000 live births in the NFHS-4 and 305 (95% CI [268, 344]) in the NFHS-5. The SRS reports an MMR of 130 for 2014-16 and 97 for 2018-20. Differences between the two surveys’ MMR measurements are largest in the socioeconomically disadvantaged states of north India. We discuss possible sources of sampling and non-sampling error in the two surveys. We conclude that these new NFHS estimates should inform discourse about the burden of maternal mortality in India.",

Background: Total fertility rates in Finland have declined sharply since 2010, reaching lowest-low levels in recent years. This study complements previous, mostly register-based, research by focusing on young Finns’ fertility intentions and their self-reported rationales. Method: We analyzed survey responses from 3,803 young Finns (aged 20–29) collected in 2021–2022, who evaluated how 39 rationales influenced their fertility intentions, including postponement, not desiring (additional) children, or uncertainty. Exploratory factor analysis was used to group the rationales, and latent profile analysis identified distinct groups of individuals with similar rationales. Multinomial logit models were then estimated to examine the associations between these profiles and fertility intentions. Results: We identified five latent profiles differing in their constellations of personal and partnership concerns, autonomy concerns, global concerns, and career-related concerns. Postponing childbearing was typical of the groups with moderate concerns over personal autonomy and career, who could also have experienced personal and partnership difficulties. Individuals who intended to forgo childbearing entirely prioritized personal autonomy and global concerns. Conclusions: Practical circumstances primarily drive the postponement of childbearing, while ideological motivations and lifestyle choices are more strongly associated with intentions to remain childless.",

This study addresses this gap using a mixed-methods approach, combining data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), the European Social Survey (ESS), and in-depth qualitative interviews and group discussions (N = 47). Quantitative results indicate that first-generation migrants are significantly more likely than non-migrants to think German society is meritocratic and offers equal opportunities. In turn, they are more likely to tolerate large inequalities. Qualitative analysis reveals that this optimism stems from favorable comparisons with their countries of origin. This paper argues that migrant optimism, previously associated with educational expectations, extends beyond individual-level perceptions to encompass perceptions of society at large. While prior research has emphasized the motivational benefits of migrant optimism, this study highlights how it can lead migrants to legitimize inequalities, revealing more ambivalent political consequences.",

While recent economic history has produced a substantial body of empirical tests and refinements of Weber’s thesis, far less attention has been paid to his core claim that theological concepts helped shape distinctive work-oriented subjectivities. This article addresses that gap by examining art manuals produced for and by artisans during the Reformation era, with a particular focus on Nuremberg. By situating these manuals in their historical contexts, it demonstrates that their authors explicitly related their understandings of work to theological ideas, though in ways that depart from standard Lutheran assumptions. The manuals draw not only on Protestant sources but also on humanist traditions. Moreover, they frame the dissemination of artistic knowledge through print as a Christian obligation to enhance the community’s artistic productivity, thereby articulating an implicit logic of economic expansion that cannot be reduced to a Calvinist ethos.",

        "authors": "INVEST Flagship, Katrin Schwanitz, Martin Klesment",
        "abstract": "Immigrants and their descendants constitute an increasing share of European populations, yet research on how immigrant background shapes the cohabitation experience remains limited. This study investigates how generational status at the individual level and national context at the macro level influence the likelihood of ever having cohabited. Our central proposition is that the diffusion of cohabitation among immigrants is more pronounced in countries where the practice is common and socially accepted among the native population. We analysed pooled data from the European Social Survey (ESS; 2002–2023), encompassing 66,017 respondents across 32 countries. Our findings provide evidence of an adaptation pattern: descendants of immigrants are significantly more likely to have ever cohabited than the first generation. Crucially, this generational difference does not vary systematically according to the prevalence of cohabitation among natives. The cohabitation context nonetheless significantly increases the likelihood of ever having cohabited, outweighing the influence of economic factors such as income inequality (Gini index). This suggests that the social and normative environment—the cohabitation context—is a primary driver of behavioural change. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that immigrant family formation is not merely a product of individual traits but is fundamentally shaped by the normative climate of the host country.",

        "authors": "INVEST Flagship, Henrik Dobewall, Hannu Lehti, Outi Sirniö, Maria Vaalavuo",
        "abstract": "Research has identified socioeconomic disparity in university enrollment due to a higher likelihood to stop applying after an initial rejection among individuals from less educated families. We investigate the role of education-linked genes alongside family background and experiencing mental illness and other major life events in predicting (re-)application to university. We further examine the later socioeconomic outcomes of individuals who are more persistent in their educational goals. Utilizing longitudinal genetically informed register data from Finland, we analyze a sample of 6,101 individuals born 1987-1990 followed up until 2018. The study uses parental polygenic scores to assess the genetic endowment to high educational attainment (EDU-PGS) combined with information on application behavior (1,683 individuals experienced rejection) and socioeconomic variables. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models and discrete time hazard models are employed. Our findings indicate an intricate interplay of genetic endowments, income and education of the parents, (re-)application behavior, and early adulthood income and occupational status. Individuals with a higher EDU-PGS were more likely to reapply after rejection, suggesting a genetic component in persistence in educational goals and application behaviors beyond family background. Mental illness did not have an effect over and above other included indicators on stop applying, and there was no evidence for the presence of gene-environment interactions. Moreover, application behavior mediated the influence of the polygenic score on occupational status in early adulthood. The study contributes to the broader equality of opportunity debate and shows how genes express themselves in our smaller or bigger decisions. The joint contribution of genetic and family factors has a crucial role in shaping educational trajectories and later socioeconomic outcomes.",

Untersucht wurden die Wahrnehmungen und Einstellungen sowie das Nutzungsverhalten der 1.657 Befragten (1.119 Erwerbstätige, 538 Nichterwerbstätige) zu Beginn des Jahres 2025. Die überwiegend ambivalenten Einstellungen gegenüber KI in der Bevölkerung weisen lediglich geringfügige Unterschiede zwischen Erwerbstätigen und Nichterwerbstätigen auf. In der Arbeitswelt äußern Erwerbstätige zunächst eine eher positive affektive Haltung gegenüber KI, die sich jedoch bei der konkreten Bewertung einzelner Arbeitsbedingungen relativiert. Während Befragte Entlastungspotenziale durch den KI-Einsatz in Hinblick auf Arbeitsbelastung und Gesundheitsschutz sehen, bewerten sie die KI-Auswirkungen auf Datenschutz, soziale Kontakte und Mitbestimmung kritisch. Konkrete Sorgen um Arbeitsplatzverlust oder Karriere bleiben bislang begrenzt. Zugleich zeigt sich eine zunehmende, überwiegend freiwillige Nutzung von KI am Arbeitsplatz. Insgesamt deuten die Ergebnisse auf noch instabile und kontextabhängige Einstellungsmuster hin, die durch eine hohe Ambivalenz gekennzeichnet sind.",

        "abstract": "Background. Food insecurity (FI) is associated with increased mortality and poor health. In high-income populations, documented risk factors for experiencing FI include low income, being female, having children, and ethnic minority status. Low social support may increase the risk of FI above and beyond these. Methods. In two epidemiological datasets, the Changing Cost of Living Study (CCLS; UK and France) and the National Health Interview Survey 2024 (NHIS; USA), we used model selection to identify the best predictors of FI from a set including social support alongside socioeconomic and demographic variables. Results. In both datasets, social support was selected as a predictor variable. High social support roughly halved the odds of experiencing FI (CCLS: 0.45 (95% CI 0.35 - 0.56); NHIS: OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.49 - 0.56)). Other selected predictor variables were income, income volatility, gender, and age (CCLS); and income, gender, age, having children, education and ethnicity (NHIS). Social support operated additively to other factors. Conclusions. Low social support is an independent risk factor for FI. FI may be reduced by fostering social connection and capital; and inferences about the causal effects of FI on health may be confounded by the influence of social support on both.",

        "authors": "Faezeh Fadaei, Jenny Carla Moran, Taha Yasseri",
        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive settings, yet we know little about how their identity performance develops when they interact within large-scale networks. We address this by examining Chirper.ai, a social media platform similar to X but composed entirely of autonomous AI chatbots. Our dataset comprises over 70,000 agents, approximately 140 million posts, and the evolving followership network over one year. Based on agents' text production, we assign weekly gender scores to each agent. Results suggest that each agent’s gender performance is fluid rather than fixed. Despite this fluidity, the network displays strong gender-based homophily, as agents consistently follow others performing gender similarly. Finally, we investigate whether these homophilic connections arise from social selection, in which agents choose to follow similar accounts, or from social influence, in which agents become more similar to their followees over time. Consistent with human social networks, we find evidence that both mechanisms shape the structure and evolution of interactions among LLMs. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of bodies, cultural entraining of gender performance leads to gender-based sorting. This has important implications for LLM applications in synthetic hybrid populations, social simulations, and decision support.",

        "authors": "Sam Mutsamwira",
        "abstract": "This review synthesises the literature on university entrepreneurial ecosystems to understand their role in fostering university spin-off companies as drivers of economic development. This study adopts a systematised conceptual literature review design, employing a structured search and thematic synthesis to develop an integrative conceptual framework that positions university entrepreneurial ecosystems as a dynamic interplay between internal (e.g. university leadership, faculty) and external (e.g. government, venture capitalists) stakeholders. The framework identifies knowledge spillover and transfer as key mediating processes, and highlights intellectual property frameworks and mechanisms (e.g. university IP policy, legal system) as a critical moderator that can either enable or constrain academic entrepreneurship, and subsequently spin-off formation. Applying this lens to New Zealand, a paradoxical situation was uncovered: while home to a recognised “emerging world leading” university entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is a significant paucity of recent, system-wide academic research. Key gaps are identified, including the need for longitudinal data on spin-offs performances, and a deeper understanding of internal ecosystem dynamics like the critical imperative to integrate Mātauranga Māori (Māori traditional knowledge) into commercialisation pathways. This review provides a foundation for future empirical research and offers insights for policymakers and university leaders in New Zealand and other small, innovative economies.

        "abstract": "This paper outlines a distributional approach to institutional analysis, reconceptualizing institutions as distributions of knowledge and activity across people. We argue that institutionalization and institutional change are best understood by focusing on actors with the requisite knowledge and motivation to keep institutional patterns going, fix them when they go awry, or transform them when required, here called functionaries. The distributional approach allows us to distinguish between two main types of institutional change often conflated in the literature: Content-based and formal change. Content-based change, the one most often discussed, involves the importation, recombination, or expansion of specific patterns of activity. In contrast, formal change, often neglected in the literature, refers to shifts in the distribution of knowledge and activity within an institution, leading to dynamics of centralization and decentralization of institutional patterns. In this way, the distributional approach highlights the role of functionaries in both institutional stability and change, providing a micro-level perspective on institutional dynamics.",

        "authors": "Haoran Shi, Wanting (Wendy) Wang, Dario Krpan",
        "abstract": "How do political parties transform bipartisan foreign policy issues into partisan polarization? This study examines partisan polarization on Ukraine aid between Democratic and Republican elites as reflected in U.S. news media from March 2022 to December 2024, leveraging party brand theory and foreign policy polarization literature to explain when and how Democrats and Republicans consolidated distinct positions on a novel foreign policy issue. Analyzing 37,312 sentences from 23,630 news articles, we employ a dual-pipeline methodology combining LLM-based ideological scoring across four dimensions with BERT-based masked vocabulary extraction. Results reveal significant polarization growth, driven asymmetrically by Republican movement toward opposition while Democrats maintained stable pro-aid positioning. Resource allocation framing, such that Ukraine aid competes with domestic resources, contributed most strongly to the general polarization of supplying further aid to Ukraine, accounting for over 60% of explained variance. PELT identified October 2022 as the first major departure from bipartisan consensus, with polarization of the subsequent segments moving with electoral cycles and leadership transitions. Critically, as polarization increased, so did the clarity of party brands to voters: both parties’ messaging became more internally coherent, enabling clearer partisan differentiation. Vocabulary extraction revealed early crystallization of partisan linguistic patterns, with Democrats emphasizing language of provision (“promised,” “signed”) and Republicans emphasizing language of obstruction (“block,” “killed”). These findings demonstrate that elite polarization on Ukraine aid served functional party branding purposes, challenging assumptions about foreign policy’s insulation from domestic partisan conflict.",

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods with 170 students participating in the survey in Hanoi, the results showed that the rate of eating disorders was highest in females, followed by males and the other gender group. In particular, the other gender group had the most severe and diverse levels of eating disorders. Factors such as body dissatisfaction, social pressure on body standards, gender discrimination and internalization of appearance standards had a significant impact on eating disorder behavior. The study also showed that eating disorders negatively affected students' mental health, while coping ability was limited and there was a lack of appropriate support. On that basis, the study proposes educational, communication and school psychological support solutions for effective prevention and intervention, with special attention to gender-diverse student groups.",

In several latest events, unverified posts framed around political, religious, and identity-based outrage have moved quickly from online spaces into offline vandalism and communal violences. The transition from rumour to violence is not automatic and unavoidable. It depends on how digital content is articulated, who disseminates it where it spreads, and how authorities respond. This study develops a sequential explanation of social media driven rumour spread in Bangladesh and analyses a risk-reduction model. Using a mixed-methods design, this study combines content analysis of viral rumour incidents, interviews with journalists, diffusion pathway mapping within closed networks, influencer, and digital security stakeholders. Presenting information suggests that escalation is most likely when identity threats circulate through trusted local networks and confusing institutional responses. Employing Social Exchange Theory, the study argues that perceived institutional failure facilitates negative reciprocity and accumulation. This study also suggests a mitigation strategy structured around early detection, rapid institutional communication, and locally credible counter-narratives.",

        "authors": "Johannes Petry",
        "abstract": "This chapter investigates the growing importance of Asia within the global financial system and analyzes its implications for the liberal script. First, the chapter explores the place of finance within the liberal script, investigating the paradigm shift from embedded liberalism to neoliberalism and subsequently growing importance of capital-market based finance for economic allocation within the Western script. Second, the autonomous origins of developmentalism in Asian financial scripts are discussed which markedly differ from (neo)liberal conceptions of finance. Third, and moving beyond the neoliberal-developmental dichotomy, the chapter conducts a comparative analysis of the five largest Asian financial systems: China, Korea, India, Japan, and Singapore. In doing so, the chapter identifies significant variations of how Asian finance relates to the liberal script, ranging between accommodation, resistance, and contestation. While maintaining some developmental characteristics, Japan and Singapore largely accommodate the liberal script. In contrast, we can observe resistance to conform with the liberal script in Korea and India where developmental characteristics maintain a prominent role and steps are taken to enable a controlled co-existence. Finally, only China truly contests the liberal script, both through the intensity and international reach of its developmental characteristics but most importantly through other actors’ reaction towards it. The chapter thus illustrates that while there are significant differences between (more) developmental Asian and (more) neoliberal Western financial systems, the rise of Asia represents only a partial contestation of the neoliberal financial script, which cannot, however, be separated from broader geopolitical constellations that challenge the liberal script.",

Using micro-level data from Brazil, I exploit variation in the supply of government bonds at different maturities to estimate the causal effect of additional government debt outstanding on firm issuance decisions. I find that at early stages of development, government debt complements corporate debt, implying that additional government debt outstanding at a given maturity causes firms to issue more. These effects ultimately increase long-term debt issuance and investment across firms, with stronger responses from companies with higher asset duration. However, as markets mature and government debt levels rise, I document a shift from complementarity to substitution. This evidence can be rationalized through government debt reducing corporate pricing uncertainty by providing pricing benchmarks and facilitating price discovery in bond markets.",

This pilot study examined smartphone use behaviors, awareness of RF-EMF exposure, and selected exposure relevant practices among high school and college students. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 60 high school students and 72 college students to characterize daily smartphone use across social networking, communication, and academic activities; device proximity behaviors during daytime and nighttime; network type (4G/5G); and awareness of regulatory exposure concepts, including Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). Descriptive statistics and exploratory subgroup comparisons were conducted. Results indicated substantial daily smartphone use across both groups, with college students reporting significantly greater total use and higher engagement across social networking, calling/texting, and study related activities compared with high school students (all p ≤ .005; small-to-moderate effect sizes). Awareness of RF-EMF exposure concepts and regulatory metrics was limited among participants. Exposure relevant behaviors, including close body proximity during daytime use and placement of phones near sleeping areas at night, were common across both groups. College students were significantly more likely to report use of 5G enabled devices than high school students (p = .045), although the effect size was small. These findings highlight important gaps in technology related risk awareness and health literacy among younger populations. The results underscore the need for improved risk communication strategies, educational interventions, and interdisciplinary research on how emerging digital infrastructures shape everyday technology use, perceptions of risk, and informed decision making in contemporary society.",

In two studies (UK, N = 402; Poland, N = 799), national narcissism was negatively related to pacifism and, in Study 2, to democracy, while positively linked to anarchism. National identification, however, was related to lower support for anarchism but higher support for democracy and pacifism (only in Study 2). Additionally, national narcissism was negatively linked to voting intentions, whereas national identification was positively associated with them, mediated by support for democracy. Our research showed that national identity is linked to support for different political visions of the world, which have distinct effects on the functioning of society.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates expenditure of European parties in referendum campaigns. Previous work exploring why parties initiate referendums hints at the importance of subsequent campaigns to parties, but theoretical insights regarding party behavior in campaigning contexts are fragmented and limited. We argue that party expenditure indicates the extent of their engagement, and identifying explanatory factors can offer insights into underlying strategic goals driving parties in their behavior. Drawing on referendum instrumentalization literature and existing empirical studies, we propose a framework with three strategic factors and corresponding hypotheses. These are tested using official expenditure data for 47 parties campaigning in 24 referendums in eight European countries through bivariate and multivariate analysis. Our findings mainly suggest that parties see referendum campaigns as avenues for image-building, spending more on average when they initiate them and when referendums are publicly salient. Additionally, parties seemingly prioritize elections, while spending limits are ineffective in curbing expenditure.",

        "authors": "Maria Castiglioni, Fausta Ongaro",
        "abstract": "From 1961 in Italy the average number of individuals per household decreased from 3.6 to 2.4 in 2011 and to 2.2 in 2022, and the proportion of households with six or more members or more from 14.4% to 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. Large families, particular those with four or more children, are often associated with poverty, but, given their rarity, they are extremely difficult to study. They are essentially unknown, especially in contexts of very low fertility, such as Italy. We aim to characterize families with four or more children (largest-large families) and to identify the socio-demographic factors that distinguish them from families with one or two children (small families) which represent the prevailing model. To do this, we apply multivariate logistic models to microdata from the 2011 Italian Population and Housing Census. This is the last Census conducted in Italy on universal population basis. Sample surveys are usually not large enough to enable in-depth analyses of the processes underlying the formation of this type of families. The census source also allows analyses to be conducted separately for the native and non-native populations. Results suggest a socio-economic polarization of largest-large families and a negative association with women’s education among both native and non-native populations. Among Italian couples only, re-partnering is a predictor of having a largest-large family and couples in which the male partner is self-employed are more likely to have four or more children than those with employed men. Regional cultural and institutional differences also play a non-negligible role.",

        "authors": "Janet Loebach, Rouzbeh Rahai, Asiya Natekal, Cory Parker, Byoung-Suk Kweon, Patsy Eubanks Owens",
        "abstract": "Economic inequality in the U.S. has risen sharply over the past three decades, overlapping with persistent racial, ethnic, and spatial segregation to produce entrenched neighborhood-level disparities in health. Youth are especially vulnerable to these neighborhood effects, facing disproportionate risks from adverse environmental conditions. This study examines whether neighborhood disadvantage is associated with both increased prevalence of youth health risks and lower provision of green infrastructure across four U.S. cities (Houston, TX; Minneapolis, MN; Prince George’s County, MD; San Francisco, CA). We further test whether green space moderates the relationship between disadvantage and youth health. Census-tract analyses show that neighborhood disadvantage is strongly correlated with higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, and poor mental health among youth. Disadvantaged neighborhoods had significantly less park space and tree canopy cover, and areas with limited green space showed higher risks for all three health concerns. Greater tree canopy was specifically associated with reduced obesity risk. Crucially, interaction analyses revealed that higher proportions of park space substantially weakened the negative effects of disadvantage across all health outcomes. Findings underscore systemic underinvestment in green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighborhoods and highlight the protective potential of urban green space as a public health strategy for vulnerable youth.",

        "authors": "Tarnell Brown",
        "abstract": "Individuals released from jails and prisons face extremely high risks of fatal overdose and reincarceration, yet many jurisdictions continue to underprovide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), recovery housing, and supervised consumption services. At the same time, recovery residences and diversion courts are expanding without a clear framework for institutional design. This paper develops a mechanism-design model of harm-reduction policy at the interface of criminal justice and community treatment. A public funder chooses a funding regime and certification rules, diversion judges set the stringency of supervision and treatment conditions, recovery residence providers decide whether to operate abstinence-only or MOUD-inclusive housing, and high-risk individuals choose whether to comply or relapse. The model yields a punitive equilibrium, supported by abstinence-only funding and strict conditions, and a harm-reduction equilibrium under MOUD-inclusive funding and flexible conditions. Using effect sizes from Rhode Island’s statewide corrections MOUD program, Massachusetts’ jail-based MOUD pilots, and recent recovery housing evaluations, we show that the harm-reduction equilibrium is Pareto-superior for funders, judges, providers, and high-severity residents, yet the punitive equilibrium can remain risk-dominant because of political and informational frictions. We then embed the game in a computational social choice framework: stakeholders hold multi-dimensional preferences over policy bundles—combinations of funding rules, certification standards, diversion guidelines, and overdose prevention interventions such as supervised consumption sites—and social choice is constrained by justice-based requirements that rule out policies generating avoidable lethal risk or systematic exclusion of MOUD patients from housing and treatment. The analysis characterizes which harm-reduction mechanisms are implementable as equilibrium outcomes of the institutional game while respecting these constrained social preferences, and it identifies simple instruments—MOUD-inclusive funding commitments, performance-based transparency, and structured diversion defaults—that can move jurisdictions from punitive to harm-reduction equilibria within existing legal constraints.",

        "abstract": "Der Kurzbericht präsentiert zentrale Ergebnisse der zweiten von vier repräsentativen Befragungswellen der Studie Monitor Digitale Arbeitsgesellschaft, die im Rahmen des Forschungsprojekts Meinungsmonitor Künstliche Intelligenz 3.0 durchgeführt wurde. Grundlage sind die Angaben von 1.651 Befragten (925 Erwerbstätige, 726 Nichterwerbstätige) im Juli 2025; der Bericht legt einen besonderen Fokus auf Entwicklungen im Vergleich zur ersten Erhebung zu Beginn des Jahres 2025. Insgesamt bleiben die Einstellungen gegenüber Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in der Bevölkerung ambivalent, zeigen jedoch leichte Verschiebungen hin zu größerer Informiertheit, differenzierteren Bewertungen und steigender Akzeptanz, insbesondere unter Erwerbstätigen. Diese berichten häufiger persönlichen Nutzen durch KI, während die Wahrnehmung gesellschaftlicher Risiken verhaltener positiv ausfällt. In der Arbeitswelt bleibt die affektive Haltung gegenüber KI stabil positiv, zugleich entwickeln sich einzelne kognitive Bewertungen moderat in Richtung positiverer Einschätzungen, etwa in Bezug auf Einkommen, Karrierechancen und Kompetenzanforderungen. Die Jobunsicherheit bleibt insgesamt niedrig; die allgemeine Sorge vor einer KI-bedingten Ersetzung menschlicher Arbeit nimmt leicht ab. Parallel dazu steigt die berufliche Nutzung von KI deutlich, insbesondere von generativer KI, und weitet sich von routinisierten hin zu komplexeren und kreativen Aufgaben aus. Insgesamt deuten die Ergebnisse auf einen graduellen Übergang von Unsicherheit zu stärker erfahrungsbasierter Auseinandersetzung mit KI hin, wobei KI zunehmend als kollegiale Unterstützung wahrgenommen wird, ohne dass bestehende Ambivalenzen vollständig aufgelöst sind.",

        "abstract": "The term ‘paper park’ is widely used to label protected areas that only exist ‘on paper’. Identifying and rectifying paper parks could be critical for producing ‘effectively conserved and managed […] systems of protected areas’, a core component of Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3. However, the term is not well defined and often applied to cases more accurately described as protected areas with low management effectiveness. This inconsistency is problematic because areas where management interventions are entirely absent (true paper parks) fundamentally differ in conceptualisation, monitoring, and required solutions from those where management is insufficient or poorly executed (ineffective management). To address this, here we propose a new paper park definition as “a site that has been legally or otherwise designated as a protected area, but where management interventions have been absent for at least 5 years”. We present a decision tree to identify paper parks and discuss how they differ from other types of conservation areas. We suggest addressing the problem by measuring the extent of paper parks, investigating the causes of absent management, and prioritising investment to implement effective interventions. Without such work, there is a risk that Target 3 will perversely incentivise the creation of more paper parks.",

        "authors": "Zahriatul Aini",
        "abstract": "This study explores the impact of the marketing mix on customer loyalty at the Banda Aceh Branch of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), with satisfaction acting as a mediating variable. In a highly competitive Islamic banking industry, an effective marketing strategy is essential for sustaining customer loyalty. This research employs a quantitative approach, using purposive sampling of 100 customers from five BSI branches in Banda Aceh. Data were collected through a Likert-scale questionnaire and analyzed using multiple linear regression and path analysis. The results indicate that while factors such as place, human resources, and physical evidence contributed to customer loyalty, ineffective promotion and slow service processes reduced it. Furthermore, customer satisfaction plays a mediating role, strengthening the link between the marketing mix and loyalty. These findings emphasize the need for BSI Banda Aceh Branch to improve their service efficiency, enhance human resource quality, and adopt more targeted promotional strategies to retain customers in the long term. Enhancing service efficiency and refining marketing strategies will allow BSI Banda Aceh to maintain a competitive edge in the evolving Islamic banking industry.",

This hypothesis is formalized as a set of quantitative predictions describing cross-cultural urban scaling and tested with archaeological and historical data describing hundreds of cities and polities from across the globe spanning the last 7,000 years.

This paper provides the first comprehensive population-level evidence on age-specific mortality and cause of death patterns in the intersex population compared to the endosex (i.e., not intersex) population. The study relies on diagnostic codes in Danish administrative health data to observe intersex traits at the individual level across the entire population, identifying more than 1.2% of the Danish population as intersex. Results reveal higher mortality among intersex males in early life, driven by deaths related to congenital disorders, but deaths in childhood remain rare in absolute numbers among both intersex and endosex individuals. Distinctive mid- to late-life survival patterns emerge whereby intersex males' survival probabilities outpace those of endosex males, instead converging towards that of endosex females. At the same time, the survival probability of intersex females is lower than that of endosex females, converging towards that of endosex males. Whilst substantial heterogeneity exists across intersex subgroups, overall intersex mortality patterns - like intersex sex characteristics - fall in between the typical patterns of males and females.",

        "abstract": "How do voters in competitive authoritarian systems learn about opposition parties? Electing opposition parties is risky when their governance quality is uncertain, but voters can reduce this uncertainty by observing and learning from neighboring sub-national governments’ experiences with opposition leadership. I examine how opposition governance in neighboring municipalities affects support for opposition candidates in municipal elections in 1990s Mexico. Using a close-election regression discontinuity design, I find that municipalities with exogenous exposure to PRD-governed neighbors increased their support for the PRD by 12-15 percentage points compared to municipalities with PRI-governed neighbors. This effect is specific to the PRD and does not extend to the PAN, a better-known opposition party. These findings provide insight into how governance information spreads across electoral borders and highlight that opposition parties are not necessarily perceived equally in competitive authoritarian systems.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between climate change and pastoralist–farmer conflict in Mali’s Dogon–Fulani communities within the wider Sahel region. The problem addressed stems from the increasing environmental pressures (such as drought, desertification, and erratic rainfall) that intensify resource competition amid fragile governance and deep-seated ethnic tensions. The study’s objectives were to examine how climate change contributes to these conflicts, identify key conflict drivers, and propose strategies to mitigate their impacts. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, 56 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024 were purposively selected from the Google Scholar database. Data were thematically analysed under three categories: environmental pressures, institutional responses, and conflict transformation mechanisms. The findings reveal that environmental degradation acts as a conflict catalyst only where weak governance and social exclusion prevail. Statistics from the region indicate that mean annual temperatures have increased significantly since the 1960s, while rainfall in the Sahel has become increasingly erratic, leading to a 40% loss of livestock in past extreme drought cycles and displacing hundreds of thousands in central Mali. Yet, communities that maintain inclusive local mediation structures experience fewer violent clashes. The study concludes that sustainable peace in the Sahel depends on integrating environmental resilience with effective governance. It recommends strengthening the rule of law, enhancing state capacity, adopting climate-smart and technology-driven agricultural practices, and transitioning to modern ranching systems to reduce farmer–herder competition and build long-term regional stability.",

        "abstract": "Problems such as persistent inequality, institutional decay, performative governance, and large scale economic costs from global conflicts suggest a deeper structural flaw within the economic reasoning itself, one that cannot be adequately explained by technical inefficiencies or policy errors alone. This paper conceptualizes miseconomics as the practice of conducting economic activity that generates cumulative social harm through normalized societal losses, and misaligned incentives that erode moral responsibility while remaining internally consistent within an institutional framework. Drawing on classical moral philosophy, normative economic critiques, and cases from governance failures across multiple political systems, the study analyses moral entropy to describe a pattern of progressive institutional disorder. Governmental failure is examined through the conceptual framework of Lazeez Fair governance, wherein symbolic, performative, and indulgent interventions substitute substantive reform, allowing dysfunction to persist despite visible action. The paper further illustrates these dynamics though global patterns of corruption, institutional capture, and the selected cases of proxy warfare, showing patterns through which costs appear externalized onto vulnerable populations while benefits accrue narrowly. It concludes that without a structural realignment of incentives and a reintegration of moral responsibility into mainstream economic thought and governance- stability, sustainability, and development- risk remaining structurally unattainable. The central claim is that economic failure is not primarily a shortage of analytical tools and normative ideologies, but a failure of moral alignment embedded within decision making systems. Recognizing and correcting miseconomics is therefore presented as a necessary condition for restoring coherence between economic theory, development of society, and human wellbeing.",

        "abstract": "The most recent conjunctures of financial criticality have brought about evident institutional and socio-economic transformation trajectories; looking at the Western context, the policy field of welfare assistance and protection has seemingly been affected by these changes. Since the main theoretical foundations for the comparative study of these regimes of public aid towards socio-economic disadvantage primarily derive from scientific contributions that are previous to this alteration window, we suggest the opportunity of drafting a new epistemic framework, which, on one hand, may be able to renovate the analytical and heuristic appropriateness of the so called ‘regime approach’, while, on the other, providing a precise and in-depth glance at the current geography of welfare architectures within the developed economies’ perimeter, mainly relying on quantitative indicators inherent (i) to the private sector’s participation in welfare provision, (ii) to the public actor’s generosity of treatment and (iii) to the familist architectural propensity. The 28-case-studies field-testing of the framework, conducted via modern HCA, KCA and PCA techniques provides results that corroborate the practical reliability of the fiscal design model as a means of welfare legacy family identification.",

        "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
        "abstract": "This paper deepens the \"Equilibrium Theory Endogenizing Imbalances\" based on asset dynamics, as presented in the previous study (Kitamura, 2025), by incorporating concepts from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. While the previous work proposed a model where imbalances are perpetuated through asset preference and capital diffusion, this study extends the framework into a model where \"effective asset potential\"—defined as the asset level divided by the rate of return on assets—acts as the driving force behind capital flows. It demonstrates a mechanism in which the capital efficiency of each nation significantly determines its economic trajectory. Through observations using multilateral data, this paper reveals that individual economies exist under a tension between \"subjective equilibrium,\" aimed at utility maximization, and the \"pressure of entropy increase\" inherent in asset dynamics. Consequently, the global economy has polarized into \"self-organizing economies\" that concentrate and accumulate capital, and \"diffusive economies\" that primarily disperse and dissipate capital. This paper presents a novel perspective that views the global economy as a \"dissipative structure\" maintained through the interdependence of these distinct phases. Based on this analysis, the paper argues that for an economic system to remain sustainable, it is essential to involve maintaining the gradient of asset potential within the system by promoting innovation and eliminating \"stagnation\" through redistribution policies. Ultimately, this paper proposes that what economics terms \"equilibrium\" is equivalent to \"thermal death\" in physics; therefore, the goal of economics should be the avoidance rather than the realization of such a state, making the perspective of \"entropy management\" indispensable.",

        "authors": "Don Sanjeewa Alwis",
        "abstract": "The institutional approach to development typically classifies colonial institutions as inclusive or extractive. This categorization is based on formal design. This classification often overlooks how rights and protections were distributed within societies, assuming access rather than measuring it. This paper develops a Selective Inclusion framework, arguing that colonial regimes frequently built formally capable institutions while restricting access for indigenous and majority populations. To operationalize this idea, I construct a Partial Access Index (PAI) measured at independence for a sample of 62 former colonies. The index codes access in four domains: political franchise, access to executive constraints, legal uniformity, and educational-economic participation. Descriptive evidence reveals a Settler Colony Paradox: countries commonly treated as benchmarks of inclusive institutions often exhibited substantial exclusion of non-settler populations. Empirically, higher institutional access is associated with lower long-term income inequality. Robustness checks, including jackknife and region-exclusion tests, confirm that this relationship is not driven by outliers. The pattern is non-linear and region-specific. Latin America exhibits high inequality under partial inclusion. Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits high inequality under low access. These findings suggest that formal institutional strength can coexist with restricted access, and that who is included matters as much as what institutions exist. The distinction of institutional form from institutional access clarifies the persistent distributional consequences of colonial rule.",

        "abstract": "As autism and ADHD cohorts reach later life in growing numbers, population aging frameworks face a critical challenge: conventional models assume aging occurs independently of lifelong neurodevelopmental disability. This review synthesizes findings from autism research, life-course theory, and aging studies to examine how lifelong neurodevelopmental differences interact with age-related health and system demands. By integrating evidence on physical health, mental health, service access, and regulatory demands, the review identifies mechanisms through which aging-related challenges emerge in autistic and ADHD populations and highlights implications for clinical care and support planning. We show that later-life outcomes reflect interaction effects between stable neurodevelopmental profiles, universal biological aging, and cumulative institutional exposure, rather than diagnosis timing or progressive trait change. Functional changes often attributed to decline instead reflect reduced recovery capacity under increasing health complexity and system demands. This reframing has direct implications for population planning, healthcare design, and service integration, particularly for high-support individuals who encounter aging-disability interactions earliest. The review concludes by identifying critical research gaps and system stress points requiring anticipatory policy as neurodevelopmentally diverse populations age.",

        "authors": "Karl Patrick R. Mendoza",
        "abstract": "This article reexamines political modernization by developing a theory of vernacular moral order to explain how political legitimacy is sustained under conditions of institutional fragility. Drawing on public scandals and everyday civic discourse in the Philippines, it shows how moral reasoning is organized through vernacular grammars such as hiya, tino, and bait, which translate concerns with trust, accountability, and authority into relational practices of judgment and repair. Rather than treating scandal as institutional breakdown or moral deviance, the article theorizes scandal as a recurrent activation mechanism through which publics evaluate authority and recalibrate legitimacy when formal procedures fail to command confidence. These vernacular moral grammars do not represent residues of tradition opposed to modern politics; instead, they function as culturally embedded infrastructures that enable political order to endure despite weak institutions and persistent uncertainty. By foregrounding moral reasoning as relational, affective, and culturally situated, the article challenges institutionalist accounts of modernization and legitimacy, demonstrating how political order is sustained not by the completion of modernization but through ongoing moral coordination in its aftermath.",

Tracing my adoption of an injured stray cat encountered in a habitual workspace, I examine how hesitation, domestic negotiation, and eventual commitment unfolded alongside wider social encounters with animal neglect and my own developing engagement with moral-relational public life. I conceptualize trust not as a calculated expectation of reciprocity but as a redistribution of contextualized vulnerability and a temporal reordering of everyday routines. The cat’s early-morning activity, which reorganized household and scholarly rhythms, becomes an analytic hinge for examining how care inscribes itself into bodily time. I argue that interspecies adoption offers a micro-foundation for understanding trust as an embodied, temporal, and morally generative practice of being held.",

        "abstract": "The procurement of residential care facilities presents opportunities for design innovation yet is challenged by various contextual factors, including country-specific policies, regulations, research, care models, organisational practices, and socioeconomic influences. Despite the impact of these factors on built quality, research on their role in supporting design innovation remains limited. Defining procurement as four phases—Planning, Design, Construction, and Occupancy— this study aims to provide a holistic understanding of these dynamics to identify pathways to design innovation. Objectives are, to: 1) create a diagrammatic representation of the procurement process for new residential care facilities, highlighting key stakeholders; 2) identify and prioritise contextual factors that significantly influence innovation in residential care facility design; and 3) explore the facilitators and barriers to innovation at each step of the process to propose actionable strategies for overcoming them. A multi-method qualitative approach included a systematic literature review, analysis of 38 case studies, and a two-round national e-Delphi study with 32 experts from four stakeholder groups. The findings offer a foundation for policymakers to assess the influence of various factors, reframe power dynamics between key stakeholders, and explore transdisciplinary collaboration models to foster innovation. The study reveals that many challenges are not unique to residential care facilities but reflect broader systemic issues across sectors and building typologies.",

        "authors": "Henri de Ruiter, Kirsten Vegt, Hester Volten, Margaret Gold, Janneke Elberse",
        "abstract": "Citizens are increasingly using low-cost sensors to measure their surroundings, for example air quality. Sensor measurements offer greater temporal and spatial resolution and therefore have the potential to complement official monitoring practices. However, the integration of citizen science (CS) data into official frameworks is still limited. CS data are often perceived as “messy”, with barriers such as concerns about data quality, the absence of standard methodologies, and perceptions of unreliability. While these challenges are well-documented, the critical role of infrastructure in bridging CS data and institutional frameworks has received less attention. This study examines the case of Measure Together, a government-funded project and community that functions as a boundary organisation to bridge the gap between CS initiatives and institutional air quality monitoring. We explore how a CS infrastructure emerges through a combination of relational, organisational and technical factors aimed at making sense of CS data. We further analyse how this CS infrastructure is beginning to merge with official monitoring infrastructure, resulting in a hybrid infrastructure that seeks to combine local data and insights from CS with the standardised and rigorous approaches of official monitoring. Our analysis highlights critical tensions, including conflicts between local and generic data, the action-oriented expectations of many CS participants versus the long-term timelines of official infrastructure, and challenges around trust and standardisation. We conclude by identifying pathways to navigate these tensions, emphasizing the need for adaptive, participatory infrastructure that balance rigour with societal relevance, fostering greater integration between CS and official infrastructures.",

        "abstract": "The United States, long regarded as a stable liberal democracy, is undergoing rapid democratic backsliding that increasingly targets liberal civil and social rights. How do citizens in other liberal democracies respond to such developments? We address this question using two causal strategies. First, drawing on a quasi-experiment with individual-level data from thirty-five countries (N=32,080), we show that attacks on women’s rights significantly undermine the United States’ democratic standing among European publics. Second, a pre-registered vignette experiment in Britain (N=2,993) demonstrates that news about attacks on liberal civil and social rights -- specifically the right to protest and LGBTQ+ rights -- reduces perceptions of the United States as a democracy and lowers public willingness to cooperate with the US. These effects are driven by updated beliefs about the United States’ adherence to shared liberal values rather than fears of democratic backsliding at home. Our findings demonstrate that liberal backsliding in the United States carries substantial cross-national costs, weakening its democratic reputation and eroding public support for international cooperation among citizens in allied democratic nations.",

        "authors": "Mascha Samkova",
        "abstract": "This paper employs a novel approach in applying the cheap talk signalling game to study the EU accession game of the 10 Central and Eastern European states that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007. The interdisciplinary application of a Bayesian game to international relations reveals the strategic interactions between the Union and applicant states in the light of the Copenhagen criteria and the unprecedented challenges countries faced during the post-Communist transition since 1989. The paper first presents the historical background about the EU accession process, debates on EU conditionality and existing game-theoretical approaches, before presenting the timeline and data on accession and reform speed of applicant states from 1989 to 2007. The model applies a signalling game to the negotiations process where the European Commission’s annual progress reports are seen as costless, unverifiable and observable signals to the applicant states about their final EU accession speed. It is demonstrated that possible equilibria outcomes can be uninformative or informative, depending on the players’ divergence of interests with regards to reform speed. Furthermore, the model is used to explain the outcomes seen in three ex-post case studies, taking into account additional domestic and external factors that shaped the varying outcomes of accession and reform speeds in the two EU enlargement waves in the 2000s.",

        "authors": "Moses Boudourides",
        "abstract": "Qualitative and mixed-methods research has long balanced interpretive depth against empirical scope. The rapid expansion of digital and textual data has intensified this tension, creating methodological pressures that challenge established qualitative workflows. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as a means of addressing these pressures by enabling large-scale textual processing and synthesis. However, their apparent fluency risks conflating linguistic coherence with interpretation, thereby obscuring judgment, accountability, and scholarly responsibility. This paper argues that the methodological significance of LLMs for qualitative and mixed-methods research lies not in automation but in carefully governed computational assistance. Drawing on qualitative traditions centered on meaning, interpretation, and theory-building, the paper situates LLMs as infrastructural tools whose use must be governed by explicit research design, validation, and reflexive oversight. Particular attention is given to forms of failure that exceed factual error, including bibliographic distortion and loss of structural integrity in scholarly representation. The analysis develops a framework organized around research design patterns, human judgment under computational assistance, and three interrelated dimensions of validity: interpretive, integrative, and bibliographic. Ethical implications concerning consent, representation, bias, and responsibility at scale are also examined. The paper concludes that responsible integration of LLMs requires strengthening—not relaxing—the methodological commitments that define qualitative and mixed-methods inquiry. Carefully governed computational assistance, rather than automation, provides the appropriate orientation for incorporating computational assistance while preserving interpretive rigor.",

        "authors": "Katrin Firl, Nora Müller, Theresa Nutz",
        "abstract": "This study examines how couples’ relative resources and gender ideology shape women’s exposure to method-level burdens embedded in contraceptive methods in Germany. Contraceptive labor is conceptualized as the physical, financial, and psychosocial costs and risks structurally embedded in contraceptive methods and unequally distributed between women and men. Using nationally representative data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), we assign partnered women aged 18–49 a method-specific Contraceptive Labor Score (CLS) capturing these structural burdens. Regression analyses show limited support for resource-based explanations: relative employment is not associated with women’s exposure to method-level contraceptive burdens, while women who are more highly educated than their partners are more likely to be exposed to methods with higher CLS values. In contrast, the gender ideology hypothesis holds: women with traditional gender beliefs face higher method-level burdens than egalitarian women. Supplementary analyses using contraceptive efficacy as an alternative outcome show that exposure to method-level burdens does not fully correspond to contraceptive effectiveness. By linking couple-level inequalities to structural characteristics of contraceptive methods, this study extends research on the gendered division of unpaid work to reproductive labor and highlights the role of institutionalized contraceptive arrangements in sustaining women’s disproportionate responsibility for fertility control.",

Most - if not all - autocracies are not ideologically neutral, but can be ascribed to ideological “brands” (Left/Right). These, in turn, serve as powerful heuristic cues in party competition. Combining insights from signaling theory and mnemonic politics, we argue that party elites in new democracies will try to distance themselves from the previous dictator’s ideological side in pursuit of legitimacy and in line with a spatial competition framework. Consistently, we show evidence of asymmetric fragmentation in the party systems of both former Left- and Right-Wing regimes, with fewer parties located on the dictator’s side. This difference persists in time, waning as party systems consolidate. Our analysis shows how such an escape from the stigma has substantive implications for the average ideological slant of the party system and its polarization.",

        "abstract": "Do dictatorships create an ideological backlash in new democracies? Existing evidence documents shifts in public opinion and party supply, but cannot distinguish genuine preference change from stigma attached to former regimes. We address this by focusing on the actors most vulnerable to such stigma: parties aligned with the Dictator’s ideological Side (DS). If backlash is genuine, parties’ policy platforms and the heuristics signaling them should shift in tandem; if stigma operates, heuristic signals should move more than policy. To isolate this divergence, we compare parties’ names - highly visible yet non-binding cues - to manifesto-based ideological positions. In a preregistered survey, 988 UK-based respondents guessed the ideology of 1,604 parties from 53 countries using only their English-translated names. Names are markedly less informative about \"true\" ideology in post-authoritarian regimes than in mature democracies; a gap driven by DS parties, systematically perceived as more centrist than their manifestos indicate.",

This study reflects on the influence of social media in public relations scholarship and examines social media research to identify strengths, gaps, and assumptions in this body of literature. Using structural topic modeling and bipartite network analysis, this research models every word published in six leading journals studying public relations from 2012 - 2022 in two separate studies. First, a census of the 2,675 articles, totaling 15,926,460 words, is analyzed to establish the percentage of scholarship related to social media, what methodologies are used to study social media, and how social media interacts with other topics within public relations. Second, a subset of 666 articles that heavily emphasize social media are examined in order to identify the key social media topics within public relations scholarship. This research finds that few social-media specific topics are being studied in public relations scholarship and that even research focused on social media is more heavily emphasizing existing public relations theory than social media-specific topics.",

        "abstract": "Preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) research has long relied on profiling approaches that draw on demographic variables, ideological labels, and observable late-stage behaviours. These strategies have consistently performed poorly, and their limitations are further exposed in contemporary digital environments, where ideological identities are fluid, most individuals who engage with extremist content never mobilise, and a highly fragmented ideological landscape frustrates stable categorisation. In parallel, psychological research has identified mechanisms that help explain why only a minority escalate to violence, yet these mechanisms remain difficult to operationalise and test at scale. This Perspective argues that recent advances in artificial intelligence—broadly defined to include statistical learning, generative modelling, and decision-oriented optimisation—provide tools to close this operational gap when explicitly aligned with psychological theory. At the individual level, machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models enable measurement and forecasting from heterogeneous digital traces. At the interpersonal level, graph-based approaches may capture influence dynamics, exposure pathways, and the evolution of extremist social milieus. At the collective level, agent-based simulations and field experiments support explanatory and counterfactual analysis of mobilisation processes. We advance a hybrid research agenda that prioritises theory testing, mechanism evaluation, and carefully bounded intervention analysis over automated individualised profiling, advancing a more mechanistic, empirically grounded, and scalable science of P/CVE.",

Results show that higher Native spirituality and identity were correlated with lower depression and anxiety, as well as lower perceived social support. These results highlight the importance of understanding historical and political factors influencing identities within Native communities as well as differing definitions and views on the concepts of religion, spirituality, and social support and highlight the need for longitudinal study to better understand these relationships.",

In response, UK suicide prevention policies have suggested that there needs to be tailored, prioritised and culturally appropriate methods of prevention employed. However, what these should, or even could, look like has been left undefined and unguided. To begin to address this, in this research I employed systematic mapping methods, identifying 79 services, groups and organisations providing suicide prevention to LGBTQ+ communities and engaging with 37 practitioner and facilitators for informal reflections on their service provisions in the UK. Reflecting critically on the findings of this, I explore the pathologising problematics and productive potentialities of expanding suicide prevention beyond the conventional disclosure-to-recovery, mental health model that dominates the landscape of suicide prevention both in the UK, and globally. I ultimately argue that the discomforting tension between the problematic and the productive may offer us fertile space to not only consider what LGBTQ+ suicide prevention is, but what all suicide prevention could be.",

        "abstract": "Low health literacy, an established risk factor of poor health outcomes, may be applied to better understand individual health related decisions and actions. Health literacy can help explain why and how people make prevention and treatment choices and is particularly salient in developing interventions among populations experiencing health disparities. American Indians experience the highest smoking and tobacco use rates of any racial/ethnic group in the United States, yet health literacy has never been examined for association with tobacco use. In this project, we developed and tested an instrument to assess tobacco health literacy among American Indians using a long (THL-L) or short (THL-S) form. The instrument was developed to measure prose, numeracy, and document literacy across five domains (health risks, addiction, cessation, environmental tobacco smoke, and cost). We tested both a long (25 question) and a short form (12 question) by administrating them to American Indians aged 18+ years attending community events at both urban and reservation communities in Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota (THL-L: N=205; THL-S: N=114). Descriptive statistics were computed for all scored THL-L questions and demographic characteristics. The average score on the long form instrument was 17.76 (SD = 3.53); for the short form, it was 8.18 (SD = 2.17). THL-S scores show no statistically significant difference (p=0.16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Both long- and short-form instruments appropriately assessed tobacco health literacy among American Indians. Neither measure includes traditional tobacco as a domain or item, suggesting this index may, with further testing, be appropriate for other populations.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates how labeling AI-generated content (AIGC) influences users’ perceptions of authenticity in social media environments. Motivated by emerging global regulations mandating the disclosure of AI-generated media, we designed a pre-registered survey experiment to test two main questions: (1) Do AI labels reduce the perceived authenticity of AI-generated images? (2) Does exposure to labeled content affect perceived authenticity in unlabeled images (a potential spillover effect)? The pre-analysis plan and materials are available on OSF (see link below). We conducted a survey experiment with a German sample (N = 877) in which participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group without labels, a process-based label group (“AI-generated”), or a harm-based label group (“Misleading”). Participants viewed twelve Instagram-style posts, six of which contained AI-generated or AI-altered content. Perceived authenticity was measured by asking whether the depicted events actually occurred. Our results show that both labeling strategies significantly reduced perceived authenticity of AI-generated images, with average reductions of about 0.27 standard deviations. We also find evidence of an implied authenticity effect: exposure to labeled content slightly increased perceived authenticity in unlabeled images (about one-fifth the size of the direct labeling effect). Exploratory analyses indicate that internet skills and age are associated with perceived authenticity differences. By embedding labels in Instagram-style posts, our study increases ecological validity compared to earlier work focused on headlines or generic stimuli. Situated in Germany, a frontrunner in digital platform regulation, the findings provide rare non-U.S. evidence on AI labeling and contribute directly to ongoing policy debates.",

        "authors": "Olivier Y. Rouquette, Yannik Peters, Johannes B. Gruber, Sebastian Stier, Katrin Weller",
        "abstract": "The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) introduces, for the first time, a legal framework granting researchers access to data from very large online platforms and search engines. This represents a profound shift in how platform data can be obtained: access becomes a regulated right rather than a technical workaround. Yet the DSA’s promise of transparency depends on the ability of researchers to meet stringent legal and technical requirements for security, confidentiality, and data protection. Few researchers can do so individually. This commentary argues that the emerging DSA regime makes research infrastructure a precondition for meaningful and lawful data access. Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and other institutional arrangements can mediate between three actors — researchers, platforms, and Digital Services Coordinators — ensuring trust, compliance, and accountability. In this role, infrastructures become not just technical means but governance interfaces that translate regulatory obligations into practical research conditions. The shift from ad hoc data collection to regulated access requires more than new rules; it demands a reorientation of the research community itself. Building and sustaining infrastructures is now integral to enabling independent, transparent, and reproducible platform research. The DSA, we suggest, inaugurates a new phase in the politics of data access — one in which infrastructures mediate the relationship between science, regulation, and the digital platforms that shape public life.",

These bills signal a shift in the local political climate, pressuring public colleges and universities to realign their priorities in anticipation of future legal changes. Using federal data on new postsecondary hires, we find that the introduction of state anti-diversity legislation was followed by an increase in the share of White men and a substantial decline in the share of faculty hires from marginalized groups, even before bills were signed into law. This shift was most pronounced at schools highly dependent on state funding. Our findings suggest that “anticipatory compliance” with political intervention varies by organizational revenue streams, raising concerns for the future of higher education organizations largely dependent on public grants and appropriations.",

        "abstract": "Adolescents undergo critical neuropsychological development, but this rarely meaningfully informs secondary pedagogy. Yet, many argue that a “whole-person,” developmental approach is needed to durably address adolescents’ achievement, equity and mental health issues. This begs a question: Do teachers with developmentally informed perspectives enact higher quality practices? Forty public secondary teachers from schools serving low-SES urban communities were nominated for excellence by their administrators. We interviewed these teachers about their approaches. An independent team rated their classroom teaching. Qualitative interview analysis yielded four characteristic “pedagogical narratives”, which we ordered according to the social-cognitive complexity with which teachers integrated considerations of students’ personal/intellectual development into their justifications for their teaching practices. In order of decreasing social-cognitive complexity, we named these narratives: transformative, responsive, transactional, and gatekeeping. We found that quantitized narrative social-cognitive complexity scores, representing developmental orientation, statistically predict the quality of teachers’ practices, irrespective of years of teaching experience. We also found that “gatekeeping” narratives often describe teachers’ sense of being overwhelmed, pressed for time, and worried for youth. Our findings suggest that understanding the coordinated nature of adolescents’ personal/intellectual development and academic learning improves teachers’ practice and lessens their stress—important information for reforming secondary education and educator preparation.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive decision making is the process of flexibly adjusting strategies and behaviors in response to changing task demands and environmental characteristics. This adaptiveness is characterized by the ability to dynamically consider multiple alternatives, update one’s approach as new information emerges, and make flexible, context-sensitive choices to meet evolving challenges. Although infants are often described as efficient and adaptive information seekers, research with preschoolers suggests that truly adaptive decision-making and possibility reasoning emerge only later in childhood. This apparent discrepancy raises important questions about how children develop the ability to integrate possibility reasoning into adaptive information search and decision-making under uncertainty. To address this gap, we designed a novel paradigm to investigate whether younger preschoolers can adjust their exploratory strategies in response to the probability structure of a task. In Experiment 1, 2- and 3-year-old children (n = 156) chose between two actions in a Search task (searching for a ball) and two boxes in a Catch task (catching a ball). Before the test, they learned about the probability structure where the ball was either more likely to come from one exit (Skewed condition) or equally likely from any exit (Uniform condition). Even 2-year-olds adjusted their strategies accordingly, choosing the large box more often in the Uniform condition and the small box in the Skewed condition. In Experiment 2 (n = 46), we replicated this finding with 2- to 4-year-olds. These results suggest that adaptive decision-making emerges as early as age 2, emphasizing the importance of designs that capture children's adaptiveness while contributing to the literature on probability reasoning.",

Using a representative survey of 1,671 Muslim immigrants in Germany and a preregistered online survey experiment, we investigate the effects of inclusive religious messages on intergroup attitudes. Our observational analyses indicate that Muslims who hear sermons from non-politicized (vs. politicized) religious leaders are less likely to justify religiously motivated violence, feel hostility toward Christians, and are more likely to identify with both their ethnic and national groups. These effects are mediated by identity inclusiveness. The experimental results reveal that exposure to an inclusive sermon from a prototypical religious leader reduces support for religiously motivated violence and hostility toward Christians but does not affect other attitudes. Finally, we find that immigrants who listen to sermons from politicized religious leaders are no more resistant to changing their attitudes in response to inclusive sermons than others.",

        "abstract": "Homelessness among people with Central and Eastern European (CEE) migratory backgrounds is a concern in several Western European countries, including the Netherlands, where migration from other EU countries is often motivated by perceived employment opportunities. This study aimed to better understand the emergence of CEE labor migrants’ homelessness. Based on interviews with 42 Polish and Romanian labor migrants, we explored patterns of events and situations they described in relation to becoming homeless in the Netherlands. We identified five unique pathways to homelessness, named based on what appeared to be key events and situations: 1) Loss of work as a singular event, 2) Prior vulnerabilities and multiproblem situations, 3) Dissolution from a romantic relationship and loss of work, 4) Homelessness upon arrival and 5) Serious health problems. These pathways and the underlying experiences can inform policy in several ways. Implications include providing more information about living and working in the host country, more thorough recruitment processes, reconsidering combined contracts (work and housing), providing timely support to people who become unemployed, and sheltering and supporting people in cases of homelessness.",

        "abstract": "‘Silent’ evaluation refers to the prospective, non-interventional testing of artificial intelligence (AI) model performance in the intended clinical setting without affecting patient care or institutional operations. The silent evaluation phase has received less attention than in silico algorithm development or formal clinical evaluations, despite increasing recognition of this type of evaluation as a critical phase in an effective translation process for healthcare AI tools. There are currently no formal guidelines for conducting silent AI evaluations in health settings. We undertook a scoping review to identify silent AI evaluations described in the literature, aiming to summarize current practices for the conduct of silent evaluations. We screened PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles fitting our criteria for silent AI evaluations, or ‘silent trials’, published from 2015 to 2025. A total of 891 articles were identified, and 75 met the criteria for inclusion into the final review. We found wide variance in terminology, description, and rationale for silent evaluations; this led to substantial heterogeneity in what was reported. Overwhelmingly, papers reported measurement of AUC, precision/recall, positive and negative predictive values and similar technical performance metrics. Far fewer studies reported the verification of outputs against an in-situ clinical ground truth, and, when reported, the comprehensiveness of such verification was highly variable. We noted relatively less discussion of sociotechnical components such as stakeholder engagement and human-computer interaction elements. We conclude that there is an opportunity to bring together diverse evaluative practices (e.g., from data science, human factors, and other fields) if the silent evaluation phase is to be maximally effective as a translational mechanism these gaps mirror challenges in effective translation of AI tools from “computer to bedside” and identify opportunities to improve silent evaluation protocols that address key translational needs. This is important as healthcare organizations and regulatory bodies worldwide seek guidance for gathering meaningful evidence of the impact of AI tools on clinical practice.",

        "authors": "Johannes Due Enstad",
        "abstract": "Public concern about antisemitism has increased globally in the 21st century, sparking renewed interest from social scientists. However, the crucial question of why trajectories of antisemitic hostility differ between countries remains unanswered due to a lack of studies designed to track temporal and cross-national variation. Addressing this gap, I evaluate the explanatory power of two main lines of argument that divide the literature: generalist and particularist. While generalists see antisemitism as a manifestation of general outgroup hostility common to various forms of prejudice, particularists stress the contextual specificity of antisemitism and posit that its 21st-century expressions are distinctively linked to antizionist sentiment (enmity toward Israel and its supporters). I derive observable implications from these positions and conduct a comparative, longitudinal case study of antisemitic hostility in Germany, Sweden, and Russia (1990--2020), using a mixed-methods approach to integrate incident counts, victimization surveys, media analysis, and expert interviews. Findings match predictions from the particularist position, with flare-ups in the Israel-Palestine conflict generating or catalyzing antisemitic hostility depending on the strength of local antizionist sentiment, thus demonstrating the centrality of the \"Israel factor\" in contemporary antisemitism.",

        "authors": "RALPH RENDELL TOLEDO",
        "abstract": "Public administration systems have intensified accountability and oversight to address corruption, inefficiency, and misuse of public resources. These developments have reinforced an audit society in which verification and performance control increasingly shape everyday administrative routines. Although scholarship widely documents proceduralism, risk aversion, and compliance-oriented behavior under audit-intensive regimes, it has paid limited attention to the behavioral mechanism through which these outcomes are systematically produced. This paper develops the Fear-Based Decision-Making Framework, positioning fear as an institutionalized mechanism linking audit culture and asymmetric accountability to conservative administrative behavior. Using theory-driven conceptual synthesis across Audit Culture Theory, Risk Aversion Theory, and Behavioral Public Administration, the analysis integrates evidence from peer-reviewed literature and institutional reports, with comparative attention to Western and ASEAN governance contexts. The synthesis shows that expanding audit regimes tend to redefine accountability around documentation and procedural defensibility, encouraging anticipatory compliance and narrowing discretionary space. Conservative administrative behavior commonly manifests as rigid rule adherence, documentation inflation, defensive standardization, and discretion avoidance, reflecting loss-avoidance incentives under conditions of retrospective scrutiny. The framework specifies five-part typology of fear: anticipatory, sanction, reputational, interpretive, and institutionalized, and explains how ASEAN scholarship often masks fear-driven behavior through proxy framings such as capacity and compliance narratives. By making fear analytically explicit, the paper reframes conservative administration as an accountability design problem and provides a basis for developing testable propositions and governance reforms that protect integrity without systematically constraining discretion and judgment.",

Drawing on document analysis, and interviews with experts and community members in Sydney, the study identifies four disparities between industry and government imaginaries for Australia - a regional data centre hub, resilient and sovereign digital futures, economic expansion, and capitalising on ‘temporary’ investment opportunities - and the lived, material realities of communities living alongside data centre developments. Building on these findings, the paper contributes to discussions on scaling PD by exploring how PD can attend to vertical inequities by: (i) building critical data centre literacy; (ii) fostering transparency in sustainability governance; and (iii) broadening dominant visions of data centre futures to include community aspirations. Together, these interventions highlight PD’s potential to cultivate more inclusive and sustainable data centre futures.",

This article engages with key findings from the empirical literature on the Indian experience to unpack the complex relationship between sex trafficking and sex work. Interpretations of “exploitation” in both fields are fluid and constantly negotiated in real-world scenarios. Policy measures intended to combat trafficking can inadvertently harm sex workers by increasing surveillance, restricting movement, and heightening vulnerability to exploitation, thus threatening their livelihoods.",

        "authors": "Alessio Lacchè",
        "abstract": "This dissertation investigates how capitalist globalisation undermines traditional local knowledge systems, focusing on the Indian ghani, an ancient artisanal method of producing edible oil. The decline of this practice is analysed within the broader context of Western-driven development, agri-food industrialisation, and liberalisation of the edible oil sector. The study examines epistemological tensions between traditional and modern knowledge, the sociocultural and economic significance of the ghani, and the extent to which artisanal practices can coexist with industrial production in contemporary India. A hybrid deductive–inductive approach was employed, combining a literature review with fieldwork conducted in India. This comprised two surveys allowing both quantitative and qualitative analysis of contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society, ghani workers, NGOs, industry representatives, and academics. Findings reveal declining visibility and practical knowledge of the ghani, yet also a strong sociocultural resonance. This paradox reveals a fading practice that continues to embody memory, identity, and resistance to the homogenisation of global models. Economically, small producers face severe disadvantages in competing with industrial plants and cheap imports, while niche markets provide only limited opportunities for survival. The analysis shows how industrial and policy frameworks structurally marginalise artisans, relegating them to peripheral or subordinated roles, while simultaneously rebranding elements of their cultural value for urban elite markets. This process of “eliticisation” risks detaching artisanal production from its community base, transforming a once accessible tradition into a niche commodity. The study concludes that the decline of the ghani is emblematic of wider processes of epistemic injustice, whereby capitalist globalisation privileges industrial efficiency and consumerist appropriation over cultural continuity, social equity, and ecological sustainability. It calls for a reimagined food system in which artisanal and industrial modes of production are integrated on more equitable terms. Such an approach would recognise the cultural and ecological contributions of traditional practices while harnessing the capacities of modern industry, generating hybrid models that are both more socially just and environmentally resilient. Safeguarding institutions like the ghani is thus not a nostalgic exercise but a vital step towards building plural, inclusive, and sustainable futures.",

        "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
        "abstract": "Anger has long been regarded as an adaptive emotion in human evolution, functioning as a mechanism for negotiation, deterrence, and the correction of unfair treatment. However, in contemporary societies characterized by dense institutional arrangements and long-term social interaction, anger frequently manifests not as an adaptive response but as a source of interpersonal disruption, psychological insecurity, and harassment. Despite its apparent maladaptiveness, anger persists and, in some environments, proliferates. This study proposes a novel theoretical framework, the Anger-as-Indulgence Model (AIM), which conceptualizes anger not as a mere emotional reaction or personality trait, but as an emotional resource that is selected, consumed, and reproduced within socio-ecological systems. Drawing on evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, meme theory, and the author’s prior work on emotional contagion, formal sanction loops, and reverse selection, AIM explains how anger becomes repeatedly chosen through immediate psychological rewards, reward expectations, institutional legitimation, and environmental selection pressure. Central to this model is the redefinition of anger as an indulgent emotion analogous to a consumer good: not physiologically necessary, yet repeatedly consumed due to its reliable short-term rewards, despite long-term social costs. Through anonymized case studies, this paper demonstrates that the indulgent transformation of anger is not dependent on individual personality traits, but on isomorphic socio-ecological configurations across different times, locations, and occupational contexts. The findings suggest that conventional interventions focusing on emotional regulation or moral instruction are insufficient as long as anger remains embedded in reward-generating institutional arrangements. Instead, effective intervention requires reconfiguring environments so that anger no longer produces psychological or organizational rewards. By shifting the analytical focus from managing anger to repositioning it within socio-ecological systems, this study offers a unified explanation for anger dependence, contagion, institutionalization, silence, and avoidance, and provides a structural foundation for addressing anger-related dysfunctions in modern organizations and societies.",

        "abstract": "The archives are one of the important sources of information that can support the processes of administrative and bureaucratic activities. The archives created from processing units will always be improved because the activities of an institution or individual never stop and will grow. One way to reduce the amount excess archives in an organization or agency is by narrowing the archives. Archive reduction is one of the activities of archive management in the archival unit of an institution such as BPJS Ketenagakerjaan Banda Aceh Branch. The purpose of this research is to find out the stages of archive narrowing, and the constraints experienced by the BPJS of Banda Aceh Branch. This research uses qualitative descriptive methods with observational data collection techniques, interviews, and library studies. The result of this research is the production of archive shrinkage in BPJS. The archive is destroyed by the Archival Unit in several ways, and the archive transfer is carried out by the Archival Unit to the Head of ANRI. The transfer of archives to BPJS is done according to the guidelines of JRA. The problems experienced by BPJS are limited archive storage, a lack of human resources, and a lack of training for human resources.",

        "authors": "Elizabeth Davis, Kirstie A. Ruppert, Chau My Thi Le, Dat Cao, Trung Cao",
        "abstract": "Bear bile is a highly demanded medicinal product in certain areas of Vietnam, which contributes to the decline of Asiatic black bears and sun bears. Multiple conservation strategies, such as closing bear farms and raising awareness, have been enacted in Vietnam to address this issue, but there have been few targeted demand reduction efforts. Here, we present the design and evaluation of a campaign to reduce demand for bear bile, founded on the principles of conservation marketing. We used a Theory of Change informed by baseline consumer research and consultations with international and local stakeholders to guide the design of the campaign. We used quantitative surveys to measure the prevalence of bear bile use in a Before-After-Control-Treatment (BACT) design (n = 1,690 individuals (pre-campaign: 767; post-campaign: 923)). Bear bile use declined by 97% in our treatment site (from 16% (CI: 12 – 19%) to 1% (CI: 0.3 – 2%)), and did not change significantly in the control site. We can conclude that our campaign did change behavior, and reduced demand for bear bile in our target community. We also found a significant shift to disagreement for the belief “Bears are easy to find in the wild”, indicating that accurate knowledge about bear population decline in Vietnam increased in the treatment site. Our results illustrate the conservation potential of demand reduction campaigns, particularly when paired with efforts to decrease the available supply of wildlife products.",
