        "title": "Emotional Words, Emotional Contexts: Investigating Emotional Valence in Children’s Writing and Word Learning",
        "authors": "Yuzhen Dong, Matthew HC Mak, Robert Hepach, Kate Nation",
        "abstract": "There is a relationship between the emotional valence of a word and the valence of its surrounding language context in adult language, and context valence predicts how well adults learn new words. Little is known about whether this extends to children. To address this, we first conducted a computational analysis to quantify the relationship between the emotional properties of words and their contexts in a large corpus of stories written by children (N = 103,541; approximately 55 million word tokens, age 7-13 years). As predicted, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.46) between word and context valence, and this was stable across age. We then conducted a pre-registered word learning experiment to investigate how emotional narrative context shapes the learning of novel adjectives during independent reading. Children (N = 120, age 7-11 years, 59 girls) were presented with 15 novel words embedded in 30 short narratives of either neutral, negative, or positive valence. We found that children learned novel adjectives from their reading experience, and older children outperformed younger children in word recognition and valence judgment. Novel adjectives read in more emotional (positive or negative) contexts were recognised more accurately than those read in neutral narratives. Children inferred word valence from narrative context, demonstrating that context valence is an effective cue for word learning. We discuss how affective associations build from children’s experience of words in emotional contexts, consistent with affective embodiment supporting children’s learning of abstract concepts.",

        "abstract": "The meaning of our experiences is informed by their emotional tone, but to what extent judging that events evoke similar emotions (“emotional similarity”) determines our perception that these events are similar to each other overall? To investigate this question, in two experiments, we solicited judgments of the similarity between pairs of photographs of major real-world events on several dimensions, including their emotional and overall similarity. Ratings of the emotionality of single photographs were also collected. Participants in Experiment 2 completed questionnaires that quantified trait anxiety and depression. Explicit judgements of emotional similarity predicted judgements of overall similarity better than single-stimulus judgments, an important methodological point which should inform future studies of this construct. Our findings suggest that perceived emotional similarity is highly predictive of how similar stimuli are perceived to be overall. Despite the high correlation among the facets of similarity between stimuli, emotional similarity had a unique explanatory power. Depression severity decreased the perceived similarity. Because this relationship was unexpected we analysed two existing datasets where participants with a diagnosis of depression were compared to non-depressed controls. Our findings suggest that depression may sharpen the representation of negative experiences, exaggerating, rather than diminishing, the differences between them.",

        "authors": "Maximilian Frank, Felicitas Hesselmann, John Jolliffe, Bernhard Miller, Johannes Vosskuhl, Sandra Zänkert",
        "abstract": "In this manuscript, we examine the role of errors in data-driven research and assess the extent to which a lack of a positive error culture has been addressed across various research fields. It presents examples of how scientific communities have addressed related problems and highlights observations on how newly developed error cultures can positively impact the research process. We do this against the backdrop of Germany’s effort to facilitate data sharing through a National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) which was initiated in 2018. We demonstrate, error cultures both benefit from suitable infrastructure while at the same time needing their support to spread. Therefore, we argue that it is not the failure or the errors themselves that hinder the progress of scientific knowledge, but rather the way in which they are subsequently dealt with. Moreover, data sharing and open science practices can only be fostered by developing an error culture in each disciplinary context.",

        "authors": "Jorrit Smit",
        "abstract": "Increasingly, funding programs in Europe seek to align scientific research agendas with societal challenges. A promissory regime results around emerging science and technology, in which researchers seek to present their work in line with the expectation of disruptive but feasible technological innovation. In the fields of energy, materials and chemistry research, many turn to (prospective) techno-economic assessments as to respond to this demand. Based on fieldwork and an interview study, I show how these quantitative anticipations can function as ‘feasibility filters’ in the process of agenda-setting that implicitly translate the interests, infrastructures and imaginaries of large-scale industries into technical targets for laboratory science. Non-economic considerations come second, after the rate-determining step of the feasibility filter. Finally, I argue that the resulting, paradoxical dynamics of techno-economic alignment is at odds with calls in STS to open up sustainable transformation and innovation pathways via socio-political and economic alternatives.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we present the Competency Explorer: a valid, user-friendly digital tool to assess civil servants’ views of the relative importance of competencies in their daily work. Through two studies of evaluation and modification in which 131 Dutch civil servants participated in a Q sorting procedure in combination with either a focus group or an individual interview, we developed a tool that is easy to use and enables its users to adequately reflect their views. A key finding from the development of the tool is the identification of 32 competencies that are demonstrated as meaningful and appropriate for civil servants in a large variety of positions and domains. This study provides insights into the competencies that matter for civil servants’ work and the tool can be used by researchers and practitioners for a wide array of learning and development purposes.",

        "authors": "Irina Valerie Gewinner",
        "abstract": "Professional communication increasingly unfolds on digital platforms where traditional credentials no longer guarantee credibility. This working paper develops an integrated framework of hybrid epistemic authority to explain how organizational leaders construct professional credibility in environments driven by algorithms. Drawing on theories of epistemic authority, platform affordances, and professional self-branding, I conceptualize authority as simultaneously institutionally grounded and performatively achieved. The framework identifies eight interdependent dimensions: traditional competence, digital communication skills, strategic authenticity, contextual adaptivity, institutional embedding, strategic restraint, reactive authority, and emotional labor. Preliminary findings from interviews with eleven senior executives on their LinkedIn use reveal that authority construction requires continuous negotiation between competing necessities. These include authenticity versus optimization, visibility versus protection, and personal versus organizational identity. C-level leaders navigate these tensions through strategic practices that balance genuine expression with platform-specific performance demands. This framework contributes to scholarship on digital leadership, professional expertise, and platform governance by demonstrating that contemporary authority is no more solely possessed by credentials or defined by performance. Rather, it emerges out of a delicate interplay of communication and the sociotechnical constraints that we can’t control. The model provides an analytical means of dissecting how digital platforms alter professional credibility and the implications for equity, career sustainability and organizational communication.",

        "authors": "Kathleen Flanagan, Stephen Glackin, Wendy Stone, Emma McDonald, Megan Robinson",
        "abstract": "This research aims to deepen our understanding of the design and impact of the ‘machinery of government’ – the administrative, bureaucratic or institutional arrangements that deliver public policy – with respect to housing policy in Australia. Drawing on the insights of current and former senior housing policy officials, the study identifies a set of principles to guide the best feasible governance and policy outcomes. Machinery of government changes occur regularly in Australia’s public sector at the federal and state/territory levels. However, there has been little focus on the impact of such changes for the delivery of housing policy, or which arrangements are most suitable for effective delivery. Changes to the machinery of government may lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and key expertise, and impede efficiency, effectiveness and innovation. Identifying and settling on a feasible and effective governance and administrative structure will allow agencies – and the people working within them – the longevity and stability to deliver better policy outcomes.",

        "authors": "Philipp Brauner, Julia Offermann, Martina Ziefle",
        "abstract": "Purpose: The social acceptance of health technologies is crucial for the effectiveness and sustainability of healthcare systems amid the demographic change. However, patients’ acceptance, which shapes technology use and compliance, is still insufficiently understood. Methods: In this study, we explore how perceived risks and perceived benefits relate to attributed value as a proxy for social acceptance. Unlike most studies that focus on individual technologies, we measure public perception of 20 very different types of health technologies—ranging from plaster cast and x-Ray to insulin pumps, bionic limbs, and mRNA vaccines. Through an online survey utilizing a convenience sample of 193 participants from Germany and Bulgaria, we assessed perceived risks, benefits, and overall value attributed to these technologies. The study presents a visual mapping of the technologies and investigates the individual and technology-related factors shaping these perceptions. Results: The findings suggest that perceived benefit is the strongest predictor for overall value (β = +0.886), while perceived risk plays a significant, but much smaller role (β = −0.133). Together, both factors explain 95% of the variance in overall attributed value (95%, R2 = .959). Further, individual differences, such as prior care experience and trust in physicians, significantly influences the perceptions of health technologies. Conclusion: We conclude with recommendations for effectively communicating the benefits and risks of health technologies to the public, mitigating biases, and enhancing social acceptance and integration into healthcare systems.",

        "title": "Influence, Deviations, and Excesses in the Pharmaceutical Sector",
        "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
        "abstract": "Since Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928, the pharmaceutical sector has expanded rapidly, becoming one of the most powerful segments of the global economy today, with estimated annual revenues of approximately US$ 1.5 trillion and major corporations valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. Although scientific and technological advances and socioeconomic transformations have driven drug research and development, yielding substantial gains, critical scholarship has emphasized controversial practices of corporate influence - here synthesized as “Influence, Deviations, and Excesses” - that promote growth, profitability, and the consolidation of power, at times in conflict with the collective interest and public health. In this context, the present article adopts an exploratory-descriptive design and a mixed-methods approach, triangulating public datasets, institutional documents, and a critical review of the international literature to map and describe mechanisms of corporate influence in the pharmaceutical sector across eight axes: (i) lobbying and electoral financing; (ii) influence over regulatory and oversight bodies; (iii) influence on patient organizations; (iv) influence on the development of clinical guidelines; (v) manipulation, promotion, and concealment of pharmaceutical research and trials; (vi) ghostwriting; (vii) strategies of diagnostic expansion and disease promotion; and (viii) the funding and provision of benefits to prescribers and institutions, including psychosocial mechanisms and formative dimensions. The findings indicate that corporate influence is structured across multiple scales and operates in a manner that is simultaneously visible and diffuse. At the political level, lobbying and electoral financing emerge as central instruments for shaping the normative and regulatory environment, with a progressive expansion of investments. In the regulatory sphere, the recurrence of conflicts of interest in advisory committees and the circulation of personnel between agencies and companies suggest vulnerabilities to institutional capture, with implications for drug approval, oversight, and withdrawal processes. In the scientific domain, industry sponsorship is associated with biases that may affect everything from trial design and conduct to the selective publication of results, as well as practices such as ghostwriting and “market conditioning” strategies, undermining the credibility and circulation of evidence. In parallel, industry involvement is evident in diagnostic expansion and the medicalization of conditions of everyday life, enlarging markets and potentially obscuring social determinants and non-pharmacological approaches. In clinical practice, payments and transfers of value to prescribers and educational institutions are associated with shifts in prescribing patterns, increased costs, and preferential use of promoted drugs, including through low-value benefits mediated by cognitive biases.",

        "authors": "Tilman Hertz, Francois Bousquet, Mathilde Boucher, Catherine Lumalé, María Mancilla García, Maja Schlüter, Aurélie Sors",
        "abstract": "This paper draws on process-relational perspectives to present an understanding of socio-environmental problems not as obstacles but as modes of existence. We argue that engaging with problems in this way unlocks their potential to be transformative, rather than merely resolving them. But how can those who set up and engage with processes of transformative change unlock this potential? This brings us to the topic of theorizing, as we argue that theorizing is an integral and fundamental part of engaging with problems. In this paper we develop an approach to theorizing for transformative collective action based on two key aspects: “Time”, building on Gilles Deleuze, and the “Complex We”, building on Marisol de La Cadena. As to the first, we explore how the past and future condition our understanding of problems, contrasting a linear, sequential view of time with a process-relational one where past and future are contracted in the present and are continuously reconfigured via processes of difference and repetition. As to the second, we introduce the \"complex we\", an emergent subjectivity as the agent of theorizing as that which supports reconfiguration of the past and the future. Together, these two aspects open up the transformative potential of socio-environmental problems beyond what could be conceptualized on the basis of linear time. We apply our approach to theorizing to a research project in Southern France, where problems such as tensions and conflicts over water availability are explored collaboratively. The paper concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Counterfactuals fundamentally shape what impact evaluations estimate, yet documentation of how they are chosen is rare in conservation. We present a practical framework to make counterfactual choice systematic and transparent. First, we identify common evaluation goals and map these to four broad counterfactual types - no-intervention, program-level variation, attribute-level variation, and alternative implementation contexts. Second, we propose a four-step, iterative process for selecting counterfactuals that foregrounds decision context, conceptual counterfactuals, feasibility constraints (programme feasibility, ethical, observability of outcomes), and the final choice with limitations. We offer a concise minimum reporting set (the “counterfactual reporting standards” or CREST) to standardize documentation and illustrate the approach with a worked example comparing MPA expansion versus enhanced enforcement. Adopting structured counterfactual selection will increase the policy relevance and comparability of conservation evaluations, reduce misinterpretation of effect sizes across studies, and strengthen meta-analysis. We call on authors, reviewers, and journals to require transparent counterfactual reporting to accelerate accumulation of usable evidence and improve decision-making globally also.",

        "authors": "Matthew Motta, Timothy Callaghan, Sarah K Lipson, Jennifer Ross, Kiersten Strombotne, Christopher Louis",
        "abstract": "The recent discovery that a class of drugs collectively known as “GLP-1s” (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) can promote weight loss has led to a surge in pharmaceutical production, demand, and advertising. While previous research has considered the impact that advertising exposure may have on public demand for using GLP-1s for weight management, few have considered the broader public health impacts (both positive and negative) of GLP-1 advertising. For example, increased GLP-1 advertisement exposure could make people more self-conscious about their own weight and physical appearance. It could also promote destigmatizing views toward those who use GLP-1 products for weight management. In a nationally representative survey of N = 1,000 US adults, we find that people exposed to higher levels of GLP-1 advertising tend to hold more negative views about their own weight and physical appearance. We find no evidence that ad exposure is associated with destigmatizing views about those who use GLP-1 products, although we find strong evidence that exposure can stimulate demand for GLP-1 products. These results hold across a wide range of measures and model specifications. We conclude by discussing the potential public health risks of GLP-1 advertising, in a changing regulatory landscape.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines how the Iranian regime’s online supporters sought to manipulate and suppress the #MahsaAmini movement on Iranian Twitter. Whereas prior work emphasizes the emancipatory potential of hashtag activism, less is known about the discursive and rhetorical tactics authoritarian actors use to undermine such mobilization. Drawing on critical discourse and rhetorical studies, we analyze 6,170 tweets posted by 1,388 influential pro-regime accounts during the movement’s first two months (15 September–15 November 2022). We find that incivility was the dominant strategy for disrupting the movement, followed by disinformation and conspiracy narratives. These tactics were reinforced through stigmatizing metaphors (e.g., “whore,” “ISIS/Daesh”) and other delegitimizing labels aimed at discrediting dissidents. Pro-regime accounts also relied on emotional appeals, especially fear and pity, to naturalize false claims. We argue these moves enact coordinated boundary-work that delegitimizes protest narratives and reasserts regime authority online systematically. The study clarifies mechanisms of repression under theocracy.",

        "abstract": "Hispanic immigrants in the United States face persistent socioeconomic disadvantage but paradoxically experience lower mortality throughout the life course. We document this Hispanic mortality paradox across 22 national-origin groups using Social Security administrative mortality records from 1988--2005. The paradox extends to migrants from every country in South America, Central America, and the Hispanic Caribbean. Yet the magnitude of the mortality advantage varies substantially by country of origin, state of arrival, and period of arrival, demonstrating the importance of examining subgroup-specific outcomes rather than treating Hispanics as a monolithic population. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to move beyond the aggregated Hispanic category and recognize how diverse migration histories and incorporation contexts shape the health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants.",

        "authors": "Arij Yehya, Jüri Allik, David M Condon, Anu Realo",
        "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the gender equality paradox by examining within-country variation in the size of the gender/sex gap in the Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality traits within three geographically large and socially diverse countries and to explore whether gender/sex differences in personality trait scores across regions in these countries were associated with various regional-level indicators. Method: Multilevel analysis was conducted to assess regional gender/sex differences in FFM personality trait scores using data from Germany (three samples), Russia (one sample), and the United States (two samples). When the gender/sex gap varied across regions, we assessed whether this variation was explained by regional indices of human development and its subcomponents, gender equality, individualism/collectivism, and survival/self-expression values. Results: Significant regional differences were observed for Openness and Conscientiousness across most samples, with further multilevel analysis revealing significant gender/sex differences in these two traits. These differences were explained by regional educational attainment in four out of seven samples. Conclusions: Some evidence of a within-country gender-equality paradox was found for Openness and Conscientiousness, with higher regional educational attainment associated with widening gender/sex gaps in these traits.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical account of how domestic cooking, historically understood as private and relational labor, can come to be translated into publicly visible and socially consequential forms of value. Building on the concept of Culinary Home Economics Capital (CHE Capital), domestic cooking is understood as a relationally embedded, value-generating practice. Through processes of visualization, narrativization, and platformization, CHE Capital becomes legible within contemporary regimes of visibility and evaluation, generating recognition, identity, and hierarchical effects. This paper situates CHE Capital in dialogue with Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital, care ethics, and affect theory, highlighting both its continuities with and distinctions from these frameworks. The analysis contributes to cultural sociology, everyday aesthetics, and feminist political economy by offering a framework for understanding how intimate, relational practices enter public circuits of evaluation and recognition.",

        "authors": "Chris Soria, Dennis M. Feehan",
        "abstract": "Personal networks influence health and mortality at the individual level, but less is known about how population-scale social network structure relates to mortality. This study examines how US county-level social network structure relates to mortality disparities. Using measures from 21 billion Facebook friendships, we investigate how two structural features of population social networks – cohesiveness and diversity – are associated with age-standardized and age-specific mortality rates. Bivariate results show that measures of social network structure rival smoking rates, median income, and educational attainment in their association with mortality rates. Social network structure remains predictive of mortality even after controlling for traditional measures like socioeconomic status and rural/urban classification. Network diversity is associated with lower mortality in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Network clustering is associated with higher mortality bivariately, but this association reverses after controlling for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, revealing a protective effect masked by confounding. Age-stratified analyses further complicate this picture, showing that clustering predicts lower mortality among adults aged 15-64 but higher mortality among those 70 and older. These findings highlight social network structure as an important dimension of place-based health disparities, one not fully captured by conventional measures of socioeconomic composition or spatial segregation.",

        "authors": "Huabo LIU",
        "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research is frequently conceptualized as an integrative endeavor that synthesizes disciplinary perspectives to yield more holistic explanations of complex phenomena. Although this integrative paradigm has yielded valuable outcomes, it often frames disciplinary differences principally as barriers to be surmounted. Drawing on insights from science and technology studies (STS), this article advances an alternative epistemological framework by reconceptualizing disciplines not as repositories of accumulated knowledge but as historically stabilized methodological apparatuses that actively constitute explanatory objects and practices. Building upon this reconceptualization, the article develops an interventionist epistemology that positions disciplinary differences as generative epistemic resources rather than impediments. The proposed framework delineates a three-stage mechanism—interpretive juxtaposition, cognitive friction, and methodological reflexivity—whereby the deliberate and sustained co-presence of incommensurable explanatory logics disrupts the naturalized authority of any single disciplinary method, thereby fostering reflexive scrutiny of underlying epistemic commitments and normative implications. Through illustrative cases from climate policy modeling, management research, and evidence-based medicine, the analysis demonstrates how interpretive juxtaposition manifests across diverse institutional contexts, generating cognitive friction that prompts methodological reflexivity without necessitating premature synthesis or resolution of differences. These examples illustrate that prolonged exposure to plural explanatory regimes can productively intervene in epistemic assumptions, thereby reshaping the conditions of legitimate judgment and knowledge production. The article concludes by elaborating the implications of reframing interdisciplinarity as epistemic intervention rather than integration, and by identifying promising directions for future empirical inquiry within STS, including investigations into the institutional conditions that enable or constrain such reflexive dynamics.",

        "title": "Spatial Changes in Kathmandu Valley: A review through political perspective",
        "authors": "Apil KC",
        "abstract": "Kathmandu valley’s spatial characters are constantly changing, and as such, its urban morphology can be observed as a frequently altered palimpsest. Developing on the trade route of Tibet and India, settlements of Kathmandu valley can be traced back to more than three thousand years. The foundation of the earliest settlements were laid out by Kirats in 300 BC or before that. The settlements expanded first under the succeeding Lichchhavi ruling house who applied Vedic town planning principles and later the Mallas expanded the settlements further with Astamatrika and Dashmahavidya concepts affiliated to Shakti- cult. After the unification of Nepal in 1769, Kathmandu Valley became the capital of politics, economy and administration, however the political centralization can be vividly observed only after the 1950's. After the dethroning of the autocratic Rana Regime in 1951, the monarchical government had the authoritative grip in government and development. The political turmoil did not stop until the 1990s, which brought two big changes in Nepal, when the re-establishment of Democracy and wave of globalization brought unprecedented change in the urban form of Kathmandu Valley. However, the democratization of Nepal did not go well; the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) declared a civil war that lasted for a decade till 2006 jeopardizing the baby local government (Decentralization) and causing massive migration to urban core from rural regions, especially to Kathmandu Valley. The mass movement of April 2006 changed the governing landscape, turning a democratic monarchical nation into a federal republic, with an expectation to loosen valley’s centripetal grip of economy and administration, if not politics. The era of federal republic of Nepal has witnessed the political chaos of more than a decade, in terms of urban policy and development strategy. The paper reviews the spatial changes of Kathmandu Valley from the perspective of the political economy of Nepal till date. It is observed that the political system and social structure have defined the changes in the urban landscape of Kathmandu valley. The paper takes into account the regime changes over the period and the planning strategies carried out in the period along with the political economics behind it. The spatial changes of Kathmandu valley inferential to its political economy is also significant to understand the growth pattern of other growing cities in Nepal, which are largely influenced by political decisions in Nepal.",

        "authors": "Jesús Ignacio Rivera Cano",
        "abstract": "La reunión programada entre el presidente colombiano Gustavo Petro y el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump (primera semana de febrero 2026) representa un encuentro diplomático de alto riesgo cuyo desenlace dependerá críticamente de la comprensión de las dinámicas psicológicas subyacentes. Mediante análisis comparativo de dos encuentros recientes con Trump – el caso fallido con el presidente ucraniano Volodímir Zelenski (febrero 2025) y el caso exitoso con el alcalde de Nueva York Zohran Mamdani (enero 2026) – este estudio identifica patrones psicológicos que determinan resultados en negociaciones con líderes narcisistas en contextos de asimetría de poder. Empleando metodología cualitativa de análisis de caso comparativo basada en el modelo de narcisismo patológico de Kernberg y Kohut, y marcos teóricos sobre toma de decisiones en contextos asimétricos, se analizan transcripciones de encuentros públicos, declaraciones oficiales, y reportes periodísticos detallados. Los hallazgos sugieren que el narcisismo patológico de Trump crea vulnerabilidades específicas que pueden ser navegadas exitosamente mediante estrategias que eviten activar rabia narcisista mientras permiten al líder narcisista \"salvar face\" y declararse ganador. Se argumenta que la estructura de personalidad de Petro – caracterizada por narcisismo ideológico más que patológico – puede constituir ventaja táctica si es adecuadamente movilizada mediante recontextualización del pragmatismo como coherente con identidad revolucionaria. Se identifican siete principios psicológicos generales para negociaciones asimétricas con narcisistas patológicos: (1) priorizar evitar activación de rabia narcisista, (2) permitir \"salvar face\" como necesidad estructural, (3) reconocer que la narrativa de \"ganar\" puede superar el contenido sustantivo, (4) validar selectivamente sin adulación, (5) reconocer diferencias sin insistir en ellas, (6) crear oportunidades para magnanimidad, y (7) reconocer asimetría de poder implícita pero no explícitamente. Se formulan recomendaciones estratégicas específicas organizadas en tres fases: preparación pre-encuentro (reencuadre mental, identificación de triggers, preparación de propuestas ganar-ganar), tácticas durante la reunión (apertura constructiva, manejo de provocaciones, uso estratégico de validación), y comunicación post-encuentro (narrativas para audiencias múltiples). El estudio tiene implicaciones para diplomacia en contextos de personalidades incompatibles, gestión de crisis con líderes autoritarios, y comprensión de cómo factores psicológicos individuales interactúan con asimetrías estructurales de poder en relaciones internacionales.",

We argue that this ‘deregulationist’ view rests upon flawed assumptions. Through empirical simulation, we show that even a dramatic, deregulation-driven supply expansion would take decades to generate widespread affordability in high-cost U.S. markets. We advance an alternative explanation of declining affordability grounded in demand structure and geography: uneven demand growth – driven by rising interpersonal and interregional inequality – is the primary driver of declining affordability in recent decades. For cost-burdened households, trickle-down benefits from deregulation will be insufficient and too slow.",

        "abstract": "In spite of human rights protection given to the “other-gender” population (transgender) worldwide, they still constitute a deserted community which faces a significant occupational challenges around the world. In India, the other-gender community encompasses individuals with a variety of gender identities forming a culturally unique gender group. Although they have always remained an integral part of the society from the very ancient time, unfortunately their existence is grappling with abject poverty, illiteracy, hatred and mockery. Such stigmatisation and segregation from society have left them to compromise with the employment opportunities available. This paper used the data on ‘other-gender’ released by Census of India for the first time. The 2011 Indian Census reported approximately 4,87,803 individuals belonging to the other-gender category in the country. This data demonstrate that the other-gender community exhibits lower level of literacy and labour force participation when compared with the general population. In this paper, we endeavour to conceptualize these findings and engage in a discussion of the inherent limitations of the data.

        "authors": "Andualem Yimer Desalegn",
        "abstract": "This finalized Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) manual introduces an innovative framework for institutional research ethics review guidelines that integrates the Ubuntu philosophy with international research ethics standards. The SOPs cover research ethics in a variety of fields, including veterinary medicine, public health, social sciences, natural sciences, agriculture, environmental sciences, business and economics, education and humanities, engineering and informatics. Despite being created for Wollo University, the SOP frameworks are widely applicable to African academic and research institutions. A unique and strong strength of the manual is the combination of the Ubuntu philosophy with a multidisciplinary approach, which advances beyond a simple compliance checklist to create a genuine ethical framework deeply integrated with the local context. Key features of the SOPs manual include: • An ethical framework grounded in Ubuntu philosophy, which emphasizes community interconnectedness and collective benefit as foundational principles guiding ethical review processes. • Customized, discipline-specific evaluation checklists that address the unique methodological and ethical considerations inherent to various research fields. • Comprehensive protocols that extend beyond human subjects research to encompass studies involving animals, plants, environmental systems, and communities, applicable across all academic units, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of contemporary research ethics. • The introduction of innovative procedures and tools for community impact assessment that respect indigenous knowledge systems and actively involve stakeholders. • Full alignment with international standards, including the Declaration of Helsinki and World Health Organization guidelines, while ensuring compliance with Ethiopian national regulations as stipulated in Proclamation No. 1130/2019. • Recognition of interconnectedness through the incorporation of concepts such as environmental stewardship, community impact assessment, and benefit-sharing, which are essential for fostering sustainable and ethical research practices. • Detailed implementation guidelines and training protocols designed to facilitate effective adoption and operationalization of the SOPs. Innovation This manual constitutes the first comprehensive effort to integrate Ubuntu philosophy into institutional research ethics review procedures, offering a culturally grounded approach that upholds international standards while honoring African philosophical traditions. The framework serves as a practical model for the decolonization of research ethics within African universities and research institutions.",

        "authors": "Jesse Magin",
        "abstract": "Existing research has focused on women´s primary role in housework as an explanation for attitudinal gender gaps but stands at a crossroads as women´s labour force participation rates are catching up to men´s and the gender gaps remain. This article seeks to expand the idea of gender roles to the gendered nature of work experience as a result of gender-based occupational segregation. In doing so it synthesises an attempt to redraw the class map into a two-dimensional space divided by task structure and authority logic as a predictor of political attitudes with the literature on gender gaps. Is there a direct link between the attitudinal gender gaps and the gendered experience of work? Drawing on panel data and fixed effects estimation the causal nature of work experience is scrutinised. While previously noted differences in attitudes between different positions in the two-dimensional class scheme are (partly) observable, these differences largely cannot be attributed to a causal effect of work experience across different political attitudes. Rather, evidence points to the existence of personality-based selection into certain class positions and the stability of political attitudes irrespective of work experience. Although individuals in different occupations differ this is not because of their work. These findings contradict social role theory as an explanation for gender gaps by discounting the relevance of specific roles such as occupation in (gendered) attitude formation.",

        "authors": "Kristin Turney, Emily Smith-Greenaway",
        "abstract": "General strain theory posits that parental incarceration—and the corresponding parental absence—leads to youth delinquency and criminal legal contact. However, parental incarceration represents just one form of parental absence and comparatively little research considers how a common—and permanent—form of parental absence, parental death, may similarly precipitate youth criminal legal outcomes. We use data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a broadly representative cohort of youth born around the turn of the 21st century, to examine the relationship between parental death and youth criminal legal outcomes. We find that, net of observed characteristics associated with selection into this experience, parental death is associated with higher levels of youth delinquency and incarceration. Parental death is as relevant to youth criminal legal outcomes as parental incarceration. The associations are largest among boys who experienced parental death in middle childhood or adolescence relative to early childhood. These findings underscore the profound consequences of parental death on youth trajectories, highlighting the need to consider bereavement as a critical yet understudied dimension of social inequality and risk for criminal legal involvement.",

        "authors": "Nerhum Sandambi",
        "abstract": "The 1960s, 1970s and late 1980s were significant for Venezuela. However, this period of intense transition saw particularly strong growth, largely driven by unsustainable and impoverishing economic growth. On the other hand, this type of growth did not enrich the vast majority of Venezuelans. Thus, on the one hand, there was in fact the emergence of a virtuous circle and institutional plurality, which naturally lasted in the short term. Thus, the Chavista regime that later took hold in Venezuela largely promoted the significant emergence of vicious circles and a set of extractive institutions, strongly characterised by the very existence of economic destruction, promoted on the one hand by democratic stagnation. In this particular approach, I show some evidence that points to divergences regarding the plausible existence of abundant natural resources. Most countries that are rich in natural resources, for example, have similar characteristics, but are influenced, first by vicious circles, and secondly by the institutional extractivism existing in these countries. Examples such as Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Venezuela, Syria, Democratic Congo, and Congo Brazzaville reinforce the theory that abundance is primarily a promoter of political inconsistency, vicious cycles, and, above all, a large part of the multidimensional poverty that is significantly rooted in these countries in particular. Thus, during the vicious circle in Venezuela, on the one hand, the governmental incapacity promoted by the Chavista government consistently and continuously promoted the breakdown of social protection levels and, on the other hand, the significant increase of a significantly dual society, which is strongly persistent with non-inclusive and stagnant democracies. Democratic stagnation, however, was not economically and politically sustainable, and the marked differences consistently and plausibly led to the emergence of severe deprivation of freedoms, namely the deprivation of democratic freedoms and the deprivation of freedoms of access to basic needs. The lack of these freedoms led the country to institutional collapse and significant state collapse.",

However, a large number of countries with significant natural resources have not managed to promote high standards of significant transformation. Angola, however, is following the same path where, from the outset, abundance of oil and diamonds providing impoverishing growth, strongly supported by short-term public policies that in fact sustain only a minority. Naturally, the abundance of natural resources, particularly for Angola, has nevertheless promoted vicious economic and political circles, which are in fact consistent with short-term objectives. Most of these cycles are in fact ongoing. On the other hand, another major feature highlighted in the study is that it shows, for example, an economy based on international market expectations, so it is international markets that largely control the Angolan economy. On the other hand, the increase in political inconsistencies and public policies aimed at a minority naturally contributed to the consistency of vicious circles and, on the other hand, to the continuity of economic destruction in particular.",

Aspects of recreational visitor use include visitor demographics, recreational activity participation, visitor satisfaction, visitor attitudes and experiences, trip characteristics, and economic contributions. We review practices used to understand aspects of visitor use across seven Federal agencies, revealing similarities such as the use of visitor intercept surveys and coverage of similar topic area, and differences in how survey programs are operationalized and how specific questions on visitor surveys are worded. We also evaluate emerging technologies, such as geolocated social media and mobile device location data, for their potential to aid in understanding aspects of visitor use. This report concludes with potential opportunities to enhance data collection and coordination, ensuring cost-effective data collection and informed decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Homophily, the tendency for individuals to associate with similar others, has long been treated as a central principle of social organization. Yet people may overestimate its importance in reasoning about their social networks. Here, we investigate individuals’ cognitive expectations of homophily and compare these expectations to actual homophily among 10,072 adults in 82 isolated Honduras villages. We elicited subjects’ beliefs about whether pairs of people in their village social networks were socially tied. We show that people deploy cognitive heuristics that substantially overestimate homophily, including based on wealth, ethnicity, gender, and religion. We also find that people exploit network structure when predicting ties between others, independent of expectations about homophily. Understanding cognitive homophily has implications for models of network formation, interventions targeting social behavior and information diffusion, and the maintenance of social inequality.",

        "abstract": "Estimating unknown outcomes at small-area population level is a routine task in spatial analysis. We demonstrate how Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP), now widely used in political polling, overcomes some deficiencies in Spatial Microsimulation (SPM), the de facto approach in quantitative geography. Using individual-level data from Health Survey for England and population-level data from 2021 UK Census, we evaluate MRP and SPM at estimating two known health outcomes that occur with high and low frequency in the population. With few constraints there are only slight differences in estimation between the two approaches. With more and especially area-level constraints extreme errors in the SPM estimates begin to accumulate, and these are particularly pronounced for the low-frequency outcome. Additionally, where uncertainty ranges from MRP posteriors begin to widen we find they map to groundtruthed errors, providing a useful validity check when the true population distribution is unknown. This is the first direct comparison of MRP and SPM for small-area estimation. Alongside metrics for evaluating estimates, we highlight the value of area-level variables that constrain outcomes or that may capture varying processes over spatial units, and of a principled approach to model specification and uncertainty quantification – both central to MRP practice.",

        "authors": "Tal Yaron",
        "abstract": "As groups grow in size, the complexity of collective decision-making increases exponentially, leading societies to concentrate authority in small hierarchical subgroups. While this enables coordination at scale, it systematically underrepresents the interests of broader populations and limits collective learning. Traditional voting mechanisms exacerbate these problems: binary choices, fixed option sets, and winner-take-all outcomes incentivize polarization rather than consensus-seeking. This paper introduces a deliberative framework designed to support meaningful participation at scale. The framework combines three innovations: (1) open and continuous proposal generation, allowing participants to introduce new alternatives throughout the process; (2) continuous preference expression on a scale from strong opposition to strong support; and (3) real-time aggregation using the Consensus Algorithm, which calculates scores as Mean − SEM (standard error of the mean), yielding a confidence-adjusted estimate of collective agreement that penalizes uncertainty and protects minority positions. Two proof-of-concept applications demonstrate the framework's practical viability. In the first, 53 participants converged on a single name from 26 proposals within approximately five minutes. In the second, 40 participants representing secular and religious perspectives jointly developed a social charter on religion-state relations over two sessions totaling 5 hours, achieving consensus above 60% on key provisions. These results suggest that appropriately designed deliberative technologies can enable rapid, inclusive decision-making on both simple and normatively contested issues—offering a pathway toward scalable deliberative democracy.",

We argue that criminal justice debt should not be viewed merely as a symptom of neoliberal austerity or as collateral consequence of punitive excess, but as a structural feature of settler governance. We reconceptualize criminal legal debt not as a marker of the punitive turn in U.S. criminal justice policy nor even as the application of recent neoliberal austerity policies to the administration of carceral institutions. Instead, we contend that such forms of state financial extraction must be understood as an integral feature of settler colonialism. In doing so, we shift attention from recent policy frameworks such as neoliberalism toward the deeper and underlying historical trajectories of criminal legal extraction that are rooted in the long-standing pattern of settler-colonial financial predation.",

It shows comparison between the male and female laborers in case of the location of work i.e., rural-urban, earnings across employment categories with references to education on contextual basis. The analysis relies on published PLFS tables and applies percentage gap calculations and simple graphical comparisons. The findings reveal that there is a persistent gender wage gap across all segments of labour markets. The women are mostly engaged in self-employment and informal sectors, mainly in rural areas, leading to low-average earnings. The study also highlights that education alone fails to eliminate wage inequality and the market calls for a structural labour market and policy implementation to reduce the gender wage gap prevailing so far.",

        "authors": "Drake Rinks, Casey Roulette",
        "abstract": "Male-biased drug use is a consistent finding in contemporary epidemiology, yet it remains unclear whether this pattern reflects universal features of human behavior or is primarily a product of industrialization, commercialization, and recent socio-political change. Because most “global” evidence derives from urban or industrialized populations, little is known about how gendered substance use unfolds across small-scale, rural, and Indigenous societies. To address this gap, we systematically examine ethnographic evidence of female psychoactive substance use across 171 societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample. Using 1,397 drug-by-document cases identified in the Human Relations Area Files OCM category 276 (“Recreational and Non-Therapeutic Drugs”), we document (1) the prevalence of male and female drug use; (2) regional and subsistence variation; (3) substances most frequently associated with female use; and (4) the cultural contexts of women’s consumption, identified through text analysis and exploratory factor and cluster analyses. Findings reveal a robust cross-cultural pattern: women’s drug use is consistently less frequent and more culturally regulated than men’s. Gender disparities appear in every world region and subsistence system, though with varying magnitude in part due to the density of ethnographic reporting. Textual descriptions most often situate women’s use in low-dose, domestic, and socially embedded contexts. Exploratory factor and cluster analyses identify four latent domains structuring female drug-use contexts – prestige-regulated substances, ceremonial and social-sharing practices, medicinal and low-intensity uses, and high-risk entheogenic rites – highlighting the culturally patterned environments in which women’s drug use occurs. These findings provide the first global, ethnographically grounded test of whether low female drug use is a cross-cultural regularity and establish the empirical basis needed to evaluate biocultural, political-economic, and evolutionary explanations of gendered substance use.",

        "abstract": "Eye-tracking research, which often captures and analyses the trajectory of an observer’s gaze (commonly known as the scanpath) is crucial for understanding the dynamics of visual attention. While scanpath analysis typically relies on high-resolution data collected in controlled lab settings, it faces challenges in real-world applications, where data are often noisy. This paper explores the application of spatio-temporal scanpath similarity metrics as a measure of gaze pattern similarity, with a primary focus on dynamic time warping (DTW), alongside supplementary measures, within the context of mobile eye-tracking. We demonstrate an approach that utilises DTW via tslearn toolkit, adjusting the analysis to account for the lower spatio-temporal resolution and increased data variability inherent in mobile eye-tracking devices. Two datasets serve as the basis for our investigation: an instructed viewing set, consisting of benchmark experiment data where participants’ gaze follows predefined paths, and a free-viewing set where participants naturally engage with artwork stimuli. Our preliminary results demonstrate the robustness of DTW in capturing scanpath similarity despite data imperfections, especially when using gaze data, and to a lesser extent, with aggregated fixation data. We present a pipeline for implementing DTW in mobile eye-tracking, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world settings. While supplementary comparisons with other spatio-temporal similarity metrics are provided in the supplementary materials, the focus remains on DTW as the primary method for assessing scanpath similarity. To support further research, we provide datasets and analysis scripts publicly, alongside recommendations for applying DTW to mobile gaze data, aiming to broaden the scope of eye-tracking research. Keywords: mobile eye-tracking, temporal scanpath similarity, visual attention, dynamic time warping (DTW)",

        "abstract": "Since 2014, Russia's Wagner Group has gained prominence, expanding its role from driving Russian foreign policy across many African and Middle Eastern countries into an integral part of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In this paper, we first draw on the one-sided violence (OSV) literature to show how organizational incentives explain Wagner's violence against civilians pre-November 2021. Despite the static context of organizational incentives, Wagner's OSV lethality increased dramatically after the initial invasion. While prior research on this topic assumes organizations to be unitary and rational, we use personnel composition as an additional explanatory factor to explain OSV. Situated within research on combat psychology and health sciences, we introduce pre-combat experience (PCE) as key to understanding how training contributes to the use of OSV. By clarifying the role of PCE on OSV, we provide novel theoretical logic and empirical evidence explaining how individual-level experience aggregates to unit-level violence.",

        "abstract": "Autonomy support is associated with enhanced motor performance, learning, and psychological well-being across various populations and motor skills. However, research on autonomy support remains limited, and current evidence is predominantly observational, with no studies on the performance of aesthetic sports. This study examined the effect of the autonomy support condition—specifically, allowing gymnasts to choose the task order—on motor performance in comparison to a yoked control condition. Thirty female gymnasts (age range 11–22 years, Mage = 13.8, SD = 2.52) completed three form-based tasks (jumping, static strength, and coordination) under both autonomy and control conditions in a counterbalanced within-subject design, performing five trials per task. Two certified judges evaluated the performance. The participants also completed the 10-point Borg scale for perceived exertion (both before and after each condition) and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (after each condition), assessing perceived choice, perceived competence, and pressure/tension. Linear mixed-effects modelling revealed better performance under autonomy than under the control condition (β = 0.017 [0.004, 0.031], p = 0.011). Perceived exertion was higher in autonomy than in the control condition (β = -0.275 [-0.539, -0.011], p = 0.042), and in the post- compared to pre-condition (β = 1.47 [1.211, 1.74], p &lt; 0.001). No statistically discernible differences were observed for any of the intrinsic motivation measures (all βs &lt; -0.08, all ps &gt; 0.101). In line with our predictions, autonomy-supportive conditions enhanced gymnasts’ performance of form-based motor skills in gymnastics. This result contributes novel experimental evidence to the growing literature on autonomy and motor performance.",

        "abstract": "Background Drug-related deaths are rising in many countries, with Scotland having the highest rate in Europe. Understanding the clustering of health conditions, social experiences, and broader social and political factors may enhance policy and intervention design. Systems science methods can help identify action areas for effective interventions. This study aimed to (1) develop a broader understanding of the complex system relating to drug-related deaths in Scotland, and (2) identify potential action areas for interventions. Methods and data We conducted a systems-informed intervention development study following steps 1 and 2 of the 6 Steps in Quality Intervention Development framework (6SQuID), which define the problem and clarify modifiable factors. We facilitated co-production workshops using soft systems methods, including critical system heuristics, variable elicitation, multiple perspective diagrams, system mapping, priority setting, and six cohering questions. In parallel, we used Gaussian graphical models to identify co-occurring variables in linked datasets: Public Health Scotland’s National Drug-Related Deaths Database, Prescribing Information System, and Scottish Morbidity Records for inpatient and day case stays in acute (SMR01) and psychiatric (SMR04) hospitals. The linked data included information on 6,608 drug-related deaths in Scotland between 2009 and 2018. Preliminary findings from network analysis were integrated into the workshops for active co-production. We described the structure of the system map and linked data using community detection and network metrics. Results Analysis of the system map found eight subsystems covering direct causes of drug death, life experiences, stigmatising attitudes, treatment services and wider public perspectives. Analysis of the linked data found a further 78 subsystems; 58 related to distinct conditions, eight to co-occurring conditions, and 12 to substance use. Assault, and alcohol treatment and harms were distinct subsystems in the linked data less prominent in the system map. Workshops identified three priority action areas: workforce development, service navigation, and community and connections. Stigma was a leverage point relevant to all actions. Conclusions Preventing drug-related deaths in Scotland can benefit from a systems science approach. Considering the whole system when prioritising action areas and designing interventions could hold more potential for change. Future policy and practice should consider how systems-informed approaches to death prevention may operate and interact across multiple levels of the social system.",

Our fractured society and the erosion of a shared identity make it difficult for communities to work together to advance the collective good. Solutions are needed to help communities span these social fissures, strengthen our social fabric, and address shared concerns. While individual-level efforts to form relationships across social differences are valuable, they are insufficient. Such efforts will never reach the scale necessary to achieve society-level change. In Bridging Social Divides, we present a scalable approach that works through coalitions of community organizations to bring together diverse communities, strengthen ties between those communities, and work together to promote equity, advance opportunity, and foster individual and societal flourishing.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in digital technologies create opportunities to support circular economy strategies for mass-produced consumer and industrial goods. Building on the CE-RISE project, this study evaluates how Digital Product Passports (DPPs) and related digital innovations can improve circular outcomes across selected value chains. We combine secondary data analysis of production and trade statistics with a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence. The empirical scope covers heat pumps, PV panels, printers, ICT equipment, and batteries. We report baseline material flows and circularity indicators for Europe (2010-2023), highlight differences between the EU27 and non-EU Europe (CH/NO/TR), and quantify a DPP scenario with confidence intervals. For the EU27 in 2023, current circularity is 15.5% and the DPP scenario implies 45.6% (95% CI: 29.2-62.0), corresponding to potential savings of 52.3 Mt and EUR 64.7 bn (95% CI: 23.8-80.8 Mt; EUR 29.5-100.0 bn). We also provide a proxy estimate of refurbishment-related employment exposure based on Eurostat production value per employee in NACE J. The paper provides an evidence-informed baseline for estimating DPP-enabled gains and for monitoring future policy impacts.",

        "abstract": "Value-driven governance is a prominent topic in AI regulation, with both state actors and tech companies professing a commitment to values like fairness and safety. Despite this seeming agreement, we know little how normative principles are interpreted, operationalized, and assigned responsibilities within particular contexts. This study compares the values invoked within the European Union’s AI Act with policy documents of five major AI companies—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Meta AI, and Mistral AI. Through a combination of frequency analysis and inductive keyword-in-context analysis, we identify prioritized values and map how they are specified in public legislation and corporate policies. Both public and private actors largely invoke the same values (accuracy, authenticity, control, improvement, privacy, safety, and security) but sometimes differ in their specification. While values like privacy, security, and safety typically mean the same thing in policy discourses, we found stark differences in the understanding of improvement, tensions between technical and normative operationalizations of values, and shifts of responsibilities for upholding values from one stakeholder to another. Value specifications surface the politics of values in AI regulations, exposing how private actors employ polysemy to claim alignment with the public interest while avoiding substantial accountability. When it comes to value-driven governance, the devil is in the details.",

        "abstract": "Individualism, the prioritization of personal distinctiveness over group conformity, is theorized to increase with economic development. This study tests this hypothesis over a century (1900–2022) across 95 French départements, using name uniqueness as a behavioral proxy. We first validate this proxy at the subnational level, showing that name uniqueness correlates with regional survey-based individualism indices (World Values Survey), even after controlling for immigration rates. Using complete civil registry data (N ≈ 79 million) and a bootstrapped name uniqueness score, we then analyze its relationship with economic development across space and time. Our analysis yields three key findings. First, longitudinal analysis reveals a strong positive association: as GDP per capita increased nationally over the 100-year period, name uniqueness rose significantly across all départements. Second, after removing shared temporal trends by standardizing variables within each year, effectively treating départements (n = `r nobs(norm_model_boy)`) as small, culturally and socially identical countries, GDP per capita continues to predict higher name uniqueness. Third, we uncover nuanced patterns: the relationship was moderated by gender, particularly during the World Wars, and rising economic inequality between regions was accompanied by growing divergence in naming practices, suggesting that development drives both cultural individualism and cultural stratification. Together, these results provide robust, fine-grained evidence that economic development fosters a cultural shift toward greater individualism.",

In a context of increasing social, mental, and physical vulnerability, there is wide agreement on the need to address health and social needs in an integrated manner. Yet, considering such “complexity” remains a pervasive challenge for professionals in social and health care, especially due to a lack of operational definitions. This scoping review aims to map existing definitions of complexity in social and health care and to identify shared assessment tools that support interprofessional and coordinated intervention. Methods and analysis. The review will follow the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al., 2018) and updated guidance (Peters et al., 2020). Literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), SocINDEX (EBSCO), Social Services Abstracts (ProQuest), and Cairn.info databases using appropriate keywords, index terms and search equations. All selected study bibliographies will undergo manual screening (\"snowballing\"). Studies will be selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, screened by title and abstracts. Data from full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be extracted independently by three authors. Evaluation discrepancies will be resolved through consensus. Results. Findings will be presented in descriptive tables and summarized narratively in relation to the review’s objectives and questions. Conclusion. This scoping review is expected to contribute to the development of an operational definition of complex situations in integrated social and health care and to identify tools that support professionals in assessing these situations in practice.",

        "abstract": "As climate-related hazards intensify, transportation systems play a central role in shaping who is exposed to risk, who can respond, and who recovers mobility and access after disruption. This scoping review synthesizes 88 studies to assess how transportation and hazards research has engaged equity and justice frameworks, what outcomes are used to evaluate inequity, where findings converge or diverge across hazards and disaster phases, and what conceptual gaps constrain progress. We find that the literature is effective at documenting disparities in exposure, evacuation, adaptation, and recovery, largely through population-based comparisons and novel mobility datasets. However, equity is most often treated implicitly, with unequal outcomes reported absent explicit normative or theoretical grounding. As a result, differences are frequently described without clarifying when and why they constitute inequities, limiting comparability across contexts and policy relevance. Evidence is strongest for inequities in transportation-mediated exposure, particularly for extreme heat and access loss driven by network failure, indicating a maturing understanding of transportation systems as active producers of vulnerability. Findings on evacuation disparities are less consistent, reflecting methodological limitations and contextual variation, while recovery outcomes show greater convergence, with marginalized communities experiencing slower or incomplete mobility restoration. Across domains, mismatches persist between commonly used mobility metrics and lived disaster needs, and mechanisms producing inequity—such as disinvestment, governance capacity, caregiving constraints, disability access, labor precarity, and information asymmetries—are often underexamined. We argue that greater engagement with explicit justice frameworks is necessary to move beyond documenting disparity toward explaining inequity and guiding equity-oriented transportation decisions under growing risk and uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "The Karo of North Sumatra, Indonesia, have long expressed a preference for matrilateral cross-cousin (impal) marriage, yet the practice has declined sharply over the past century. To identify the demographic and sociocultural factors underlying this change, we applied an epidemiological approach to cultural evolution, using a case-control design coupled with structural equation modeling (SEM). Ethnographic data from 176 married individuals across 62 villages were analyzed to assess the effects of demographic, alliance, religious, cosocialisation, and modernisation variables on the likelihood of impal marriage. The model fit was strong (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.04), revealing significant direct and indirect effects. Marrying an impal was positively associated with the number of marriageable impal and with arranged or strategically motivated unions but negatively associated with reported religious conflict between spouses. Indicators of modernisation such as schooling and infrastructure were non-significant. These results indicate that the decline of impal marriage reflects demographic contraction and the weakening of alliance-based strategies rather than a rejection of the cultural norm itself. Framed within an epidemiological model of cultural transmission, the findings demonstrate how social practices may fade when the ecological and demographic conditions sustaining them erode, even as their normative value persists.",

We frame this phenomenon through the lived experiences of minimally and nonspeaking autistics whose multimodal communication profiles challenge the speech-centered defaults of current AI pipelines. “Nonspeaking” is not a single condition or an absence of language but a spectrum encompassing users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), from text to gesture, rhythmic movement, and partial vocalizations. Communicative profiles vary across time with fatigue, anxiety, sensory load, and motor planning demands, yet design abstractions erase this variability. By tracing exclusionary mechanisms across speech recognition, text-to-speech, plain-language generation, and interface design, we identify how inequities are structurally produced and propose measurable designed dignity metrics for evaluation and governance. We argue that accessibility must be treated as a core dimension of AI ethics—on par with fairness, privacy, and safety. Re-engineering AI for designed dignity requires systems that recognize embodied, multimodal, and state-dependent forms of communication, expanding what counts as valid signal and responsible innovation.",

        "authors": "Billy Southern",
        "abstract": "Accurately delineating urban and suburban space has become increasingly difficult. Identifying each setting has long relied on capturing where population density and commuting flows differ, with research and policy often operating with binary measures to separate city from suburb. But as urban and suburban spaces expand, age, and reshape, places emerge that do not definitively fit this binary imagination. The uncertainty this generates creates complexities in claims made about urban and suburban space, but it is rarely addressed within empirical classifications. This research focuses on the uncertainty that dichotomous categorizations of place hide. Through a comparison of seven extant definitions of urban and suburban, I identify places that sit reliably in one category or another; but I also highlight the areas of uncertainty and instability. Results demonstrate that there are ‘stable’ urban and suburban areas, but a spatially uncertain transitional space exists where the nature of the landscape is unclear. By delineating these transitional spaces as a third category, I support research and policy that aims to speak clearly about changes in urban and suburban places, while also opening a conversation about how places might move between these two canonical definitions.",

        "authors": "Ibrahim Arinc",
        "abstract": "This paper analyzes Türkiye's natural gas market reform through the lens of institutional path dependence, demonstrating the failure of textbook liberalization strategies in a system marked by embedded support structures and geopolitical constraints. The delayed restructuring of BOTAŞ and the absence of a clear segmentation framework prevented the emergence of a well-functioning domestic market, constraining price formation and liquidity, and ultimately hindering Türkiye's hub potential. To address this structural gap, this study proposes a unique hybrid institutional pathway operationalized through a novel Dual-Ring Model. This model segments gas supply between a regulated Guardian Ring (for vulnerable consumers) and a market-based Competitive Ring, fostering traded liquidity and authentic benchmark pricing. Drawing on the \"second-best\" institutional approach and the principle of \"embedded autonomy\", the framework argues against full liberalization. The AggregateTR procurement mechanism coordinates strategic state bargaining power, notably leveraging the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover period, with transparent competitive allocation. Two original Structural Market Indicators (SSDI and TVR) monitor support targeting and traded liquidity. Scenario-based analysis demonstrates how disciplined segmentation and phased support recalibration, including the strategic release of Sakarya Domestic Gas Production into the Competitive Ring, progressively balance supply security, affordability, and benchmark credibility. This framework provides a resilient hybrid gas market architecture grounded in Türkiye's structural context, offering actionable insights for the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover window and the subsequent post-2030 market design. The approach offers replicable lessons for other gas import-dependent emerging economies, reconciling liberalization with strategic state coordination.",

        "abstract": "The growing use of algorithm based systems to manage employees has transformed how work is organized and controlled in contemporary organizations. Commonly referred to as algorithmic management, this approach relies on automated decision making to allocate tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate employee outcomes. While such systems are often adopted to enhance efficiency, their implications for human work remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the relationship between algorithmic management and key employee outcomes, with a particular focus on employee autonomy, job satisfaction, and performance. Using a quantitative research design, data were collected through an online survey from employees working in algorithmically managed environments. Established measurement scales were employed to assess the study variables, and statistical analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicate that algorithmic management is negatively associated with employee autonomy and job satisfaction, while demonstrating a significant relationship with employee performance. These results suggest that algorithmic management may improve performance related outcomes but can also constrain employees’ sense of control and satisfaction at work. The study contributes to the growing literature on digital and technology-mediated management by highlighting the dual effects of algorithmic management on human work. From a practical perspective, the findings underscore the importance of designing algorithmic systems that balance organizational efficiency with employee well-being. The study also offers directions for future research on the evolving role of algorithms in shaping the future of work.",

        "authors": "周勇",
        "abstract": "The ability to enhance productivity is pivotal in determining the success of a social system. Beyond scientific and technological advancements, productivity primarily hinges on workers' production enthusiasm and labour quality, the scale of production within each unit, and the pattern of resource allocation. Under given productive forces, the scale of production per unit is determined by the rate of exploitation imposed by owners upon labourers. As productive forces advance, new production models emerge. To boost productivity, the rate of exploitation diminishes, elevating the political and social standing of the populace, thereby giving rise to new social formations. Undifferentiated human labour constitutes the origin of goods value, while interest represents the outcome of value distribution. The risk-free rate approximates 20% of the average return on corporate assets. Goods prices in the market are primarily determined by supply, with the labour value of goods serving as the equilibrium point of supply—thus constituting the market's equilibrium price. The labour theory of value quantitatively explains the Equity Risk Premium Puzzle. The higher the automation level of enterprises, the lower the value of goods, and in the long run, the lower the profits of enterprises. After the highly developed productive forces in capitalist society, the vast majority of industries will become low-profit public infrastructure services, making it difficult for private entities to continue operating. Public ownership will replace private ownership. The future social structure will be a “communist society” characterized by public ownership and distribution according to need as the mainstay, supplemented by private ownership and distribution according to work under a free-market economy. In this “communist society” the state will persist, giving rise to a united human government where selfless dedication becomes the socially advocated moral standard. Under current productive forces, public ownership impedes both productive and economic development. Marxism is mistaken about the reasons and timing for the inevitable collapse of the capitalist system. Contemporary society faces issues such as welfare systems, nationalization, unified currencies, and China's economic and political structures.",

Conditionals constitute 33% of Europeans who are active voters for the dominant centrist and centre-right parties. Conditionals’ preferences hinge upon specific policy instruments and the perceived cost–benefit balances, but less on fixed ideology or demographics. The potential shift of Conditionals plays a vital role in shaping overall patterns of public policy support and electoral outcomes.

        "abstract": "Groove, the compelling and often pleasurable urge to move to music, is strongly influenced by rhythmic features like syncopation, frequently exhibiting an inverted U-shaped relationship with complexity. However, the neural dynamics underlying the emergence of groove over time are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the temporal evolution of groove perception and its neural correlates using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants listened to synthesized drum patterns varying systematically in syncopation complexity (low, medium, high) while EEG was recorded. After each rhythm, participants rated their subjective “desire to move” and “feeling of pleasure”. We analyzed the dynamics of middle frontal theta-band (4-8 Hz) power across four repetitions of the core rhythmic phrase and correlated this activity with behavioral ratings, complemented by sLORETA source localization. Behaviorally, results robustly confirmed the inverted U-shaped function, with medium syncopation eliciting the highest groove ratings. Neurally, middle frontal theta power paralleled this pattern, showing maximal amplitude for medium syncopation, particularly during later repetitions. Importantly, theta power during the 3rd repetition positively correlated with both desire to move and pleasure. Source analysis localized these significant correlations primarily to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These findings reveal middle frontal theta oscillations originating from an SMA-ACC network as a dynamic neural signature tracking the subjective experience of groove. The results support a predictive coding framework where theta activity reflects precision-weighted prediction errors, optimally balanced by moderate rhythmic complexity, thus linking rhythmic prediction processing, motor system engagement, and affective valuation central to the groove phenomenon.",

        "authors": "Han Ke, Eiji Watanabe",
        "abstract": "Dimensional theories of emotion propose that affective experiences can be organized along continuous dimensions like Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance. Recent computational methods for capturing these conceptual structures have relied primarily on word embeddings, requiring substantial technical expertise. This study examined whether prompting GPT-4 as a more accessible method, can capture this structure more effectively, by comparing both approaches against human spatial reasoning, with particular focus on analyzing extensive emotion vocabularies exceeding constraints of human cognitive capability. Study 1 established validity by testing six basic emotions, prompting showed strong convergence with human judgments, while embeddings produced fundamentally different clustering patterns. Study 2 extended analysis to 99 emotion terms. Both approaches identified two optimal clusters distinguished by both Pleasure and Dominance, though prompting produced clearer cluster separation. Particularly, Arousal's discriminative power increased substantially in case of 99 emotion terms with prompting method only. This pattern may reflect how broader sampling of emotion lexicon provides sufficient linguistic contexts for arousal-related distinctions to emerge statistically. Together these results indicated that GPT prompting offers a promising methodological tool for dimensional emotion research, particularly in terms of uncovering patterns that only become visible when analysing a broader sample of emotion lexicon.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To determine whether a biopsychosocial model of suicidality, specifically sleep, nutrition, physical exercise, mindfulness, social connectedness, lower socioeconomic status, and sex are uniquely associated with increased suicidal ideation, longitudinally over adolescence. Design: Longitudinal, prospective cohort study. Setting: A structured self-report questionnaire was collected as part of the Longitudinal Adolescent Brain Study at the University of the Sunshine Coast's Thompson Institute, (Queensland, Australia) from July 2018 - January 2024. Participants: 159 Australian adolescents (n=91 female; 68 male) aged 12 to 17 years. Outcome measures: Self-reported suicidal ideation was measured longitudinally. Data were also collected on self-reported lifestyle factors (sleep, nutrition, physical exercise, mindfulness, social connectedness), psychological distress, socioeconomic status, and sex. All measures were collected at 4-monthly intervals for each participant for up to 5 years (maximum of 15 time points). Results: Significant relationships were identified between increased suicidal ideation and poor sleep (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, p = .002), socioeconomic disadvantage (SES Quintile 1: OR 6.3 [95% CI, 1.8-21.8, p = .004; SES Quintile 2: OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.4-56.2, p = .022), psychological distress (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.1-15.6, p = &lt;.001) and eating habits (β -0.08, 95% CI -0.2--0.0). Conclusions: Poor sleep, socioeconomic disadvantage, psychological distress and eating habits were all found to be significantly associated with increased adolescent suicidal ideation over time. These biopsychosocial factors should be considered in targeted interventions and policies for reducing adolescent suicidality. Further research should employ multilevel modelling to examine factor interactions and rigorously evaluate interventions targeting lifestyle factors and socioeconomic inequalities through randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs.",

        "authors": "Joshua Konstantinos",
        "abstract": "The majority of the widely-discussed “sex recession” reflects a symmetric rise in virginity affecting both genders equally. A companion paper, however, documented an additional asymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the sexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that asymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on never-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated meaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and restricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in broader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital selection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the share of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) between 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category (exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. The upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting concentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. Because this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme upper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to analyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather than upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes evenly into exclusion and concentration.",

        "abstract": "Social media platforms play a central role in shaping today’s information ecosystem, yet access to both their internal data and even publicly visible content remains tightly restricted for academic researchers. This stands in sharp contrast to other industries such as food and pharmaceuticals where researchers can independently study product ingredients and effects. As a result, academic research on social media faces an unprecedented dependency on industry-controlled data, increasing the risk of bias and potentially distorting the evidence needed for effective regulation and policymaking. Drawing on research from other disciplines, we examine how industry influence operates and how researchers’ reliance on platforms for data may amplify industry influence. We identify four challenges in collaborations between researchers and social media platforms: restricted data access, selective funding, hard-to-detect influence, and institutional entanglements. These challenges risk undermining the independence and transparency of research in a field of growing societal relevance. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to regulate data access, as illustrated by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates data access for vetted researchers while safeguarding user privacy. In addition, new independent funding mechanisms could help ensure that research agendas remain free from platform interests. In parallel, the social science community must adopt stronger ethical standards and invest in “research on research” to detect and mitigate potential biases in policy-relevant research. With a dual approach – policy reforms and critical academic debates – we can ensure that research on social media platforms serves the public interest rather than platform priorities.",

        "authors": "Maximilian Reichert, Alzbeta Bartova, Tom Emery",
        "abstract": "This study examines when parents across Europe begin using formal childcare and how the timing of entry is socially stratified by socioeconomic resources, employment, and informal care availability. Childcare services are central to work–family reconciliation and gender equality. Existing research focuses primarily on whether families use childcare, largely overlooking when they do so. But timing matters because institutional entitlements only translate into real opportunities when households can convert them into use at specific points after childbirth. Using harmonized EU-SILC data from 22 European countries (2003–2020), this study estimates age-specific probabilities of formal childcare use during the first four years after birth. An analysis with matched longitudinal data complements thus study to assess the stability of childcare use once initiated. Formal childcare use rises steeply with child age but displays pronounced social stratification. Higher maternal education, stronger labor-market attachment, and higher household income are associated with substantially earlier entry into formal care. Informal childcare acts as a key substitute, delaying formal entry. Cross-national differences in usage levels and timing are large. Longitudinal results show that once families enter formal childcare, exit is rare. Inequality in childcare use is fundamentally temporal. Advantaged parents convert institutional entitlements into earlier and longer use, while less resourceful households enter later, reinforcing cumulative inequalities in employment trajectories and early childhood environments.",

        "abstract": "Evolutionary thoughts have been applied within archaeology for over a century, but the last four decades have seen a specific manifestation of such ideas rooted in the development of the field of cultural evolutionary studies. Concepts, methods, and theories have been borrowed and adapted from biology to cultural evolutionary studies and subsequently applied to the study of the archaeological record. While these developments have loosely defined what constitutes the modern subfield of evolutionary archaeology, we argue that many of its premises fail to sufficiently engage with insights from fields such as ethnoarchaeology or explore theoretical and methodological consequences dictated by the nature of the observational data that archaeologists deal with. Here, we critically review the field of evolutionary archaeology, highlighting the relevance of under-discussed behavioural processes and inferential challenges and question what its critical self-consciousness can lead to.",

        "authors": "Main Uddin",
        "abstract": "The work focuses on the implementation of textile industry effluent management, the current pollution scenario in Bangladesh caused by these effluents, and the proposed solution of installing an effluent treatment plant. Despite the presence of ETP equipment in almost all textile industries in Bangladesh, many factories do not operate them regularly because of high maintenance and operational costs (Rahman &amp; Islam 2020). Rapid industrialization has intensified environmental pollution through the discharge of untreated toxic waste (Islam Rahman and Akter 2021). On the other hand, increasing industrialization is contributing to severe pollution of the environment by poisonous waste discharge. The liquid effluents from industries are causing major havoc to the environment, ecology, agriculture, aquaculture, and public health since the development of textile industries in the country. It had become a prerequisite to set up ETP in each industrial establishment, particularly at dyeing industries that were discharging immense amounts of liquid waste to the rivers every day. However, for the successful implementation of ETPs, industry owners will need to be socially responsible. At the same time, the government should provide factory owners with logistical support and a relaxed timeframe to set up ETPs.",

        "abstract": "We examine the impact of 1990 and 2000 laws of citizenship in Germany, which liberalized the path to the acquisition of citizenship, on the national identity of immigrants. Leveraging the exogenous variation in waiting time for naturalization generated by those two reforms, we find that immigrants who benefited from less restrictive conditions to become citizens developed a stronger national identification with Germany, both after and during their waiting time for naturalization. The effect was particularly strong for women and for those immigrants that were older at the time of their arrival. A higher attachment to Germany seems to have been mainly driven by psychological and socioeconomic mechanisms: a more liberal regime reduced subjective concerns about discrimination, heightened immigrants’ social and political participation, and fostered their use of the German language.",

        "authors": "Evangeline Wandag, Michelle Victoria De Leon",
        "abstract": "This qualitative research investigates the constitutive role of communicative framing in the production and internalization of economic poverty among urban poor residents in Manila, Philippines. Anchored in the framing theory and situated within a communication-centric analytic paradigm, the study utilizes semi-structured interviews to examine how macro-level discursive formations emanating from state, media, and institutional actors are translated into micro-level interpretive schemas through which marginalized subjects perceive economic deprivation, agency, and futurity. The analysis demonstrates that participants’ narratives are permeated by hegemonic frames of dependency, passivity, and moralized deservingness, which operate as symbolic constraints that delimit perceived economic agency and normalize structural exclusion. The study contends that communication functions not merely as a descriptive or mediating apparatus but as an infrastructural dimension of economic inequality itself, actively configuring the conditions of possibility for economic action. To deepen the paper’s theoretical portability, we introduce the Communicative Architecture of Governed Exclusion (CAGE) as a mid-range framework specifying how poverty is reproduced through 1) classification (what counts as poverty and who counts as poor); 2) access control (administrative and informational gatekeeping), 3) governance through discourse (moralized narratives of deservingness and dependency), and 4) exclusion effects (internalized passivity, “waiting orientation,” and self-limiting economic agency). CAGE clarifies how framing effects become durable social infrastructure—an architecture that governs inclusion and exclusion through everyday communication.",

        "authors": "Martin Lukk",
        "abstract": "What is the relationship between global and local identification, and how is it linked to political conflict? These questions are central to scholarship on contemporary electoral politics, which has linked the radical right’s rise to a new dimension of political conflict separating tolerant, globally minded voters from exclusionary, locally oriented ones. This cleavage, variously described as universalist–particularist, cosmopolitan–parochial, or globalist–nationalist, implies that collective identification is polarized along a global–local axis and helps drive political mobilization. Yet little is known about how different territorial identities compete with or reinforce each other, let alone how their configurations shape political preferences. Using latent class models and survey data from 35 countries, I find that most Europeans are pluralists, who identify across a range of territories and support mainstream parties. A subset of countries, however, exhibits a division between particularists, who emphasize proximal identities, and expansivists, who emphasize distal ones. Remarkably, both groups converge in their strong attachment to the nation. This division overlaps with educational and geographic divides and separates radical-right supporters from those of new left parties like the greens. The findings demonstrate how collective identities reinforce new electoral divisions while challenging influential accounts of the scope and structure of identity-based polarization.",

        "authors": "KIYOMI DOI",
        "abstract": "This study offers an anthropological analysis of the early societal journey in Japan of the world’s first commercially released genome-edited tomato, the SRHGABA, conceptualizing it as a societal and planetary rite of “passage.” Treating the tomato as a hybrid actor embedded in ecologies and social infrastructures, the study first explores how its cultivation and circulation has generated apprehension and elusiveness exceeding standard risk metrics. This is partly due to the crop’s undetectability—it contains no foreign genes—rendering it less radical than conventional GMOs. Next, the study advances a theory of dynamis and dynamist rites, viewing the current transitional stage of adoption as a contradictory and suspended spatiotemporal journey. It draws on liminality and liminoid formations to highlight this limbo-like phase, which nonetheless harbors an undercurrent of potent possibility. The research foregrounds pre-reflective, magico-religious attunements (e.g. awe-like receptivity), arguing that they lie deeper than ethical stances or anticipatory care. Amid current preparations to export genome editing to Asian countries, this study’s use of an ethnographic case from the region illuminates the potential and concerns of genome editing adoption that are likely to emerge across Asia and the world in the near future.

        "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
        "abstract": "Desde el descubrimiento de la penicilina por Alexander Fleming en 1928, el sector farmacéutico se ha expandido aceleradamente hasta convertirse en uno de los segmentos más poderosos de la economía global, con una facturación anual cercana a US$ 1,5 billones y corporaciones valoradas en cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Aunque los avances científico-tecnológicos y las transformaciones socioeconómicas han impulsado la investigación y el desarrollo de medicamentos, la literatura crítica ha señalado prácticas controvertidas de influencia corporativa — aquí sintetizadas como “Influencia, Desvíos y Excesos”— que favorecen la rentabilidad y la consolidación del poder, en ocasiones en tensión con el interés colectivo y la salud pública. En este contexto, el artículo adopta un diseño exploratorio-descriptivo y un enfoque mixto, basado en la triangulación de datos públicos, documentos institucionales y revisión crítica de la literatura internacional, con el objetivo de mapear los principales mecanismos de influencia corporativa en el sector farmacéutico a partir de ocho ejes: (i) lobby y financiación electoral; (ii) influencia en organismos de regulación y fiscalización; (iii) influencia en organizaciones de pacientes; (iv) participación en la elaboración de guías clínicas; (v) manipulación, promoción y ocultamiento de investigaciones y ensayos clínicos; (vi) escritura fantasma; (vii) estrategias de ampliación diagnóstica y promoción de enfermedades; y (viii) financiación y provisión de beneficios a prescriptores e instituciones, incluyendo dimensiones psicosociales y formativas. Los resultados muestran que la influencia corporativa opera de manera multiescalar y simultáneamente visible y difusa. En el plano político, el lobby y la financiación electoral se consolidan como instrumentos centrales para moldear el entorno normativo y regulatorio. En el ámbito regulatorio, la recurrencia de conflictos de interés y la circulación de profesionales entre agencias públicas y empresas privadas evidencian vulnerabilidades a la captura institucional. En el campo científico, el patrocinio industrial se asocia a sesgos que afectan el diseño de los ensayos, la publicación selectiva de resultados y la credibilidad de las evidencias, incluyendo prácticas como el ghostwriting. Asimismo, se identifica la actuación de la industria en la ampliación diagnóstica y la medicalización de la vida cotidiana, con efectos sobre la invisibilización de determinantes sociales y alternativas no farmacológicas. En la práctica clínica, los pagos y transferencias de valor a profesionales e instituciones se vinculan a cambios en los patrones de prescripción, incremento de costos y favorecimiento de medicamentos promovidos, incluso mediante beneficios de bajo valor mediados por sesgos cognitivos.",

        "authors": "Emanuele Fedeli, Solveig Topstad Borgen, Moris Triventi",
        "abstract": "A longstanding debate in research on peer effects concerns whether exposure to high-achieving classmates enhances or depresses students’ academic performance. While normative models emphasize positive spillovers, social comparison theories highlight negative contrast effects, and empirical evidence remains mixed. Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

        "abstract": "This study analyses Technician Commitment action plans from UK higher education institutions to address persistent technical talent demand in research. Using natural language processing with Google Gemini, 3558 action items from 104 plans were categorised into 26 key themes. The most common focus areas were \"Ongoing Visibility and Communication\", \"Networking and Presenting\" and \"Career Pathways and Progression\", whilst \"Wellbeing and Mental Health\", \"Environmental Sustainability\" and \"Equipment Sharing\" received minimal attention. Comparison with the TALENT Policy Commission's recommendations revealed strong alignment on improving visibility and diversifying entry routes, but significant gaps in technical staff's policy involvement and strategic workforce planning. Notably, institutions rarely cited external resources from professional bodies, suggesting underutilisation of available support. The study proposes developing a 'Skills Portfolio' methodology with a standardised 'living skills ontology' to provide verifiable mechanisms for demonstrating technical expertise. These findings highlight the need for more prescriptive national guidance and targeted outreach to foster comprehensive technical workforce development.",

This comparison is done after searching in both tools 10 different queries (e.g. Covid-19 or ChatGPT) with known trends in the last three years. Results show a high mean similarity between both tools (cosine: 0.7766, Pearson: 0.5478, Euclidean: 16.59) indicating that the proposed methodology is able to search and combine different online resource types efficiently and with enough quality. In addition, the application of filters has reduced the average similarity between both tools by up to 15.33%. We publicly release topSEARCH's code to support future research. We also release the database generated with topSEARCH, which contains a total of 27,002 resources for the selected 10 search queries.",

Total annual hotel revenue capacity is estimated at €177.7 billion, of which €69.8 billion (39.2%) is generated in High or Extremely High stress regions and €52.3 billion (29.4%) in Extremely High stress regions. Exposure is highly concentrated in Mediterranean countries.",

        "abstract": "Conventional wisdom holds that economic crises such as high inflation reduce public support for incumbents, yet surprisingly, incumbents sometimes retain public approval and even win reelection. How do incumbents maintain public support during economic crises? We argue that incumbents may use two rhetorical strategies. First, incumbent rhetoric can divert attention to sociocultural issues to reduce the salience of a souring economy. Second, incumbent rhetoric can stress relative economic competence by emphasizing the opposition’s incompetence and incumbent’s achievements. We test the effectiveness of these strategies by conducting a survey experiment with 2,400 citizens before Turkey’s 2023 election, a context of severe inflation. We find that incumbent sociocultural rhetoric failed to shift respondents’ attitudes. By contrast, incumbent economic rhetoric significantly affected respondents’ attitudes and persuaded citizens outside the incumbent’s base in particular. These findings illuminate the surprising resilience of support for incumbent populist leaders in competitive authoritarian regimes.",

However, qualitative evidence on what people find uniquely fearful and uniquely hopeful about climate change remains limited. To address this gap, an online qualitative survey asked 299 Australians (Mage = 33.09, SDage = 12.14) to identify what they found fearful and hopeful about climate change. Through inductive thematic analysis, three themes reflected Australians’ fear: (1) ‘Change and Instability’, (2) ‘Inaction and Negligence by Government, Large Corporations, and Others’, and (3) ‘Intergenerational Impacts and Legacy’. Additionally, three themes reflected Australians’ hope: (1) ‘Changing Attitudes and Changing Pro-environmental Habits’, (2) ‘Progress, Technology, Sustainability, and Innovation’, and (3) ‘An Opportunity for Change’. While some elements of what Australians find fearful or hopeful may be unique (e.g., bushfires), others (e.g., intergenerational impacts) align with global concerns. These insights offer valuable guidance for designing interventions that aim to foster fear and hope to promote climate action.",

This study examines their distributional effects using individual asset data from the DNB Household Survey and cross-country portfolio information from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Applying the Global Capital Asset Pricing Model, I find that returns do not systematically correlate with financial wealth in the Netherlands. Counterfactual simulations indicate that inequality remains stable under the Dutch status quo. However, rising returns or increased return heterogeneity amplify inequality, particularly if participation gaps persist. Broadening financial market participation mitigates these effects and reduces long-term uncertainty in wealth inequality trends. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

        "abstract": "We introduce a new source for the study of the kinship networks and careers of local officials in China in the late Qing, that is the late 19th and early 20th century. These officials constituted a local bureaucratic and educational elite, but compared with elite officials, relatively little is known about their characteristics, including their family backgrounds and kin networks. To study them, we have constructed a new dataset from Tongguanlu rosters of officials that include their resumes, degree or other qualifications and rosters of their kin and are available for officials in a variety of locations in China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Information for officials includes not only the names and degrees held by patrilineal father, grandfather, and great-grandfather commonly recorded for elite examination degree holders that have been studied previously, but detailed information about uncles, great-uncles, male cousins, sons, and nephews, and basic information about female kin including mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers, daughters. In contrast with other sources that only include holders of elite exam degrees, Tongguanlu include holders of purchased Jiansheng and Tribute (Gongsheng) degrees, low-level prefectural degrees Shengyuan, and other qualifications. We provide background on the Tongguanlu as a source, describe how we constructed the dataset, summarize its contents, and then present results on the posts, qualifications, and kin networks of local officials. We show that holders of purchased degrees and low-level Shengyuan examination degrees were less likely than holders of higher degrees to come from families with a history of holding degrees, and that officials with regular appointments were more likely to have kin with degrees than officials with acting appointments, or who were expectant officials.",

        "authors": "Daniel Sandvej Eriksen",
        "abstract": "Agenda setting is pivotal to democratic politics and remains in constant flux. With the rise of social media, many argue that political communication has increasingly migrated to these platforms, overshadowing traditional venues like parliament. However, the interplay between social media and the parliamentary venue remains poorly underswtood, even though understanding this relationship is crucial for grasping behavior in both contexts. In this paper, I argue that agendas initiated on social media can find their way into parliamentary discussions. However, while discussion in parliament is among opposition actors’ prime means of confronting the government with its ideas, such discussions carry higher stakes for government actors, making parliamentary talk less cheap for them. This dynamic creates an unexpected opportunity: Government parties can leverage social media to initiate new agendas that opposition parties subsequently introduce into parliamentary debates. In contrast, opposition parties cannot similarly employ social media to force government responses in parliament. Utilizing an original dataset of over 5.5 million tweets by parties and politicians, 400,000 parliamentary questions, and 750,000 news articles from the United Kingdom and Denmark (2015–2022), I employ state-of-the-art automated content analysis techniques. The findings support the proposed ideas. Together, these insights underscore the dynamic interplay between digital platforms and the legislative venue, calling for a renewed understanding of agenda setting in a hybrid communication environment where the boundaries between social media and parliament are increasingly blurred.",

        "abstract": "Climate change has often been characterized as humanity's greatest threat. However, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may cause technological risks to materialize more rapidly than many climate impacts. This raises fundamental questions for the climate community. How should climate professionals address the potential for AI systems to automate cognitive tasks? How might dramatic technological transformation over shorter timescales affect the relative value of near-term versus long-term research priorities? Drawing on recent developments in AI capabilities, expert forecasting, and risk assessment, I suggest three broad scenarios to guide our thinking about AI development and its implications for climate research. Rather than advocating for any single response, I explore how climate professionals might thoughtfully prepare for multiple possible futures while maintaining commitment to addressing the climate crisis. The analysis considers potential adjustments to research communication, graduate education, and collaborative engagement with the AI safety community, while acknowledging the significant uncertainties inherent in technological forecasting. These questions have no easy answers, but they warrant serious consideration as the climate research community navigates unprecedented technological change alongside ongoing environmental challenges.",

        "authors": "Ibrahim Arinc",
        "abstract": "This article examines critical mineral supply chains through a geo-economic and governance-oriented lens, drawing on Global Value Chain (GVC) theory and insights from asymmetric interdependence. It argues that supply vulnerabilities extend beyond geological endowment and extraction, increasingly reflecting coordination failures across transnational value chains, particularly at midstream and downstream stages involving refining, processing, logistics, certification, and regulatory alignment. While existing scholarship has largely treated hydrocarbon corridors and critical mineral supply risks as separate domains, limited attention has been paid to corridor-based governance arrangements capable of coordinating extraction, transit, processing, and market access across Eurasia. The study adopts a qualitative, policy-oriented methodology combining conceptual analysis, review of institutional and policy frameworks, and an embedded case study of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC serves as an institutional reference to examine how geographically connected actors, including Central Asian producers, Azerbaijan, Türkiye, and European markets, have managed asymmetric interdependence through long-term cooperation, intergovernmental frameworks, and coordinated state and commercial participation. Building on these insights, the article develops a corridor-based governance perspective for Eurasian critical mineral supply chains. It conceptualizes the Eurasian Critical Minerals Corridor not as an existing institutional structure, but as an analytical framework for examining how variable-geometry cooperation can structure interdependence, reduce exposure to value-chain vulnerabilities, and support more resilient supply arrangements. In doing so, the article advances a governance-centered interpretation of critical mineral supply chains and demonstrates how institutional lessons from energy corridors can inform policy debates on critical mineral security and the political economy of the energy transition.",

Ökonomisch betrachtet ist Journalismus ein Gut mit ausgeprägten positiven Externalitäten, da sich ein erheblicher Teil seines gesellschaftlichen Nutzens nicht in der individuellen Zahlungsbereitschaft widerspiegelt. Empirische Forschung, insbesondere zu sogenannten „Nachrichtenwüsten“, zeigt, dass der Rückgang von (lokalem) Journalismus mit geringerer Wahlbeteiligung, steigender politischer Polarisierung, sinkendem politischen Wissen sowie schwächerer politischer und wirtschaftlicher Kontrolle einhergeht. Dieser gesellschaftliche Nutzen entsteht in wesentlichen Teilen durch positive Externalitäten und führt zu einer Unterversorgung mit Journalismus. Die Digitalisierung hat dieses Problem verschärft, da sie traditionelle Erlösmodelle (insbesondere durch Werbung und Anzeigen) untergräbt und die wirtschaftliche Verwertbarkeit journalistischer Inhalte erschwert. Der Beitrag diskutiert verschiedene Regulierungs- und Förderansätze zur Korrektur dieses Marktversagens, darunter öffentlich-rechtliche Medien, sowie Nachfrage- und Angebotsförderung.",

This study offers novel insight into how staff perceive the opportunities and challenges of introducing a peer support worker role into a community brain injury service. Methods: Using qualitative interviews and focus groups with clinical and support staff, we explored understandings of the role, its perceived value, and contextual barriers to implementation. Reflexive thematic analysis generated three themes: the perfect candidate, context for success, and connecting care. Rigour was ensured through pre-registration, triangulated coding discussions, and reflexive analytic practices. Results: Findings highlighted the unique value of lived experience in fostering trust, hope, and engagement, while also revealing neuro-specific challenges relating to cognition, behaviour, and role boundaries. Staff emphasised the need for tailored recruitment, training, and supervision frameworks distinct from existing mental health models. Conclusions: The study is significant in being the first to systematically examine the adaptation of peer support to neurorehabilitation, offering evidence to guide service development and policy. Collectively, the findings underscore both the transformative potential and the structural requirements of embedding peer support within neurorehabilitation contexts.",

MOT is more strongly related (1) to self-reported K–12 math and science performance than to writing performance, (2) to math SAT scores than to verbal SAT scores, (3) to pursuing a STEM major than are vocabulary scores, and (4) to obtaining a STEM occupation than are vocabulary scores. The strength, selectivity, and breadth of these associations—with a cognitively and neurally well-characterized MOT task—underscore its value as both a mechanistically grounded probe of STEM aptitude and a promising tool for studying untapped STEM potential.",

        "abstract": "The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into education has revolutionized teaching practices, offering educators advanced tools for lesson planning, content creation, personalized learning, and administrative automation. While AI enhances efficiency and instructional effectiveness, concerns have emerged regarding teachers’ potential over-reliance on these technologies, leading to AI addiction. This study applies the I-PACE model (Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution) to explore the psychological and behavioral mechanisms underlying teachers’ dependence on generative AI. Using survey data from 1750 teachers, the study examines factors such as self-efficacy, need for cognition, mood regulation, positive affect, perceived usefulness, and cognitive absorption in shaping AI addiction. Findings indicate that cognitive absorption is the strongest predictor of AI dependence, while perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, and positive affect contribute indirectly through reinforcement mechanisms. Notably, mood regulation and need for cognition do not significantly influence AI addiction, suggesting that AI engagement in education is driven more by functional efficiency than emotional dependence. The results highlight the importance of fostering mindful AI integration in teaching to prevent habitual over-reliance. This study provides theoretical contributions by extending the I-PACE model to the context of AI addiction in education and offers practical insights for educators, institutions, and policymakers in promoting responsible AI use while maintaining teachers' professional autonomy and cognitive engagement.",

The findings indicated no significant differences in AU, AF, RD, and PL between males and females. Similarly, there were no significant differences in PU, AT, BI, and UB between genders, although males demonstrated marginally higher scores in PEOU than females. Autistic traits showed specific correlations with perceptions of AI tools: AU was negatively correlated with PU, AT, and marginally with PEOU; AF was marginally negatively correlated with PU and AT; RD was negatively correlated with PEOU, AT, and BI, and marginally with PU. Furthermore, the study highlighted the moderating role of gender in the relationship between autistic traits and perceptions of AI tools. Specifically, the effects of autistic traits on perceptions were more pronounced in males than in females, particularly the relationships between PEOU and AF, UB and AU, and UB and PL. This research highlighted the importance of considering autistic traits in educational technology deployment, advocating for customizable AI solutions to better meet diverse learner needs. The outcomes contributed to a more inclusive understanding of educational technology, emphasizing the need to adapt AI tools to enhance learning experiences for all students, regardless of gender or neurodiversity.",

        "abstract": "This study explores English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' perceptions of the promise and limitations of EAP Talk, an AI-based speech evaluation system, for speaking practice. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 366 EFL learners across five universities through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The findings reveal that EAP Talk significantly enhances speaking skills, including pronunciation, grammar accuracy, idea-organization, read-aloud, and presentation skills. Participants appreciated the convenience, motivational aspects, and institutional efficiency of EAP Talk, which allowed for flexible and autonomous learning. However, several limitations were identified. Issues with the accuracy of voice recognition and score feedback affected learners' confidence in the feedback. The relevance of practice materials to academic courses was another concern, as was the limited detail in the feedback provided by EAP Talk, which often lacked comprehensive explanations and corrective guidance. The absence of feedback on grammar accuracy and textual organization further limited the tool's effectiveness for developing comprehensive speaking proficiency. These findings suggest that while EAP Talk holds significant potential for enhancing language learning, ongoing improvements are necessary to address its limitations. This study contributes to the understanding of how AI tools can support EFL learners for speaking practice.",

        "authors": "Yiran Du",
        "abstract": "This study examines the influence of emojis on the comprehension of verbal irony in computer-mediated communication (CMC), with a focus on cross-cultural comparisons between Chinese and American participants. Verbal irony, often reliant on paralinguistic cues absent in text-based communication, poses comprehension challenges in CMC. Emojis, as nonverbal cues, are hypothesized to aid in conveying and interpreting ironic intent. The research involved 96 participants, equally divided between the two cultures, who were presented with scenarios containing verbal irony accompanied by either a winking or smiling emoji, or no emoji. The findings suggest significant cross-cultural differences in irony comprehension facilitated by emojis. American participants showed improved irony comprehension with the winking emoji, aligning with its conventional association with sarcasm in Western cultures. Conversely, Chinese participants better understood irony when paired with the smiling emoji, highlighting cultural variations in emoji interpretation. The study underscores the complex role of cultural context in digital communication.",

        "authors": "Joep van Lit, Rozemarijn van Dijk",
        "abstract": "This paper examines the underexplored impact of violence against politicians on citizens’ acceptance of violence and their willingness to engage in politics. By focusing on citizens, it addresses a critical gap in research, which has largely emphasized how violence affects politicians rather than the public. While existing studies demonstrate that political violence influences politicians’ behavior and discourse, impacting representative elements of democracy, there is limited insight into how such incidents shape citizens’ engagement after learning about violence. Although citizens generally condemn violence against politicians in the abstract, it remains unclear whether their own political engagement is impacted and varies based on the target of the incident. We theorize that the impact of violence against political figures on political engagement varies by (1) partisanship; (2) political role (elite or activist) and (3) the gender of the victim. Additionally, we examine the potential mediating roles of fear and anger on political participation. Based on a survey experiment in both Belgium and the Netherlands (n = 3.139) we find no demobilizing effect of learning about political violence. In fact, we find a small mobilizing effect when the target belongs to the political in-group of the party. This mobilizing effect is likely to be mediated by anger.",

        "authors": "Bernard Koch, David Peterson",
        "abstract": "Evaluation systems are central organizing institutions in science that coordinate consensus and drive epistemic trajectories. Scientific fields have traditionally relied on \"organic\" evaluation systems (e.g., peer review, citation) where consensus emerges gradually across multiple epistemic values. This paper highlights artificial intelligence research (AIR) as a potent counterpoint to this model. Drawing on interviews with key actors, computational analyses, and archival materials spanning AIR’s history (1956–2021), we examine how AI evolved from a discipline with weak organic evaluation into a field driven by benchmarking, a “formal” evaluation system that defines progress quantitatively as state-of-the-art accuracy on commercial tasks. We demonstrate that benchmarking came to dominate through an intricate symbiosis with deep learning: benchmarking rewards accuracy, which large-scale deep learning uniquely excelled at, while deep learning’s opacity made organic evaluation increasingly difficult. This symbiosis restructured the field organizationally, epistemically, and materially into a “monoculture” dedicated to scaling. While enabling breakneck progress, monoculture discouraged exploration of alternatives with different epistemic strengths. As AI spreads to other knowledge fields (from science to law to art) benchmarking will accompany it. Our findings thus highlight the risk that formalization of evaluation can lead to monoculture in other creative domains.",

        "authors": "Benhee Lee",
        "abstract": "International education research often emphasizes economic, academic, or structural factors shaping student mobility, yet such approaches insufficiently capture the psychological meanings students attach to prestigious foreign institutions. This qualitative study examines how Korean undergraduate and graduate students construct self-concepts and future-oriented identities when deciding to pursue higher education in the United States. Drawing on identity-based motivation theory, self-concept and possible selves, and consumer identity perspectives, the study conceptualizes elite U.S. universities as prestige brands that carry symbolic value beyond academic instruction. Based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with Korean students enrolled at U.S. universities, thematic analysis reveals that participants understood university choice as a means of enacting aspirational elite or global identities, signaling social status, and securing social recognition and belonging. Seven interrelated themes capture how educational decisions were shaped by relational self-concepts, collective family expectations, prior academic and cross-cultural experiences, perceived career security, desires for autonomy and meaningful learning, negotiations over cost and sacrifice, and the branding power of U.S. institutions as signals of global competence. The findings suggest that international higher education functions as an identity-driven practice embedded in cultural expectations, social comparison, and symbolic hierarchies. This study contributes an integrative perspective that advances understanding of motivation, stratification, and identity in international higher education decision-making.

        "authors": "Mehdi Khalighi",
        "abstract": "Workplace safety is a critical driver of operational efficiency and employee well-being, yet organizations often struggle to quantify its economic value. This study examines the cost–benefit dynamics of investing in occupational safety programs relative to the financial burdens associated with workplace injuries. Using quantitative analysis, industry benchmarks, and an applied case study, the research evaluates the return on investment (ROI) of proactive safety interventions. Findings demonstrate that comprehensive safety programs reduce the frequency and severity of workplace injuries while generating measurable financial benefits, including lower insurance costs, reduced absenteeism, and improved operational efficiency. Although safety initiatives require upfront investment, the results show that proactive interventions consistently outweigh injury-related costs and deliver substantial long-term economic advantages. The study further highlights the strategic importance of integrating safety management into organizational decision-making, emphasizing its role in enhancing economic performance, workforce sustainability, and organizational resilience.",

        "abstract": "This paper refers to interview data collected in six municipalities in the Lecce province of southern Italy, across three waves: 2020, 2021, and 2022. The principal aim of the research was to determine whether compliance with four government-recommended non-pharmaceutical measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 differed over the years and, if so, whether these differences were influenced by personal characteristics. Specifically, we focused on the psychological features of self-control, risk attitude, and fear of contracting COVID-19 and their relationships with indoor and outdoor mask use, and indoor and outdoor physical distancing. The results suggest that virus mortality, the regulations in force, and experience of the pandemic affected compliance with certain preventive measures across all waves. With regard to psychological features, the three factors of interest were found to determine preferences and substitutions across measures.",

        "authors": "Elizabeth Davis, Hieu Quoc Vo, Thang Le, Dat Cao, Chau My Thi Le, Trung Cao",
        "abstract": "Demand for tiger parts has contributed to a global decline in tiger populations. Tigers are extirpated entirely from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and are severely threatened in extant populations in Southeast Asia. Across the region, tiger farms have been established with the main intent of supplying tigers for consumer demand, e.g. tiger bone glue for medicine. Tiger farms are known to operate within Vietnam and within Nghe An province, the focal area of this study. We interviewed 16 former tiger farmers to understand how they obtained their tigers, how they farmed tigers, why they farmed tigers, why they stopped farming tigers, and their beliefs around environmental policy, tiger conservation, and tiger reintroduction. Tiger cubs were trafficked in from Laos and raised by the tiger farmers to adulthood, at which point the tigers were sold to other individuals who slaughtered the tigers for their parts. We found that most of our sample were aware that tigers are in decline globally, and extinct from Vietnam. Farming was perceived as “easy” and lucrative; however, our sample were no longer raising tigers due to fears of fines and jail time. Our sample were ambivalent about the current environmental policy around farming, but were supportive of reintroduction and stated their desire to see tigers in Vietnam again. While tiger farms do still operate in Nghe An, we find it heartening that proactive enforcement appears to be discouraging individuals to continue farming. Our study illustrates the importance of government commitment to policy in driving conservation impact.",
