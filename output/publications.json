          "authors": "John J. Cho, Mia Costa, Yusaku Horiuchi",
          "abstract": "Do voters want representatives who share their race, ethnicity, or partisanship? We examine this question with a focus on Asian Americans who face trade-offs between descriptive (that is, Asian American or ‘pan-ethnic’) and partisan representation, as well as trade-offs involving ‘co-ethnic’ (for example, Korean for Korean) and ‘cross-ethnic’ (for example, Indian for Korean) descriptive representation. Across two experiments, we find that when Asian Americans are asked about collective representation in Congress, they prioritize more co-ethnic and pan-ethnic legislators over co-partisan legislators. However, in a competitive electoral setting, they often trade off race/ethnicity for partisanship. Asian Americans are only willing to cross party lines to vote for a co-ethnic candidate, but never for a cross- or pan-ethnic candidate. These findings shed light on the importance of considering heterogeneous preferences along ethnicities within the same racial ‘in-group’, such as Asian Americans, a heavily understudied and heterogeneous group in American politics.",

          "authors": "Mark A. Kayser, Kasia Nalewajko",
          "abstract": "Scholars and political observers, alike, have associated political polarization with the weakening of democratic norms and the undermining of accountability, as partisans trade off the public interest against in-group loyalty. We probe how in-group bias shapes support for collective goods in actual high-stakes settings in an especially polarized democracy. Conducting survey experiments in Poland, we examine two scenarios: electoral integrity during the 2023 parliamentary election that could have entrenched authoritarian rule and national security after Russia’s 2022 invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Our findings show pronounced partisan bias undermining support for electoral integrity – approximately 40 per cent of party supporters with an average level of partisanship supported rerunning an election when their party unexpectedly lost – but less bias in judgments about national security, raising the possibility that individuals may view democracy as more of an instrumental than an intrinsic good.",

          "authors": "Andrew Trexler",
          "abstract": "Political news consumption is highly uneven today: few people consume from news outlets directly, while many encounter news incidentally through social media and aggregators. Because outlets depend on direct consumers for revenue, they respond primarily to this core audience’s preferences. Several contemporary styles of news coverage—which emphasize partisan conflict, employ specialized jargon, engage in predictive analysis, and use clickbait language—are attractive to core consumers, but may also make news less accessible for others. In a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 2,233), I show that, relative to a public interest style that prioritizes key information about policy and democratic norms, typical news styles weaken post-exposure recall of key news information—that is, they are under-informative. Recall penalties are especially severe for those with lower baseline political engagement, yet still affect highly engaged consumers as well. This study shows that contemporary approaches to news coverage broadly under-serve the public by inhibiting political learning.",

          "authors": "Ning He, Wenbing Wu",
          "abstract": "State violence inflicts obvious direct costs on its victims, but many of its significant consequences may be indirect. Building on the literature on principal-agent problems in authoritarian regimes, we argue that coercion against bureaucrats motivates them to pursue over-zealous goals at social costs. We test this argument by studying how bureaucratic purges in China under Mao impacted the behavior of local bureaucrats during the Great Leap Forward, a campaign that caused over 30 million deaths from mass starvation. Exploiting variations in purge intensity across about 1350 counties, we find the purge intimidated local bureaucrats into inflating grain production figures and extracting excessive amounts of grain from farmers, which resulted in significant increases in famine mortality. The results highlight the perils of “accountability by violence” in authoritarian regimes.",

          "authors": "Romuald Méango, Esther Mirjam Girsberger",
          "abstract": "One of the exciting developments in the stated preference literature is the use of probabilistic stated preference experiments to estimate semi-parametric population distributions of ex ante returns and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a choice attribute. This relies on eliciting several choices per individual and estimating separate demand functions at the cost of possibly long survey instruments. This paper shows that the distributions of interest can be recovered from at most two stated choices with significantly weaker assumptions. Hence, it allows for significantly shorter survey instruments. The paper also shows that eliciting probabilistic stated choices allows identifying much richer objects than we have done so far, and therefore, provides better tools for ex ante policy evaluation. Finally, it showcases the feasibility and relevance of the results by studying the preferences of high ability students in Côte d’Ivoire for public sector jobs by exploiting a unique survey on this population. Our analysis supports the claim that public sector jobs might significantly increase the cost of hiring elite students for the private sector.",

          "abstract": "Taxpayer audits are key instruments to combat tax evasion. Whether they deter tax non-compliance beyond audited taxpayers is largely unclear, however. Drawing on rich tax administrative data for South Africa, we show that business tax audits enhance the tax reporting compliance of unaudited firms in the same neighborhood and tax preparer network as the targeted business. On average, firms’ reported tax liability increases by around 1% when a business in close proximity (located within a 100-m radius) undergoes an audit and equally by around 1% when a firm in the same tax preparer net is audited. These estimates translate into sizable aggregate revenue gains as audited firms are linked to numerous other firms within their networks. Our findings carry important implications for the design of tax enforcement policies.",

          "abstract": "We propose a new fiscal transmission channel based on countercyclical monopsony power in the labour market. We develop a New Keynesian model incorporating a time-varying degree of monopsony power, with workers valuing various job aspects and firms having wage-setting power, inversely related to the elasticity of labour supply to individual firms. As government spending increases, labour supply to individual firms becomes more elastic, creating more competition and larger fiscal multipliers. We examine this channel’s interactions with other fiscal transmission channels. Finally, we confirm empirically the model’s prediction of reduced employer market power following government spending expansions.",

          "abstract": "Using confidential Census data, we find that aggressive performance pay practices and productivity growth have combined to increase U.S. inequality. Employees at more productive firms earn higher pay at all earnings levels; similarly, when a firm becomes more productive, pay increases across its workforce. Importantly, however, these pay-productivity relationships strengthen with seniority: within a firm, the pay-productivity elasticity more than doubles from the median-paid worker (0.04) to the top-paid worker (0.10). Moreover, this pay-performance relationship is particularly steep when there is more scope for performance-based pay, suggesting that the use of incentives can spur the growth of inequality following productivity growth.",

          "abstract": "When useful information is distressing, it may deliberately be ignored. In this paper, we examine both theoretically and experimentally whether increasing perceived efficacy — the belief that one’s actions can influence an outcome — reduces such strategic ignorance. Participants in India are given the choice to receive or avoid information about the average loss in life expectancy due to air pollution in their district and are later asked to recall it. We find that increasing perceived efficacy significantly improves recall, particularly among participants with optimistic prior beliefs. The pattern is confirmed when conducting the same experiment in the United States. Our theoretical framework highlights how perceived efficacy shapes the interplay between anticipatory and realized utility, thereby influencing strategic ignorance.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that attitudes towards immigration are linked to policy preferences and voting behaviour. However, we lack insights on the relevance of the other side of the migration coin: emigration. This is especially pertinent in the European Union (EU), which guarantees free movement of persons and where large-scale mobility gained momentum following the Eastern enlargement (East to West) and the euro crisis (South to North). Drawing on a 2021 survey conducted in nine peripheral EU countries, this study investigates whether concerns about emigration shape electoral behaviour. Findings indicate that such concerns reduce support for governing parties, but only among individuals with high levels of political trust, highlighting trust as a key moderating factor. At the country level, concerns about emigration favour radical-right parties, though not exclusively. In fact, the politicization of emigration can potentially benefit (or disadvantage) a range of parties depending on national political conditions.",

Despite strong evidence that ODA actually results in increased levels of emigration, a new approach to ‘migration management aid’ is driving widespread policy experimentation, particularly in Europe. In the case of ‘in‐donor refugee costs’, an earlier attempt to use ODA to pursue migration management goals, accounting methods of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) provided valuable tools to monitor changes in expenditure. The creation of a new DAC code means that this is now possible for migration management aid.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how social ties are actively constructed, recalibrated or severed by migrants navigating a reality of double war, defined as the simultaneous exposure to war in both their countries of origin and destination. The study draws on thirty‐seven in‐depth interviews with migrants from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus who immigrated to Israel between 2022 and 2024 following Russia's full‐scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and later experienced renewed insecurity during the Israel–Hamas War. Engaging three main bodies of literature, transnationalism, social network theory and migration in contexts of war and displacement, this study explores how migrants manage ties across a geo‐social triangle: the origin country, the host country and third countries. The analysis identifies two relational phases: an initial overload and triage of social ties, followed by a phase of relational calibration, in which migrants make strategic and emotionally and morally charged decisions about with whom to connect, support or withdraw from. These findings offer a conceptual understanding of social ties as dynamic and ethically negotiated responses to instability. By positioning migrants' agency under conditions of insecurity, the study contributes new analytic tools for examining how war reshapes relational life across transnational space.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization is often characterized as a consequence of changes in media content or technology. We argue, in contrast, for an account that views polarization in media and the public as a co-adaptive process. This paper begins with a brief review of cultural evolution and co-adaptation and then considers the application of similar ideas to changes in media and the public over time. Using formal models, we suggest that—in combination with the human tendency toward in-group bias—a co-adaptive (rather than unidirectional) relationship can best account for real-world dynamics. We consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of media effects and technological innovation in polarization, representative democracy, and mass-mediated communication more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Does poverty drive prejudice? We study this question in Myanmar, a deeply divided society where anti-Muslim sentiment surged during a partial democratic transition in the mid-2010s. Drawing on theories of economic competition and scapegoating, we test whether material hardship predicts exclusionary attitudes using new data from a nationally representative survey of 22,000 adults belonging to the majority Buddhist group. We find a large and consistent association: both poorer individuals and poorer townships are more likely to express Islamophobia. This relationship persists when leveraging a plausibly exogenous income shock caused by severe flooding. Poverty is more predictive of anti-Muslim sentiment than key alternative explanations for intergroup animus. It also correlates with hostility toward other minorities (Hindus and Indians), indicating that poverty is tied to a more general tendency to denigrate outgroups. Our findings shed light on the economic foundations of polarized social preferences and may help identify communities at heightened risk of ethnoreligious conflict.",

I propose a theory of strategic opportunity, which holds that a major power seeks to drive a wedge in the rival’s alliance by offering economic aid to a rival’s protégé when that country experiences a rapid deterioration in its relations with its patron. I test my theory on major power rivalry dyads and find empirical support for my argument on a set of directed dyad-year observations between 1960 and 2010. The findings contribute to our understanding of alliance politics and strategic considerations behind using economic carrots in major power rivalry.",

We find that state dyads which possess nuclear weapons are significantly more likely to engage in indirect conflict. The results suggest the importance of including measures of indirect conflict in future scholarship and the need for policymakers to prepare for increased instances of indirect conflict between major powers possessing nuclear weapons.",

          "authors": "Anne-Kathrin Kreft, Ragnhild Nordås, Ingrid Vik Bakken",
          "abstract": "Although many scholars have studied the effects of repression on dissent, we have relatively little information on how the public perceives these effects. Do people think that protesters are likely to demobilize when faced with repression? And do such perceptions depend on the particular repressive methods being used, the characteristics of the dissenters, or a combination of the two? This manuscript uses an experimental design to address these questions, inquiring specifically into gender dynamics in repressive victimization. Research outside repression scholarship shows that public perceptions of political actors are often based on gender stereotypes. However, gender has so far received less attention in studies of contentious politics, despite the growing involvement of women in protest movements worldwide and recent reports of gender-based and sexualized repression in different contexts. This study uses a survey experiment of a U.S. sample (N = 1,500), leveraging a vignette of a protest-repression scenario in a foreign country, which randomly varies the gender of the repressed protesters (men vs. women) and the repressive tactic (rape vs multiple electric shocks). The results reveal that rape is perceived as more demobilizing across the board. However, defying prominent gender stereotypes, respondents do not expect that women are more likely to demobilize than men, even following rape. Instead, women are assumed to mobilize friends and talk to journalists. The results highlight the need for a broader research program examining public perceptions of repression and gender in contentious politics. After all, public perceptions of who asserts political agency under what conditions can have tangible socio-political ramifications, e.g., with respect to support for social movements or leadership preferences.",

          "abstract": "How do terror attacks influence the attitudes of minority groups who are often targets of prejudice and hostility in their aftermath? Existing research considers the effects of terrorism on majority group attitudes; however, there is a significant gap regarding its effects on minorities. We address this gap by examining the impact of 2016–2017 terror attacks in Western Europe on the perceived discrimination of Muslims in Germany using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We employ an unexpected event during survey design to estimate the causal effects of these attacks on Muslims' perceptions of ethnic discrimination and worry about xenophobia. Our results show that the effects of these attacks on Muslims are not uniform and depend on respondents' levels of education and integration. Respondents with higher levels of education and host language fluency are less likely to report perceived discrimination or worry about xenophobia following attacks, compared with those with lower levels of integration. These results are consistent with a dissociation–detachment mechanism, whereby more integrated members of a stigmatized group psychologically distance themselves from the in-group to buffer against the negative psychological impacts of discrimination in the aftermath of attacks. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the psychological and political consequences of terrorism, with particular emphasis on minority communities. They underscore that minority responses to terrorism are not monolithic but shaped by social and educational differences within these communities.",

Respondents are less willing to host displaced persons who participated in the fighting compared to victims of violence, with particular aversion toward those affiliated with militias who are perceived as more accountable for the conflict and as posing a greater security risk. We contribute to the literature on attitudes towards migrants by highlighting that hosts in conflict-affected communities are driven by a broader range of concerns than those identified in the existing literature, which primarily focuses on the US and European contexts.",

          "abstract": "Preconflict material, social, ideological, and organizational foundations are seen as central to sustaining the insurgencies of the 20th and 21st centuries. These endowments help to explain how some insurgents survive the early onslaught of stronger counterinsurgents. Still, while endowments may be central to attracting followers and building legitimacy, they do not necessarily help insurgents fight better. Military practitioners and scholars of state militaries often view such preconflict foundations as challenges to military effectiveness that organizations must overcome. This article considers the role of rebels’ preconflict foundations through the lens of the Taliban’s revival after 2001 and via cross-national analysis of the association between preconflict foundations, insurgent military capacity, and insurgent victory since 1946. I find little evidence that endowments generate military power. In fact, there is evidence that, in some circumstances, ideological, social, and organizational foundations may have the opposite effect. In the case of the Taliban, its preconflict endowments interfered with military reform and adaptation and the social cohesion they generated often led to worse combat outcomes.",

          "authors": "Quan Li, Hankyeul Yang",
          "abstract": "According to the idea of extended dependence (Chen, 2021), in a directed dyad setting, a challenger’s trade dependence on a target’s defensive allies decreases the likelihood that the challenger initiates military conflict. The deterrence works because the target’s allies are both willing and able to impose severe economic punishment on the challenger. We refine this argument by introducing conditional extended dependence. We argue that for extended dependence to deter a potential challenger ex ante, the target’s allies must overcome two challenges. First, the potential challenger must believe those allies would credibly follow through with the threat of sufficiently harmful economic punishment. Second, the target’s allies successfully coordinate collective action to prevent the challenger from finding substitute markets. Extended dependence is more likely to fulfill these conditions when a “significant” state is centrally positioned within the target’s alliance network and exerts substantial leverage over other allies. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that extended dependence deters Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) initiations conditionally between 1951 and 2012, but unconditionally from 1870 to 1950.

Linking the nutrient composition of &gt;2,800 aquatic species with &gt;2 million fishmeal and farmed fish transactions in international aquatic food trade between 2015 and 2019, we examined aquaculture’s nutritional flows and distributional equity. We found that aquaculture provided adequate intakes for nearly a quarter of a million individuals, on average, across 14 key nutrients, and for up to 2.7 billion individuals for several nutrients, such as Vitamin B 12 . The vast majority of these nutrients (76.8%) were domestically retained, contributing to the nutritional security of producer countries. With most internationally traded nutrients originating from nutritionally vulnerable countries (57.7% for fishmeal and 66.3% for farmed aquatic foods), rethinking existing distribution policies with nutrition as the primary objective may help unlock the full potential of aquaculture to eliminate hunger and malnutrition.",

          "abstract": "The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical forests leads to major social–ecological impacts. Yet little is known about where and how the capitalized actors driving this expansion interact with smallholders, particularly where smallholders live inside the forest. Two alternative outcomes of their interactions on deforestation are plausible: accelerated deforestation as all actors compete for land (i.e., land rush hypothesis) or, alternatively, slower deforestation as actors hinder each other’s expansion (i.e., competition hypothesis). We test these hypotheses for two global deforestation hotspots: the Dry Chaco and the Chiquitano Forests (together nearly 1 million km 2 ), using a land-systems representation that captures spatially overlapping land-use actors. We integrate satellite-based forest-loss time series with an independent reconstruction of land-system change from 2000 to 2023 in a Bayesian regression framework. This reveals three key findings: First, capitalized agriculture has expanded mainly over areas used by forest-dependent smallholders and Indigenous communities, indicating strongly intensifying land competition. Second, where forest-dwelling smallholders persist, their presence can mitigate deforestation pressure from expanding commodity frontiers. Third, the presence of either forest-dwelling smallholders or conservation areas maintains forest cover, but their combined presence does not amplify the protection effect. Overall, our findings show that interactions between agribusinesses and smallholders are key factors that shape the social–ecological outcomes of frontier expansion in the tropics. Accounting for land-system overlaps in research and policymaking on frontiers can therefore improve efforts to safeguard forests while supporting traditional livelihoods, especially in contested, rapidly changing landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Forecast models are a key decision-support tool for public health authorities in managing epidemics, feeding into early warning systems, scenario evaluations, and an empirical basis for resource allocation. In Brazil, improving dengue forecasting became a priority in response to the unprecedented increase in cases, which surpassed the total of the previous decade and expanded to new regions. The Infodengue-Mosqlimate consortium launched the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge 2024 (IMDC24), or Dengue Forecast Sprint, bringing together six international teams provided with cases and climate covariates data to generate actionable forecasts for 2024 and 2025 seasons in five diverse Brazilian states, leveraging advanced machine learning and classical statistical models. This paper outlines the structure and findings of the IMDC24. The performance of the models varied between years and locations, and no single model consistently excelled, especially during 2024’s unprecedentedly large season. This performance variability highlighted the need for ensemble approaches. The ensemble models developed are presented as the main results of this collaborative development. As intended, the ensemble models have been adopted by Brazilian public health authorities to help with planning and response to the forecasted 2025 dengue epidemics across the country.",

          "abstract": "Expectations can shape perception and potentially lead to self-fulfilling prophecies such as placebo effects that persist or grow over time. Nonetheless, whether and how unreinforced and unconditioned social cues (i.e., suggestions about future experiences that have not been reinforced with reward or punishment) can create and sustain such effects is unknown. We conducted a set of experiments in which participants (N = 111) experienced stimuli eliciting somatic pain (heat), vicarious pain (videos of others in pain), and cognitive effort (a mental-rotation task), at three intensity levels each. Before each stimulus, participants viewed a social cue that ostensibly indicated ratings from 10 other participants but was in fact randomized to a high or low mean aversiveness level independent of actual stimulus intensity. Across all tasks, participants’ expectations and experience ratings shifted in line with the cues, with high-aversive cues leading to higher perceived aversiveness. Computational modeling and behavioral analysis revealed lower learning rates for prediction errors inconsistent with the trial’s cue value (e.g., better than expected for high-aversive cues) and higher learning rates for prediction errors consistent with the cue value (e.g., worse than expected for high-aversive cues). These findings reveal a confirmation bias in learning: people update more when outcomes align with expectations. Combined with expectation effects on perception, this bias helps sustain social cue effects. Together, these mechanisms show how social information can shape perception and learning, giving rise to self-fulfilling prophecies.",

In this study, we systematically map peer-reviewed literature that explicitly assesses the societal value of ESI across instrumental, intrinsic, and relational value types, and the diversity of approaches used to assess those values. Drawing from 13,823 publications across Scopus, Web of Science, and a curated library of ESI valuation studies, we identify 171 studies that applied ESI in a decision context and used a valuation method to compare outcomes with and without ESI. The majority of these studies employed decision analysis methods (e.g., Value of Information, Cost–Benefit Analysis), focusing primarily on quantitative instrumental values (e.g., profit, crop yield, lives saved), particularly in agricultural contexts. A smaller set of studies applied preference elicitation methods (e.g., stated preference, surveys, interviews, focus groups) to capture qualitative benefits and relational values including quality of life improvements, empowerment, and procedural justice. Many excluded studies demonstrated scientific value of ESI but did not explicitly translate that into societal value, revealing the need for a more systematic approach to ESI valuation. By promoting a more inclusive, interdisciplinary, and flexible portfolio of valuation methods, we aim to expand our understanding of the societal benefits of ESI to help guide investment in future missions, enhance public support, and ensure that science and policy goals are well aligned.",

          "abstract": "Conservation and environmental management are under increased scrutiny as the embeddedness of oppressive practices has gained wider societal and scholarly attention. As conservation and environmental practitioners and scholars grapple with foundational assumptions and practices of the field, there remains a pressing need to identify persistent problematic legacies and articulate a positive vision for conservation grounded in an ethic of justice. To help advance this conversation, we present a framework of four intersecting dimensions of oppression: 1) the physical or material manifestations of conservation and environmental management; 2) the knowledge practices and assumptions that inform and underpin conservation and environmental visions and decision-making; 3) the modes of governance associated with conservation and environmental practice; and 4) the forms of relational praxis implicitly and explicitly endorsed and/or imposed in conservation and other environmental arenas. We explain the framework through an analysis of the legacy of fortress conservation, then illustrate the framework’s wider application to diagnose ongoing elements of oppression in other environmental arenas (wildland fire, riverine flows). We then review prominent strategies and visions for moving forward for both nature and people to highlight both positive steps being taken and the utility of the framework in ensuring emergent environmental paradigms avoid the pitfalls of the past. Viewing each dimension of oppression as moveable levers to promote antioppressive conservation futures, we conclude with a set of questions to help conservation and environmental management scientists and practitioners identify where oppression might be manifest in their own work, and begin to embody antioppressive practices.",

          "abstract": "First impressions often hinge on visible cues, leading people to infer the trustworthiness of strangers from their appearance and dress. While religiosity is generally associated with greater perceived trustworthiness, little is known about how visible religious markers, such as clothing and grooming styles, shape trust judgments in Muslim-majority societies, where such signals are widespread and easily recognizable. We examine this question using a large-scale vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative face-to-face survey in Turkey. By experimentally varying profile characteristics, we identify the causal effect of a Muslim headscarf or beard on perceived trustworthiness. Contrary to expectations, individuals displaying these religious badges are generally viewed as less trustworthy than otherwise identical profiles, even by highly religious respondents. Mediation analyses show that these effects arise because religious badges signal multiple attributes, not only religiosity but also political orientation and physical attractiveness—and that these inferred meanings differ by gender: women’s headscarves and men’s beards prompt distinct patterns of inference. These findings show that visible religious markers shape trust judgments through multivalent social inferences rather than perceived piety alone. The results highlight how observers draw on broader social and political associations when interpreting religious markers, providing evidence on how public expressions of religion affect everyday trust judgments.",

          "abstract": "Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps’ law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones and a specialization parameter that describes how a function’s attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system’s goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.",

An extensive literature in welfare economics addresses the matter. Nevertheless, economists have often simplified policy analysis by assuming that individuals have homogeneous, consequentialist, and self-centered preferences. Individuals may hold heterogeneous private and distributional preferences. To enhance policy analysis, economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways. Specifying social welfare functions that formally express different interpretations of equity will not eliminate disagreements, but it should clarify concepts and reduce the inconsistencies that afflict verbal communication.",

          "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a key question for researchers and authorities was to understand the psychological motivations that sustained public engagement in protective behavior such as physical distancing and hygienic protection. While feelings of threat were rampant during the pandemic, theories of health psychology have highlighted appraisals related to the ability to cope (e.g., the feeling of being able to adhere cost-effectively to government advice) and argued that coping appraisals are superior predictors of motivations to protect the self against risks. In this study, we conducted a massive population-based comparison of the association between, on the one hand, threat appraisals and coping appraisals and, on the other hand, protection against actual infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a unique Danish data infrastructure that links surveys of ~8% of the adult population (N = 386,633) with the individual results of the 123 million COVID-19 tests performed during 22 mo of the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for a comprehensive range of sociodemographic measures and employing panel data to bolster internal validity, we observe that stronger coping appraisals are consistently associated with lower individual probability of COVID-19 infection risk. We find no consistent evidence of a similar association for threat appraisals. Threat appraisals rather seem to index individual feelings of infection exposure. As appeals to fear also have unintended negative consequences (including anxiety, fatigue, and stigmatization), the findings offer strong support for relying on coping-oriented public health policy and communication in future societal crises in the domain of health and beyond.",

          "authors": "Laura Lungu",
          "abstract": "How are subjective perceptions of economic status related to public support for social welfare? I argue that the negative psychological costs associated with perceived relative deprivation lead individuals to prioritize immediate over long-term income gains. Consequently, those who perceive themselves as having low status are less likely to sacrifice a part of their current income to fund welfare policies with long-delayed benefits. I test this argument using two waves of the Life in Transition Survey and two more recent waves of the British Election Survey. In line with my argument, I find that, although a lower sense of subjective economic status correlates with preferences for reducing inequality, the lower individuals place themselves in the economic hierarchy, the less likely they are to support a tax increase to finance spending on education, poverty assistance, and healthcare. While subjective perceptions of low economic status increase demand for equality, they may also limit the government’s ability to redistribute economic resources if citizens are unwilling to share the burden of social welfare. The findings suggest a subjective limit to the scope conditions of welfare state reform and the politics of fiscal solidarity and redistribution.",

          "abstract": "This study uses a budget game experiment to study the effects of active engagement with performance information on citizens' trust in public services and voice behavior regarding those services. Participants reviewed performance information on two fictional schools, one low‐performing and one high‐performing, after which some participants played the budget game. Participants who participated in the game expressed lower trust in and higher subjective voice regarding both the low‐performing and high‐performing school than participants given only a short description of the schools, with a particularly strong effect on the higher‐performing school. Playing the game also decreased the negative effects of performance information on the lower‐performing school. The results suggest that actively engaged citizens are more likely to view service performance in a negative manner, but also that active engagement reduces the perceived differences between high‐performing and low‐performing services.",

          "abstract": "Priority‐based budgeting (PBB) identifies community priorities and systematically reallocates budgetary resources from programs that are less aligned with those priorities to those that are more aligned. Proponents claim that PBB provides fresh opportunities to inject equity considerations into goal‐setting, prioritizing, and allocating activities via public engagement and direct minority representation among elected and appointed officials. This study examines these claims by exploring the budgetary reallocation of 32 early‐adopting PBB municipalities through multiple regression analysis, finding that differing levels of minority population do not dramatically affect the average departmental budgetary reallocation during PBB implementation. However, those with one or more racial minority council members experience a substantially lower level of reallocation than those that do not; the same holds true for organizations with 10% or more minority senior managers. The findings invite public budgeting scholars to revisit theories regarding community diversity, minority representation, budgetary conflict, urban power dynamics, majority–minority politics, and budgetary allocation.",

          "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence in public decision‐making is reshaping state legitimacy by shifting administrative discretion from human bureaucracies to algorithmic systems. While research has explored AI accountability and legitimacy deficits, how they are related across different decision contexts remains unclear. Drawing on bureaucratic legitimacy, procedural fairness, and forum drifting theories, this study examines how AI accountability and effectiveness shape legitimacy perceptions, depending on decision outcomes. Using three survey experiments with 1135 participants in China, we find that accountability is most crucial when AI decisions introduce losses to citizens, whereas effectiveness plays a greater role when outcomes are positive to them. Additionally, the interaction effects between AI accountability and effectiveness are also contingent on decision outcomes. These findings advance AI governance research by highlighting the conditions under which algorithmic legitimacy is strengthened or weakened, emphasizing the need for tailored accountability and effectiveness strategies based on decision outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Understanding municipalities' local governance conditions is crucial for addressing environmental sustainability worldwide, especially regarding their ability to deliver increasingly complex services with environmental implications. Administrative capacity issues significantly hinder municipal performance. While previous studies have established that general capacity impacts public organizations' performance, the role of service‐specific administrative capacity remains underexplored. Local conditions demonstrate the importance of assessing specific capacity, as some municipalities effectively deliver services of varying complexity due to specialized resources, including political support, while others fail due to uniform allocation and poor task understanding. This research uses nested qualitative fieldwork methods to examine municipal waste management, comparing simple waste collection with complex waste disposal, to explore the mechanisms through which service‐specific administrative capacity influences performance. The study argues that specialized capacity, at three different hierarchical levels, is essential for complex service performance, whereas general capacity suffices only for simpler services.",

Thus, we highlight hybrid strategies that integrate both approaches, allowing public organizations to balance operational stability with innovation in their overall digital evolution. Our findings offer practical insights for practitioners seeking to align system structures, methodologies, and procurement strategies with the realities of digital change. For scholars, this article lays the groundwork for future research on how modernization and transformation can co‐evolve in public administration, thus challenging existing dichotomies and opening new avenues for investigation.",

While compensation gaps are often cited, growing evidence suggests that institutional rigidities and non‐pecuniary disincentives—ranging from opaque hiring procedures to limited flexibility—constrain the public sector's ability to attract and retain expertise. This paper provides a comprehensive review of federal hiring pathways and opportunities to expedite the attraction of talent under existing authorities. Using the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in February 2025 as a case study, I contextualize how it was used to facilitate personnel reforms via alternative hiring mechanisms. The paper concludes with a set of practical policy recommendations for personnel reform for both the short and long run.",

          "abstract": "Despite its importance in theory and practice, little is known about whether, how, when, and for whom a collaborative governance strategy achieves socially equitable outcomes. Using a staggered difference‐in‐differences design and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we analyze how well Oregon counties that adopted collaborative governance bridge racial disparities in healthcare access compared to non‐adopting counties. We find that collaborative governance is associated with reducing racial and ethnic disparities in financial barriers to visiting a doctor after 3 years of implementation and that such effects grow stronger over time. In addition, the estimated effect of collaborative governance on having a personal doctor is greatest for Hispanics. This article points to potential benefits of a collaborative governance strategy that designs and scales collaboration through a collaborative platform and collaborative governance regimes, sustains long‐term efforts to meet health equity goals, and identifies and serves the most vulnerable populations.",

Using fuzzy‐set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) of 34 CEG projects in Indonesia, we identify three distinct pathways to effectiveness: co‐faith‐based, multifaith‐collaborative, and secular‐market, each reflecting a unique configuration of authority, market, and social and community logics. Importantly, our findings challenge essentialist views of religion by reconceptualizing it as a context‐dependent institutional logic that can enable or constrain collaboration depending on its institutional embeddedness. Religion represents a dynamic informal force, especially salient where formal institutions are underdeveloped or contested. These insights extend theories of institutional design and collaborative governance, particularly in culturally diverse and institutionally uneven settings. Our study offers practical implications for designing context‐sensitive CEG systems, emphasizing the importance of inclusive leadership and institutional alignment.",

Drawing on upper echelons theory, imprinting theory, and scholarship on managerial decision‐making and the transferability of private‐sector management approaches to the public sector, this study examines the relationship between US governors' top business experience and budgetary outcomes. Competing hypotheses are proposed and tested to assess whether governors with significant business experience enhance or hinder budgetary outcomes. Using a panel dataset of 48 states spanning 1960–2010 and a regression discontinuity design, the analysis finds that electing governors with high‐level business experience leads to improved budget equilibrium during their terms. These findings suggest that governors with business backgrounds are likely to be better able to align revenues with expenditures, thus reducing deviations from the budget. The results are robust across alternative model specifications and offer critical theoretical and practical insights into leadership dynamics and fiscal governance.",

          "abstract": "Americans’ trust in scientists has been stable and high, relative to other political and social institutions, for the last half century (Krause, Brossard, and Scheufele 2019). Yet, underlying this stability lies a dramatic change such that a partisan gap has emerged, with Democrats exhibiting substantially more trust than Republicans. Fifty years ago, Republicans in fact exhibited more relative trust in scientists. This article explains this continuity and change. First, we demonstrate that the demographic correlates of trust in scientists have been remarkably stable for more than a half century: women, Black, rural, religious, non-college educated, and lower/working-class individuals exhibit less trust than their counterparts. Second, we show that the partisan relationship with trust in scientists has flipped (over that same time period) as low-trusting demographic strata shifted partisan allegiances. This is particularly the case when it comes to education and religiosity. Concomitant with the emergent partisan gap is a massive perceptual gap among Democrats, who perceive a partisan divide more than double its actual size. Democrats vastly underestimate Republicans’ trust in scientists. The enduring demographic basis of trust in scientists provides an opportunity to bridge partisan divides by addressing demographic inequities in the practice and application of science.",

          "authors": "Giorgio Chiovelli, Stelios Michalopoulos, Elias Papaioannou, Sandra Sequeira",
          "abstract": "We study the impact of conflict-induced displacement on human capital and occupational shifts, focusing on the Mozambican civil war (1977 - 1992), during which millions of civilians were forced to flee to the countryside, cities, and neighboring countries. Reconstructing the wartime mobility histories of the surviving population, we examine the consequences of multiple displacement trajectories within a unified framework. First, we characterize the education and sectoral employment of the universe of (non-)displaced. Second, we exploit differences in relocation trajectories among extended kin members during their schooling years. Displacement is associated with significant gains in education. Third, employing a “movers design,” we show that minors displaced earlier to better districts experienced an increase in educational attainment. Focusing on moves during the intensification of the war and when comparing members of the same household, regional childhood exposure effects remain strong, whereas spatial sorting becomes negligible. Fourth, we jointly estimate place-based, spatial sorting, and uprootedness effects, showing that all forces are at play. Fifth, a small survey in Mozambique’s largest northern city reveals long-term effects: internally displaced report higher education than their siblings who stayed behind, but lower social capital and worse mental health relative to locals. Our findings demonstrate that displacement shocks can foster human capital accumulation, even in very low-income settings, albeit at the cost of enduring social and psychological traumas.",

          "abstract": "We develop a system of disaggregated economic accounts. The system breaks down national accounting positions into bilateral flows between consistently defined groups of consumers (“consumer cells”), groups of producers (“producer cells”), the government, and the rest of the world. We disaggregate the full circular flow of money, including consumer spending, labor compensation, firm profits, trade in intermediates, foreign trade, and government transactions, while satisfying all national accounting identities. We implement the disaggregated system for small region-by-industry cells in Denmark and present stylized facts, including variation in domestic spending shares, local and urban bias in consumer spending, and a pattern of “triangular flows” across regions. Cell-level measures of “spending intensity” capture how much spending by a cell contributes to the income of cells experiencing unemployment after a shock. Using a general equilibrium model, we show that fiscal transfers are more effective in stimulating aggregate GDP when they target cells with high spending intensity on unemployed cells. Knowledge of the disaggregated economic accounts helps governments select more effective policies.",

          "abstract": "Legitimated authorities enjoy approval, support, and compliance from subordinates. Thus, legitimacy enhances authorities’ effectiveness across broad arenas, such as the judiciary, law enforcement, and the workplace. Understanding what shapes subordinates’ personal view of an authority as legitimate (propriety) elucidates how authorities can gain propriety. We investigate the relative impact of instrumental, relational, and moral bases of legitimacy on subordinates’ assessments of their workplace authorities’ propriety. We additionally consider social influences (i.e., “what others think”) captured by perceived collective support for the authority from superiors (authorization) and peers (endorsement). Results from a survey of 2,062 US workers indicate that all individual bases, as well as support by superiors and peers, positively contribute to propriety. Among the individual bases, instrumental concerns are most impactful, and the effect of endorsement far exceeds that of authorization. In an exploratory analysis, we show that perceptions of collective support moderate the effects of some of the individual bases of propriety. Our study reveals that it is not only how an authority behaves toward subordinates but also “what others think” that influences propriety.",

          "abstract": "Extant work has identified two discursive forms of racism: overt and covert. While both forms have received attention in scholarly work, research on covert racism has been limited. Its subtle and context-specific nature has made it difficult to systematically identify covert racism in text, especially in large corpora. In this article, we first propose a theoretically driven and generalizable process to identify and classify covert and overt racism in text. This process allows researchers to construct coding schemes and build labeled datasets. We use the resulting dataset to train XLM-RoBERTa, a cross-lingual large language model (LLM) for supervised classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets relating to the Ecuadorian indígena community between 2018 and 2021.",

          "abstract": "Analyzing social change requires detecting patterns of continuity and difference over time. While time-series clustering offers a valuable approach, existing techniques are often limited by assuming fixed cluster definitions and static assignments of entities to clusters. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified framework of temporal clustering methods that allows for both dynamic cluster definitions and the transition of entities between clusters, generalizing and extending previous work. We also provide new algorithms for this dynamic clustering that optimize global objectives, with optional constraints on the transitions of entities across clusters. This framework expands the methodological toolkit for analyzing social change, and we provide guidelines for its application. We illustrate our approach with three case studies: polarization of social and political attitudes across U.S. states; cross-national cultural change; and the evolution of neighborhood business patterns. We conclude with directions for further research.",

          "abstract": "We employ an innovative Bayesian multistate life table approach to examine how race, ethnicity, and sex shape marital status and living arrangements in later life. Using the Health and Retirement Study (1992–2018), we estimate expected years spent in various marital and living arrangements after age 50. Our findings reveal stark disparities: White adults largely follow traditional patterns, spending most of their later years married and living with a spouse. In contrast, Black adults experience the shortest durations of marriage and spousal coresidence, spending much of later life alone or with nonspouse family members. Hispanic adults occupy an intermediate position, maintaining substantial years in marriage while also spending extended time in multigenerational households. These patterns are further stratified by sex, with minority females experiencing significantly fewer years married and living with a spouse than males, amplifying their reliance on alternative family support structures. These findings highlight how the intersection of race, ethnicity, and sex shapes later life social and economic security, emphasizing the need for policies that account for diverse family structures in aging populations.",

          "abstract": "The number of deaths from antibiotic resistance is steadily rising and has become a global public health issue. Children in low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected, as last-line antibiotics are usually unavailable to them. Pollution of riverways caused by pharmaceutical products is one driver of antibiotic resistance. In this research note, we assess whether this channel contributes significantly to infant mortality in India. We show that living downstream of a producer increases the risk of infant mortality by 16% and that antibiotic production explains 17,000 infant deaths in India per year. These findings suggest that better monitoring, stronger regulations, improved production processes, and strategic considerations on the location of antibiotic producers are needed to ensure that production does not induce negative externalities on the local population.",

          "authors": "Matthias Rosenbaum-Feldbrügge, Björn Quanjer, Kristina Thompson",
          "abstract": "Studies have shown strong relationships between the presence of kin and children's survival outcomes in historical and contemporary low-income contexts. However, this relationship has never been studied among an enslaved population, who encountered extremely harsh living conditions. Examining this relationship among different populations may reveal similarities and differences across contexts. The present study addresses this gap by examining the life courses of children born between 1830 and 1863 and enslaved in Suriname (n = 19,095 children) and their mothers. For the period 1848‒1863, we can also observe matrilineal kin, including grandmothers, aunts, and uncles (n = 12,020 children). The relationships of matrilineal kin's presence and children's hazard of death from ages 6 months to 12 years were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models. Experiencing maternal death was related to an increased hazard of death for children throughout childhood, but particularly during infancy (ages 6 months to 1 year; hazard ratio: 6.24, 95% confidence interval: 3.34‒11.66), and it decreased as children aged. The presence of grandmothers was related to a decreased hazard of death among children aged 1‒5, and the presence of aunts and uncles was beneficial to survival for children aged 5‒12. Mothers were especially important to children's survival, particularly during infancy, likely due to the importance of maternal care and breastfeeding on survival. During childhood, however, it appears that the presence of extended kin was also important, implying that children's care could have been provided by other family members once children were weaned. These findings closely align with those of other studies and reflect the importance of extended kin networks on childhood survival across time and space.",

Our analysis broadly indicates that racial and ethnic inequality is greater than suggested by other welfare metrics such as consumption or life expectancy alone. Decomposition exercises show that a majority of the estimated welfare gaps are determined by age 60 initial conditions as opposed to racial and ethnic differences in dynamic processes after age 60. Additional counterfactuals suggest that eliminating common heath risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes in late life only marginally closes overall welfare gaps. These simulations suggest that policies aimed at closing racial and ethnic gaps in late life may be more successful and efficient if targeted earlier in the life cycle.",

          "abstract": "This research note discusses one underexplored aspect of the study of polygyny, namely, the extent to which the practice remains viable from a purely demographic standpoint. Using data from the United Nations World Population Prospects 2022 covering 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), I evaluate a simple indicator—gamma—for capturing the “demographic potential” of polygyny, that is, the fraction of men who can have two wives with no other man pushed out of the marriage market. I estimate how this indicator has evolved between 1950 and 2021 across regions of SSA and show how the measure correlates with polygyny estimates from available men's and women's Demographic and Health Surveys. Gamma shows inverted U-curve patterns aligned with stages of the demographic transition, from modestly low levels to high levels during periods of rapid population growth and then declining again. Recent declines are starkest in South SSA, while potential remains moderate elsewhere. Gamma correlates positively with polygyny estimates from Demographic and Health Surveys—particularly in Central and South SSA—and can explain up to 50‒70% variation in polygyny, albeit not everywhere. Findings primarily hold within regions, suggesting this is one of manifold factors at play. I conclude by outlining fruitful directions for the study of polygyny.",

Drawing from the growing body of research on the predictability of life course events, we model and predict individual-level lifespan using 12 statistical and machine learning models and more than 150 predictors derived from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study longitudinal data. Statistical and machine learning models report comparable accuracy and relatively high discriminative performance, but they fail to account for most lifespan heterogeneity at the individual level. We observe consistent inequalities in mortality predictability and risk discrimination, with lower accuracy for men, non-Hispanic Blacks, and low-educated individuals. Additionally, people in these groups show lower accuracy in their subjective predictions of their own lifespan. Finally, top features across groups are similar, with variables related to habits, health history, and finances being relevant predictors. We conclude by highlighting the limits of predicting mortality from one of the richest longitudinal representative surveys in the United States, as well as the context-dependent inequalities across sociodemographic groups, and providing baselines and guidance for future research and public policies.",

          "abstract": "Studies estimating the cumulative risk of imprisonment have been central to documenting the rise of incarceration and its consequences for inequality in the United States. Data limitations have stymied efforts to document the risk of criminal legal contact falling short of imprisonment, however, and few studies estimate risks among groups other than Black and White men. Although less severe than imprisonment, subfelony contact also carries damaging and lifelong consequences. Using more than 25 years of administrative criminal record data from Texas, this study estimates the prevalence of both subfelony and felony arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration across five cohorts of Black, White, and Hispanic men and women born between 1971 and 1995. Findings show that subfelony contact is 3‒18 times as prevalent, and far more widely distributed across the population, as felony conviction and incarceration: fewer than 3% of Black women go to prison by age 24, but at least 22% are arrested at least once. Although risks of felony events have fallen substantially for some groups, subfelony criminalization has persisted at high and increasingly unequal rates. These findings have implications for our understanding of the reach of the criminal legal system and its role in shaping inequality in the twenty-first century.",

These LLM agents are typically assigned humanlike characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM’s behavior remains underexplored. In this study the author proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM’s internal representations in a dictator game, a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. The author extracts “vectors of variable variations” (e.g., “male” to “female”) from the LLM’s internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model’s inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model’s decision making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing artificial intelligence agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.",

Yet, in many low‐income countries, citizens do not make formal payments to the state or forego engaging with the state altogether due to vulnerability to opportunistic demands by state agents. We study two randomized interventions in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, designed to empower citizens in their negotiations with opportunistic state agents: one provided information about statutory payment obligations, the other offered protection from abusive officials. We examine the effects not only on citizen payment amounts (intensive margin effects) but also on whether citizens start making formal payments, or any payments, to the state (extensive margin effects). We find that protection, and to a lesser extent information, had clear extensive margin effects, increasing the share of citizens making formal payments and engaging with the state. These findings show how empowering citizens can help countries transition away from a low‐revenue, low engagement equilibrium.",

War and other forms of interstate competition for power may increase the salience of national identity, but the effect may be weak if the nation is divided. Empirical evidence of a trade‐off between national (superordinate) and subnational (subordinate) identification during times of crisis is sparse. We present an experimental framework to measure effects of external threat on national identification in the United States, exploring whether effects are driven by attachment to the nation (ingroup love), hostility toward other nations (outgroup hate), or both simultaneously. We find that even in a context of partisan polarization, external threat strengthens national identification, expressed mainly as increased hostility toward the national outgroup. National identification need not come at the expense of salient partisan identities as long as these are not perceived to be in competition with the national identity.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how face-to-face (FtF) and computer-mediated communication (CMC) contribute to relationship maintenance and resilience in dual-earning families, a largely overlooked area in family communication research. Guided by the theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL), we test how ongoing FtF and CMC maintenance behaviors predicted well-being across a week among 62 families (i.e., two parents and one adolescent). Using a week-long daily diary and physiological measures (cortisol and IL-6 assays), we assess perceived stress, mental health, and loneliness. Findings suggest that both FtF and CMC maintenance are associated with lower stress and better well-being, with FtF showing somewhat stronger associations on certain outcomes such as loneliness. Additionally, perceived gaps between desired and received maintenance predicted higher and more erratic stress and diminished mental health, underscoring the importance of meeting relational needs. These results highlight how families balance FtF and digital maintenance in everyday life and extend the TRRL by incorporating mixed-media contexts and perceived maintenance gaps.",

          "abstract": "Electoral winners are more satisfied with democracy than losers, but there is debate over whether this is due to emotions or policy considerations. In two quasi‐experiments, we exploit the outcomes of major football games, which exogenously separated people into winning and losing groups. As the games' outcomes have no bearing on governmental policy, any detected effects of victory and loss on satisfaction could be attributable to irrelevant emotions. We validate the initial studies with an experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to view emotion‐inducing excerpts from The Lion King . While the manipulations in each study altered participants' emotional states, they had no effect on democratic satisfaction. Because specific election‐induced emotions may be distinct from those experienced by the participants in our studies, we cannot rule out an affective mechanism completely. We conclude that emotions do not indiscriminately drive the winner–loser gap in democratic satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "Why some individuals vote while others abstain remains a central question in political behavior research, yet little is known about whether civic motivations formed during adolescence endure into adulthood. Drawing on expectancy–value theory, this study examines whether civic motivations in early adolescence (ages 13–16) including political efficacy, perceived political knowledge, political interest, and civic norms are associated with electoral participation in early adulthood (ages 26–29). Using a longitudinal dataset from Sweden, we show that civic norms are the strongest predictor of adult voting, even after accounting for prior participation, socioeconomic background, and immigrant origin. In contrast, expectancy‐based beliefs do not independently predict turnout, suggesting that value‐based motivations may have greater long‐term relevance for electoral participation. Sex‐specific analyses reveal clear differences. Among women, adult electoral participation is associated with a broader constellation of civic motivations, whereas men's participation is primarily predicted by prior voting and structural background factors. Immigrant origin strongly reduces participation for both male and female respondents, but the effect is more pronounced among women, consistent with intersectional disadvantage. Overall, the findings demonstrate that civic motivations held in adolescence have lasting implications for adult electoral participation and underscore the importance of gender‐sensitive, intersectional approaches to understanding political development.",

          "abstract": "Collective action is essential for tackling social, institutional, and environmental challenges, often fueled by shared identities, common norms, and a belief in the possibility of change. However, the impact of participating in collective action on individual identities, and how this knowledge can shape future efforts to maintain engagement and promote positive change, remains underexplored. This study uses a liminal and identity work approach to examine how precarious Spanish activists, involved in long‐term struggles against precarity, develop and negotiate their identities as activists through protest participation. Based on a qualitative study spanning over 9 years, this research focuses on the experiences of activists from two collectives in Seville, Spain, that emerged in response to the Great Recession. Our findings introduce the concept of necessity activism to describe political engagement driven by survival needs rather than ideological commitment. We show how activists facing precarity undergo a three‐phase identity transformation: forced separation, intensive identity work, and varied outcomes including burnout, withdrawal, or adaptive re‐engagement. This process highlights the emotional and material costs of activism and the ongoing reconstruction of activist identities under the liminal conditions created by precarity.",

This research investigates the psychological underpinnings of public support for claiming World War II reparations, focusing on the roles of national narcissism and ingroup victim beliefs. Across four pre‐registered studies conducted in Poland and Greece (total N = 2780), we show that national narcissism—a defensive belief in national greatness coupled with a desire for external recognition—predicts support for war reparation claims. This relationship is mediated by perceptions of ingroup victim beliefs, particularly exclusive victimhood, which emphasizes the ingroup's unique suffering. Our findings illuminate how identity‐based motivations, especially those rooted in narcissistic group beliefs and selective historical narratives, can shape support for populist foreign policy initiatives long after the original conflict has ended.",

          "abstract": "The study aimed at reducing the propensity for violence among supporters of left‐wing parties toward the right‐wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) as well as supporters of the AfD toward the German left‐wing Green Party (Die Grünen) using metacognitive training (MCT). A total of 1025 German participants were recruited online. Participants' political orientation and attitude toward the Green Party and the AfD were assessed using questionnaires. The MCT intervention asked participants seemingly simple questions that evoked common stereotypes and then presented the correct counter‐stereotypical answers alongside explanations. The study used a pre–post design to measure changes in political polarization. Hostile attitudes toward the opposing political camp were reduced at a small to medium effect size. Most participants felt they had learned something new from the intervention. Metacognitive variables pertaining to overconfidence predicted change. The findings suggest that MCT can reduce hostile attitudes toward an opposing political group. The study highlights the potential of MCT for reducing societal conflict by challenging stereotypes through surprising information. Studies with control groups and long‐term follow‐up are desirable. More research into the mechanisms of change is needed.",

          "abstract": "Attributing racial disparities to factors related to individuals (individual causes) or to societal factors (structural causes) is linked to attitudes toward racial equity policies. Membership in a dominant or subordinated racial group might shape these associations. Using the case of Black and White Americans' attributions for Black–White economic inequality, we investigated the association between distinct kinds of individual (i.e., innate factors, lack of motivation) and structural (i.e., discrimination, lack of educational opportunity) attributions and attitudes toward racialized policies. We used cross‐sectional samples of non‐Hispanic Black and White Americans from the 2016 ( N = 2361) and 2018 ( N = 1875) General Social Survey to examine these associations. Results show that Black Americans were more likely to make attributions to discrimination and individual factors than White Americans. Generally, structural attributions were associated with stronger support for policies aimed at addressing racial inequality, whereas individual attributions showed opposite associations. Effects varied by the kind of attribution and policy. Race moderated the effects of attribution on attitudes toward government spending and racist expression policies, but not affirmative action. These studies contribute to understanding how group position and attributions of racial inequality relate to policy preferences, which have implications for developing initiatives to improve policy support.",

We argue that characters not only serve descriptive functions but are also strategically employed to shape the relationship between policy problems and policy solutions. Through this lens, we identify a gap in the current character typology. While NPF scholarship has established victims, villains, heroes, and beneficiaries as key characters in narratives, we introduce the loser . The loser character is not directly involved in the policy problem but is adversely affected by the policy solution. Our research is guided by three aims: to theorize the purpose of characters, clarify their narrative functions in relation to policy problems and solutions, and formally introduce the loser as a new character archetype.",

          "abstract": "Why do some people feel stronger emotions about politics than others? Past work suggests that political sophistication, consisting of knowledge and interest, is related to feeling strong emotions about politics, as learning about politics strengthens both cognitive and affective ties with political objects. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotions, we argue why political interest and confidence-in-knowledge, rather than factual political knowledge, are primary drivers of emotional engagement. Using three waves of the ANES and two pre-registered studies (conducted in the Netherlands and the U.S.) we show that political interest and confidence-in-knowledge increase emotional responses to politics. Knowledge, however, is unrelated to or even suppresses feelings about politics. We experimentally test the causal effect of confidence-in-knowledge and find a direct effect on feeling anger. Our findings have implications for civic education and political engagement, as fostering political interest and confidence—rather than merely increasing factual knowledge—may better promote active citizenship, albeit with potential risks if confidence is not rooted in accurate knowledge. We also demonstrate the necessity to theoretically and empirically disentangle the different components of political sophistication.",

This study bridges these two literatures. Exploiting variation in age at arrival between siblings, we causally show that immigrants who arrive at younger ages are more likely to live in less segregated neighborhoods as adults, with the effect being particularly pronounced among refugees. A descriptive decomposition suggests that economic factors account for a larger share of the relationship among non-refugees, whereas for refugees, intermarriage and economic factors contribute roughly equally to explaining the variation in the effect of age at immigration.",

Using an instrumental-variable approach to analyzing data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2019–2023), we examine the impact of partners’ online banking use on who manages the couple’s money and controls major financial decisions. We reveal an ‘empowering effect’ whereby one’s use of online banking bolsters their control of both money management and major financial decisions, and this effect is particularly pronounced when one’s partner does not use online banking. Online banking similarly bolsters the power of women and men in money management, but subtle gender differences are observed in financial decision-making. Whereas online banking increases men’s exclusive control of major financial decisions, it bolsters women’s exclusive or joint control of such decisions. We also find an ‘individualizing effect’ whereby both women’s and men’s use of online banking increases the likelihood of partners’ independent money management, and independent money management is least likely when only one partner uses online banking. Our study provides novel insights into how digitalization, seen through online banking, redistributes power in and reconfigures the nature of couple relationships.",

          "abstract": "Today, autocratization is the predominant trend of regime development. However, if we focus on autocratization as democratic erosion or decline, such a trend is not matched by an equivalent increase in the number of democratic breakdowns or autocracies. Why (and how) do some democracies survive autocratization, while others do not? Current research on autocratization has recently turned toward studies on democratic endurance. In particular, mostly large-N contributions focusing on structural factors protecting democracy from autocratization onset (democratic resilience) have lately been complemented by numerous small-N contributions exploring concrete actions that can stop ongoing autocratization processes before democratic breakdown (democratic resistance). However, due to its necessarily limited scope, such qualitative evidence on democratic resistance may be subject to internal and external validity issues. Therefore, we systematically advance the research on resistance to autocratization within a comparative framework. Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we examine 69 autocratization episodes that began in democracies in the 21st century (2000–23). Our analysis reveals the combinations of institutional, political, social, and external conditions of democratic resistance that impede democratic collapse during autocratization episodes. While the success of individual actions is mainly context-specific, we demonstrate that it is the cooperation across various areas of resistance ( unity makes strength ) that characterizes the multiple, and cross-nationally robust, sufficient configurations of democratic survival during autocratization processes. Through alternative analytical choices, robustness tests, and integration of sources, we bolster the validity of prior studies on democratic resistance to autocratization and point to further research avenues.",

          "abstract": "Are parties responsive to public opinion and, if so, to whom exactly? These key questions continue to be major topics of debate among party and representation scholars. This research note extends recent contributions to the literature in three distinct ways. Unlike most extant studies, I do not limit my analysis to Western European countries and the left-right dimension but examine party responsiveness across the entire EU with a focus on six key issues. Conceptually, I draw on two responsiveness frameworks that are concerned with distinct ways through which parties can change their position to align with the general electorate or their partisan supporters. The standard framework tests whether parties shift in the same direction as the public, whereas the congruent responsiveness framework focuses on whether parties reduce past incongruencies with the public. Using updated expert and voter survey time-series data for the period between 1999 and 2024, I show that parties are primarily responsive to their supporters. The uncovered patterns of responsiveness are consistent across responsiveness frameworks, issues, European regions, and time. Both mainstream and niche parties primarily respond to their supporters. The findings carry important implications for our understanding of representation in contemporary European politics.",

For a political entity like the EU, social media are a promising route to overcome the remoteness to its citizens, identified as one of the crucial challenges to its public legitimacy. Against this broader background, our study analyses the influence of 10 years of EU visual social media communication on user engagement as an indicator of successfully creating visibility in a crucial communication space. For this purpose, we conducted an image-type analysis, combining quantitative and qualitative features of visual analysis: First, a subsample of posts was inductively analysed to identify recurring image types and subsequently used to implement a manual quantitative visual content analysis. Building on the results, we drew on a machine learning approach, allowing us to analyse over 40,000 posts, including more than 20,000 pictures. Our results emphasise the crucial influence of social media affordances in explaining user engagement with EU visual social media communication. Implications are discussed with reference to the ongoing discussion about the EU’s democratic deficit.",

          "authors": "Nick Lin, Lie Philip Santoso, Randolph T. Stevenson",
          "abstract": "Are citizens in western democracies developing affective attachments to the Left and Right as social-political groups? If so, one can hardly imagine a more consequential development for understanding the electoral behavior of Western publics. However, previous evidence suggesting such attachments are important (and growing) comes from a small number of single-case studies. In this paper, we expand the evidentiary basis for this idea by implementing a method that leverages existing survey data to test whether citizens in western democracies, over a long time period, have developed such group-based attachments. Specifically, we use surveys in which respondents place parties on the left-right scale to test for the existence of an out-group homogeneity effect between potential Left and Right identifiers. We argue that this pattern provides compelling indirect evidence of such group attachments and shows that the effect is both widespread across western democracies and increasing over time. As a proof of concept, we fielded original surveys in Denmark, Italy, and Sweden and found that our direct Left/Right attachment measures are strongly associated with the indirect evidence documented in our cross-national analyses. Thus, this paper provides an empirically justified call for scholars to invest in the development of appropriate survey batteries that directly measure affective attachments to the Left and Right in a large set of countries.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of intertextuality to the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF). Outlining three broad approaches in the NPF study of evidence, the article highlights that the existing literature has overlooked how some phenomena invoked as evidence are themselves narratives. By introducing intertextuality, the article contributes to the NPF by providing an approach to study the use of pre-existing narratives in the creation of new narratives. Empirically, the study examines Swedish municipal policy documents on men’s violence against women with a new code for intertextual references added to the traditional NPF codebook. The study finds that (1) the narratives use different forms of intertextual references to previous narrative texts, (2) these intertextual references contain narrative elements from the referenced text, and (3) the references can be used to situate the new narrative, or to develop, echo or counter past narratives. The theory and methods developed in this analysis will help to guide future NPF studies in using intertextuality to identify the flow of narratives through policy discourse.",

Recent research has highlighted concerns both with how asylum seekers are heard and how their accounts are assessed. Recently, we developed a novel training program in investigative interviewing and legal psychology for asylum officials in Finland. During the training, the officials reported several organizational constraints and everyday challenges that they face in their daily work of interviewing asylum seekers. These concerns can have a considerable negative effect on interview quality and the work-related stress experienced by officials, with potential negative effects on their work. This aspect has largely been unexplored in research until now. In this field reflection, we aim to describe the key challenges that we observed, and which were formulated by the practitioners, discuss them in relation to empirical research, and propose recommendations for future research and practice.",

Yet, scholars have not unpacked how community contexts shape how welfare agencies operate on the ground. This is especially the case for the rural South, an oft‐overlooked context where local influence has historically undermined the equitable provision of social welfare programs. We know surprisingly little about how “small‐town” norms, values, hierarchies, and politics make their way into the day‐to‐day life of welfare offices. Drawing from 43 in‐depth interviews with front‐line bureaucrats, I demonstrate how the political and social order of one southern rural community undermines policy implementation. Interviews show that this rural southern welfare office was (1) deeply affected by economic decline; (2) was situated in a community where strong rather than weak social ties determine economic opportunities, and (3) vulnerable to the influence of white power elites in county‐level government. These three factors can undermine effective policy implementation, harming vulnerable families.",

Outcome dependence can occur simultaneously due to both spatial diffusion in the lower-level units and spatial diffusion in the unobserved group effects. For example, counties are nested within states and diffusion processes might take place at both levels of analysis. Building on recent research from the spatial econometrics and multilevel modeling literature, we propose a class of spatial hierarchical models with binary outcomes. One method accounts for spatially independent, unobserved group effects and the other method accounts for spatially dependent unobserved group effects. We propose a Bayesian approach to estimate such effects while also accounting for lower-level diffusion in the outcome, and provide software to estimate these models. Our Monte Carlo results demonstrate that failing to correctly account for diffusion and/or the nested structure of data can lead to bias in both parameter estimates and substantive effects. We apply these models to analyze the causes of civil rights protests in the United States in the 1960s.",

          "abstract": "Election integrity is paramount to democratic health. The Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) is a multistate collaboration that facilitates essential election administration functions, whereby members share administrative data to ensure clean voter registration lists and to encourage individuals who are eligible but unregistered (EBUs) to register to vote. Despite ERIC’s primary focus on maintaining the accuracy of voter rolls, in 2022, some conservatives accused it of being a tool for partisan electioneering, prompting nine Republican-led states to leave ERIC. To assess the validity of a central criticism made against ERIC, we leverage field experiments conducted by member states during the 2016 elections in Pennsylvania and Nevada (i.e., two important swing states). We find no empirical evidence to support the claim that outreach to EBUs yielded a partisan advantage: ERIC’s registration efforts had little differential effect on party registration or turnout. This article discusses the importance of efforts to maintain accurate voter rolls and to encourage greater participation for promoting confidence in our democratic system.",

          "authors": "Karen Sebold, Eric Heberlig, Robert Boatright",
          "abstract": "The US major-party presidential nominating conventions are an essential platform for a political party’s branding and messaging for upcoming presidential and congressional elections. The conventions also can provide revenue and media attention to their host cities and, consequently, convention fundraising has grown substantially in recent decades. Convention fundraising rules were changed in 2014, tripling the limit for contributions to a party’s campaign funds and removing limits on contributions to host-city committees. Although we do not expect these changes to affect individual donors, we expect corporations, banks, and labor unions to have taken advantage of these new rules. Elections since 2014, however, have been unusual in many ways—for instance, in the relationship between the nominees and their parties and, in 2020, the public health precautions required to hold conventions. This study examines developments in political-party convention fundraising since 2014, focusing on the relationships among candidates, their parties, and the cities where conventions have been held. To make this determination, funding reports were collected for the 2000–2024 election cycles. The article explores changes in the characteristics of convention donors—their other contributions and their relationships to candidates, party committees, and host cities—and notes variations that might be attributable to the nominees or the host cities. It considers whether the new convention-funding rules have matured sufficiently that it is possible to make broad claims about the effects of the rules themselves.",

Historically, coverage was concentrated among a small set of major newspapers that regularly reported on high-profile decisions. The expansion of digital platforms and the Court’s decision to livestream oral arguments at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic created new opportunities for coverage, but it is unclear whether these changes increased overall media attention on the Court. Using new data to track how often Supreme Court decisions and oral arguments appear in print and broadcast-affiliated outlets, this article shows that the volume of coverage has declined in traditional newspapers but expanded (unevenly) across other outlets. These patterns challenge assumptions about stable and centralized Supreme Court coverage and highlight the need for scholars to account for changing levels of media attention when studying public responses to the Court.",

I analyze country names as independent variables, hypothesizing that they have value as signals of political characteristics. To test my hypotheses, I turn to the Varieties of Democracy dataset. I use fixed-effects panel regressions to examine whether countries’ descriptors correlate with the characteristics they name. I find that except for the democratic descriptor, all other descriptors are surprisingly accurate. This is the first step toward developing an understanding of names in political science as well as adding a new tool for comparative politics.",

We address this gap in the literature through an analysis of Democrats Abroad—the official overseas arm of the US Democratic Party—during the 2024 election cycle. Drawing from an original two-wave panel survey of party members, we demonstrate that some of the forces that prompt campaign activism in the domestic United States hold for partisans overseas. At the same time, factors pertaining to the migration experience and settlement in another country also affect engagement in American campaigns. Most notably, we find that overseas Democrats who become integrated into the party system of their residential country are more likely to participate in American elections from the distance. This finding contributes a fresh perspective to models of political transnationalism and “campaign spillover” in electoral research—that is, the impact that partisan engagement in one context has on subsequent involvement in separate domains.",

          "authors": "Jaeyeong Nam, Pamela Herd, Sebastian Jilke, Donald Moynihan",
          "abstract": "A core claim of the administrative burden literature is that the experience of frictions during administrative encounters can generate psychological costs. Using a split-ballot survey experiment with a question order design (n = 3,812), we show that being asked to recall administrative encounters in a welfare program negatively affects people's psychological affect. Further, we show that the responses to burdens are asymmetric and consistent with a pattern of negativity bias in how people recall citizen-state encounters. Being asked to recall encounters induces negative affect, even though the majority of respondents reported having experienced low levels of administrative burden. Respondents' negative psychological reactions are driven by individuals who rated their experience as burdensome in survey questions or reported a bad experience in open-ended responses. Positive reported experiences were not associated with more positive affect. The results also suggest that the relationship between the experience of burden and negative affect is more pronounced for women, liberals, Whites, and those in poor or fair health. Moreover, those with neutral political ideology and those in very good or excellent health experienced decreased positive affect. A key theoretical implication is that the experience of psychological costs is shaped by negativity bias: negative interactions have a larger effect on outcomes than positive interactions. A practical implication is that governments should focus attention on reducing burdensome or otherwise negative encounters.",

          "abstract": "Public participation processes promise that citizens will be heard, but rarely guarantee they will be heeded. This distinction between procedural acknowledgment and substantive influence lies at the heart of bureaucratic responsiveness, yet these two forms of responsiveness are often conflated in empirical research. I demonstrate that in federal rulemaking, procedural acknowledgment (being heard) is empirically distinct from substantive policy influence (being heeded). Drawing on theories of bureaucratic responsiveness, I argue that agencies strategically cite commenters not primarily to signal agreement but to build defensible administrative records that satisfy procedural requirements while preserving their policy autonomy. Analyzing 854 federal rules from 2017 to 2023, I use semantic text analysis to track changes in binding regulatory provisions distinct from the explanatory preamble. I show that agencies systematically cite comments they ultimately reject, particularly from well-resourced groups. Roughly two-thirds of comment citations are not accompanied by any responsive change to the regulatory text. This reveals that procedural responsiveness can function as a strategic substitute for substantive policy change. These findings suggest that procedural engagement and substantive influence operate as distinct modes of bureaucratic responsiveness, with agencies often prioritizing legal defensibility over policy adaptation when facing potential judicial review.",

          "abstract": "Voters are often at a disadvantage in assessing policies when possessing limited information. Although party identification has long served as an important heuristic to inform preferences, there is support for the notion that party attachment may amplify race and gender stereotypes about elected officials. In this paper, we evaluate how race and gender might also condition attitudes towards elected officials by serving as indicators of a politician’s ideology. Using foreign policy positions as a “low-information” environment in which respondents should be more susceptible to cues, we find that some partisans rate support for policy statements lower when they are attributed to politicians from the opposite party. More importantly, this effect is further conditioned by race and gender cues as a function of a respondent’s ideology.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how regime efforts at educational indoctrination affect mass mobilization in autocracies. The literature tends to emphasize education’s democratizing potential. However, mass schooling in autocracies also facilitates pro-government propaganda, which may undermine the democratic character of mass mobilization in contexts where the regime uses education for indoctrination. This article builds on previous experimental findings to evaluate the correlation between regime indoctrination efforts through schooling and mass mobilization using expert assessments and observational data. Analyzing autocratic spells from 1950 to 2019, we find that educational indoctrination correlates with reduced mass mobilization. Specifically, autocracies investing in indoctrination show weaker pro-democracy movements and are less likely to experience anti-system uprisings. Conversely, educational indoctrination correlates with mobilization for autocracy, indicating it helps solidify authoritarian regimes against democratic pressures and promotes regime-compatible demonstrations.",

          "abstract": "Contests over the presentation of history in public commemorations or “public memory” have become flashpoints in American culture wars, as minority groups and their allies push for inclusive representations while racial conservatives resist these changes as threats to national identity. This study examines whether symbolic disputes can erode democratic commitments by fostering political intolerance and whether they do so by shifting the boundaries of inclusion in the “imagined community.” Across two survey experiments, we find that proposals to replace White-centered commemorations with more inclusive alternatives trigger support for undemocratic penalties (e.g., investigations, civil liberties restrictions) among racially conservative White Americans. We also show that racial liberals respond similarly when tsymbols consistent with their own identity are targeted. We find that such threats reliably shift respondents away from strong opposition to undemocratic penalties and toward ambivalence, even in the absence of elite cues. Finally, we demonstrate that this is enabled by reclassifying opponents as “unamerican” and “undemocratic,” thus shifting the boundaries of inclusion in the imagined community. Our findings demonstrate that symbolic politics may activate latent undemocratic impulses across ideological lines, posing underrecognized risks to democracy.",

In this article, we offer a novel and original early analysis of New America (Trump 2.0) as a contemporary political project on a protofascist trajectory. Our analysis contributes to scholarly understanding in multiple different ways. First, it grounds present American warnings about fascism in their specific historical tradition, showing how current alarm over Trump 2.0 continues, rather than departs from, long-standing American anti-fascist discourse. Second, it theorises fascism as revolutionary transformation, distinguishing it from both traditional conservatism and authoritarian populism, and further proposing a framework demonstrating how political projects may escalate towards fascism. This serves both as an analytical tool and as an early-warning system for identifying when democratic backsliding crosses certain critical thresholds. Finally, it provides an account of multiple mechanisms of ‘loyalty’ creation in Trump 2.0 that operate as an active process and are crucial to the project’s complete realisation.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces “data mirroring,” a methodological framework for conducting data-donation-based interviews using Data Download Packages (DDPs) from digital platforms. Since the General Data Protection Regulation took effect, DDPs have found application in research. While the literature on the value of DDPs primarily points toward scaling and validating aggregate-level data, their potential to illuminate complex user–media relationships within datafied environments at the micro-level appears underexplored. Drawing from recent conceptualizations of the “data mirror,” which captures the feedback loops between users and digital media, this article provides theoretical grounding and practical guidelines for “mirroring” DDPs to users. Based on exercises with 64 participants, we articulate through an illustrative case study how DDPs can serve as prompts, contexts, and reflections, revealing reflexive strategies users employ to curate information flows on algorithmic platforms like Instagram. In addition, we introduce an open-source web application to operationalize DDPs as data mirrors for non-technical researchers.",

          "abstract": "This study, one of the first cross-national and cross-professional approaches, maps Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption and perceptions through a survey of 797 professionals in eight countries (Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Norway, and Denmark) spanning six fields including journalism, marketing, audiovisual, public relations, graphic design, and communication education. Experimentation is widespread (88%), yet workflow integration remains uneven. Adoption is strongest among younger professionals, and sectoral differences are detected: marketing reports higher adoption, whereas journalists and educators report the lowest usage. ChatGPT dominates (77%), followed by Canva (38%), and DALL·E and MidJourney (27%). Frequency of use lag behind positive attitudes. National patterns also diverge, reflecting cultural, regulatory, and market factors. Results draw on SCOT, Rogers’ diffusion, and Bozdag’s AImosis to frame sociotechnical adoption of AI as a negotiation. We offer a baseline of AI practices in European communication professions and identify key priorities in policy.",

          "abstract": "In May 2010, the U.S. Public Affairs Office of the Joint Task Force of Guantánamo (JTF-GTMO) joined many other federal institutions in opening an official Twitter account (@JTFGTMO), but by May 2019, it was gone; the account, deactivated. This research builds upon the premise that carceral authority is exerted not only through speech itself but also erasure, which can decentralize the networked power of government spokespeople. This article importantly advances a method for procuring social media data by decentering corporate regimes of records management and focusing on the archival potential of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as a way of studying disconnective practices of the U.S. national security state. Drawing on a multimodal corpus of archived deleted tweets, internal administrative records, and a FOIA response letter, the article traces disconnection as a staged institutional process rather than a single act of withdrawal. This empirical approach garners an analysis of how the JTF-GTMO steadily attempted to sever much of its networked communication, initially through deletion of individually published messages and later through the total deactivation of its Twitter and Facebook accounts. The study ultimately contributes to ongoing research on national security, public memory, and platform power by proposing a counter-archival method that can be adapted across a number of jurisdictions.",

By revealing Douyin’s affective affordances to produce queer counterpublics through censorship, we propose a framework that explains how queer counterpublics navigate user–state tensions and balance affect with strategy in a dynamic discursive space. Based on our large-scale Douyin video dataset, we analyze 102,031 videos from 90,901 accounts by combining computational and qualitative methods. By employing computer vision and content analysis, we uncover the multimodal features and strategies calling for justice in those videos. We also show how non-influencers, influencers, and official accounts adopt distinct strategies and how these strategies are associated with user engagement. Further multimodal discourse analysis examines three key counter discourses, including maximum visibility, limited anger, and infinite hope.

Drawing on a hybrid methodological approach that combines computational analysis of tweet corpora with interpretive readings, the research examines how histories of racial violence circulate within the algorithmically mediated space. While lynching remains a central symbol of anti-Black terror in the United States, its meaning in public discourse has become increasingly unstable. On Twitter, lynching is deployed as a historical referent, a metaphor, political claim, and rhetorical provocation, thereby surfacing in divergent frames. We theorize this instability as frictional memory: a dynamic of circulation under constraint, operating through temporal traction (mnemonic pivots that attach past to present), semantic abrasion (collisions that produce drift, contestation, and repair), and visibility routing (platform-mediated asymmetries of attention). This framework shows how histories of racial violence are not simply recalled online but continually reconfigured in digital architectures.",

The sites for the mapping are X/Twitter and LinkedIn, where users frantically post not only about Altman but also about all manner of AI promises and pitfalls. By employing techniques from controversy mapping and digital research methods, we locate contemporary AI imaginaries, assess their salience in a cross-platform perspective, and describe the stakes gleaned from the prominence of certain dominant imaginaries, such as longtermism, regulatory ambivalence, and techno-hagiography. We discuss the issues these imaginaries raise and the AI industry’s premediation and preclusion of them: the manners by which the AI industry strives to occupy the future and absorb the present.",

          "abstract": "Starting in the early 1980s, advanced democracies increasingly privatized state-owned enterprises. While most research seeking to explain this phenomenon treated countries as independent units, this study analyzes whether diffusion played a role in the spread of privatization. We provide a comprehensive, cross-sectoral picture of the drivers of the diffusion of privatization. We estimate spatio-temporal autoregressive models for 20 countries between 1980 and 2019 and include theoretically grounded operationalizations for the three main mechanisms of diffusion (learning, competition, and emulation), which we tailor to the case of privatization. We find that all three mechanisms affected privatization decisions but not at all times. Rather, diffusion only occurred from the early 1990s until the financial crisis. In contrast, during the 1980s, the example had to be set before the policy instrument could spread, while after 2007 the instrument was a well-established economic policy instrument that no longer needed to spread.",

          "abstract": "What is the scope for international cooperation in innovation policy in economies closely integrated via trade? We address this question by building a two-region innovation-driven growth model with endogenous technology diffusion via FDI. We use the model to analyse R&amp;D subsidy cooperation in the EU, which has a common trade and monetary policy but where a coordinated innovation policy is still in its infancy. Stark differences in innovation capabilities between the West (old member states) and the East (new member states) shape optimal policies. Western countries have higher R&amp;D efficiency and serve as primary sources of knowledge spillovers, through FDI-driven technology transfer. Cooperation is driven by two factors: correcting distortions from subsidy competition, the strategic motive, and leveraging intertemporal knowledge spillovers that sustain growth. A coordinated policy involves substantial subsidies for the West and taxes for the East, reflecting the West’s superior R&amp;D efficiency and role as a key source of knowledge spillovers. Both regions experience welfare gains, primarily by internalising cross-border spillovers. We find strong complementarity between innovation and FDI subsidies, showing that jointly supporting knowledge creation and diffusion yields greater benefits than implementing each policy in isolation.",

We exploit a quasi-experimental setting created by Switzerland’s implementation of the treaty, which initially eased entry restrictions only for commuters from neighboring countries, thereby inducing a large inflow of “cross-border inventors” in regions close to the border. We find that the treaty increased patenting in such regions relative to comparable ones farther away from the border. We find no evidence indicating the displacement of native inventors or a reduction in the patenting activity of Switzerland’s neighboring countries. We also find that incumbent inventors in regions next to the border increased their productivity, thanks to patents in collaboration with cross-border inventors. We provide evidence suggesting that cross-border inventors contributed to Swiss patenting by enabling R&amp;D laboratories to enlarge, albeit without increasing the productivity of local peers outside direct collaborations.",

An 1894 reform removed institutional features—a graduated franchise, property qualifications, the absence of a secret ballot, and the participation of unelected magistrates—that allowed landowners to control spending on poor relief after the 1832 Great Reform Act. The empirical analysis uses a new annual dataset of poor law spending from 1884–1905 to test whether higher pre-reform inequality amplified the effect of democratic reform on redistribution. The results support the Meltzer–Richard hypothesis: higher local income inequality led to higher poor relief spending after 1894. Areas where landed elites held political power saw smaller increases in expenditure, indicating that de facto elite influence muted the effect of democratization. These findings provide empirical support for models of democratization that focus on demands for redistribution.",

          "authors": "Tatjana Neuhuber, Antonia E. Schneider, Selim Banabak, Justin Kadi",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates how residential mobility among high‐income households shapes income segregation. Drawing on a unique data set covering all household relocations in Vienna between 2011 and 2018, we examine whether the movements of the top income quintile (Q5) reflect a broader ‘retreat of the rich’ to affluent clusters and, if so, how these mobility patterns influence both citywide and localized segregation. Using a combination of global and local dissimilarity indices, as well as a novel scenario‐based approach, we isolate the effects of intra‐urban mobility, income status change and in‐migration. The results show that Q5 households are consistently the most segregated group, and while they mostly tend to move between affluent areas, their mobility alone does not fully explain segregation trends. Instead, we find that the selective out‐migration of lower‐income groups from the same areas plays a critical role in reinforcing segregation. Local scenario analyses reveal that Q5 mobility can either increase or reduce segregation, depending on the spatial context, challenging simple narratives of a retreat of the rich. These findings underscore the importance of analysing segregation as a dynamic, multi‐scalar process shaped by the intersecting mobility patterns of all income groups, even in cities with inclusive housing regimes like Vienna.",

While numerous studies and literature reviews have examined camps through specific lenses (humanitarian governance, sovereignty, biopolitics, architecture) no comprehensive synthesis has yet mapped the full terrain of camp‐related research across forms, periods, and locations. This article addresses that gap by sketching a broad, cross‐disciplinary overview of Camp Studies, identifying key clusters and points of convergence within the literature. Beyond synthesis, the article advances a second, more programmatic intervention: it proposes Critical Camp Studies as a distinct field of inquiry. Drawing inspiration from the emergence of Carceral Geography and Critical Border Studies, the article argues that the proliferation and normalisation of encampment as policy (particularly in relation to migration) demands a sustained, systematic, and explicitly critical framework. Rather than analysing camps solely as sites of management or humanitarian ‘best practice’ Critical Camp Studies foregrounds urgent social questions of injustice, inequality, and power in relation to camps and encampment.",

          "abstract": "High‐income countries shape their migration policies to attract highly qualified immigrants (HQI), aiming to boost human capital and economic growth. HQI often settle in large cities, raising two challenges for urban social sustainability. First, immigrants frequently face residential segregation, hindering social integration. Second, local communities in cities receiving wealthier migrants may experience displacement due to lifestyle migration and transnational gentrification. However, in countries with recent migration history, the residential distribution of HQI in urban areas remains largely unknown. This study analyses the residential distribution of HQI in Spain's largest urban areas, where HQI have rapidly increased from nearly 170,000 in 2001 to over 925,000 in 2021. Using 2021 Census data, we apply Multilevel Latent Class Analysis to categorize immigrants by migration status, labour performance and household characteristics. We identify seven distinct groups and demonstrate the existence of a socioeconomic stratification regarding their residential distribution. Unemployed or overqualified HQIs from low‐ and middle‐income regions cluster in lower‐income peripheral areas, while those employed in high‐skilled jobs originating in Europe concentrate in central cities.",

It investigates the loneliness reports of older African adults in the South African context, where out‐migrants are reported as retaining membership in their household of origin. An analysis of household survey data collected in the National Income Dynamics Study shows that between 2008 and 2017, almost 30% of older ( ≥ 60 years) African adults in South Africa lived in a household that was “stretched” (it included at least one household member not physically resident in the household). At the unconditional mean, older adults in these households are significantly less likely than other older African adults to report feeling lonely. This relationship exists independently of whether the older person's household receives private transfers (including remittance income). A series of ordered probit regressions shows that lower loneliness reports derive from sizeable differences in household characteristics. In comparison to older African adults in other households, those in stretched households are far more likely to live with children and working‐age adults. These characteristics are significant protectors of the loneliness of older adults, and once they are accounted for, there is no further association between living in a stretched household and the loneliness of older adults.",

While previous research has predominantly focused on deskilling, this research focuses on the upskilling of Filipino migrant nurses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The morphogenetic cycle has been adopted to explore how structural factors interplay with agencies of Filipino migrant nurses related to the upskilling process. Findings demonstrate that Filipino migrant nurses who majored in nursing due to external factors, such as parental pressure or social trends, tend to improve their professional and soft skills after migrating to the UAE, which offers abundant resources, thereby demonstrating their agency. Furthermore, migrant nurses developed a positive perception of themselves, actively recommending migration to those around them, while also voicing their criticisms of the Filipino medical system. This research demonstrates how agents and structures interact in relation to the upskilling of migrant nurses, providing clues as to how the phenomenon of labor migration perpetuates.",

          "authors": "Rong Bao, Catherine Conlon, Robbie Gilligan",
          "abstract": "This study examines return migration within the broader context of rural–urban migration in China, focusing on young migrant mothers in Beijing. While return migration in China is often attributed to structural barriers, this research highlights the agency of migrant women in actively shaping their migration trajectories. Using Constructivist Grounded Theory methods, the study draws on in‐depth interviews with twelve young migrant mothers (seven participated in follow‐up interviews one year later), revealing that aspirations for return migration emerge early but become more concrete after childbirth. Our findings suggest that return migration is not merely a response to exclusion but a strategic decision influenced by multi‐local capabilities, familial responsibilities, and aspirations for a better life. Migrant mothers exercise adaptive agency by strategically navigating settlement choices across both rural and urban locations. Rather than viewing return as a failure, this study conceptualises it as an evolving and relational process of place‐making, shaped by gendered expectations and ongoing mobility. By reframing return migration as a dynamic and strategic decision, this research expands existing understandings of internal migration and place in China.",

          "abstract": "The paper documents new educational and social geographies: the intensified and variable geographies of segregation and exclusion of one of the most marginalised groups of children, those with labels/experiences of ‘Special Educational Needs and Disabilities’ (SEND), who are usually disabled or neurodiverse, in England. The disadvantage faced by, and systematic societal failure to support, disabled and neurodiverse children has become increasingly visible within political and media debates, yet is largely overlooked within geography and broader social sciences. We present original findings demonstrating that increasing proportions of children are being educated in segregated special schools, and that these geographies are uneven at the local (Local Authority) scale, despite a stated presumption of mainstream education, dating back to 1989 and within existing legislation (Children and Families Act, 2014). Time and spatial trends in the school provision of children with SEND are analysed using multilevel longitudinal models and panel data at Local Authority scale. Critically, location is pivotal to whether children attend segregated special schools. The spatial difference is tied to: the proportions of children with statutory support, Local Authorities with higher levels of income deprivation affecting children, and the types of labels/experiences of ‘need’—particularly the increasing number of children on the autism spectrum. In light of the stated government priority to continue a presumption towards inclusion in mainstream schools, our analysis begs questions of the ability of mainstream schools to include children with common and growing ‘differences’, particularly in locations of high deprivation.",

          "authors": "Senyo Dotsey, Audrey Lumley‐Sapanski",
          "abstract": "Legal precarity has been used to describe the relations between ‘space, law and persons’ that produce illegality and shape the sociolegal exclusion of forced migrants. Precarious legal status is demarcated by hierarchies of legal and social membership and degrees of exclusion. Within the context of legal precarity, we explore the coping strategies used by forced migrants preceding and during the COVID‐19 period in Italy. Our analysis focuses on interviews with 31 asylum claimants. We find that forced migrants experienced protracted legal liminality and precarity characterised by extended time spent in migration camps, unpredictable legal status determination, and, more broadly, imperfect knowledge. In particular, their legal precarity was formed or shaped by a fluctuating legal and bureaucratic system, the suspension of asylum determination processes, and the closure of institutions due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The cumulative impact affected their well‐being and limited their full participation in society. This paper's key contribution is in identifying strategies employed in response. Individuals employed social network support, physical exercises, faith, and cognitive reframing of the legal difficulties to cope with prolonged precarious legal precarity. These findings have implications for migration scholarship and for professionals working with forced migrants, and can help inform policy and future research.",

          "authors": "Vu Linh Chi Hoang, Sarah Turner",
          "abstract": "In this article we examine how rural‐to‐urban migrant factory workers in two of Vietnam's industrial zones actively construct livelihood stability and pursue future aspirations while dealing with structurally precarious work environments. We develop a multi‐scalar conceptual framework combining key ideas regarding livelihood trajectories, feminist social reproduction theory, and social networks and social capital, and draw on worker interviews in Bình Dương and Bắc Ninh Provinces as well as focus groups with officials and other key stakeholders. While workers' trajectories are shaped by shifting production demands, low wages, housing insecurity, and limited social protection, as well as familial obligations and life events, we find that they actively recalibrate their livelihood strategies and focus on gaining stability through informal income activities, support networks, and future‐oriented planning. Rather than viewing workers as passive subjects of exploitation, our study contributes to scholarship on precarious labour and migration by showing how economic survival, emotional well‐being, and aspirational agency are dynamically interwoven and negotiated over time. We also challenge dominant policy narratives within Vietnam that frame industrial employment as a straightforward path to improved livelihoods, while calling for more integrated policy approaches that recognize the entanglement of labour, housing, and care in sustaining Vietnam's industrial development.",

          "abstract": "Migration is often associated with favourable labour market outcomes, particularly among higher educated individuals. This paper shifts the focus to the benefits of staying by examining how location‐specific capital shapes labour market outcomes for middle‐skilled vocational education graduates. Using longitudinal register data from Statistics Netherlands, we analyse whether residential history, professional networks, and personal networks are associated with higher employment rates and more stable employment contracts among young vocational graduates. The results show that stayers experience more favourable labour market outcomes than newcomers (i.e. migrants) and that locally embedded professional and personal networks are positively related to employment and contract stability. These patterns do not depend on geographical contexts, but are found in both rural and urban regions. Together, the findings suggest that, through the accumulation of location‐specific capital, staying, rather than moving, can be an effective labour market strategy for vocational education graduates.",

          "abstract": "Neighbourhood cohesion is suggested to improve residents' subjective well‐being, especially for disadvantaged individuals who are more likely to live in resource‐deprived neighbourhoods. However, existing studies face a challenge in establishing a causal relationship between neighbourhood cohesion and subjective well‐being due to endogeneity issues from residential selection. To address this methodological challenge, we use the random allocation of public housing in Hong Kong as a natural experiment. We analyse data from the Hong Kong Panel Study of Social Dynamics (HKPSSD) and focus on public housing residents. We find that individuals' pre‐determined socioeconomic and demographic characteristics are uncorrelated with the social cohesion of the neighbourhoods where residents are placed, which confirms the validity of our research design. Based on the design, we find that neighbourhood cohesion is positively associated with residents' life satisfaction and happiness, while it is also negatively associated with mental distress. Moreover, neighbourhood satisfaction is a significant mediator between neighbourhood cohesion and subjective well‐being. Our findings contribute to establishing a causal relationship in studies on neighbourhood effects and provide policy implications for improving well‐being among disadvantaged residents.",

In this paper we systematically review 15 peer‐reviewed studies and 5 gray literature sources (2016–2025) identified through structured searches of Scopus, Web of Science, and regulatory repositories. Treating effectiveness as contested and multidimensional, we combine existing studies to demonstrate when, how, and for whom sandboxes generate benefits and risks. Three patterns emerge. First, the clearest gains are ecosystem spillovers: once a sector has its first sandbox entrant, funding for non‐participating firms often rises, consistent with signaling and information diffusion. Second, direct firm‐level funding advantages largely fade after accounting for staggered adoption, with positive effects concentrated in smaller firms. Third, system‐level impacts depend on context, varying with supervisory capacity, complementary policies, and wider pro‐innovation reform bundles. Overall, the evidence base is small, UK‐centric, and methodologically heterogeneous, so findings should be read as indicative. We conclude with evaluation implications for regulators.",

To address this question, we conducted a conjoint survey experiment on nursing home services with 1009 direct relatives of nursing home residents in Spain. Participants evaluated hypothetical nursing home profiles that varied across core service characteristics and regulatory tools: ownership, transparency, oversight body, and control and sanction mechanisms. The article shows that individuals prefer public and nonprofit providers, five‐star quality ratings, disclosure of inspection results, and strict sanctions. However, when examining which models are most trusted, our results indicate that trust is shaped by overlapping but distinct factors. As with preferences, respondents place greater trust in public and nonprofit providers, but trust is also shaped by participatory mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for involvement and having one's voice heard have a core role in shaping confidence in care provision.",

          "abstract": "Mediator discretion in community mediation is inevitable yet often invisible, which can obscure legitimacy, accountability, and bias in publicly funded or state‐adjacent settings. This conceptual design paper uses integrative synthesis, drawing on street‐level bureaucracy, procedural justice, and dispute system design, to derive a practice‐ready and auditable way to govern within‐session discretionary process moves without disrupting conversational flow or capturing confidential narratives. I define transparent mediator discretion as the practice of making discretionary process moves visible through brief reason‐giving, authorizing them through bounded party choice, making them reversible through a normalized reset pathway, and documenting them through minimal coded entries. The paper's results are design outputs: a fairness‐by‐design framework centered on a brief rationale‐and‐consent loop, a proportionality ladder, a menu‐based set of move options, and a code‐only documentation structure. Worked examples illustrate how the loop can be delivered as a human micro‐competency and supported by digital decision aids without replacing human judgment. I also specify falsifiable propositions, privacy‐minimizing indicators designed to avoid narrative capture, and low‐cost evaluation designs that can be implemented in low‐resource programs. Next steps include piloting in both voluntary and court‐connected contexts, testing safeguards for stalemate and power imbalance, and assessing how AI‐assisted support can preserve party choice, reversibility, and accountability under human oversight.",

          "abstract": "Wage theft remains a pervasive problem internationally and within the United States. In response, worker advocates have sought stronger laws to deter violations and promote compliance. Yet formal authority alone may be insufficient; labor departments often fail to use the full extent of their legal authority to conduct vigorous enforcement. This raises two empirical questions: to what extent do agencies deploy available enforcement tools, and with what consequences? Drawing on a novel survey of U.S. state labor departments, new measures of statutory strength in wage‐hour laws, and state‐level estimates of minimum wage violations, we find widespread nonuse of available powers. This misalignment of powers and practices has substantive consequences: the predicted probability of minimum wage violation falls sharply as strategic enforcement practices increase, conditional on strong labor laws. However, this effect shows no measurable impact for some of the most vulnerable workers, suggesting limits in reaching those at greatest risk. We conclude by outlining a forward‐looking research agenda on the (mis)alignment of powers and practices.",

This study reviews the existing literature on whether the poor are more exposed to climate shocks and whether they are more adversely affected. We find that 67% of our analyzed samples show that the poor are more exposed to climate shocks than the rest of the population, and 88% find that the poor are more adversely affected by climate shocks than the rest of the population. Income and human capital losses tend to be concentrated among the poor. These results are similar at the global and low‐ and middle‐income settings. These findings highlight the potential long‐term risk of a climate change‐induced poverty trap and the need for targeted interventions to protect the poor from the adverse effects of climate shocks.

Drawing on fieldwork and interviews conducted in Turkish newsrooms, we show how journalists navigate ethical commitments amid state control. Using Weber’s “ethic of responsibility” and “ethic of conviction,” we find that editors routinely suppress reporting to protect their newsrooms and carve out a reduced space for critical coverage, while some reporters prioritize truth-telling but disclaim responsibility for publication outcomes. These orientations reinforce a division of labor that perpetuates suppression, showing that ethics can sometimes be used to legitimize restraint rather than resist authoritarianism.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how political trust shaped citizens' aspirations to influence others on social media during a COVID‐19 pandemic. Using four‐wave longitudinal survey data (2017–2021; N = 2172) collected from 543 citizens in Finland, we first analysed how political trust moderated the temporal development of individuals' aspirations to influence others online. We then examined how trust and influence aspirations jointly contributed to citizens' social media behaviour during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The findings showed that aspirations to influence declined during the crisis, particularly among those with high political trust. In contrast, individuals with low trust typically maintained their influence aspirations and were more likely to engage on social media and to criticise public authorities. High political trust, on the other hand, did not promote criticism but was instead positively associated with support. Overall, these findings clarify social media engagement dynamics in times of crisis and the tendency of online discussions to amplify the voices of those who are politically frustrated or sceptical. From a policy perspective, the results highlight how trust asymmetries shape visible participation in digital spaces, offering evidence relevant to the design of crisis communication, platform governance, and strategies for engaging both vocal critics and less visible, high‐trust citizens.",

Often, these behaviours have been measured using economic games or tasks where people decide between helping or not. However, in everyday life current behaviours are interrupted with alternative opportunities. Across three independent samples (two preregistered, total n = 510), people watched a movie whilst encountering opportunities that benefitted another person or themselves. Crucially, participants decided in different poor and rich foraging environments where the average reward values of opportunities changed. We demonstrate a stronger environmental influence on decisions that benefit others: people were more willing to interrupt their behaviour to help others in poor environments, where the average reward value was lower, compared to richer environments where average reward value was higher. Computational modelling revealed that the opportunity costs of the different foraging environments were valued distinctly for others. Factors of utilitarianism, and empathy/emotional motivation, captured variability in opportunity costs for others. We show that when humans decide to engage in prosocial behaviours depends on the quality of opportunities in one’s environment, which is critical as environments change.",

          "abstract": "Social scientists often compare survey responses before and after important events to test how those events impact respondent beliefs, attitudes, and preferences. This article offers a formal analysis of such pre-event/post-event survey comparisons, including designs that seek to reduce bias using quota sampling, rolling cross-sections, and panels. Our analysis distinguishes major sources of bias and clarifies the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We then introduce a modified panel design—the dual randomized survey—to reduce bias in cases where asking respondents to complete the same survey twice could impact their Wave 2 responses. Our formalization of bias and novel research design improve scholars’ ability to study the causal impact of events through surveys.",

          "abstract": "Do anti-elitist parties behave differently in parliament than other parties? Existing evidence is inconclusive: some studies suggest that anti-elitist parties do not show a shared voting pattern as this is mainly structured by their left- or right-wing ideology. Others suggest that these parties vote against legislation more often. In order to address this question, we develop a new method that allows one to look at different explanations of voting concurrently while also taking into account characteristics of the vote. We find that anti-elitist parties do vote in a similar way and different from other parties, but only on legislative votes. As such, we present a major step forward in our understanding of and methodological approach to parliamentary voting behavior.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing ecosystem services demand (ESD) is key to understanding the diverse preferences for various benefits from nature. However, direct evidence of the variations in ESDs among different groups of people and places remains limited. Here, a national-scale dataset of ESDs derived from a non-probabilistic survey of 20,075 urban residents across 31 provinces in China is presented. The dataset captures preferences for nine typical urban ecosystem services using a point-allotment experiment, where participants allocated a total of 100 importance points to prioritize ESDs. Key findings reveal significant variations in ESDs, with air purification receiving the highest average importance point (22.17), followed by recreation (15.60) and local climate regulation (13.62). This pattern of variation in ESDs is evident in 28 of 31 provinces. The dataset also includes detailed socioeconomic and environmental metadata, enabling further analyses of regional disparities and their drivers among ESDs. This resource offers exploratory insights into tailoring urban design and ecosystem management strategies to diverse societal needs, thereby advancing sustainable land use planning and ESD research.",

          "abstract": "The dissemination of weaponized information—defined as the intentional use of falsehoods (i.e. disinformation) and the harmful misuse of accurate information (i.e. malinformation) against a target—on social media represents a notable downside of these platforms, often linked to polarization. However, research on the relationship between weaponized information and polarization remains limited due to conceptual ambiguities and geographical context. This study uses cross-sectional survey data ( N = 520) collected across eight provinces in Afghanistan to explore the direct and indirect association between exposure to disinformation and malinformation online and ethnic polarization. Findings through mediation analyses reveal that exposure to disinformation was not associated with ethnic polarization, either directly or indirectly. Conversely, exposure to malinformation was directly associated with ethnic polarization and indirectly linked to it through increased ingroup positive perception. These findings highlight the nuanced difference in how intentional falsehoods and the harmful misuse of accurate information shape polarization dynamics in ethnically diverse and polarized societies.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that in China’s digital sphere, online misogyny functions less as a gateway to extremism and more as a structural hub for systemic discontent. Drawing on opportunity structure theory, our mixed-methods approach combines computational analysis of posts from Baidu Tieba ( n = 91,026) with in-depth interviews ( n = 27). We find that “Gendered Insults” exhibits the highest betweenness centrality, acting as a structural bridge connecting disparate frustrations. Women-targeting topics are both speakable and resonant within the community, anchored by a self-deprecating “sewer mouse” masculinity that navigates opportunity structures. Interviews reveal that when political opportunity structures remain closed while discursive and mediated (legacy platform) opportunities stay relatively accessible, misogyny becomes a functional language for channeling widespread socioeconomic anxieties. We conclude that in this context, misogyny operates not as a starting point for radicalization but as a core organizing principle for the socially disillusioned. This suggests that divergent structural conditions produce different mechanisms.",

Based on in-depth interviews with key industry stakeholders, the study demonstrates how children’s visibility within influencer marketing is strategically cultivated through the interdependent operation of economic, professional, and normative structures. The article introduces the concept of institutionalized sharenting to describe the processes through which sharenting becomes routinized and legitimized, enabling industry actors to capitalize on children’s presence while displacing full responsibility onto parents. This deflection is enacted through a variety of practices, such as the inclusion of children via strategic collaborations with their parents, and is framed through discourses of authenticity, intensive parenting, and personal choice. Ultimately, the paper argues that the marginalization of children, despite their centrality to the industry’s profitability, is sustained by adultist and neoliberal logics that frame children’s labour as play and familial monetization as empowerment.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been characterized by political partisan differences and opinions that influenced individual behavior and political policies, correlating with varying outcomes. Measuring these differences in opinion using traditional methods, such as opinion polls, can be costly and provides only a snapshot of sentiment at a given time. Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) may offer a real-time tool for assessing opinions to explore the relationship between differing viewpoints about the pandemic and how these differences impact the occurrence and severity of disease burden. Utilizing an open-source data set of 1.75 million keyword-selected X (Twitter) posts, updated weekly from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, along with publicly available COVID-19 case and death counts and county-level data on election outcomes from the 2020 election, we analyzed how the volume of tweets on the X (Twitter) platform related to COVID-19 has changed over time and how patterns of use vary across the partisan divide. We discovered that Democratic-leaning counties exhibited higher X (Twitter) volume associated with COVID-19 topics compared to Republican-leaning counties in response to changes in case or death rates. In addition, we found a higher proportion of tweets in urban counties compared to rural ones.",

          "abstract": "The nonreligious—atheists, agnostics, and nones—are on track to become America’s largest religious group between 2030 and 2040. The group’s rapid growth is largely attributed to widespread disaffiliation from Christian traditions across racial and ethnic identities. However, a significant portion of the population is now 2nd generation nonreligious, meaning that they not only never identified with a faith tradition but were raised in a nonreligious household by nonreligious parents. A significant body of work in psychology shows differences between those who convert away from religious identification and lifelong nonbelievers across intersecting identities. Yet, no work exists examining how this distinction impacts ideology or political beliefs that affect how voters’ identities interact with political outcomes. This study investigates the ideological and political differences between ex-Christian members of the nonreligious community and lifelong nonbelievers across multiple facets of identity, using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS).",

          "authors": "Karun Kishor Karki",
          "abstract": "In an era of globalization, increasingly interconnected labor markets have intensified competition for skilled talent, particularly among countries in the Global North such as Canada. While Canada’s immigration policy prioritizes education and professional experience, these same credentials are often devalued upon arrival, as systemic barriers limit access to commensurate employment. This study examines the employment experiences of skilled, racialized immigrants in British Columbia, exploring how institutional narratives of meritocracy conceal exclusion, credential systems reinforce epistemic hierarchies, and settlement services pathologize migrant experiences. Using a qualitative design with four focus group discussions ( n = 18), the study integrates critical migration theory, intersectionality, and decolonial social work to analyze the structural marginalization of skilled, racialized immigrants. Findings reveal a central paradox: the very system that celebrates global talent simultaneously erodes its value through credential gatekeeping, discriminatory hiring practices, and labor market practices that privilege local over global expertise. By situating these barriers within broader colonial and epistemic hierarchies, the study argues that integration must be understood not as individual adaptation but as institutional transformation. It contributes to critical debates on skilled migration, equity, and the reproduction of colonial logics within Canada’s labor market.",

          "authors": "Joseph A. Coll, Courtney L. Juelich, Scott J. LaCombe",
          "abstract": "Felon disenfranchisement, while ostensibly race neutral, bars more Black Americans from voting than White Americans. This has promulgated claims that felon disenfranchisement is used to limit Black political influence. However, we lack systematic evidence tying perceptions of racial political power to support for disenfranchising felons. Utilizing the racial threat framework, we argue that White Americans who perceive Black Americans as too politically powerful will be more supportive of disenfranchising felons, particularly right-leaning White Americans. Using data from the 2020 and 2024 ANES, we find perceptions of political threat are associated with greater support for felon disenfranchisement. In further support for the political racial threat hypothesis, we find perceptions of Black political power increase support among those on the political right while decreasing support among the political left. Importantly, these results hold after controlling for economic and symbolic threat, general Black affect, crime spending preferences, and Black population size. These results suggest political racial threat significantly influences support for felon disenfranchisement among White Americans, and conditionally on political leanings, underscoring the role of political racial threat in whether White Americans think felons should be allowed to vote.",

We argue that given the goals of the organization, Black people should be the CBC’s strongest supporters. We also anticipate that age will be a major cleavage in support for the CBC among Black people. We test our hypotheses using the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS). We find that Black people, and older Black people in particular, are the most supportive of the CBC. Moreover, we find that disparities in support among the youngest and oldest Black respondents are greater than the differences between Black and White people in our analysis. We empirically explore the causes of this intergenerational rift and show that younger Black Americans’ lower levels of support for the organization are in part tied to their lower levels of linked fate and their perception that elected officials do not work to advance their interest in government.",

          "abstract": "This project investigates how skin tone and gender of Black political candidates work together to influence White Americans’ evaluations. Drawing on the colorism literature and group position theory, I develop a theoretical framework anticipating how the skin tone of Black candidates may influence White voters’ perceptions. Two survey experiments were conducted on nationally representative samples. Both studies highlight that skin tone is meaningful to White voters’ evaluations, but in nuanced ways based on gender. Specifically, the darker-skinned Black female candidate is evaluated more positively than her lighter-skinned female and darker-skinned male counterpart across multiple domains, including vote choice and expected job performance. These findings suggest that gender can attenuate the negative stereotypes typically associated with darker skin tone in some contexts. These findings underscore the importance of theorizing about race as a multidimensional construct, with implications for understanding hierarchy, intergroup relations, and electoral politics in a diversifying American racial landscape.",

Despite recent advances in Western, industrialized contexts, we know far less about how cooperative behaviors emerge across cultures, how normative environments shape their development, and how these behaviors relate to one another. Here, we examined the development of four cooperative behaviors—fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty—in children ( N = 413) aged 5 to 13 from five societies: urban United States, rural Uganda, Canada, Peru, and the hunter-horticulturalist Shuar of Ecuador. We also collected normative judgments from peers ( N = 163) and adults ( N = 86) of each community. We find substantial variation in cooperative behaviors and norms across populations, but, more generally, that children’s behaviors and norms tend to converge toward community-specific norms in middle childhood. We also identify three cooperative strategies—maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation—whose prevalence shifts with age and differs across societies. Together, these findings illuminate how cooperative behavior develops within and across cultures.",

          "abstract": "The critical nexus between biodiversity loss, climate change, and societal change is increasingly intertwined, requiring coordinated action, especially in urban contexts. This study examines how urban governance operationalizes the climate-biodiversity-health nexus in four European case cities through a goals-oriented framework informed by the Planetary Health approach. We conduct a qualitative analysis of urban policy documents to assess the degree of change and level of coordination across climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, and health domains. While cities have employed transformative solutions like nature-based solutions (NBS), we consistently identify policy blind spots such as fragmented mid-level targets, sectoral silos, insufficient attention to indirect emissions, and reliance on soft governance tools. We conclude by offering actionable insights for transformative urban nexus governance: mainstream transformative metrics and indicators, create new institutional innovations, integrate multi-benefit NBS across sectors, expand governance toolkits to address trade-offs, and co-create a culture of innovation, learning, co-creation and leadership.",

          "authors": "Qianwen Duan, Shengjie Lai, Alessandro Sorichetta, Andrew J. Tatem, Jessica Steele, Felix Eigenbrod",
          "abstract": "While widespread urbanisation continues, emerging trends of population redistribution away from highly urbanised areas have been observed in some countries, with important implications for infrastructure planning, resource allocation, and environmental risk assessment. However, few studies have examined this trend in a timely and spatially comprehensive manner across diverse national contexts, particularly in response to the turbulence in migration patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analyse spatial Facebook population data from 2020 to 2022 across 35 countries to characterise two forms of population redistribution: shifts between urban and rural areas, and changes along the urban density gradient. During the early response phase of the pandemic, broader country-level trends of urban-to-rural redistribution and intra-urban deconcentration were evident. However, 20% and 4.8% of these trends, respectively, were temporary and reversed during the later phase of the pandemic. The extent and direction of these patterns varied across countries and were negatively associated with the Human Development Index, suggesting that developed nations experienced greater urban depopulation and spatial deconcentration. Our findings reveal a potential misalignment between population redistribution and existing physical urban densities in certain countries, as densely built-up areas are experiencing outflows, highlighting the need for adaptive urban planning strategies to address evolving population dynamics and related sustainability challenges.",

          "abstract": "As climate change increasingly threatens urban habitability through extreme weather events, cities must rapidly adopt strategies to safeguard public health and well-being. This study presents a valuable methodology for evaluating and optimising the distribution of indoor climate shelters in urban areas, using the AccessiCity model. Using Bilbao as a case study, the research evaluates existing and potential shelters according to their spatial accessibility, operating hours, and typology. By applying a time-sensitive accessibility analysis and a prioritisation algorithm, the study identifies key gaps in coverage. It proposes targeted improvements, emphasising the role of places of worship, schools, and subway entrances. When this refined “Bilbao Strategy” is extrapolated to 131 cities across different continents, climate zones, and colonial legacies, it achieves over 60% of maximum potential coverage in 74.81% of cases and exceeds 40% in 96.18%. Results underscore the importance of urban density, climate context, and typological availability in shaping the strategy’s performance. The findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on equitable and scalable urban adaptation frameworks, offering a replicable model for enhancing resilience in the face of climate uncertainty.",
