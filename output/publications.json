          "abstract": "Do perceived foreign policy failures shape assessments of a country’s leadership in the eyes of international observers? We explore the consequences of foreign policy failures using global reactions to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Some argue that a poorly executed withdrawal heightened concerns about America’s soft power and image abroad. Others believe that the negative consequences of the withdrawal were exaggerated. To adjudicate between these claims, we compile public opinion surveys across 24 countries containing over 17,000 respondents. Analyzing perceptions of US leadership before and after the fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021, we find that the Afghanistan withdrawal had a substantive negative impact on global perceptions of US leadership. However, we observe no corresponding evidence that the attractiveness of great powers is ‘zero-sum’: decreases in favorability towards the United States were not paralleled by increases in the perceived attractiveness of alternatives to US leadership like Russia and China.",

          "authors": "Rune Stubager, Peter Egge Langsæther, Stine Hesstvedt",
          "abstract": "According to influential theories of modernization and individualization, social class has ceased to be relevant to citizens and their political behaviour in Western countries; class has been proclaimed ‘dead’. The argument is particularly strong at the subjective level where people are thought to no longer identify with social classes let alone relate this identification to politics. Using time-series election study data covering many decades combined with manifesto data from the US, Britain, Denmark, and Norway, we challenge this view and show that levels of class identification have been stable. The relationship between class identification, attitudes to redistribution and vote choice has, however, changed but this appears to result more from political parties’ varying polarization on economic and social issues than from the demise of class in voters’ minds.",

          "abstract": "The qualitative analysis of open-ended interviews has vast potential in economics but has found limited use. This is partly because the interpretative, nuanced human reading of text and coding that it requires is labour intensive and very time consuming. This paper presents a method to simplify and shorten the coding process by extending a small sample of interpretative human-annotated interviews to a larger, representative, sample using supervised natural language processing. We extensively assess the robustness and reliability of this approach to show when and how it adds value, including an analysis of how many human-annotated documents are optimal for a budget constrained researcher. We apply this approach to analyse 2,200 open-ended interviews on parent’s aspirations for children with Rohingya refugees and their Bangladeshi hosts. We show that studying aspirations with open-ended interviews extends the economics focus on material goals to ideas from philosophy and anthropology that emphasize aspirations for moral and religious values, and the navigational capacity to achieve these aspirations. This approach allows us to identify several novel results including a new type of migrant selection; we show that Rohingya refugees are negatively selected on education but positively selected on navigational capacity.",

          "abstract": "We analyse the resilience of community-based institutions to large shocks. Our case study is on forest user groups in Nepal in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake. We combine remote sensing data with detailed administrative data on forest user groups and exploit spatial variation in the intensity of the earthquake. Using a triple difference strategy, we show that the earthquake-induced increase in deforestation is significantly lower in locations with a higher share of forest covered by forest user groups. Thus, these institutions lead to more sustainable use of forests when they are under pressure. Regarding potential mechanisms, survey data suggest that social capital plays a role for the positive effects of forest user groups. More generally, our findings show that shifting governance of local resources to community-based institutions can be an effective policy in times of increased pressure on natural resources.",

Consumers can have different attitudes to status: conformists have a greater incentive for conspicuous consumption when they have many well-off neighbours, while snobs have a greater incentive when they have few well-off neighbours. Despite the neighbourhood income distribution affecting the incentives of snobs and conformists in starkly different ways, I show that conspicuous consumption is always higher in a more segregated society.",

          "abstract": "The study offers a systematic review of scientific literature on ‘return migration’ performing computational text mining and topic modelling. On a sample of 3000 studies indexed in Scopus and published between 1960 and 2020, we present a textual analysis and a clusters' analysis of titles, keywords, abstracts and publications' metadata. Results show a rapid growth in research since the 1970s, mirroring the evolution of migration events and the pace of theoretical advancements. The research landscape appears dominated by receiving high‐income countries' perspective. Throughout the entire period, topics related to culture, ethnicity and political identity have been prominent. A progressive shift in the economic paradigm has been identified, with labour‐related keywords leaving room for more subjective aspects of well‐being. Growing attention has been paid to different forms of migrants' capital and vulnerabilities, along with a declining interest in demographic implications of return, especially with respect to African and European internal and international migrations.",

          "authors": "Ettore Recchi, Luca Bernasconi, Alejandra Rodriguez Sanchez",
          "abstract": "Overstayers—travellers entering a country with a valid visa but staying beyond the initially authorised period—are a blind spot of migration research. Past studies claim that overstaying is indeed the main gateway to irregular migration in Europe, but few estimates exist. This paper explores three new methods to estimate the inflows of overstayers. We concentrate on the Schengen area as destination, given its relevance in global migration flows, and on non‐European countries as origins, since for travellers from these countries commercial flights are the most likely transportation mode to Europe. Our methods rely on aggregate information on incoming and departing passengers from all airports in the Schengen Area, and on Facebook users' mobility data. In the first method, we compute ‘net air travel flows’ as the difference between incoming and outgoing passengers; we then deduce net regular migration (using data from Eurostat and the QuantMig project) from ‘net air travel flows’ to obtain ‘unaccounted net flows’, which we hold to equate approximately to newly incoming overstayers with short‐stay visas for 2019. In the second method, building on the first estimate, we employ the logic of gravity models to project estimates for later years. In the third method, we build on the intuitions of the first method but use net migration figures from data on Facebook users' cross‐border movements. Substantively, the results of the different methods converge, indicating around 450,000 new overstayers who entered the whole of the Schengen Area in 2019 with short‐stay visas. Analyses for the following years obtained with the second and third method match and are in line with changes in travel policies during the COVID‐19 pandemic (2020 and 2021), suggesting a significant reduction in the number of overstayers for those years and an uptick for the years 2022–2023. By uncovering the size and scope of the overstaying population we shed light on a highly contested issue in the public debate and ultimately contribute to raise awareness on the constructed nature of the ‘regular’ versus ‘irregular’ framing of migration.",

          "abstract": "A formal model reveals how the information environment affects international races to implement a powerful, dangerous new military technology, which may cause a “disaster” affecting all states. States implementing the technology face a tradeoff between the safety of the technology and performance in the race. States face unknown, private, and public information about capabilities. More decisive races, in which small performance leads produce larger probabilities of victory, are usually more dangerous. In addition, revealing information about rivals’ capabilities has two opposing effects on risk: states discover either that they are far apart in capability and compete less or that they are close in capability and drastically reduce safety to win. Therefore, the public information scenario is less risky than the private information scenario except under high decisiveness. Finally, regardless of information, the larger the eventual loser’s impact on safety relative to the eventual winner’s, the more dangerous is the race.",

          "abstract": "Chlamydomonas acclimates to repeated low (LL) or high light (HL) days by changing the abundance of photosynthetic complexes and the ultrastructure of its thylakoid membranes. These phenotypes persist through the night phases, suggesting a readiness for the daylight environment that is routinely experienced despite the intervening dark periods [S. Dupuis et al. , Plant Cell 37 , koaf086 (2025), 10.1093/plcell/koaf086]. Here, we investigate how prior acclimation impacts algal fitness upon a change in daylight intensity and how quickly Chlamydomonas can reprogram its photoprotective strategy in a diurnal context. We performed a systems analysis of synchronized populations acclimated to diurnal LL when subjected to HL days and of populations acclimated to diurnal HL when subjected to LL days. In the latter case, diurnal photoacclimation decreased fitness during the first day at a new light intensity: HL-acclimated cells barely increased in size over the first LL period, and they failed to complete a cell cycle. However, although LL-acclimated cells showed severe photodamage after 6 h of HL, they recovered chloroplast form and function later that afternoon and successfully divided at nightfall. These cells rapidly altered their thylakoid membrane ultrastructure, increased their photoprotective quenching capacity, and decreased their inventory of photosystem and antenna proteins by the end of the first HL day. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed rapid induction of thousands of genes, including those encoding proteases, chaperones, and other proteins involved in the chloroplast unfolded protein response. These results show that the alga is highly flexible and competent to rapidly acclimate to changes in diurnal light intensity.",

The detection of novelty serves as a critical indicator of such changes, priming mechanisms to detect and respond to goal-relevant information. However, neural regions that support novelty detection (hippocampus) and goal-directed behavior [dopaminergic midbrain (VTA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC)] have yet to be described as a sequential process that unfolds over time. Using a forward-prediction functional MRI model, we explored interactions between the hippocampus, VTA, and PFC in humans performing a novelty-imbued target-detection task. Hippocampal novelty activation predicted subsequent VTA target activation, enhancing readiness to detect goal-relevant information. Concurrently, goal-directed PFC activation modulated VTA target activation, refining focus on behaviorally significant cues. These circuits function both synergistically and independently, promoting subsequent hippocampal activity during target trials. This work provides insights into how distributed circuits coordinate to optimize adaptive behavior.",

          "abstract": "Hibernation is a seasonal survival strategy employed by certain mammals that, through torpor use, reduces overall energy expenditure and permits long-term fasting. Although fasting solves the challenge of winter food scarcity, it also removes dietary carbon, a critical biomolecular building block. Here, we demonstrate a process of urea carbon salvage (UCS) in hibernating 13-lined ground squirrels, whereby urea carbon is reclaimed through gut microbial ureolysis and used in reductive acetogenesis to produce acetate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) of major value to the host and its gut microbiota. We find that urea carbon incorporation into acetate is more efficient during hibernation than the summer active season and that while both host and gut microbes oxidize acetate for energy supply throughout the year, the host’s ability to absorb and oxidize acetate is highest during hibernation. Metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome indicates that genes involved in the degradation of gut mucins, an abundant endogenous nutrient, are retained during hibernation. The hydrogen disposal associated with reductive acetogenesis from urea carbon helps facilitate this mucin degradation by providing a luminal environment that sustains fermentation, thereby generating SCFAs and other metabolites usable by both the host and its gut microbes. Our findings introduce UCS as a mechanism that enables hibernating squirrels and their gut microbes to exploit two key endogenous nutrient sources—urea and mucins—in the resource-limited hibernation season.",

          "abstract": "The Ciona heart cell lineage can be accurately traced back to a pair of blastomeres, the B7.5 cells, that form at the 64-cell stage. In addition to the adult heart, the B7.5 cells also contribute to two tail muscle cells in the larva, as well as the muscles that form the siphons for pumping water for feeding. Because of the simplicity of this system, we have a good understanding of how the B7.5 derivatives are specified during development. However, we know less about how the Ciona embryo precisely regulates cell numbers, as well as what effects altering cell numbers will have on development. We found that cell numbers in the B7.5 lineage are controlled by a pulse of transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1.b . Cdkn1.b can be repressed by the paralogs Prdm1-r.a and Prdm1-r.b that are exclusively transcribed in the B7.5 cells at the 112-cell stage. We unexpectedly found that precocious arrest of cell division in the B7.5 cell lineage resulted in a reversion to tail muscle fate, even in cells that can migrate. Our work demonstrates an unexpected connection between the control of cell numbers and cell fate in development.",

          "authors": "Mark J. Butler, Donald C. Behringer, Jason Schratwieser",
          "abstract": "Ecological traps occur when animals erroneously choose habitats that lower their fitness, drawn by cues that are adaptive in most instances, but not all. Most ecological traps result from anthropogenic changes that make habitats less beneficial, yet still attractive to unsuspecting animals. Naturally occurring ecological traps are rare, persisting despite their drain on population sustainability. We found an unusual natural ecological trap whereby social juvenile Caribbean spiny lobsters ( Panulirus argus ) are drawn to solution hole dens by the scent of larger conspecifics dwelling there, but where predatory red grouper ( Epinephelus morio ) also lurk. Although lobsters are sensitive to odors from food, healthy and diseased conspecifics, and other predators such as octopus, our experiments revealed that lobsters cannot detect the scent of groupers. As a consequence, mortality of small juvenile lobsters was 30% higher near solution holes occupied by grouper, as compared to larger lobsters that are invulnerable to the gape-limited grouper predator. By preying on small lobsters, grouper negatively skewed lobster size distributions up to 16 m away from the solution hole lair that they patrol. Our results provide one of the clearest examples of a natural ecological trap, in which the normally advantageous social cue of large conspecifics lures young lobsters to what is a predatory death trap. Although anthropogenically driven traps are an evolutionarily new and destabilizing force for animal populations, natural ecological traps like this one are ecological oddities whose effects on populations can be locally intense, yet persist through time.",

          "abstract": "Computer-assisted learning (CAL) offers an affordable way to implement a mastery learning approach in the classroom. However, while experimental research suggests CAL can enhance student outcomes, such findings often rely on experimental conditions not easily replicated in ordinary classroom settings (e.g., opt-in participation, extensive training and support, and high CAL usage targets). To assess the real-world impact of CAL, we draw on a large three-year panel of administrative data covering over 200,000 students in school districts that licensed Khan Academy’s Measures of Academic Progress accelerator, a program designed to support math learning. To identify causal effects, we exploit within-teacher and within-school changes in average classroom CAL practice time—a strategy that yields precise, policy-relevant estimates even at modest usage levels. We find that a classroom with 6.6 h of annual Khan Academy practice (about 11 min per week) experiences a + 0.031 SD gain in math test score performance compared to no practice. For classrooms with higher usage levels, we find approximately linear gains, with projected effects rising to + 0.085 SD at the recommended 30 min per week. Higher-achieving students benefit most, in part because they spend more time on CAL and progress through more skills than lower-performing peers. Teachers might reduce achievement gaps and boost overall gains by encouraging more productive use of the platform (focused on skill mastery)—especially among struggling students.",

          "abstract": "Humans predict the timing of imminent events to generate fast and precise actions, decisions, and other behaviors. Such temporal anticipation is critical over wide timescales, and especially salient over the range from hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. Despite advances in our understanding of basic timing behavior and its underlying neural mechanisms, it remains an open question whether anticipation is stable across these short time scales. Recent work shows that the brain models the probability density function (PDF) of events across time, suggesting a canonical mechanism for temporal anticipation. Here, we investigate whether this computation holds when the event distribution covers different time spans. We show that, irrespective of the time span, anticipation, measured as reaction time, scales with the event distribution. This demonstrates that the key computation—the estimation of event probability density—is invariant across temporal scales. We further show that the precision of anticipation is also scale invariant which contradicts Weber’s law. The results are established in vision and audition, suggesting that the core computations in temporal anticipation are independent of sensory modality. Perceptual systems exploit probability estimation over time independently of temporal scale to anticipate imminent events.",

Here, we generated sST2-deficient mice with intact ST2L using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Skin fibroblasts constitutively released sST2 protein at extremely high levels compared to mast cells, which did not reflect the expression levels of sST2 mRNA. This discrepancy can be partly explained by the sST2 protein degradation mediated by mast cell proteases. Accordingly, sST2 deficiency did not affect IL-33- and/or IgE plus antigen-stimulated mast cell activation in vitro. We provided evidence that constitutively high levels of sST2 suppress food allergies in mice by inhibiting IL-33-dependent, both expansion of jejunum mast cells and enhancement of their degranulation. Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice under steady-state conditions showed that circulating sST2 was derived almost equally from hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Increased circulating sST2 in food-allergic mice was possibly and partly derived from fibroblasts stimulated by locally released IL-4 and IL-13. In conclusion, endogenous sST2 contributes to the suppression of food allergies.",

Not all DCIS becomes invasive, and no strategy currently exists in patients to stratify indolent DCIS from DCIS at risk of progression. Several studies of human DCIS and breast cancer suggest that TP53 mutations occur early in DCIS. However, TP53 mutation alone is insufficient for DCIS formation or transformation to invasive disease. Using an autochthonous somatic mouse model of Trp53 R245W induced breast cancer (equivalent to the TP53 R248W hotspot mutation in humans), we identified DCIS lesions. Through exome sequencing and low-pass whole-genome sequencing, we identified additional genomic changes shared between DCIS and invasive tumors. This comparison nominated seven murine candidate genes, with eight human orthologs. We assessed the cooperativity of these genes with mutant TP53 in human breast cells using acinar morphogenesis and migration assays. Overexpression of TMEM267 , which encodes a transmembrane protein overexpressed in 22% of TP53 missense mutant breast cancer cases, in cells with mutant TP53 caused a significant increase in the filled duct, DCIS-like phenotype. We nominate TMEM267 as a cooperating event with mutant TP53 in DCIS progression.",

Here, we identify a dominant population of IL-10 producing, T-bet-expressing Tr1 T cells, residing in the small intestinal lamina propria at homeostasis. Remarkably, these intestinal Tr1 cells emerge at the time of weaning and accumulate independently of the microbiota displaying similar abundance, function, and TCR repertoire under germ-free conditions. Instead, the small intestinal T-bet + Tr1 program is driven and shaped by dietary antigens, and accumulates in a cDC1-IL-27-dependent manner. Upon activation, these cells robustly express IL-10 and multiple inhibitory receptors, establishing a distinct suppressive profile.

The molecular mechanism of how VcINDY physically moves substrates across the membrane, and does so in an energetically efficient manner, is unclear. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments to directly observe the individual mechanistic steps that VcINDY takes to translocate substrates across a lipid bilayer, and then test key predictions of transport cycle mechanistic models. Our data provide the first direct, dynamic evidence that VcINDY undergoes stochastic, elevator-type conformational motions that enable substrate translocation. The dynamics of these elevator motions are approximately an order of magnitude faster than the turnover rate for substrate transport, demonstrating that VcINDY undergoes multiple rounds of substrate translocation before a productive transport cycle is completed. Furthermore, the two protomers of the VcINDY homodimer undergo the substrate translocation motions in a noncooperative manner, and thus likely engage in independent transport reactions. The relative substrate independence of those motions supports the notion that the VcINDY transport cycle maintains strict cosubstrate coupling by a mechanism other than translocation inhibition. Thermodynamic modeling provides insight into how a cooperative binding mechanism is one such generalized approach to optimizing transport for many secondary active transporters.",

This understanding is essential for developing novel targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer, particularly in the context of interactions between pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). However, protein conformational changes that occur during PCCs–PSCs interactions remain poorly studied, and the relationship between these changes and phosphorylation is not well understood. Here, we present a comprehensive mass spectrometry–based study investigating the interplay between protein conformational alterations and phosphorylation in a coculture system of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PANC-1) and PSCs. Our results demonstrate that 435 proteins exhibiting conformational changes were detected during the coculture of PANC-1 with PSCs, primarily involving proteins associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and carbon metabolism. Our findings also highlight a potential association between phosphorylation and protein conformational changes. Moreover, we identified five potential conformational targets, including ACLY, ACO1, ACO2, IDH1, and OGDH, which may provide valuable insights into the molecular pathways underlying gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer. Overall, these results offer insights into protein conformational changes and their potential link to phosphorylation in the context of cancer-stromal cell interactions, paving the way for structure-based, targeted therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer treatment.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate these conflicting pathways remain poorly understood. Through a comprehensive transcriptomic meta-analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana , we show that nitrogen (N) supply and water deficit signaling exhibit overlapping and often opposing gene expression responses. Regulatory network modeling identifies the NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7 (NLP7) transcription factor (TF) as a central integrator of these convergent transcriptional responses. Through combinatorial water deficit and N supply treatments in wild-type and nlp7 mutant plants, we find that NLP7 accounts for 85% of the transcriptional interaction between these pathways. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing and a cell TF assay to detect TF regulation genome-wide reveal that NLP7 directly downregulate the expression of TFs such as HB6 , NAC6 , NAP , and WRKY18 , which are central regulators of water deficit–mediated stress signaling. Repression of these secondary TFs has distinct downstream effects on gene expression, influencing shared and water deficit–specific responses. Loss of NLP7 enhances water deficit tolerance, characterized by increased water retention, reduced abscisic acid-mediated stomatal aperture, and altered expression of stress-responsive genes. These findings establish NLP7 as a central hub balancing growth and stress responses, providing insight into how plants integrate competing environmental cues.",

In this study, we report a role for rNSCs in actively engulfing synapses in the adult hippocampus. Mice in which rNSCs lack the phagocytic receptor MERTK exhibit reduced elimination of excitatory synapses, defective synaptic plasticity, and impaired formation of hippocampal learning and memory, but normal neurogenesis. Furthermore, we show that MERTK-dependent phagocytosis of excitatory synapses by rNSCs contributes to voluntary exercise-induced cognitive enhancements. Together, our data suggest that rNSCs eliminate unnecessary excitatory synaptic connections in the adult hippocampus through MERTK, thereby maintaining circuit connectivity and cognitive function independently of neurogenesis.",

Reddit’s r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created “compositions”, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 min at a false positive rate of just 3.6%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.",

In cell lines, polyserine domains mediate colocalization with tau aggregates and promote formation, suggesting that the cytoplasmic mislocalization of polyserine-containing proteins could contribute to human disease. Moreover, polyserine can be produced by repeat-associated non-AUG translation in CAG repeat expansion diseases. However, whether polyserine expressed in a mammalian brain is toxic and/or can exacerbate tau pathology is unknown. We used AAV9-mediated delivery to express a 42-repeat polyserine protein in wild-type and tau transgenic mouse models. We observe that polyserine expression has toxic effects in wild-type animals indicated by reduced weight, behavioral abnormalities, and a striking loss of Purkinje cells. Moreover, in the presence of a pathogenic variant of human tau, polyserine exacerbates disease markers such as phosphorylated and insoluble tau levels and the seeding capacity of brain extracts. These findings demonstrate that polyserine domains can promote tau-mediated pathology in a mouse model and support the hypothesis that polyserine-containing proteins could contribute to the progression of human tauopathies.",

The development of peripheral neuropathy was assessed in Shmt1 +/− and Shmt1 −/− mice, which are models of human folic acid–responsive NTDs, and diabetic ( Lepr db ) mice to determine whether NTDs and PN have a shared etiology. From 6 wk of age, male and female mice with reduced Shmt1 expression exhibited PN, with greater severity in females compared to males. The neuropathic progression was distinct from diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) observed in Lepr db mice. Excess dietary folic acid prevented PN in both Shmt1 −/− and Lepr db/db mice, whereas dietary uridine caused demyelinating PN in mice independent of genotype and folate status. The transcriptome from L3-L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) exhibited distinct sex-specific differences in glial cell gene expression when comparing Shmt1 +/+ and Shmt1 −/− mice. DRG sensory neurons exhibited changes in the expression of solute carriers and ion channels involved in nociception, neurotransmission, and structural support. We conclude that reduced thymidylate synthesis causes folic acid–responsive NTDs and PN in mice and that diabetes sensitizes mice to folic acid–responsive PN.

          "abstract": "The use of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors provides organisms with a huge amount of available energy but necessitates methods to detoxify reactive intermediates. The mechanisms of NO and O 2 detoxification in many organisms involve flavodiiron proteins (FDPs). Although the proteinaceous ligands that coordinate the diiron active site of these enzymes are well established, its exact coordination environment remains under debate due to conflicting interpretations of crystallographic and spectroscopic/theoretical studies. Using 57 Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS), complemented by Mössbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory, we elucidated the redox-linked structural changes in the FDP from Escherichia coli . The as-isolated diferric state is best described as a dihydroxo-bridged Fe(III)–(μOH − ) 2 –Fe(III) core, which upon reduction converts to a monohydroxo Fe(II)–(μOH − )–Fe(II) center through the loss of one bridging ligand. This ligand rearrangement defines the structural basis for redox-linked reactivity in FDPs. The study further demonstrates that photoreduction of a stable metalloprotein species can occur under NRVS conditions, indicating that synchrotron-based vibrational measurements may induce subtle redox changes even under low photon flux. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting redox-linked ligand dynamics in diiron enzymes and highlight the need to collect damage-free X-ray crystal structures avoiding potential beam-induced reduction. Furthermore, diiron active sites are found in numerous other enzyme classes (e.g., methane monooxygenase), and therefore, our findings have implications way beyond the FDPs.",

          "abstract": "Resource competition strongly shapes microbial community dynamics and functionality. In polysaccharide-degrading communities, primary degraders release hydrolytic enzymes, whereas exploiters consume released products without producing enzyme themselves. We investigate the competitive strategies employed by marine chitin degraders and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) exploiters, revealing various mechanisms that impact community viability and growth dynamics. In addition to direct competition strategies such as antibiotic secretion or cell aggregation on chitin particles (which helps monopolize enzyme access), exploiters also inhibit degraders by diverting limiting GlcNAc flux during the early stages of particle degradation. This critical phase requires degraders to overcome the diffusive loss of GlcNAc to sustain their chitinase production. Through quantitative measurements and modeling, we demonstrate that nutrient competition among species and nutrient loss through diffusion during the initial stages of community dynamics strongly influence the long-term success of the community. The initial community composition dictates the former mechanisms, while the latter is closely related to particle size, both of which have profound implications for environmental carbon cycling. The resulting hypersensitivity of the community is analogous to the Allee effect observed in population biology, where the outcomes—in our case polymer degradation—are heavily dependent on starting conditions. This study sheds light on how metabolic competition in the early phases of particle degradation governs species interactions, resource partitioning, and overall community viability, even under identical environmental and genetic conditions.",

Traditionally, the effective chilling temperatures (ECT) required for dormancy release have been assumed to be fixed, ranging between 0 and 10 °C, based largely on studies in cold climates. However, whether the ECT range varies across diverse climatic regions remains unclear, limiting our ability to predict tree responses to climate change. Here, we quantify ECT variation using controlled experiments on 14 species and long-term phenological observations of 65 species across a ~3,000 km latitudinal gradient in China. Our experimental results show that the estimated upper ECT threshold increases by 0.27 ± 0.06 °C per decreasing degree of latitude, indicating an expansion of the ECT range toward higher temperatures in warmer climates. Our modeling analysis of long-term phenological records supports this trend, showing a comparable increase of 0.18 ± 0.02 °C per decreasing degree of latitude. These findings provide empirical evidence of latitudinal variation in ECT, offering insights into the evolutionary adaptations in shaping tree seasonal growth across diverse climates, challenging the traditional view of a fixed 0 to 10 °C range. Incorporating this adaptive variation into vegetation models and management strategies is crucial for improving predictions of forest phenology, productivity, and resilience under climate warming.",

          "abstract": "The rise of atmospheric oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) (ca. 2.5 to 2.1 billion years ago) permanently transformed Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. The chemistry of contemporaneous marine carbonates provides a window into operation of the carbon cycle across this transition. Specifically, carbonate rocks co-eval with the GOE preserve a large and long-lived positive carbon isotope ( δ 13 C) excursion, the Lomagundi–Jatuli excursion (LJE), that canonically is interpreted as an increase in organic matter burial linked to the oxygenation of Earth’s surface. However, the cause, synchroneity, and global nature of the LJE remain contentious due to significant uncertainties in the excursion’s timing and magnitude. These uncertainties stem from the incomplete, time-uncertain, and spatially variable nature of the shallow-water sedimentary record. Here, we use Bayesian inference to reconstruct Paleoproterozoic δ 13 C from globally distributed stratigraphic observations. Our inference reaffirms that the LJE is a global excursion, although its expression varies locally, and provides revised estimates for its timing and magnitude. We find that δ 13 C most likely began to increase at 2,445 Ma, subsequently returning to baseline values at 2,018 Ma. The most likely excursion peak occurs at 2,130 Ma, and it is very unlikely (5% probability) that peak δ 13 C values exceeded 9.1 ‰ . Altogether, our results indicate the LJE has an earlier onset, longer duration, and lower magnitude than previously thought. The initial δ 13 C increase occurs before or contemporaneously with both the earliest rise of atmospheric O 2 and Paleoproterozoic “snowball” glaciations, hinting at a mechanistic link among the LJE, the GOE, and climate.",

          "abstract": "Gene family expansions are critical for functional diversification, yet the contributions of paralogs to metabolic pathways are often unclear. In Caenorhabditis , the expanded O-acyltransferase (OAC) family—enzymes that transfer acyl groups to hydroxylated substrates—remains poorly characterized despite having been implicated in lipid metabolism. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, behavioral assays, gas chromatographic-mass spectral (GC-MS) analyses, and metabolomics, we systematically analyzed 59 OAC-family protein-coding genes to define their roles in regulating signaling molecules. We found that four adjacent paralogs ( oac-13, oac-16, oac-25, and oac-28 ) on chromosome I are required for synthesizing volatile sex pheromones—airborne signals critical for male mate-searching. Specifically, oac -13 and oac-16 are necessary for producing both major pheromone components, while the identical tandem paralogs oac-25 and oac-28 regulate the production of the later-eluting component in gas chromatography. Disruption of these genes reduced production of key pheromone components and impaired male attraction. Metabolomics revealed that oac-16 and other OACs also modulate the synthesis and secretion of nonvolatile ascaroside pheromones, indicating dual roles in chemical signaling. This work uncovers functional specialization within an expanded gene family, illustrating how redundancy and divergence enable adaptive evolution of communication systems.",

These FLNPs retain robust protein expression comparable to clinical LNPs, while reducing liver accumulation by 94.6%. By integrating fluorine signal quantification with spatial analysis of mRNA translation and antigen presentation, we establish a direct correlation between carrier localization, antigen expression kinetics, and immune cell trafficking. Specifically, we show that antigen-presenting cells internalize FLNP-mRNA at the injection site and subsequently migrate to draining lymph nodes, enabling localized immune priming with minimal systemic exposure. This work provides mechanistic evidence linking in vivo nanocarrier trafficking with spatiotemporal immune activation, offering insights into how delivery kinetics govern vaccine efficacy. The FLNP platform thus enables both precision mRNA delivery and noninvasive tracking, representing a powerful tool for mechanistic studies and rational design of next-generation mRNA vaccines.",

          "abstract": "A major challenge for community ecology is using spatiotemporal data to infer parameters of dynamical models without conducting laborious experiments. We present a framework from statistical physics—Maximum Caliber—to characterize the temporal dynamics of complex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and infer parameters from empirical data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling, Maximum Caliber aims at modeling the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic system, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of the Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from near to far from equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs including random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild predation, and nontransitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches. For spatiotemporal data of species occupancy in a metacommunity, the parameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple logistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, interactions between species, and local environmental suitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes and time periods and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias. We introduce “entropy production” as a measure of irreversibility in system dynamics, and use “pseudo- R 2 ” to characterize predictability of future states. We show that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities that are far from equilibrium. The capacity to estimate basic parameters of dynamical metacommunity models from spatiotemporal data represents an important breakthrough for the study of metacommunities with application to practical problems in conservation and restoration ecology.",

CD8 + T cell populations are reduced, the level of which has emerged as an index of disease severity. Recent work has shown that the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 is a rich reservoir of antimicrobial peptide-like sequence motifs (xenoAMPs) which can chaperone and organize dsRNA for amplified Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that proteolytic digestion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by host trypsin-like serine proteases directly produces xenoAMPs. Synchrotron Small Angle X-ray Scattering, mass spectrometry, and a theoretical analysis based on continuum membrane elasticity show that proteolytically generated xenoAMPs from SARS-CoV-2 proteins in vitro and machine learning-predicted high-scoring xenoAMPs all induce negative Gaussian curvature (NGC) necessary for pore formation in membranes. We find that xenoAMPs alone as well as xenoAMPs synergistically with endogenous AMP LL-37 can induce NGC in membranes. A computational analysis of immune cells with morphologically complex shapes (e.g., pDC, CD8 + , and CD4 + T cells) suggests that surfaces with high local NGC can concentrate AMP-like sequences and promote selective membrane disruption. Consistent with this hypothesis, experiments with freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirm that viable pDCs, DCs, and T cells are significantly depleted after xenoAMP exposure, in contrast to monocytes and neutrophils, the immune cell subsets with spheroidal morphology. Structural data from Omicron variant xenoAMP homologs indicate reduced pore formation, consistent with clinical observations of reduced T cell cytopenia in Omicron variant infections.",

          "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT), leading to its misfolding and aggregation. The subcellular localization of mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates critically influences their neuronal toxicity, with nuclear aggregates contributing more significantly to neurodegeneration than those in the neuropil. Our previous findings demonstrated that site-specific ubiquitination of lysine residues at the positions of K6 and K9 in HTT significantly affect the aggregation properties of mHTT and influence cell viability. However, the in vivo functional relevance of this modification remains elusive. To address this, we generated two HD knock-in (KI) mouse models in which the mouse Htt exon 1 was replaced by human mutant HTT exon 1 containing 134 pure cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeats. In addition, one of these KI lines carries lysine-to-arginine (K &gt; R) substitutions at residues 6 and 9 to block site-specific ubiquitination (Q134 RR line). Compared to Q134 KK control mice, Q134 RR mice showed a more pronounced accumulation of both soluble and aggregated forms of mHTT. Notably, the K &gt; R substitutions accelerated mHTT aggregation kinetics, resulting in the formation of large inclusion bodies and their exclusive nuclear localization. Furthermore, Q134 RR mice exhibited earlier onset and accelerated progression of motor impairments, brain atrophy, and neuropathological features. Collectively, our findings provide strong in vivo evidence for the crucial role of site-specific ubiquitination at K6 and K9 in modulating mHTT aggregation and HD pathology. These results reinforce the therapeutic potential of targeting these specific ubiquitination sites for clinical translation.",

The molecular mechanisms governing infection outcomes remain poorly understood. We identified Peptide A, a highly conserved epitope (residues 442 to 451) within HCV glycoprotein E2, and demonstrated that differential antibody binding patterns to this region correlate with distinct infection outcomes. This immunogenic, nonneutralizing epitope localizes to a structurally exposed region that shares residue 442 as a boundary with the previously characterized Epitope II (residues 430 to 442) and is positioned adjacent to variable region 2 (VR2, residues 460 to 485). Antibodies requiring both F442 and F447 residues within Peptide A for binding emerged early following infection and demonstrated strong correlation with chronic HCV progression. In contrast, antibodies binding exclusively to F447 were associated with spontaneous viral clearance and consistently co-occurred with Epitope II antibodies during later phases of infection. By establishing the relationship between these distinct antibody binding patterns and divergent infection outcomes, our findings elucidate potential HCV immune evasion mechanisms and may facilitate the development of predictive tools for determining chronic versus clearance outcomes early in infection, as well as inform rational vaccine design strategies.",

          "abstract": "The deployment of renewable energy necessitates reliable grid-scale storage technologies. Aqueous metal battery systems are one of the promising candidates due to high safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity of metal anodes, yet their long-term stability is hindered by dendritic growth and parasitic water-induced side reactions. In particular, in the case of aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, high water reactivity at the metal anode results in hydrogen evolution and corrosion in conventional ZnSO 4 aqueous electrolytes. However, restrained water activity often leads to slow charge transport kinetics of solvated cations, limiting the high-rate operation capability of aqueous batteries. Here, we report a gradient composite hydrogel interlayer incorporating vermiculite (VMT) nanosheets within a polyacrylamide polymer matrix to synergistically regulate interfacial water dynamics and stabilize Zn anodes. Abundant hydroxyl groups and negatively charged silicate layers in VMT nanosheets strongly interact with adjacent water molecules, converting free water into bound water to suppress its activity. Charge transport behaviors of Zn ions in the hydrogel interlayer are further improved by rationally tuning the water activity along the depth of the interlayer, resulting in high ion diffusion kinetics close to the bulk electrolyte. Therefore, such a design enables Zn||Zn symmetric cells to stably cycle for over 2,000 h at 5 mA cm −2 and 5 mAh cm −2 , and sustain high current densities up to 40 mA cm −2 . This work brings critical scientific understanding on interfacial water dynamics and highlights its importance for durable metal anode during operation, advancing aqueous batteries toward practical grid-scale energy storage.",

Knowing the social status of others determines how long we look at them and how we engage with them in social interactions. While looking at faces and eyes requires a functionally intact amygdala, hippocampal memories guide the eyes toward socially relevant areas of a visual scene. We examined the local field potentials associated with socially meaningful eye movements in the amygdala and hippocampus of macaques as they watched videos of dominant–subordinate interactions among unfamiliar conspecifics. In both structures, the saccade-related potentials showed status-dependent amplitude modulation in specific frequency bands. In the amygdala, shifting gaze from lower- to higher-status individuals was associated with anticipatory power transients in the 20 to 25 Hz frequency band, whereas gaze shifts from higher- to lower-status individuals were marked by predominantly postsaccadic power transients. Following the gaze of the aggressive, dominant individual induced increased postsaccadic power in the gamma band in both the amygdala and hippocampus, with some variation in frequency depending on whether the saccade landed on the social partner or elsewhere. The timing, frequency, and status-specificity of these power transients reveal the contribution of the amygdala and hippocampus to the visual exploration of social scenes.",

However, the direct effects of compression on neurons and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using multiscale compression systems and physiologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models, we find that chronic mechanical compression induces neuronal apoptosis and loss of synaptic puncta, leading to disrupted neural network activity, as assessed by calcium imaging. This is accompanied by increased HIF-1 signaling and upregulation of downstream stress-adaptive genes in neurons. We further show that chronic compression triggers AP-1–driven gene expression in glial cells, promoting a neuroinflammatory response. Together, these findings reveal that solid stress directly contributes to neuronal dysfunction and inflammation caused by GBM by activating distinct pathways that can be targeted in future studies for neuroprotection.",

These large brains coevolved with metabolic adaptations that enhance cerebral energy supply, including increased circulating glucose levels. While the gut microbiota (GM) is known to influence host metabolism, its potential role in primate brain evolution remains unclear. To investigate this, we inoculated germ-free mice with the GMs of primate species selected to separate the effects of brain size (encephalization) from phylogenetic relatedness: humans (large-brained, Catarrhini), macaques (smaller-brained, Catarrhini), and squirrel monkeys (large-brained, Platyrrhini). We first show that differences in brain gene expression between mice inoculated with human versus macaque GMs resemble those observed between actual human and macaque brains. Comparing the effects of the different primate GMs on mouse brain gene expression further revealed that despite greater evolutionary distance, the GMs from the two larger-brained species (humans and squirrel monkeys) similarly upregulated genes associated with energy production. Notably, human GMs specifically increased the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and these gene expression changes correlated with increased abundances of GM metabolic pathways related to glucose metabolism and gluconeogenesis. Human GMs also downregulated evolutionarily conserved genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Although these are findings based on a small sample of primate species and must be interpreted as preliminary, they suggest that species differences in GM composition can influence brain metabolism and raise the possibility that the GM could have played a supporting role in primate encephalization.",

Considering the brain differences between rodents and humans, the effects of 40-Hz physical stimulation need to be further validated using nonhuman primates before its clinical application. Here, we took advantage of a rare opportunity to expose nine aged rhesus monkeys (26 to 31 y old) to 40-Hz auditory stimulation. Given the strong correlation between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ and Tau concentrations and corresponding AD pathology in brain parenchyma in clinical practice, we investigated the effects of 40-Hz stimulation on AD pathology by monitoring changes in CSF Aβ and Tau concentrations. Our results revealed that 7 consecutive days of 40-Hz auditory stimulation triggered a rapid and significant increase of Aβ levels by more than 200%, but no effect on Tau levels in the CSF. Additionally, we observed that the elevation of CSF Aβ levels persisted for more than 5 wk after cessation, which had not been reported in any previous studies. After this, a pathological examination of the temporal cortices of 4 of the experimental monkeys was carried out and the data demonstrated that all of them had prevalent extracellular Aβ senile plaque pathology, whereas Tau pathology was negative or very weak. These results provide a good explanation for the differences between the CSF Aβ and Tau protein levels. Together, these first-time results from monkeys suggest that 40-Hz auditory stimulation has strong potential of a noninvasive AD treatment method.",

This work provides an understanding of the proton conduction mechanism in CoHBEs based on mixtures of acids and azoles and establishes a link between the structurally dictated transport properties and the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction rates that can be leveraged for enhancing electrochemical reactions. Diffusion and relaxation NMR studies suggest a breaking of the viscosity–conductivity tradeoff, where at high azole concentrations (&gt;45 mol%), Grotthuss transport is more likely with lowered proton transfer energy barriers between the azole and the acid according to the machine learning (ML) accelerated ab initio path integral MD (AI-PIMD) simulations. Proton conduction pathways are found to be switchable between the hydrogen bonding networks of the acid and the azole, with imidazole chain forming structures better facilitating Grotthuss hopping. Supported by small-angle neutron scattering studies, the chains are found to have six member molecules on average with maximum of 3 to 4 imidazole/imidazoliums at 50 to 60 mol%. Despite their high viscosities, the measured PCET rates for quinones and phenazines measured in the protic CoHBEs present relatively high electron transfer rate constants (k 0 ~ 10 − 4 cm/s), validated by rotating disc electrode and scanning electrochemical microscopy measurements. The results demonstrate that strategic tuning of hydrogen-bond donor–acceptor interactions enables the decoupling of proton transport and viscosity, thereby impacting PCET reactions.",

Although dynamic heterochromatin remodeling has been implicated in RS response, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The CHAMP1 complex, composed of CHAMP1, POGZ, HP1α, and the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1, is known to regulate heterochromatin assembly at multiple genomic sites. Interestingly, upon RS, the CHAMP1 complex is transiently recruited to stalled replication forks, where it facilitates H3K9me3 deposition and establishes a repressive chromatin environment. The complex is required for stabilization of replication forks, and it shields forks from MRE11-mediated degradation. The complex also reduces RS at specific chromosomal sites, such as the heterochromatin-rich telomeric sites in tumor cells which use the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance. Loss of the CHAMP1 complex results in increased micronuclei formation and heightened sensitivity to RS. Loss of the complex also leads to a compensatory increase in other pathways which reduce RS, such as the FA pathway and the ATR/CHK1 pathway. Notably, CHAMP1 deficiency induces synthetic lethality with FANCM inhibition in ALT-positive tumor cells, and the CHAMP1 complex is essential for the survival of CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancers. These findings uncover a heterochromatin-based mechanism of replication fork stabilization and suggest that CHAMP1 may represent a candidate therapeutic vulnerability in cancers with elevated RS.",

          "abstract": "The cell surface of gram-negative Escherichia coli is rich in glycoconjugates, including O-antigen (O-Ag) and enterobacterial common antigen polysaccharides, which mediate interactions with the environment. Enzymes called nucleotidyltransferases produce nucleoside diphosphate sugars (NDP-sugars), the precursors to these and many other cellular glycans. Across bacteria, glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases (G1P-Ts) couple deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and glucose-1-phosphate to produce a key secondary metabolite, deoxythymidine diphosphate-glucose (dTDP-Glc). Flux through many glycan biosynthetic pathways is regulated through feedback inhibition at an allosteric site of the conserved bacterial G1P-T RmlA. Here, we sought to address the cellular consequences of G1P-T dysregulation on metabolic flux and E. coli physiology. Expression of a hyperactive RmlA variant in E. coli cells lacking native G1P-Ts abrogated growth, induced morphological defects, and increased sensitivity toward cell division inhibitors. These defects were suppressed through nucleotide supplementation, leading to the hypothesis that growth and division defects result from observed depletion of nucleotide pools required for DNA synthesis. Inspection of nucleotide metabolite compositions in E. coli lysates carrying mutant G1P-T, however, also indicated increased cellular concentrations of the primary metabolite uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-Glc), which is known to block cell division. We found that high intracellular levels of UDP-Glc also unexpectedly halt the expression of O-Ag, which reveals that this metabolite is key for coordinating surface glycan biosynthesis and DNA precursor production prior to cell division. Overall, this work highlights the importance of G1P-T regulation and uncovers additional roles of UDP-Glc as a molecular sensor that mediates diverse bacterial biosynthetic processes.",

          "abstract": "Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) encompasses persistent neurological disease, including olfactory and cognitive dysfunction. The basis for this dysfunction is poorly understood. Here, we report neurological dysfunction for at least 120 d postinfection in mice infected with a virulent nonneurotropic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Long after recovery from nasal infection, we observed diminished tyrosine hydroxylase expression in olfactory bulb glomeruli and in substantia nigra. Similar changes were observed in brains of COVID-19 deceased patients. Vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in these brain areas was accompanied by increased proinflammatory cytokines, and neurobehavioral changes. RNAseq analysis unveiled persistent microglia activation, similar to human neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment with antivirals (nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir) at the time of infection minimally prevented neurological abnormalities, consistent with patient data. In contrast, antivirals plus corticosteroids resulted in nearly complete recovery of neurological function. Remarkably, initiation of combined therapy even three days after infection improved outcomes. Together these results demonstrate that neurological dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice resembles human neurodegenerative disease and indicate that minimizing inflammation early after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be critical for decreasing neurological PASC. The requirement for decreasing inflammation soon after infection may also explain why antiviral therapy has had inconsistent effects in patients.",

          "abstract": "For valuable ammonia synthesis and green nitrogen recycling, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) presents a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber–Bosch process. The NO 3 RR involves intricate, multi-step proton-coupled electron transfers (PCET) featuring multiple nitrogen-oxygen intermediates and reaction branches. Unveiling this complex reaction library is crucial for rational tailoring of NO 3 RR for improved practical application, yet it remains a formidable challenge. Herein we present an in situ ultramicroelectrode-hyphenated mass spectrometry technique to systematically investigate the dynamic electrocatalytic NO 3 RR, using a cobalt-based molecular catalyst as a model system, and to decipher its mechanistic library under complex reaction environments (potential- and pH-dependent). Several key short-lived CoNO x H y intermediates were directly tracked and identified, experimentally revealing that the overall catalytic pathway of NO 3 RR proceeds through the intermediary [LCo-NO 3 ]→[LCo-NO 3 H] + →[LCo-NO 2 ] + → [LCo-NO 2 H] + → [LCo-NO] + → [LCo-NHOH] + → [LCo-NH] + to produce NH 3 , which were further validated by isotopic 15 N-labeling and collision-induced dissociation experiments. Combining theoretical simulations, a complete PCET-based mechanistic pathway was elucidated and distinguished from competing hydrogenation–deoxygenation mechanisms. Notably, a systematically interconnected electrochemical mechanistic library for NO 3 RR, visualized through heat maps, was constructed to illustrate intermediate selectivity across a broad potential-pH space. This platform underscores the promising potential of navigating the pathway prediction and regulation of complex reaction environments, thereby advancing the mechanistic understanding of NO 3 RR and other complicated electrocatalytic processes.",

Type I topoisomerases cleave and religate a single strand of DNA, and little is known about how they regulate HPV pathogenesis. The levels of type I topoisomerases, TOP1α, TOP3α, and TOP3β, were all elevated in cells maintaining high-risk HPV genomes, as well as in squamous cell carcinomas. Only TOP1α and TOP3β, but not TOP3α, bound to HPV genomes and were critical for regulating viral gene transcription and replication with little effect on cell growth. Furthermore, the knockdown of TOP1α or TOP3β reduced levels of DNA breaks and differentially altered the expression of genes in key pathways. TOP1α knockdown reduced the expression of IL6 and activation of the procytokine signaling pathway. In contrast, TOP3β targeted EGR3, which regulates growth and differentiation.

Leveraging longitudinal data from 73 Honduran villages ( N = 15 , 480 individuals) over six years, we use a Linear Network Autocorrelation Modeling framework to disentangle the effects of kinship, friendship, and economic ties on international migration decisions. Our findings reveal that incorporating social network factors as predictors significantly improves model fit. While indicators for resource-sharing processes substantially contribute to model performance, the inclusion of structural comparison mechanisms does not provide additional explanatory power.

While intrinsic drivers are well studied, the role of the surrounding metabolic environment in shaping exhausted CD8 T cells (Tex) is less understood. Using untargeted metabolomics and the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model, we investigated systemic metabolite changes following acute vs. chronic viral infections. We identified distinct short-term and persistent metabolite shifts, with the most significant differences occurring transiently during the early phase of the sustained infection. This included nutrient changes that were partially associated with CD8 T cell–induced anorexia and lipolysis. One remarkable observation was the elevation of medium- and long-chain fatty acids (FA) and acylcarnitines during the first week after chronic infection. Consistently, virus-specific CD8 T cells from chronic infection exhibited increased lipid accumulation and uptake compared to their counterparts from acute infection, particularly the stem-like Tex (Tex STEM ), which generates Tex INT that directly limit viral replication. Notably, only Tex STEM increased oxidative metabolism upon ex vivo FA exposure, while short-term administration of FA during late chronic infection exclusively increased Tex STEM and their mitochondrial potential. The last-mentioned treatment also led to reduced Tex INT and enhanced PD-1 across all Tex subsets, which coincided with compromised viral control. Our study offers a valuable resource for investigating the regulatory role of specific metabolites during acute and chronic viral infections and highlights the potential of FA to fine-tune Tex subsets during protracted infections.",

Correlation analysis of decade-long intervals of interplanetary data permits study of fluctuations at time scales much longer than suitably defined correlation times, and therefore at frequencies well below those associated with the Kolmogorov inertial range of in situ turbulence. At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the 1 / f spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the 1 / f signal. We report properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the 1 / f spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around 5 × 10 − 7 Hz . The presence of a broadband 1 / f spectrum across different wind types supports the interpretation that 1 / f signals may be related to or even originate from the solar dynamo.",

A critical step in many immunobiological studies is the identification of T cells expressing TCRs specific to a given pMHC antigen. However, the intrinsic instability of empty class-I MHCs limits their soluble expression in Escherichia coli and makes it very difficult to characterize even a small fraction of possible pMHC/TCR interactions. To overcome this limitation, we designed small proteins which buttress the peptide binding groove of class I MHCs, replacing β2-microglobulin (β2m) and the heavy chain α3 domain, and enable soluble and partially soluble expression in E. coli of H-2D b and A*02:01, respectively. We demonstrate that these soluble, monomeric, antigen-receptive, truncated (SMART) MHCs retain both peptide- and TCR-binding specificity and that peptide-bound structures of both allomorphs are similar to their full-length, native counterparts. With extension to the majority of HLA alleles, SMART MHCs should be broadly useful for probing the T cell repertoire in approaches ranging from yeast display to T cell staining.",

          "abstract": "For reasons not fully understood, proresolving immune processes sometimes fail to engage after peripheral nerve injury (PNI), leading to enhanced neuropathic pain and inflammation. Here, we implicate reduced efferocytosis due to proteolytic cleavage of surface MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK) from macrophages at the site of PNI. After PNI, the proportion of macrophages expressing MERTK progressively decreased, while soluble (cleaved) MER increased. Using male and female knock-in mice encoding cleavage-resistant Mertk , we demonstrated that cleavage of MERTK from macrophages at the PNI site led to exaggerated pain-related behaviors. PNI-induced hyperactivity of TRPV1 + sensory neurons and damage to myelin and myelinated axons was exacerbated by MERTK cleavage. Cleavage of MERTK led macrophages to adopt a proinflammatory phenotype. It also reduced their efferocytotic capacity, increasing accumulation of TUNEL + (apoptotic) and RIPK3 + (necroptotic) cells at the injury site. The pronociceptive damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) interleukin-33 and heat shock protein-90 were increased, consistent with passive release from uncleared cell corpses. These corpses can also release de novo antigens along with DAMPs to trigger autoimmunity, recently implicated in neuropathic pain through a mechanism involving secretion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Indeed, MERTK cleavage led to accumulation of IgG at the injury site and dorsal root ganglia. All outcomes were further worsened when Mertk was conditionally deleted from macrophages. Our findings identify cleavage of MERTK from macrophages at the injury site as a pivotal regulator of pronociceptive and tissue-damaging neuroimmune signaling after PNI.",

Media content with complex causal structure attenuates network structure effects by encouraging longer exploration of background knowledge. Yet network structure still shapes the narrative content communicated. An embedding-based narrative alignment measure shows that fully connected groups orient their interactions more toward communicating causes of an event, whereas locally connected networks emphasize the event’s effects. A group’s network structure also influences representational and language change in personal narratives: participants in fully connected networks showed the largest increase in causal language in personal narratives written after interaction, which also orient more around the narrative’s causal events.",

          "abstract": "Big data approaches to discovering nongenetic risk factors have lagged behind genome-wide association studies that routinely uncover novel genetic risk factors for diverse diseases. Instead, epidemiology typically focuses on candidate risk factors. Since modern biobanks contain thousands of potential risk factors, candidate approaches may introduce bias, inadequately control for multiple testing, and overlook important signals. Doublethink, a model-averaged hypothesis testing approach, offers a solution that simultaneously controls the Bayesian false discovery rate (FDR) and frequentist familywise error rate (FWER) while accounting for uncertainty in variable selection. Here, we investigate direct risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization from among 1,912 variables in 201,917 UK Biobank participants by implementing a Doublethink-based exposome-wide association study using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Focusing on the 2020 outbreak, we find nine individual variables and seven groups of variables exposome-wide significant at 9% FDR and 0.05% FWER. We identify significant direct effects among relatively overlooked risk factors including aging, dementia, and prior infection, which we evaluate in relation to studies of other populations. We detect significant direct effects among some commonly reported risk factors like age, sex, and obesity, but not others like cardiovascular disease. The effects of hypertension, depression, and diabetes appeared to be mediated via general comorbidity. Doublethink produces interchangeable posterior odds and P -values for individual variables and arbitrary groups, facilitating flexible and powerful post hoc hypothesis testing. We discuss the potential for impact and limitations of joint Bayesian-frequentist hypothesis testing, including the benefits of an agnostic exposome-wide approach to discovery.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables haploid cells to be self-fertile and mate with their own mitotic descendants (homothallism). Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here, we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,910 strains shows that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.",

          "abstract": "During the development of the rice female gametophyte (FG, embryo sac), there exists a free-nuclear stage wherein eight nuclei, originating from the same mother cell nucleus, respectively migrate to specific positions to acquire distinct cell identities after cellularization and develop into the egg cell, central cell, or accessory cells. Therefore, this nuclear migration stage is essential for fertilization and rice fertility. How these nuclei can find their own way to exactly move to different predetermined positions and how the two polar nuclei are selected have been intriguing questions for decades. Here, we show that a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, composed of OsMEKK2/OsMEKK21, OsMKK6, and OsMPK4, precisely regulates free-nuclear migration and determines the number and identities of polar nuclei. Specifically, OsMKK6 phosphorylates OsMPK4 to restrict nuclear migration at the chalazal pole, ensuring the accurate number and positioning of antipodal cells and polar nuclei. Loss-of-function mutations in OsMKK6 and OsMPK4 result in an excess of polar nuclei at the expense of antipodal cells. Additionally, OsMEKK2 and OsMEKK21 function as upstream regulators, phosphorylating and modulating downstream substrates to control nuclear migration at both poles. This regulation is essential for FG fertility and seed production. Our findings reveal a hierarchical model for the regulation of nuclear migration during embryo sac development and provide valuable insights into how an embryo sac orchestrates the migration of eight nuclei in response to different positional cues, thereby establishing female fertility in rice.",

Dietary perturbations over reproduction can impair offspring development and increase the risk of metabolic disease for the mother. However, how the intake of specific macronutrients, independent of total calorie intake, influence maternal reproductive investment and metabolic health remains poorly understood. To understand the role of protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake in influencing these parameters, we fed mice one of ten isocaloric diets that differed systematically in their macronutrient make-up. We allowed females to breed and observed striking effects of different macronutrients on fetal development, with protein intake having strong positive effects on offspring survival, accompanied by major shifts in the morphological structure of the placenta and placental lactogen production. However, maternal glucose tolerance was strongly impaired by high protein intake during pregnancy, with reproductive females more susceptible to the effects of these macronutrients than nonpregnant animals. Strikingly, metabolic effects were reversed after lactation, with mothers developing a resilience to the chronic effects of protein and fat intake on glucose tolerance observed in virgin animals. During lactation, we also observed that offspring development was optimized by a different ratio of macronutrients compared to during pregnancy. These results highlight the importance of optimizing macronutrient, particularly protein, intake to specific levels during pregnancy, ensuring a balance that maintains maternal glucose tolerance while providing sufficient nutrients to ensure healthy offspring growth and survival.",

          "abstract": "Metals usually fracture catastrophically at cryogenic temperatures and soften rapidly at high temperatures. This dilemma arises from the incompatibility of strengthening mechanisms across vast temperature regimes. Here, this work unveils a self-adaptive dislocation morphing mechanism in a model NbTaTi-based refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) that enables exceptional strength and ductility from 4 K to 1673 K. At cryogenic temperatures, dislocation kinking coupled with deformation twinning suppresses the ductile-to-brittle transition. At ambient conditions, the sequential activation of edge and screw dislocations sustains work hardening. At elevated temperatures, enhanced dislocation interactions generate jogs, multijunctions, and helical dislocations, promoting superplasticity up to 250%. This intrinsic, temperature-responsive evolution of dislocation modes offers a defect engineering strategy for designing RHEAs capable of enduring extreme environments.",

          "abstract": "Wildfires significantly alter soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), reducing microbial richness and biomass, while selecting for “fire-loving” pyrophilous microbes that drive postfire nutrient cycling. However, the genomic strategies and functional trade-offs (balancing gains in one trait with costs in another) underlying the traits that enable pyrophilous microbes to survive and thrive postfire are virtually unknown. We hypothesized that pyrophilous fungi employ specialized genomic adaptations for C and N cycling, with evolutionary trade-offs between traits governing aromatic C degradation, N acquisition pathways, and rapid growth. To test these hypotheses, we performed complementary comparative genomics, transcriptomics after pyrogenic organic matter amendment, and growth rate bioassays for 18 pyrophilous fungi from five Ascomycota (Eurotiales, Pleosporales, Sordariales, Coniochaetales, and Pezizales) and three Basidiomycota (Agaricales, Holtermanniales, and Geminibasidiales) orders isolated from burned soils. We found a dramatic trait trade-off between fast growth and number of genes responsible for aromatic C degradation, implying burned environments select for metabolically costly genes despite their evolutionary cost. We used the comparative genomics framework to evaluate genomic signatures of evolution and found that either gene duplication and somatic mutation, or recombination via sexual reproduction, were the primary drivers of fungal genomic variation in aromatic C degradation and N acquisition genes. Finally, we identified cross-kingdom bacterial to fungal horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as a secondary strategy producing novel aromatic C degradation genes. Overall, we found that trait trade-offs and genome evolutionary strategies are key drivers that may predict the persistence and contribution of pyrophilous fungi to global C and N cycling.",

Patients may progress from steatosis alone to complications such as fibrosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The cause of progression is unclear. We previously showed that liver stiffening can drive fibrosis. However, the mechanical contributions of hepatic lipid and especially cholesterol accumulation are not known. We used rat dietary models to investigate how lipid accumulation affects liver mechanics. Liver stiffness was measured using rheology and magnetic resonance elastography, and associations between stiffness and lipid droplets (LDs) or cholesterol-containing lipid crystals were measured by microindentation-visualization. Polarized light, confocal reflection, and cryo–electron microscopy were employed to assess crystal abundance and structure. LDs and crystals extracted from livers were embedded in fibrous tissue mimics to isolate mechanical effects away from inflammation or fibrosis. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin perfusion was performed to assess whether cholesterol depletion reduced crystal abundance and tissue stiffness. Increased hepatic cholesterol storage led to the formation of cholesterol-containing lipid crystals in the liver. Steatotic livers with crystals stiffened before fibrosis while steatotic livers without crystals did not stiffen or fibrose. Lipid crystals stiffened tissue mimics while LDs did not, suggesting that crystals directly cause stiffening. Cholesterol depletion reduced crystal abundance and reverted tissue stiffness to near controls without changing inflammation, suggesting key roles for cholesterol in tissue stiffening. Lipid crystals cause profibrogenic liver stiffening, connecting high dietary cholesterol to MASLD progression, and may be a target for new diagnostic tools and therapeutics for progressive MASLD.",

Here, we present a framework for estimating pathogen resilience based on how fast epidemic patterns return to their prepandemic dynamics. By analyzing time series data from Hong Kong, Canada, Korea, and the United States, we quantify the resilience of common respiratory pathogens and further predict when each pathogen will eventually return to its prepandemic dynamics. Our predictions are able to distinguish which pathogens should have returned already, and deviations from these predictions reveal long-term impacts of pandemic perturbations. We find a faster rate of susceptible replenishment underlies pathogen resilience and sensitivity to both large and small perturbations. Overall, our analysis highlights the persistent nature of common respiratory pathogens compared to vaccine-preventable infections, such as measles.",

In this study, we found that USP25 exacerbated dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits in murine models of PD by sabotaging the mitophagy machinery. USP25 physically interacted with the autophagy receptor optineurin and disrupted its linkage with K63-specific polyubiquitin chains, leading to impaired mitophagy and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP25 significantly restored mitophagy and thereby impeded the neurodegenerative progression in PD model mice. Collectively, our results unravel a pivotal role of USP25 in PD and identify USP25 as a pharmacological target for the development of PD drugs.",

          "abstract": "For thousands of years, humans have domesticated animals and cultivated crops by managing reproduction and selecting for desirable traits. In contrast, microbial domestication has often occurred unintentionally, and the variation of life cycle as well as its impact on genome evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically examined life cycle variation across a diverse panel of 771 diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates from both wild and domesticated lineages. We identified widespread alterations in sexual reproduction, including impairments of sporulation, spore viability, and mating-type switching. These changes led to the emergence of two distinct life cycle strategies, favoring either asexual or sexual reproduction, which were notably enriched in domesticated clades. Haplotype analyses of the HO mating-type switching gene revealed multiple, independent loss-of-function mutations, indicating convergent evolution of heterothallism. While a preference for sexual life cycle often correlated with increased genomic heterozygosity in domesticated and human-associated clades, this relationship was not uniform across all lineages. We propose that the co-occurrence of altered sexual and asexual cycle preferences results in a trade-off that balances outcrossing and the subsequent maintenance of heterozygosity in domesticated populations. Finally, we provide a CRISPR-based molecular toolbox and a stable haploid strain collection spanning global genetic diversity, enabling further genetic research and industrial applications.",

LPL unfolding results in loss of catalytic activity and the detachment of LPL from the surface of cells. An APOA5 truncation mutation (identified in two patients with hypertriglyceridemia) had suggested that the last 35 amino acids of APOA5 are important for its function. We reasoned that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against carboxyl-terminal sequences in APOA5 could clarify functionally important amino acid residues in APOA5 and assist in elucidating the mechanism by which APOA5 regulates plasma triglyceride metabolism. Because carboxyl-terminal APOA5 sequences are evolutionarily conserved, we began by screening a human Fab bacteriophage library for binders of carboxyl-terminal APOA5 sequences. We identified one such binder and used phage DNA sequences to build a chimeric IgG 1 mAb (IBA707) against APOA5. The binding of IBA707 to APOA5 was abolished by nonconservative amino acid substitutions in conserved sequences (residues L337–I348) within a C-terminal α-helix in APOA5. The same substitutions disrupted APOA5’s ability to bind and inhibit ANGPTL3/8 activity. IBA707-mediated blockade of APOA5 function reduced intracapillary LPL levels and triggered elevated plasma levels of triglycerides and ANGPTL3/8 in both fasted and refed mice. IBA707 was cleared rapidly from the plasma in Apoa5 +/+ mice but slowly in Apoa5 –/– mice. Our studies identified functionally important amino acids in APOA5 and revealed that APOA5 controls plasma triglyceride metabolism in part by modulating plasma levels of ANGPTL3/8.",

CINs have been classically viewed as a random and homogeneous population, but recent evidence suggests heterogeneity in their anatomical and functional organization. Here, using systematic mapping and quantitative spatial analyses, we found that—contrary to current dogma—CINs exhibited striking enrichment and nonrandom clustering in the striosome compartment, particularly in the lateral striatum. Similar analyses carried out for parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons revealed that compartmental organization is interneuron specific. The strong “striosome preference” exhibited by CINs was confined within striosome borders, not extending to the surrounding matrix. We further found that striosome and matrix CINs differed in their expression levels of phospho-S6 ribosomal protein-Ser240/244 and choline acetyltransferase, suggesting functional differences, and clustered CINs differed from unclustered CINs in their intrinsic membrane properties. Finally, CINs expressing Lhx6, which defines a distinct γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) coreleasing population, were notably absent from regions where highly clustered striosomal CINs appeared. Collectively, our findings uncover important dimensions of CIN organization, suggesting that modulation of regional and compartmental striatal output may depend upon the spatial–functional heterogeneity of CINs.",

          "abstract": "Traditional entropy-based methods—such as cross-entropy loss in classification problems—have long been essential tools for representing the information uncertainty and physical disorder in data and for developing artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous datasets with intrinsic disparities. To address this, we introduce a zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN), extending zentropy theory into the data science domain via intrinsic entropy, enabling more effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. ZENN simultaneously learns both energy and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of multisource data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives. In image and text classification tasks, ZENN demonstrates superior generalization by introducing a learnable temperature variable that models latent multisource heterogeneity, allowing it to surpass state-of-the-art models on CIFAR-10/100, BBC News, and AG News. As a practical application in materials science, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy landscape of Fe 3 Pt using data generated from density functional theory and capture key material behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the temperature–pressure space. Overall, this work presents a zentropy-grounded framework for data-driven machine learning, positioning ZENN as a versatile and robust approach for scientific problems involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.",

          "abstract": "The theory of sex allocation is hailed as one of evolutionary biology’s great successes. But while it has successfully predicted strategies of resource allocation to male versus female offspring under a wide range of conditions in species with separate sexes, it has been difficult to verify the fundamental assumption of a direct genetic trade-off between male and female allocations when both sexes are expressed together in the same individuals. This trade-off assumption supposes that mutations that increase an individual’s male allocation reduce its female allocation, and vice versa. Here, we use experimental evolution to generate wide variation in sex allocation in a wind-pollinated annual plant. We demonstrate a clear trade-off between the two sexual functions over time, with populations repeatedly evolving increased male and correspondingly reduced female allocation. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis performed on multiple crosses further reveals the segregation of allelic variation at “trade-off loci.” Taken together, our results demonstrate a genetic trade-off in sex allocation in hermaphrodites and provide compelling evidence for sex-allocation trade-off loci. Our study thus verifies the fundamental assumption of sex-allocation theory and secures its general applicability to both dioecious and hermaphroditic species.",

Here, we report a recoding scheme for the 205 kb Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, and serine, all of which have two cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs), are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native sequence without affecting expression of a reporter protein or strain fitness under standard laboratory conditions. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1 , encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA , intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction center subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and nonessential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of Rubisco, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codons were recovered. For all recoded genes, viable homoplasmic lines were obtained, showing the efficacy of our codon compression scheme.",

Overcoming the intrinsic, chemistry- and topography-governed wetting behaviors often requires specific materials which limits applicability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet spreading and wicking on hydrophilic patterns can be controlled by the vapor of a lower-surface-tension liquid. Condensation of the vapor induces Marangoni forces that delay capillary wicking and contract liquid into a droplet on top of the imbibed film. Thereby, macroscopic droplets can be maintained in an apparent partial wetting state, effectively cloaking the pattern. We quantify how pattern characteristics and vapor condensation compete, balancing in different wetting states from pinning to complete imbibition. Since this balance is the result of nonequilibrium processes rather than static wetting phenomena, it can be reversibly tuned by modifying the vapor concentration. This way, we guide droplets across patterns and even extract previously imbibed liquids, devising strategies for coating, cleaning, and drying functional surfaces.",

          "abstract": "Skeletal muscle fibrosis, as occurs with age, in response to injury, or in the setting of degenerative diseases, results in impairments of muscle regeneration and function. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), a distinct population of muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitor cells that reside in the muscle interstitium, play a crucial role in normal muscle regeneration by supporting muscle stem cell proliferation. However, in pathological conditions such as severe or recurrent muscle injury, FAPs can aberrantly differentiate into fibrogenic cells, resulting in excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and fibrosis. In this study, we explore the molecular regulation of FAP differentiation along the fibrogenic lineage to gain insights into the mechanisms of fibrosis in aged muscle in response to injury. Our findings reveal that aging is associated with an increased expression of the complement component 1q (C1q) in muscle-resident macrophages and elevated expression of the complement proteins C1r and C1s in FAPs. Exposure of proliferating FAPs to C1q results in the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, elevated expression of collagen genes, and FAP fibrogenic differentiation, leading to increased tissue fibrosis. We demonstrate that either pharmacological inhibition of the complement pathway or genetic ablation of C1s in FAPs in aged mice reduces fibrogenic differentiation of FAPs by suppressing Wnt signaling. This reduction in FAP differentiation attenuates the fibrotic response to injury in aged animals as well as in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy. Our study supports the inhibition of complement signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating fibrosis in skeletal muscle injury or degeneration.",

Using a network framework, we aimed to identify specific socioeconomic and psychological factors associated with differences in infant brain development. We find that mothers who report to be income insufficient were more likely to have lower educational attainment, report low-income, experience higher levels of stress, and encounter more adverse life events. Controlling for these variables, income insufficiency was specifically associated with delayed brain development in the first year of life; infants developing in a household where parents felt their income was inadequate to support the family’s needs exhibited slower rates of change in alpha peak frequency, alpha power, and beta power. Together, these findings provide a framework of understanding and visualizing how early adversity impacts neurodevelopment and provides evidence for the potential utility of maternal income sufficiency as an additional screening tool to accelerate identification of populations most vulnerable and in need for early intervention.",

          "abstract": "Gender stereotypes, defined as widely shared beliefs about the typical attributes of women and men, have far-reaching consequences for both stereotyped groups. This preregistered research examined cross-cultural variation in gender stereotypes based on public opinion poll data from 1995 (22 nations with 22,000 respondents) and 2023 (40 nations with 4,800 respondents). Results revealed that men were perceived as more agentic than women and women as more communal than men in all studied nations at both time points. Yet, substantial cross-cultural variation existed in the strength of these stereotypes whereby the communion stereotype in particular related to the distribution of women and men into social roles. The female advantage in communion was stronger the larger women’s share in the labor force and the greater the occupational sex segregation, both reflecting women’s employment primarily in communal domains. The male advantage in agency likely reflects that women’s considerable inroads into leader roles put them in versions of the role entailing lesser status and power and therefore conveying lesser agency. For competence, most respondents believed that women and men are equally competent in 17 of the 23 nations surveyed in 1995 and in all 40 nations surveyed in 2023. These beliefs in competence equality were stronger in nations with greater female educational attainment and labor force participation (in 2023 but not in 1995). By identifying cross-cultural patterns and socioeconomic indicators associated with variation in gender stereotyping, this research advances understanding of how the locations of women and men in nations’ social structures inform gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL) is characterized by amyloid fibril deposition in multiple organs, often severely affecting cardiac function. In this study, we extracted amyloid fibrils directly from abdominal fat and cardiac tissue biopsies obtained from three AL patients. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined five distinct structures of light chain (LC) amyloid fibrils. Our results demonstrate that LC fibrils from different patients adopt unique structural conformations, highlighting patient-specific fibril variations. Conversely, LC fibrils extracted from different tissues within the same patient share highly similar overall fibril structures, yet exhibit localized conformational variations, potentially shaped by distinct environmental cofactors. This study emphasizes the combined roles of patient-specific protein sequences and tissue-specific microenvironments in defining LC fibril conformation. The determination of LC fibril structures directly from easily accessible abdominal fat biopsy provides critical molecular insights into AL amyloidosis pathology, facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "Prenatal brain activity has long lasting effects on subsequent neurodevelopment. It is unclear if early brain activity is dominated by cell intrinsic, synaptic, or nonsynaptic mechanisms. We address this question by analyzing Caenorhabditis elegans embryo behavior in snf-11 mutants, which lack a plasma membrane GABA reuptake pump (orthologous to GAT1). At 510 to 570 min postfertilization, embryo motion was transiently and potently inhibited in snf-11 GAT1 mutants, which precedes formation of most nerve ring synapses. This transient motion inhibition requires GABA synthesis in DD motor neurons and UNC-49 GABA A receptors in body muscles. When motion inhibition occurs, DD neurons have not yet completed neurite outgrowth. Genetic analysis suggests that motion inhibition was mediated by both synaptic and tonic GABA release from DD motor neurons. These results suggest that DD neurons control embryo behavior prior to completing their developmental maturation.",

We present a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of Sudanese populations, analyzing high-coverage genomes (~30×) from 125 individuals representing five ethnolinguistic groups across three language families. Our results reveal deep population structure, involving Nilo-Saharan, West Eurasian, Northern African, and Western African ancestral components, as well as signatures of the Arab expansion. We report over one million novel variants, including population-specific deleterious alleles, highlighting the need for broader African genomic representation. Notably, local ancestry inference reveals a strong signal of adaptive admixture on chromosome 1 in Sudanese Copts, marked by a peak of Nilo-Saharan ancestry introduced via genetic admixture 1,000 to 1,500 y ago. At this locus, we estimate a remarkably strong selection coefficient (s = 0.0996) for SNP rs2814778 within the ACKR1 gene, which is responsible for the Duffy-null blood group that provides resistance to Plasmodium vivax malaria. These findings reveal Sudan as a genomic mosaic shaped by ancient and recent migrations and provide clear evidence of admixture-driven adaptation in an understudied region of Africa.",

          "abstract": "Gene delivery has emerged as a groundbreaking technique for altering gene expression, offering new possibilities in treating a vast array of diseases. We report a layer-by-layer elastin-like polypeptide nucleic acid nanoparticle (LENN) system for mRNA delivery as an attractive alternative to viral vectors and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems. This study focuses on determining the physical characteristics of LENN bearing mRNA cargo and assessing their biological performance in T24 bladder tumor cells. Our data show that mRNA encoding luciferase forms stable 30 to 130 nm LENN particles via batch mixing to efficiently encapsulate the mRNA strands, are resistant to heparin challenge, and are capable of storage at −20 °C for 3 d as lyophilized powders while retaining full biological activity after rehydration. We also demonstrate that LENN targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can efficiently deliver the mRNA cargo to the cytosol of EGFR+ T24 human bladder cancer cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis where it is translationally active. Lipid profiling analyses show the significant role that upregulated phospholipid biosynthesis plays in nanoparticle internalization and endosomal escape compared to untargeted LENN, indicating the importance of the clathrin pathway in contributing to the delivery efficiency of LENN. Endocytosis inhibition experiments further support the involvement of the clathrin pathway. These findings highlight the compelling features of LENN with respect to their size, in vitro and in vivo targetability, mRNA encapsulation efficiency, complex stability, gene expression, and “green” manufacturability, offering an attractive alternative to existing methods for gene delivery.",

Here, this study revealed that L-lactic acid promotes host immune response and inhibits viral infection by inducing Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) L-lactylation. We first found L-lactylation modification (L-Kla) of IRF9 mediated by AARS1. Further studies demonstrated that IRF9 L-lactylation potentiates type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling by promoting IRF9–STAT2 interaction, thereby boosting antiviral immune response. Intriguingly, L-lactic acid exhibits dual effects on viral infection: L-lactic acid exhibits antiviral effects at physiological and moderately elevated levels but proviral effects at high levels. Furthermore, we found that the viruses can achieve immune evasion by promoting SIRT1-mediated delactylation of IRF9. Interestingly, we uncovered that metformin promotes IRF9 L-lactylation by both accumulating lactic acid and disrupting virus-induced IRF9–SIRT1 interaction. These findings renew the understanding of the roles of lactic acid in antiviral immune response and determine metformin’s immunomodulatory effects on antiviral immunity through regulating IRF9 L-lactylation.",

          "abstract": "Culture has been a central concept in the social sciences for well over a century. Yet, a theory of culture with an associated measurement model providing the means to systematically study its effects has proven elusive. Developments in cognitive culture theory over the past several years provide a new perspective and a new set of tools. Culture can be conceptualized as a set of shared cognitive models that encode the information required for individuals to function in a given social setting. These cultural models can be elicited and examined in detail using the methods of cultural domain analysis, and the cultural consensus model (CCM) can be used to test for sharing and to describe variation in culture. Using the results of cultural consensus analysis as a foundation, cultural consonance can be measured for individuals. Cultural consonance is the degree to which individuals, in their own behaviors, approximate the prototypes for behavior encoded in cultural models. Cultural consonance thus extends cognitive culture theory to an examination of culture expressed in behavior. In this article, this theoretical and methodological orientation is presented, and some implications of its empirical examination are discussed.",

Here, we covalently link variant proteins in vivo to an RNA barcode by fusing them to Escherichia coli tRNA (m 5 U 54 ) methyltransferase TrmA (E358Q). This methyltransferase mutant forms a covalent bond with a tRNA T-arm stem-loop sequence, which we embed in an RNA along with a unique barcode. Following cell lysis, variant proteins are separated in vitro according to their biochemical properties and identified by sequencing their covalently linked barcodes. The in vitro assays can be carried out in highly denaturing conditions, such as 8 M urea, due to the covalent RNA–protein linkage. We use this method, Dosa, to analyze a large pool of FLAG epitope variants for binding to an anti-FLAG–antibody, to profile substrate variants for their cleavage by enteropeptidase and human rhinovirus 3C protease, and to measure the solubility of several hundred Aβ(1-42) variants.

In most animal clades, sex-determining mechanisms are highly diverse and evolve rapidly. Here, we identify an exception in aculeate Hymenoptera, an ancient and diverse clade of haplodiploid insects that includes ants, bees, and stinging wasps. By integrating comparative genomics across Hymenoptera with genetic mapping in bumblebees and hornets, we reveal that the ANTSR locus, a multiallelic noncoding locus, has been maintained for over 150 My as the primary instructive signal for female development. This locus is located in a conserved synteny block that originated at the base of Aculeata and functions as a highly polymorphic, zygosity-based sex determiner, with only heterozygous individuals developing as females across lineages. Despite its deep evolutionary conservation, this sex locus shows no detectable sequence homology among lineages. These findings demonstrate that an essential noncoding locus can retain its function over deep evolutionary time without sequence conservation. More broadly, our results highlight haplodiploid insects as a powerful model for studying the evolution of sex determination mechanisms beyond those linked to sex chromosomes.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the geographic spread of emerging respiratory viruses is critical for pandemic preparedness, yet the early spatiotemporal dynamics of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the United States remain unclear. While mobility and genomic data have revealed important aspects of pandemic spatial spread, several key questions remain: Did the two pandemics follow similar spatial transmission routes? How rapidly did they spread across the United States? What role did stochastic processes play in early spatial transmission? To address these questions, we integrated high-resolution disease data with a robust, data-efficient inference framework combining air travel, commuting flows, and pathogen superspreading potentials to reconstruct their spatial spread across US metropolitan areas. The two pandemics exhibited distinct transmission pathways across locations; however, both pandemics established local circulation in most metropolitan areas within weeks, driven by several shared transmission hubs. Early spatial spread was more strongly associated with air travel than with commuting, though stochastic dynamics introduced substantial uncertainty in transmission routes, creating challenges for timely detection and control. Simulations indicate that broad wastewater surveillance coverage beyond top transmission hubs coupled with effective infection control may slow initial spatial expansion. Our findings highlight the rapid, stochastic spread of pandemic respiratory pathogens and the difficulties of early outbreak containment.",

          "abstract": "A subset of the four-pass transmembrane proteins called C8 tetraspanins (TspanC8) can bind and promote the cell surface localization of ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10). ADAM10 is a conserved transmembrane metalloprotease essential for metazoan embryonic development and human health. However, the in vivo functional relationships between C8 tetraspanins and ADAM10 are not fully understood. Caenorhabditis elegans has two paralogous tetraspanins, TSP-12 and TSP-14, that resemble the mammalian TspanC8 proteins. We have previously shown that TSP-12/TspanC8 can bind SUP-17/ADAM10 and promote its cell surface localization in early embryos. In this study, we identified the specific step in the secretory pathway where TSP-12–SUP-17 interaction is needed. We found that TSP-12 and SUP-17 share a mutually dependent, yet cell type– and developmental stage–specific relationship in their Golgi trafficking itinerary. In the early embryo, TSP-12 and SUP-17 depend on each other for their transit through the Golgi. However, only SUP-17 is required for proper Golgi trafficking of TSP-12 in the developing oocytes. We further showed that the ER accumulation of SUP-17 in embryos lacking TSP-12 is mediated by the Retention in Endoplasmic Reticulum 1 protein RER-1. These findings, combined with our previous work showing that TSP-12 and TSP-14 function redundantly in endosomes for the recycling of the type II receptor of the BMP signaling pathway, showcase the dynamic and versatile functions of TSP-12 in membrane trafficking in specific cellular contexts. They further highlight the importance of dissecting the functional relationships between TspanC8 proteins and ADAM10 in vivo.",

          "abstract": "The chemical modification N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) is catalyzed by the m 6 A methyltransferase complex (MTC) comprising METTL3 and METTL14 in the nucleus. Structural evidence reveals that METTL3 primarily functions as the catalytic core, while METTL14 serves as an RNA-binding scaffold. However, the mechanism directing the complex assembly in vivo remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that MTC is formed by a cotranslational mechanism in which nascent METTL3 interacts with METTL14 polypeptide chain exposed from the ribosome exit tunnel. The methyltransferase domains in the subunits determine the specificity of their cotranslational interaction. In contrast, WTAP, the regulatory subunit of MTC, is recruited to the complex posttranslationally. We further identify CCT4, the key subunit of cytosolic chaperonin TCP-1, as an essential facilitator of the endogenous MTC assembly process. Depletion of CCT4 results in dramatic reduction of METTL3–METTL14 heterodimer formation. Remarkably, we engineer a cell-permeable peptide M14P1, which could disrupt cotranslational assembly of MTC, thereby impairing m 6 A deposition and significantly attenuating the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and promoting apoptosis. Collectively, our findings unravel intrinsic mechanisms governing the in vivo assembly of MTC, and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to disrupt oncogenic m 6 A pathways and impede AML progression.",

          "abstract": "Aging is associated with the decline of many bodily functions including motor coordination. Aging-related impairment in motor coordination can result in falls, which reduce independence, health span, and quality of life in the elderly. To study the neural mechanisms that underlie this decline, we studied aged mice and observed a progressive decline in motor coordination on multiple motor coordination assays. The cerebellum is critically involved in motor coordination and balance, and cerebellar Purkinje cells play an important role in modulating motor output and coordinated movements. Purkinje cells fire high-frequency and high-regularity action potentials in healthy young adult mice. We wondered whether this firing remained stable across lifespan in aging mice. We performed juxtacellular recordings from Purkinje cells in acute cerebellar slices and observed a reduction in the rate of firing in aged animals without changes in firing regularity. To understand whether reduced Purkinje cell firing rate caused impaired motor performance in aged mice, we used chemogenetics to modulate Purkinje cell firing. Reducing Purkinje cell firing rates in young mice impaired motor performance, while elevating Purkinje cell firing rates in aged mice improved motor performance. Our results suggest that Purkinje cell firing rate impacts motor coordination and that the aging-related reduction of Purkinje cell firing rate that we observed contributes to impaired motor coordination and could contribute to declining health span and quality of life in the elderly.",

Here, we explored the condensation transition and pretransitional behavior of an archetypal system consisting of polyuridylic acid chains (PolyU) and short cationic peptides in buffered aqueous solutions. By combining static and dynamic light scattering with confocal microscopy, we determined the location of the transition and the partitioning of PolyU and peptides between the coexisting phases as a function of the total peptides/PolyU ratio. We find that upon adding peptides in the system, the size of PolyU coils in the single-phase region is progressively reduced by peptide-mediated intrachain bonds. Such conformational constraints become less severe in the dense phase, where part of the bonds become interchain as indicated by the sticky-reptation-type kinetics observed by dynamic light scattering. We propose a phenomenological model in which we include the loss in PolyU conformational entropy induced by peptide decoration and show that this quantity is large enough to be the main driver of the condensation transition. The model well reproduces the observed molecular partitioning between phases. We argue that the role of coil conformational relaxation, here demonstrated for a specific system, might be of general relevance in complex coacervation.",

We examined the impact of gene deletion of MIF or its cognate receptor CD74 in the T cell–dependent model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and observed the complete absence of arthritis development, suggesting an unforeseen role for MIF/CD74 signaling in the development of arthritogenic T cells. While MIF has been shown in model systems to contribute to T cell activation by augmenting innate responses, fewer than 1% of T lineage cells express CD74 in naive spleens and lymph nodes, and its functional consequences in pathogenic T cell subpopulations have not been studied. We found CD74+ T cells to expand during CIA and to increase in number within joint synovium, where they express an effector memory phenotype and recapitulate CIA development upon transfer into naive mice. We further found evidence for the presence of CD74+ T cells in the circulation and joint synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

          "abstract": "CatSper serves as the primary Ca 2+ entry pathway in the principal piece of sperm flagellum and is crucial for sperm motility and fertility. Sperm lacking functional CatSper channels fail to undergo hyperactivation during fertilization, leading to complete male infertility. Along the longitudinal axis of the sperm flagellum, staggered CatSper complexes align in a hand-in-hand arrangement, forming a distinctive quadrilinear zigzag arrays known as CatSper nanodomains. However, the molecular details of how CatSper oligomerizes to form such higher-order assembly remain unclear. In this study, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of native CatSper dimer (~1.5 MDa) and trimer (~2.3 MDa) megacomplexes, which represent the fundamental units of the zigzag array. We reveal the overall configuration of the zigzag assembly by characterizing the two distinct dimer interfaces that mediate CatSper oligomerization. Specifically, we elucidate the interaction details of two extracellular interfaces formed by CATSPERβ and CATSPERγ at the two dimer interfaces, respectively, and find that CATSPERη, a recently identified component of CatSper, constitutes the transmembrane interface within one of these dimer interfaces. Functional studies in mice demonstrate that CATSPERη is essential for the formation of functional CatSper on the sperm flagellum, and CATSPERη-deficient sperm fail to hyperactivate during fertilization, resulting in male infertility both in vivo and in vitro. Our data provide insights into the higher-order assembly of CatSper at the molecular level, offering clues for the development of male contraceptives.",

An organizational framework is now in place to deliver stable, predictive, and adaptive actions to monitor and measure the Earth’s biodiversity, assess ecological and evolutionary changes, identify key drivers of those changes, and, at the core, apply effective scientific, financial, and governmental treatments to halt biodiversity decline for a sustainable future. Is this implementable? We summarize the essence of the Targets to raise key questions about their execution. We show that the reports of large conservation organizations connect to these Targets only infrequently. Yet, there is abundant evidence to measure the successes and failures of the conservation enterprise. Generally, global financial commitments are substantial and increasing. We specify improvements and continual reassessments toward protected areas, developing countries, and indigenous communities. To achieve success, we recommend actionable plans to improve implementation leading up to and following the next CBD-COP meetings.",

          "abstract": "The exorbitant cost of prescription pharmaceuticals is a critical and long-standing concern facing the United States (US). To curb rising drug costs, international reference pricing, aligning drug prices with those in other high-income countries, has emerged as a prominent policy option. We evaluated the potential national savings from such a strategy in the United States through a comprehensive analysis of utilization patterns and global price differentials for over 8,000 drugs. We project an annual national saving of $184 billion if outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals were priced comparably to those in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid would realize savings of 51%, 62%, and 35%, respectively. Pharmaceutical expenditures for common chronic illnesses would be substantially reduced, with costs declining by over 75% for diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Our findings emphasize the substantial fiscal and equity gains achievable through international reference pricing, demonstrating its potential to mitigate financial burdens borne by both healthcare systems and individual patients.",

          "abstract": "The ecological context of developmental physiology remains largely unexplored. We previously showed that thermal selection primarily targets early embryos in Drosophila melanogaster . Here, we used advanced introgression and pooled whole-genome resequencing to map the genomic basis of enhanced embryonic heat tolerance in a neotropical line of D. melanogaster . We identified two loci on chromosomes 2R and X that were consistently targeted by 16 generations of thermal selection across six replicate introgressions. Global population comparisons revealed that two SNPs in these genomic regions exhibit clinal and seasonal patterns linked to environmental variability in average precipitation and temperature variance across space and time. The two SNPs lie in putative regulatory regions of the genes SP70 and sog , where allelic variation in gene expression correlates with heat tolerance. Using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we confirmed that tropical alleles at these loci increase embryonic heat tolerance and interact epistatically, demonstrating the genotype-to-phenotype link in an independent set of diverse genetic backgrounds. Overall, our study extends previous work in developmental genetics by showcasing developmental regulatory variants that appear to be under natural selection.",

          "abstract": "Palaeogenetic evidence suggests that the last common ancestor of present-day humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans lived around 765–550 thousand years ago (ka) 1 . However, both the geographical distribution and the morphology of these ancestral humans remain uncertain. The Homo antecessor fossils from the TD6 layer of Gran Dolina at Atapuerca, Spain, dated between 950 ka and 770 ka (ref. 2 ), have been proposed as potential candidates for this ancestral population 3 . However, all securely dated Homo sapiens fossils before 90 ka were found either in Africa or at the gateway to Asia, strongly suggesting an African rather than a Eurasian origin of our species. Here we describe new hominin fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés at Thomas Quarry I (ThI-GH) in Casablanca, Morocco, dated to around 773 ka. These fossils are similar in age to H. antecessor , yet are morphologically distinct, displaying a combination of primitive traits and of derived features reminiscent of later H. sapiens and Eurasian archaic hominins. The ThI-GH hominins provide insights into African populations predating the earliest H. sapiens individuals discovered at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco 4 and provide strong evidence for an African lineage ancestral to our species. These fossils offer clues about the last common ancestor shared with Neanderthals and Denisovans.",

          "abstract": "In all domains of life, tRNAs mediate the transfer of genetic information from mRNAs to proteins. As their depletion suppresses translation and, consequently, viral replication, tRNAs represent long-standing and increasingly recognized targets of innate immunity 1–5 . Here we report Cas12a3 effector nucleases from type V CRISPR–Cas adaptive immune systems in bacteria that preferentially cleave tRNAs after recognition of target RNA. Cas12a3 orthologues belong to one of two previously unreported nuclease clades that exhibit RNA-mediated cleavage of non-target RNA, and are distinct from all other known type V systems. Through cell-based and biochemical assays and direct RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that recognition of a complementary target RNA by the CRISPR RNA triggers Cas12a3 to cleave the conserved 5′-CCA-3′ tail of diverse tRNAs to drive growth arrest and anti-phage defence. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures further revealed a distinct tRNA-loading domain that positions the tRNA tail in the RuvC active site of the nuclease. By designing synthetic reporters that mimic the tRNA acceptor stem and tail, we expanded the capacity of current CRISPR-based diagnostics for multiplexed RNA detection. Overall, these findings reveal widespread tRNA inactivation as a previously unrecognized CRISPR-based immune strategy that broadens the application space of the existing CRISPR toolbox.",

          "abstract": "The canonical mechanism that drives cell division comprises the formation and constriction of a contractile actin ring 1–3 . However, this mechanism is not compatible with the early development of many vertebrates 4–9 . Yolk-anchored embryos typically cannot form a complete ring during early cleavage divisions, but it remains unclear how a partial circular arc with loose ends can divide the cell. Here, by combining laser ablation of the cytokinetic band with rheological measurements in vivo, we show that stiffening of the bulk cytoplasm, mediated by the interphase microtubule network, stabilizes the contractile band by anchoring it along its length during growth. Conversely, as the cell cycle progresses, the cytoplasm fluidizes, diminishing band–cytoplasmic anchoring and facilitating band ingression. This dynamic interplay between stability and growth versus instability and ingression repeats for several cell cycles until division is complete, resulting in a mechanical ratchet that drives cell division. Our study underscores the role of temporal control over cytoplasmic rheology as a key feature that drives unilateral cytokinesis in the absence of a closed actin ring.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian genomes contain millions of regulatory elements that control the complex patterns of gene expression 1 . Previously, the ENCODE consortium mapped biochemical signals across hundreds of cell types and tissues and integrated these data to develop a registry containing 0.9 million human and 300,000 mouse candidate cis -regulatory elements (cCREs) annotated with potential functions 2 . Here we have expanded the registry to include 2.37 million human and 967,000 mouse cCREs, leveraging new ENCODE datasets and enhanced computational methods. This expanded registry covers hundreds of unique cell and tissue types, providing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Functional characterization data from assays such as STARR-seq 3 , massively parallel reporter assay 4 , CRISPR perturbation 5,6 and transgenic mouse assays 7 have profiled more than 90% of human cCREs, revealing complex regulatory functions. We identified thousands of novel silencer cCREs and demonstrated their dual enhancer and silencer roles in different cellular contexts. Integrating the registry with other ENCODE annotations facilitates genetic variation interpretation and trait-associated gene identification, exemplified by the identification of KLF1 as a novel causal gene for red blood cell traits. This expanded registry is a valuable resource for studying the regulatory genome and its impact on health and disease.",

Chronic inflammation can impede the phased regulation of tissue restitution, resulting in the scarring complication of fibrosis. In inflammatory bowel disease, stromal fibroblasts have been implicated in treatment-refractory disease and fibrosis 2,3 ; however, their mechanisms of activation have remained undefined. Through integrative single-cell and spatial profiling of intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we uncovered a pathological cell nexus centred on inflammation-associated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts were induced by proinflammatory macrophages ( FCN1 + IL1B + ) and, in turn, produced profibrotic cytokine IL-11. We investigated the inflammation-associated fibroblast activation program at a mechanistic level using genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens and identified the transcription factor GLIS3 as a key regulator of a gene regulatory network governing expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes. We further demonstrated that the magnitude of the GLIS3 gene expression program in intestinal biopsies could be used to stratify patients with ulcerative colitis by disease severity, and that fibroblast-specific deletion of Glis3 in mice alleviated pathological features of chronic colitis. Taken together, our findings identify a critical immune–stromal cell circuit that functions as a central node in the inflammation–fibrosis cycle.",

          "abstract": "Heterochromatin, marked by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, can be epigenetically inherited through cell division 1–3 , maintaining gene repression that preserves cell identity and enables adaptation to environmental challenges 2–6 . Studies on S chizosaccharomyces pombe have shown that heterochromatin propagation depends on the read–write mechanism, wherein a sufficient density of H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes, stabilized by histone deacetylases, concentrates Clr4 SUV39H on chromatin to promote further deposition of H3K9 methylation 7–9 . Whether other mechanisms control heterochromatin propagation by means of Clr4 SUV39H , a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ClrC 10–12 , was unknown. Here we uncover a ubiquitin-dependent heterochromatin heritability regulatory hub (HRH) that broadly governs heterochromatin propagation, even without histone deacetylase activity. The HRH is tuned by the limiting factor Raf1 DDB2 , a substrate receptor for the ClrC ubiquitin ligase. In addition to linking Clr4 SUV39H to other ClrC components on chromatin, Raf1 DDB2 acts in a dosage-dependent manner to promote ubiquitination of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ub), which is critical for heterochromatin self-propagation. HRH is intricately linked to environmentally responsive pathways, including nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling, enabling cells to adapt to changing conditions. By modulating heterochromatin propagation, cells leverage the HRH to gain resistance to antifungal agents and adapt to high temperature. Thus, heterochromatin self-propagation is actively regulated by means of H3K14ub in response to external stimuli, with broad implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease.",

At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii) 2,3 . The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5–4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance.",

Some expanded repeats cause inherited disorders and some are also somatically unstable 1,2 . Here we analysed DNA sequencing data from over 900,000 participants in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program using computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability. Repeats at different loci exhibited widely variable tissue-specific propensities to mutate in the germline and blood. Common alleles of repeats in TCF4 and ADGRE2 exhibited high rates of length mosaicism in the blood, demonstrating that most human genomes contain repeat elements that expand as we age. Genome-wide association analyses of the extent of somatic expansion of unstable repeat alleles identified 29 loci at which inherited variants increased expansion of one or more DNA repeats in blood ( P = 5 × 10 −8 to 2.5 × 10 −1,438 ). These genetic modifiers exhibited strong collective effects on repeat instability: at one repeat, somatic expansion rates varied fourfold between individuals with the highest and lowest 5% of polygenic scores. Modifier alleles at several DNA-repair genes exhibited opposite effects on the blood instability of the TCF4 repeat compared with other DNA repeats. Expanded repeats in the 5′ untranslated region of the glutaminase ( GLS ) gene associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (odds ratio (OR) = 14.0 (5.7–34.3, 95% confidence interval (CI))) and liver diseases (OR = 3.0 (1.5–5.9, 95% CI)). These results point to complex dynamics of DNA repeats in human populations and across the human lifespan.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the existence and extent of a gender gap in satisfaction with the Bank of England’s performance in controlling inflation. Descriptive data and previous research report gender gaps in attitudes towards monetary institutions and outcomes. Much of this research, however, disregards potential biases arising from women’s lower propensity to express an opinion, and to answer ‘don’t know’ instead. Using the Bank of England’s Inflation Attitudes survey (2001–2025), and modelling selection into substantive answers, I find a statistically significant – yet, substantively small and not persistent – gender gap in satisfaction with the Bank of England. This gender gap remains after controlling for inflation perception and monetary knowledge. I also find that women do not overestimate inflation, and they do not seem to ‘punish’ more harshly the Bank for high inflation or deflation. Therefore, variance in this gender gap can be attributed to a different propensity to report ‘extreme’ opinions, and to different reactions to high inflation or deflation. These findings highlight gendered dimensions for the understanding of monetary institutions and finance, contributing to the literature on satisfaction with the performance of institutions.",

          "abstract": "How do economic crises harm political trust? And can their impact be mitigated? Using data from Eurofound’s Living, working, and COVID-19 survey conducted across the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic, I find that economic performance and social protection are strongly correlated with political trust in such contexts, however independently from each other. While deteriorating economic conditions severely harm trust, social protection can subsequently temper this negative impact. More specifically, in the case of the COVID-19 crisis, the deferral of debt and taxes, followed by support from public services and wage support mitigated the most the negative impact of the crisis on political trust. However, I find this mitigating effect to be only moderate as trust attitudes are likely to be affected by a negativity bias. In other words, the positive effect of receiving state support on political trust is systematically inferior to the negative effect of the crisis. Because of this bias, governments are more likely to be punished by citizens for what the crisis has done to them than to be rewarded for what they have done for them.",

However, how the relationship between health and NiPP is conditioned by age and education remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study analyses data from 8944 participants in the European Social Survey (wave 10) across Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. Results showed that as subjective general health (SGH) increases, the likelihood of NiPP decreases. Both age and education moderated this relationship. For younger individuals and those with higher education, increased SGH led to reduced NiPP. Conversely, for older individuals and those with lower education, the decline in NiPP participation was less pronounced as SGH increased. Future research should examine specific forms of participation and specific health conditions, as well whether age and education continue to moderate NiPP involvement.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the origins and implications of a new cloud business model that is powering the advance of AI. We document how this model emerged within a handful of the most dominant IT firms whose reach into all corners of the economy makes them a powerful node or “choke point” in the political economy as a whole. We then elaborate how the features of the cloud business model differ from the traditional platform model out of which it grew, as it evolved from asset-light to asset-heavy, from hierarchical organization to semivertical integration, from domination over to collaboration with partner firms, and from embracing consumer- to enterprise-facing strategies. A final section considers the technological, political, and distributional impacts of the rise of this new business model—showing how the current race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) has reinforced and accelerated its underlying dynamics (above all, intensifying the drive for scale and ever-greater asset intensity), analyzing the new techno-nationalist alliance between industry leaders and the state that the model's development has inspired, and considering the new power-distributional dynamics this model has produced.",

          "abstract": "President Trump altered the U.S. federal civil service system by reducing merit‐based protections for bureaucratic expertise and expanding the scope of political appointments, shifting the balance long established under the Pendleton Act of 1883. Similar reforms have occurred at the state level with moves to at‐will employment. These shifts raise questions about what shapes public support for merit system protections. Using data from the 2023 Cooperative Election Survey, we examine how public service motivation (PSM), political knowledge, and ideology influence support for political neutrality and protection from political coercion. We find that political knowledge and PSM are positively correlated with favorable perceptions of current merit system protections. Interestingly, there is no significant association between ideology and support for merit protections. These findings suggest that informed and motivated citizens are more likely to support meritocratic principles, highlighting the need for public education on merit systems' role in sustaining democratic governance.",

          "abstract": "In the wake of significant increases in lesbian and gay (LG) immigration, do Americans view LG migrants as more deserving of entry to the United States than their straight counterparts? Using a conjoint survey experiment with 1,650 respondents, we investigate how potential immigrants’ sexual-minority status affects Americans’ perceptions of their deservingness for admission and their cultural similarity to the United States. Results show that, overall, Americans do not perceive LG immigrants as more deserving than straight ones, and LG immigrants are perceived as less culturally similar. But results also reveal heterogeneity: LG immigrants fleeing persecution are seen as more deserving of admission, and Democrats, atheists, and LG respondents consider LG migrants more deserving than straight ones. This paper helps disentangle Americans’ preferences for migrants’ presumed cultural similarity from economic potential and humanitarian merit as well as sheds light on public opinion of an understudied but politically salient group.",

          "abstract": "Abstract505 After US elections, news stories frequently highlight how the US Congress has a higher proportion of women and is more racially and ethnically diverse than at any point in history. While some literature suggests that this coverage may diminish legitimacy and support for democratic norms, other research suggests that as descriptive representation increases, citizens—including white people and men—have more trust in their institutions and perceive them to be more legitimate. However, little is known about the effect of this type of news coverage on citizens’ attitudes toward Congress and democracy as a whole. Given these competing expectations, we conduct a series of experiments to determine how portrayals of a diverse Congress affect its perceived legitimacy and support for democratic norms related to Congress’s power. We hypothesize that as Congress diversifies faster than the executive branch, the motivation to protect traditional hierarchies will undermine both the perceived legitimacy of Congress and the commitment to democratic restraints on presidential power among white people and men. Our results are mixed. Based on two survey experiments with nationally representative samples, we find that Democrats perceive Congress as having more institutional legitimacy when informed of its diversity, while Republicans show no difference in their legitimacy perceptions when compared to control conditions. Furthermore, we find no evidence that information about Congress’s diversity decreases support for democratic norms.",

          "abstract": "We show that intergenerational mobility changed rapidly by race and class in recent decades in the U.S. and study the causal mechanisms underlying those changes. Between the 1978 and 1992 birth cohorts, earnings increased for white children from high-income families relative to white children from low-income families, increasing earnings gaps by parental income (“class”) by 30%. Earnings increased for Black children at all parental income levels, reducing white-Black earnings gaps for children from low-income families by 30%. Class gaps grew and race gaps shrank similarly for non-monetary outcomes such as educational attainment, standardized test scores, and mortality rates. Using a quasi-experimental design, we show that the divergent trends in economic mobility were caused by differential changes in childhood environments, as proxied by parental employment rates, within local communities defined by race, class, and childhood county. Outcomes improve across birth cohorts for children who grow up in communities with increasing parental employment rates, with larger effects for children who move to such communities at younger ages. Children’s outcomes are most strongly related to the parental employment rates of peers they are more likely to interact with, such as those in their own birth cohort, suggesting that the relationship between children’s outcomes and parental employment rates is mediated by social interaction.",

The breadth of these synthetically valuable transformations is constrained by the range of molecules—and particularly the functional groups—that can deliver productive excited states, with most methods using the same functional groups that were defined more than 100 years ago. In this work, we show that N -silyl sulfinylamines can undergo synthetically useful excited-state reactivity accessed using energy transfer catalysts and visible light. We exploit these intermediates in reactions with alkenes to form four-membered cyclic sulfinamide products. The reactions are efficient and broad in scope, and the products are advanced to sulfonamides as well as four-membered cyclic sulfonimidamides.",

In wet-lab validations, DrugCLIP achieved a 15% hit rate for norepinephrine transporter, and structures of two identified inhibitors were determined in complex with the target protein. For thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12, a target that lacks holo structures and small-molecule binders, DrugCLIP achieved a 17.5% hit rate using only AlphaFold2-predicted structures. Finally, we released GenomeScreenDB, an open-access database providing precomputed results for ~10,000 human proteins screened against 500 million compounds, pioneering a drug discovery paradigm in the post-AlphaFold era.",

Anatomy shows that facial muscles are under direct control from multiple cortical regions, and studies of patients with focal lesions suggest that lateral frontal cortices control voluntary movements and medial emotional expressions. By directly measuring single-neuron activity from both sets of areas, we found that lateral and medial cortical face motor regions encode both types of gestures. They do so through area-specific temporal activity patterns, distinguishable well prior to movement onset. Our results show that cortical regions projecting in parallel downstream form a continuum of gesture coding, from dynamic to temporally stable, to produce socially appropriate motor outputs during communication.",

          "abstract": "Thermal annealing improves the crystallinity of perovskite films and boosts their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in solar cells but also induces surface iodine loss and local lattice degradation. We demonstrate a molecular press annealing (MPA) strategy in which a 2-pyridylethylamine film is thermally and pressure-bonded to the perovskite surface. Real-time healing of iodine vacancies occurred during annealing and the lead-iodine framework was stabilized through optimized ligand engineering, resulting in enhanced structural integrity and long-term stability of perovskite films. This strategy enabled n-i-p perovskite solar cells to achieve a PCE of 26.6% (certified 26.5%). Notably, the devices retain 98.6 and 97.2% of their initial PCEs after 1617 hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking [ISOS-L-3 protocol, 85°C, 60% relative humidity (RH)] and 5280 hours of ambient storage (ISOS-D-1 protocol, room temperature, 10% RH).",

          "abstract": "The pain associated with bone fracture is mediated by somatosensory neurons, which also appear to be required to initiate bone regeneration. To characterize neuroanatomical circuitry mediating skeletal nociception and regeneration, we profiled dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons innervating murine bones using single-cell transcriptomics before and after fracture. CGRP + and Aβ-Field LTMR neurons were the most represented classes of bone-innervating neurons. Dynamic changes in sensory neuron response to injury reflected the phasic nature of bone repair, including expression of morphogens such as Tgfb1 , Fgf9 , and Shh . Innervation loss resulted in poor bone repair and was associated with defective mesenchymal cell proliferation and osteodifferentiation. Finally, we identified fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) as a major regulator of fracture repair that could be leveraged to promote bone repair.",

An outstanding question is how this organization emerges during development from an apparently homogeneous pool of neural progenitors. Here, we show that mouse dorsal neurons are diversified by time, with families of related cell types born as temporal cohorts, and by a spatial-molecular gradient that specifies individual cell types. Excitatory neurons settle into a chronotopic arrangement that transforms their progressive birthdates into anatomical order and is required to establish proper laminae. We identified essential ontogenetic principles that shape dorsal progenitors into the diverse cell types and structure that subserve sensorimotor function.",

In this study, we demonstrated that a small group of Gifted Word Learner dogs, which possess an extensive vocabulary of object labels, can learn new labels by overhearing their owners’ interactions. Moreover, we show that these dogs can acquire novel object-label mappings even when the labels and objects are not presented simultaneously.

Applying CB to the enzyme lipoic acid ligase (LplA), we uncovered a previously unknown mechanism controlling its promiscuous activity. Variants biased toward an “open” conformation state became more promiscuous, whereas “closed”-biased variants were more selective, enhancing LplA’s utility for site-specific protein labeling with fluorophores in living cells. The speed and simplicity of CB make it a versatile tool for engineering protein dynamics with broad applications in basic research, biotechnology, and medicine.",

Furthermore, bark-associated methanotrophs are abundant and can coexist with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Microcosm experiments showed that bark microorganisms aerobically consume methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide at in planta concentrations and produce these gases under anoxia.

Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism. Slc25a45 -deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by GLP1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss. Our study suggests that mitochondria serve as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching, with implications for metabolic adaptation and the efficacy of GLP-1RA-based anti-obesity therapy.",

Within this mechanistic manifold, carbon-oxygen bonds in epoxides are stereoselectively converted into carbon-carbon bonds in a process mediated by organoboron reagents. Epoxycycloalkanes undergo highly chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective carbon migration to furnish ring-contracted products with broad generality. This strategy also enables enantioselective 1,2-hydride migrations for linear epoxide substrates. The combination of this ring contraction protocol with [4+2] cycloadditions provides a distinct “[4+2–1]” strategy for the stereoselective construction of complex cyclopentanes in a modular fashion.",

Floquet bands emerge through the periodic oscillation of the core, which can be initiated by either driving the core directly or pumping azimuthal magnon modes. For the latter, the azimuthal modes induce core gyration through nonlinear interactions, which in turn renormalizes the magnon band structure. This represents a self-induced mechanism for Floquet band engineering and opens avenues to study and control nonlinear magnon dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Manipulating the topology of electronic bands can realize new states of matter, with possible implications for information technology. A central question is how to tell whether a topological regime has been achieved. Experiments are often guided by a prediction of a distinct and self-explanatory signal called “the smoking gun.” However, in micrometer- or nanometer-scale specimens, phenomenology can mimic the anticipated behavior without containing the exotic states. We show limited data that are consistent with the presence of four topological phenomena; by considering additional data, we identified the most likely origins of the observed patterns as trivial. We argue that the reliability of smoking gun–type claims can be greatly enhanced by releasing comprehensive datasets, discussing alternative scenarios, and disclosing the total volume of study.",

          "abstract": "The critique that rap causes violence (causal claim) goes back as far as the 1980s, but today drill rappers are having their freedoms restricted based on instances of a causal claim. Police in the UK regularly remove drill videos from social media and streaming platforms, and drillers are being restricted from making music and associating with people via criminal behavior orders based on the claim that drill music causes serious violence. If this causal claim is true, it provides potential grounds for such restrictions on drillers. This paper argues against censoring drill on the assumption that it causes violence for three reasons. First, even according to the most charitable rendition of the causal claim, there is insufficient evidence to support it. Second, there are less speech‐restrictive and more effective approaches to violence reduction than censorship‐oriented approaches. Third, critics should not be advancing the causal claim due to its racist public meaning.",

In particular, it tries to show that plurality, like liberty, can be and has been imagined either negatively or positively: negatively, as the absence of some form of agreement or uniformity; positively, as engagement with competing qualities or commitments. In addition, it argues that the prominence of negative conceptions of pluralism, with their emphasis on difference and diversity, has made it hard to recognize and appreciate the important role that positive conceptions play in moral and political discourse.",

This unique dynamic shapes community and membership, with urban political community defined by the proximity principle and membership grounded in indifference. Secondly, it argues that urban political communities are not mere segments of national communities, but distinct entities with different constitutive conditions. This understanding challenges traditional boundaries of citizenship both vertically, toward formal citizenship boundaries, and horizontally, toward territorial boundaries of political community. Thirdly, the paper advocates for cautious formalization of urban citizenship, recognizing the dynamic nature of cities in contesting boundaries and promoting democratic inclusion while highlighting that formalizing urban citizenship is ultimately boundary affirming: It maintains the boundaries drawn around cities by the state.",

          "abstract": "We examine the endogenous development of specialized political capital and its use, by both governing and opposition parties, within a model of policymaking and electoral competition. The opposition party can use political capital to impede the governing party's policy agenda—to throw sand in the gears—but may make itself less electorally desirable in the process. We characterize conditions that give rise to different equilibrium patterns of political capital, including, among others, entrenched parties. Our results suggest that, in the special circumstances in which they arise, entrenched parties offer the voter a silver lining: In these cases, the incumbent and opposition parties have acquired different specialized political capital, and voters benefit from the opposition's developed capacity to curb the governing party's excesses. Due to the underlying conditions, policy outcomes are still poor, but, under relevant conditions, party entrenchment mitigates them, rather than exacerbating them as conventionally supposed.",

          "abstract": "While scholars have documented feedback effects among a policy's direct winners and losers, less is known about whether such effects can occur among the indirectly affected—“the policy adjacent.” Using 458 geocoded housing developments built between two nearly identical statewide ballot propositions funding affordable housing in California, we show that policy generates feedback effects among neighboring residents in systematic ways. New, nearby affordable housing causes majority‐homeowner blocks to increase their support for the housing bond, while majority‐renter blocks decrease or do not change their support. We attribute the positive effect among majority‐homeowner blocks to the housing's replacement of blight. In contrast, the lack of a positive effect among majority‐renter blocks may be driven by the threat of gentrification. Policy implementation can win support for expansion among unexpected beneficiaries, while failing to do so even among the policy's presumed allies.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how broadband internet affects rural–urban migration in China using the Universal Broadband and Telecommunication Services pilot program launched in 2015 as a quasi‐experimental setting. Analyzing China Household Finance Survey data (2013–2021) with difference‐in‐differences estimation, we find that improved internet access significantly increased rural–urban migration by 3.2–3.4 percentage points, representing a 17.5–18.6 percent rise over the baseline migration rates of 18.3 percent. Effects were strongest in villages with fewer initial migrants, closer to county centers, and with better road infrastructure. At the individual level, impacts were largest among women, younger individuals, the more educated, and those from higher income households. The mechanism appears to be increased access to economic information. Our findings suggest broadband creates “digital routes” that facilitate out‐migration rather than “digital roots” that anchor residents to rural areas.",

A two‐wave survey of non‐Indigenous Australians ( N = 797/410) pre and post the 2023 Australian referendum on constitutionally enshrining a parliamentary “Voice” for its Indigenous peoples showed that collective angst was negatively, and empathetic collective angst positively, related to intending to vote “Yes” if the “Voice” was seen to have material implications. Latent true change modeling showed that participants who voted “Yes” (relative to “No”) felt, following the failure of the referendum, increased collective and empathetic collective angst. The findings highlight the role of existential collective concerns and how these shape, and are shaped by, political processes.",

          "authors": "Jaeeun Kim, Apostolos Andrikopoulos",
          "abstract": "Crafting identity is integral to the struggle of aspiring migrants to access the territory, labor market, and citizenship of desired destinations. Such practices are at times classified as “fraud.” Migration scholars should approach this state-centered category with caution. Such framing naturalizes the state's monopolistic claim to the truth of individual identities. It obscures the complex moral terrain migrants navigate. We propose “unauthorized identity craft” (UIC) as an alternative concept. UIC shifts our attention from migrants’ deception to their agency in the absence of state authorization — their learned craft to navigate, and at times subvert, restrictive mobility regimes. Drawing on long-term, multisited ethnographic research with Korean Chinese and West African migrants, we show that UIC is sustained by a complex web of relations, connecting documents, organizations, and people — state and non-state actors alike. The effectiveness of UIC depends on migrants’ intricate and intensive labor to create, maintain, and reshape this relational matrix. Our emphasis on UIC's relationality enables us to examine how migrants and other actors involved classify their relationships and the various forms of exchange that sustain them. Mismatches in these framings give rise to contestation and negotiation — important elements of the craft migrants must perform. Our relational perspective further helps explain UIC's temporal dynamic. For some migrants, UIC remains ephemeral, a form of strategic masking; for others, it generates lasting entanglements, moral dilemmas, and enduring identity shifts. We show that UIC's long-term ramifications are shaped by the breadth, density, durability, and consequentiality of the relational matrix that sustains UIC.",

          "abstract": "Flexible workplace arrangements (FWA), particularly working from home and working without fixed workplaces, have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. However, their implications for the social integration of immigrant workers remain underexplored. This study investigates whether and how FWA relate immigrant workers’ social integration, focusing on their proficiency in the destination language, a key indicator of social integration outcomes. Using data from the 2016 and 2021 Population Census conducted by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong SAR, we compare immigrant workers under three workplace arrangements: on-site, working without a fixed workplace, and working from home. Our findings reveal a strong and positive relationship between work without a fixed workplace and immigrants’ proficiency in Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong. This relationship is consistent across immigrants with varying durations of stay and those who migrated before or after adulthood. Instrumental variable regressions, causal mediation analysis and placebo tests further suggest that this relationship is likely causal. This study represents the first work to extend the understanding of FWA beyond economic performance to social integration outcomes, opening avenues for future research on the broader societal impacts of evolving work arrangements in the post-pandemic era and offering fresh insights for migration integration and skill management policies.",

This article investigates how institutional contexts, in the form of naturalization regimes, shape differences in political knowledge among naturalized citizens. Using Germany as a case study, this analysis focuses on two major immigrant groups that were subject to different naturalization regimes, namely individuals of Turkish and Soviet origin. Drawing on data from the 2017 Immigrant German Election Study, mediation analyses reveal a knowledge gap across these groups. However, this gap does not appear to be influenced by individual proficiency in the German language. Naturalized Turkish immigrants demonstrate greater political knowledge than naturalized immigrants of Soviet origin. These results underscore that naturalization regimes do more than grant legal status but also shape the political integration of immigrant citizens.",

          "abstract": "This article improves our understanding of visibility in relation to gender equity policy in the film and TV industries and beyond, where visibility is typically imagined to be positive or beneficial. Drawing on new empirical data from an internationally comparative study of gender equity policy in film and TV in the UK, Canada and Germany, we identify three imaginaries of visibility in relation to gender equity policies: visibility is imagined as evidencing problems, as providing a solution and as demonstrating action. We show that imagining visibility in these ways limits the scope of gender inequities considered for policy intervention and creates the potential for counterproductive unintended consequences. We argue that advocating for, developing and implementing effective gender equity policy requires challenging and complicating current ideas of how visibility works in policy making. As the visibility of marginalised groups is so central to gender equity, yet rarely approached critically by policy makers, this article makes an important contribution to the literature around equity in public policy broadly.",

          "abstract": "Policy dismantling is a growing field in public policy analysis. Scholars approach this topic from different perspectives, such as exploring why it occurs and analysing the strategies used to achieve it. However, the effects of policy dismantling on the policy-making process, particularly in multilevel governance frameworks, remain unclear. This study examines how different levels of government responded to the dismantling of the Childcare Programme to Support Working Mothers in Mexico. Our findings show that local governments mitigated the adverse effects through tailored compensatory actions, leveraging existing networks, technical expertise and political dynamics, particularly opposition to the ruling federal party. Beyond these immediate responses, dismantling has reshaped the childcare policy landscape, reinforcing political divides – especially regarding childcare provision models, such as direct services versus cash transfers. As a result, the debate has shifted from whether childcare services are necessary to how they should be provided and who should have access. These findings contribute to broader discussions on the impact of dismantling policies within federal systems, particularly in shaping intergovernmental policy making and political dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Collaborative governance (CG) models show promise for addressing complex governance challenges, yet they also face obstacles and difficulties that necessitate rigorous research in this field, particularly in relation to understanding and managing conflicts and disagreements among diverse stakeholders. The research addresses three primary questions: the scales, stages and domains in which conflicts arise; the strategies utilised by CG to handle minor disagreements and fundamental conflicts; and the outputs and effects of addressing deeper-seated conflicts and disagreements. Through a systematic literature review using the PRISMA-S framework, the study reveals how conflicts in CG frequently arise in environmental and ecological management, primarily at local scales, and mainly during the initial stages of decision making. The research identifies three primary levels for addressing conflicts in CG – motives, dynamics and resolution – categorising CG strategies into six distinct types to provide a comprehensive approach for practitioners. The findings indicate that while CG can effectively manage minor disagreements through negotiation and consensus building, it struggles with fundamental conflicts rooted in differing world views. This study examines the manifestations of addressing conflicts and disagreements resolution mechanisms within CG across three distinct dimensions: output, outcome and impact. It underscores the importance of leadership and innovative dialogue frameworks in constructively managing conflicts, transforming disagreements into opportunities for creative and collective problem-solving, thereby enhancing the sustainability and effectiveness of CG.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on collaborative governance emphasises the importance of creating win–win situations as a way of generating policy innovation and effective problem-solving. However, the dynamics of collaboration are often more complicated than discovering mutual gains. An analysis of cannabis legalisation in the San Francisco Bay Area finds that ‘getting to yes’ is often a subtle mixture of finding common ground and the manufacturing of consent. This means that some participants take the role of entrepreneurs in the collaborative process and push discursive dynamics towards a dominant perspective. Exploring the importance of power and politics in collaborative governance, the case illuminates how arena design, discourse and coalition building shape the scope and character of consensus formation.",

          "authors": "Andrea Krizsán, Dorottya Fekete",
          "abstract": "In contexts of autocratisation and political polarisation, maintaining the legitimacy of policy expertise is cumbersome. Experts are clustered on two sides of the political divide: those not aligned with either side are excluded from regular policy processes, while those aligned to the regime are too close to the government to be seen as legitimate. This article analyses how policy-knowledge producers work towards achieving legitimacy for the knowledge they produce in such highly politicised contexts. It identifies three sets of legitimacy-building practices used to navigate the dominance of the political. First, knowledge producers increasingly embrace values-driven practices rather than insisting on neutrality and independence. Second, boundaries between political arenas and epistemic authority are tightened by the separation of individual and organisational identities. Third, the relevance of policy knowledge is reframed by diversifying audiences and outcomes to maintain usefulness. The practices identified are not specific to autocratising contexts, but they are exacerbated and become coerced responses to the hard constraints of an incrementally closing regime. Based on interview data with think tanks in Hungary’s polarised autocracy and highly politicised policy making, this research examines populist tendencies of questioning truth and neutrality of knowledge and expertise – all hallmarks of today’s turbulent policy environments. This makes it a valuable contribution to the broader literature on how think tanks negotiate legitimacy in contexts of de-democratisation.",

          "abstract": "Wicked problems have forced policy makers to develop new strategies for policy design that deal better with complexity. Both cross-sectoral and multi-actor collaboration are presented by collaborative governance advocates as potential solutions. Nevertheless, even if both approaches have been theoretically linked to policy innovation, there is little empirical evidence to support those relationships and none that compare the innovative potential of different collaborative approaches. Using regression analysis, we analysed 529 policy strategies promoted by Barcelona City Council as part of the Pla de Barris (‘neighbourhood plan’) strategy to identify whose participation in policy design is more meaningful in terms of innovation. Within the public sector, both collaborative government and cross-sectoral collaboration appear to be related with policy innovation. However, when non-public actors – in particular, third-sector organisations – get involved in the policy-design process (through co-creation), the innovative potential of the policy output increases significantly.",

          "abstract": "This article discusses the concept of success in relation to policy experimentation, a type of policy innovation. Despite a growing literature on policy experiments, few studies define or explore what constitutes a successful experiment. This is important given the potential of experiments for policy learning and change, and also so that experiments can be evaluated and lessons learned across jurisdictions by academics and practitioners. The article develops a concept of success that is rooted in policy learning. Based on an empirical study of policy experimentation in Canadian federal cultural, heritage and sport policy, the article outlines four key ‘success criteria’: basic elements of an experiment; leadership and resources; procedural elements; and evaluation. It argues that experiments need to be evaluated not merely on outcomes, and that they should ultimately aim to encourage reflexive learning, characterised by dialogue and deliberation.",

          "authors": "Johan Christensen, Stine Hesstvedt, Kira Pronin, Cathrine Holst, Peter Munk Christiansen, Anne Maria Holli",
          "abstract": "The Nordic countries have traditionally been seen to share a distinct and successful governance model, combining high administrative capacity, extensive interest-group involvement and active channels for incorporating expert input in policy making. Starting in the 1980s, this model came under pressure. Yet, while changes to the statist and corporatist elements of this model are well documented, we know less about the changing role of expertise in Nordic governance. Focusing on one key institutional channel for incorporating expert knowledge in policy making, namely government-appointed advisory commissions, this article seeks to compare and account for changes in academic participation in Nordic commissions since the 1970s. Drawing on a cross-national data set covering more than 6,700 advisory commissions and 73,000 commission members, it finds significant cross-Nordic divergence in academic participation on advisory groups. The article offers a historical-institutionalist account for this divergence. It shows how the Nordic countries responded differently to similar political, economic and ideational pressures, leading their commission systems and the role of academic experts within these systems in different directions. In this way, the article makes an important contribution to scholarship on the politics of expertise and policy advice and debates about the Nordic governance model.",

          "abstract": "‘Design for policy’ is a prominent framing of the intersection between policy and design. Here, we ask, if design is ‘for’ policy, then what exactly is it doing? We make a critique of literature that explains the interaction of design and policy by listing practices (prototyping or visualisation, for example) but that misses the reasons why those practices are being used. We build on and advance scholarship that anchors design in relation to the demands, constraints and politics of policy making, taking account of the quite different forms a relationship between design (as a thing) and policy design (as a process) can have. Within this debate we propose that design’s relationship to policy is not always in service to (‘for’), but also sometimes ‘with’, and even sometimes ‘against’. We set out an original typology which differentiates roles of design in policy along the lines of their ultimate purpose, scope and terms on which design and policy interact. We identify an instrumental relationship, in which design is a tool to support achieving specified goals of policy making; an improvisational relationship, seeing design as a practice enabling policy making to be more open in the face of unfolding events and experiences; and a generative relationship where design facilitates the re-envisioning of policy making. Through our analysis and proposed typology, we aim to address overly specific and overly homogenising understandings of design in the policy space, enabling a more critical understanding of the different intents and implications at play within the ‘design turn’ in policy.",

Despite being heavily researched, however, WLB is surprisingly undertheorized within sociology. This article attempts to redress the situation by proposing a robust and multilayered sociological model capable of explaining its genesis, experience, and variations. I first deconstruct the commonsense notion of WLB, recasting it as a family-employment-leisure nexus, and specify its elements. Next, I flag the limits of current conceptualizations of WLB and turn to Bourdieu’s field theory for solutions. I go beyond Bourdieu, however, by modeling more precisely how multiple fields interact to shape the demands, dispositions, and desires of everyday experience. I develop a series of concepts and distinctions to that end and finish with a sketch of research possibilities.",

This creates a substantial gap between where refugees are located and where research is produced. This study investigates this bias by analyzing 12,700 publications on forced migration from 1990 to 2022. Using a methodology that combines hand-coding with generative AI text processing, we examine publication and citation patterns based on the country of analysis and author affiliation. Our findings show that (1) most research focuses on the Global North, (2) most authors are based in the Global North, (3) Global North authors dominate publications on the Global South, and (4) Global North authors receive more citations, even when studying the same country as Global South researchers. These results prove a persistent regional bias favoring the Global North in forced migration research.",

Yet executives today also pursue strategies that deliberately weaken the state itself. This essay brings the state back into the conversation by (re)introducing the concept of state erosion to capture processes through which elected leaders weaken the state's essential governance capacities by dismantling or politicizing bureaucracies, hollowing out regulatory agencies, centralizing coercive authority, or redirecting public resources in pursuit of partisan ends. Far from being confined to fragile democracies or partisan ideologies, we suggest that state erosion is proliferating across different global contexts. The stakes are profound: While state capacity is painstakingly built over generations, it can be quickly dismantled. The hollowing out of state capacity represents a pervasive threat to the survival of legitimate democratic governance.",

Structural legacies of secular authoritarianism, regional counterrevolution (notably Gulf monarchies), inconsistent Western \"linkage and leverage,\" and a global wave of populist authoritarianism further constrain democratization.

While some subscribe to the \"anti-gender\" agenda and roll back gender equality achievements, others compete over who is the more gender equal. This essay reconciles these seemingly contradictory positions by referring to genderbashing and genderwashing as two authoritarian signalling strategies. Genderbashing occurs when authoritarian leaders strategically exploit fears and insecurities in the citizenry by cracking down on women's rights, while genderwashing involves authoritarians pushing through gender equality reforms to appear liberal and mitigate criticism about democratic deficiencies. Both strategies threaten democracy as well as the empowerment, well-being, and security of women in authoritarian contexts.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Brazil's judiciary played a pivotal role in containing Jair Bolsonaro's authoritarian drive, culminating in his September 2025 conviction for attempting a coup. Unlike in most countries—and in Brazil's own history—where leaders who undermine democracy typically evade post-tenure punishment, high courts constrained Bolsonaro both during and after his presidency through strategic choices. Equally important, their rulings enabled rivals to weaken Bolsonaro's grip on power while avoiding open confrontation with powerful congressional forces. This experience offers concrete lessons for democracies confronting similar threats, including those now investigating former presidents who sought to subvert democratic rule.",

Their concern is with institutional designs that systematically enable partisan minorities to thwart or rule over electoral majorities, such as is seen in extreme federal malapportionment, excessive judicial vetoes of ordinary legislation, and plurality systems that convert authoritarian pluralities into \"manufactured majorities.\" In an era of strong ethnonationalist minorities, the authors argue, proportional representation better contains these forces. Safeguarding democracy now requires vigilance against institutions that entrench authoritarian minorities.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: This essay argues that Ukraine's defense must be matched by democratic credibility. It identifies three pitfalls to avoid. First, in the information war, Kyiv should restore media pluralism, curb performative messaging, and institutionalize sourcing, corrections, and independent oversight to distinguish itself from Russian disinformation. Second, Ukraine should openly confront fraught history—including Volhynia/Eastern Galicia, the Azov Brigade, and WWII-era nationalist symbols—through transparent vetting, scholarship, and joint reckoning with allies. Third, wartime centralization must not harden into hyperpresidentialism: Anticorruption bodies require independence, \"sunset clauses\" limiting grants of emergency powers, and a rule-of-law compact. These reforms would strengthen public trust, EU prospects, and postwar consolidation across civil society, politics, law, state capacity, and the economy.",

It outlines the Kremlin's toolkit—political interference, corrupt financial networks, Transnistria-based security leverage, energy blackmail, and disinformation—and explains why these efforts have increasingly failed. Central to its success is Moldova's long-term Europeanization, driven by EU conditionality, and President Maia Sandu's anticorruption-centered politics, which link democracy with integrity. Legal, energy, and security reforms, plus an active civil society, diaspora, and strong support from Romania and the EU have built \"defense in depth.\" The authors distill ten lessons for vulnerable democracies on resilience in the face of hybrid warfare.",

Historical traumas—the Holodomor, the Holocaust and Jewish statelessness, and the unresolved Chinese civil war—anchor collective fears that frame current security choices and justify far-reaching measures. These states tightly align with Western powers, especially the United States, and use their democratic credentials as soft power to secure military, financial, and diplomatic support. Digital-era communication amplifies their narratives, giving them outsized influence. The authors argue that for such states, sovereignty inevitably comes before democracy, raising difficult questions about how liberal norms endure under permanent threat.",

Forcing all institutions into a majoritarian-versus-counter majoritarian dichotomy wrongly treats majority rule as democracy's core. Instead, the essay argues, democracy should be judged by widely accepted legal standards: meaningful political participation, free and fair elections that confer real power, robust rights, and the rule of law.",

This article argues that AI functions as a powerful accelerator, lowering historical barriers and making these mechanisms not only cheaper but also more frequent, by automating law-drafting, optimizing mobilization, and enabling hyper-personalized persuasion. However, this efficiency threatens the core conditions of democratic legitimacy. By eroding deliberation, weakening civil society, and corroding trust through synthetic content, AI risks converting citizen-initiated mechanisms of direct democracy from essential \"safety valves\" into engines of plebiscitarian instability. This essay contrasts a dystopian future of Automated Plebiscites with a preferable path of Augmented Deliberation. To steer toward the latter, the essay proposes a governance roadmap of digital guardrails—including AI watermarking, public-interest AI platforms, and independent algorithmic audits—aimed at ensuring AI augments rather than undermines democratic practice.",

Since 2014, students and faculty critical of the regime have been vilified, physically attacked and arrested, books and seminars banned, standard historical narratives rewritten, and foreign scholars denied visas. Three overlapping but distinct phases in this takeover are visible: the first involved suppression of existing scholarship and thought, while the second rested on the capture of administrative, faculty and student positions enabling an ideological rewiring of higher education. In the third phase, the government has introduced basic structural changes that destroy the federal structure of India's education system, and reduce faculty to government staff.",

It shows how decision making has shifted from formal institutions to an inner circle centered on Museveni's family, and especially his son, who controls key military structures and openly pursues succession. Rising repression, ethnicized patronage, and the dominance of Western-Uganda elites intensify tensions with marginalized groups such as the Baganda. Looking beyond the 2026 elections, the essay argues that Uganda's transition will likely be shaped by the first family, the army, ethnic dynamics, and regional powers, with significant risks of instability.",

          "abstract": "Given the growing body of research documenting how AI can both positively and negatively affect labor markets, it is logical to assume that AI’s effects on jobs and employment will be a significant political issue for many nations in the coming years. However, we currently lack an understanding of how political parties perceive the potential impact AI has on employment, the role of regulations in protecting workers from AI-related job losses, and the importance of AI educational and training programs to assist workers in environments where AI is more prevalent. Therefore, this study analyzes comments and statements from party members in OECD countries from 2016 to 2025 through content analysis, examining media interviews, speeches, and debates to understand how political party ideologies shape party members’ positions on AI regarding job losses, labor markets, regulations, and AI education and training programs. The findings indicate that political ideology significantly affects party members’ concerns regarding AI-related job losses and the need for government regulations to protect workers from labor market disruptions caused by AI. These findings have important implications for understanding how political ideology may influence party members’ perspectives on AI in relation to labor markets, job losses, and regulation in OECD countries.",

While polarization often rises during campaigns and correlates with democratic backsliding, isolating the effect of winning or losing has proven difficult because of the need for a pre-election baseline and to generalize across multiple elections. In this study, we leverage pre- and post-election questions about partisan affect in the American National Election Study between 1996 and 2024. Our first analysis studies how respondents’ attitudes changed based on their party’s success in its bid for the White House. Our second analysis extends this to hundreds more races, applying a regression discontinuity design to attitudes after close subnational election results. Both analyses support the conclusion that the losing side drives the post-election gap in polarization, and that they do so by feeling less warmly toward their own party. In the United States, political loss may erode in-group attachment more than it fuels out-group hostility.",

I then survey relational egalitarian criticisms of distributively focused egalitarian principles, arguing that theorists are converging on the view that both relational and distributive concerns have independent significance. I discuss attempts to identify what relational equality involves and why it matters. I argue that defenses of relational egalitarianism are more robust than often suggested. I review relational egalitarian approaches to specific political and policy problems, with a special focus on scholarship in democratic theory, given relational egalitarians’ long-standing concerns with inequalities of power and authority. I conclude with reflections on the relevance of relational egalitarianism for political science and political theory.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the interconnection between electoral and non-electoral politics. Through a unique integration of social media and nationally representative survey data, we examine how political parties in Denmark, Germany, and the United Kingdom evaluate episodes of street protest and how these evaluations relate to their voters’ participation in such protests. Our analysis shows that all political parties, regardless of type or ideology, engage with the non-electoral field, showing a greater tendency to express support for protests they agree with, rather than to criticize those they oppose, in their social media posts. Moreover, our findings underscore a robust association between party support or criticism of a protest and the likelihood of its voters either participating in or shunning the same protest. These findings renew our understanding of fluid linkages between parties and civil society through a less structured and deterministic double role of voters and street protesters than in the past.",

However, empirical evidence for a gender-specific use of attacks is inconclusive. We argue that we are not yet able to fully understand the conditions under which men and women candidates go negative on their political opponents, as the costs and benefits have not yet been empirically measured. Based on candidate surveys from Germany, we use a moderated mediation model to show that i. Women report lower levels of attack behavior than men, ii. Women show a less favorable balance of benefits and costs of negative campaigning, and iii. The perceived benefit-cost balance influences the decision to go negative. However, iv. This effect is moderated by gender; men only attack more often than women when the perceived costs are low and the expected benefits are high.",

The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union led the country to search for its new global identity and place in the global economy. Addressing the uncertain future, political actors referred to Singapore as a potential model for post-Brexit UK, idealising the Southeast Asian City State’s competitive institutional arrangements. Brexit also gave momentum for aspirations of Scottish independence with Nordic countries and welfare state acting as a starkly contrasting model for independent Scotland. Our article critically analyses the cognitive and normative aspects of the Singapore on Thames and Nordic Scotland discourses. We identify two modalities for referencing numerically constructed policy models, as means of anticipation or politicisation, blurring the communicative and coordinative variants of the analysed policy discourses and contributing to their failure.",

This is evident in the contrast between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s reputation as a risk-averse and detail-oriented technocrat and the record of his first year, which suggests a tougher, more decisive and more uncompromising persona. This article explains this discrepancy by presenting a comprehensive Leadership Trait Analysis of Starmer, using automated content analysis of spontaneous speech during his premiership. Our findings show Starmer exhibits higher than average positions on his belief in his ability to control events, distrust towards others, need for power, and self-confidence, a profile associated with leaders who challenge constraints, eschew compromise, and personalise decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Central banks form a global policy community with a historically high degree of convergence around the norms of central bank independence. However, in recent years, climate change has emerged as a topic of clear-cut divergence – most strikingly between the historically similar European Central Bank (ECB) and US Federal Reserve (Fed). We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore not only factors pushing towards central bank convergence, but also divergence. We show that in an initial stage of emergence, a largely autonomous process of internal deliberation led the ECB to endorse new climate-related norms, where this dynamic was absent in the United States. In a second phase of cascade, marked by the founding of the Network for Greening the Financial System and a growing body of research on climate impacts and central bank objectives, climate-related norms began to exert limited pressure towards convergence. However, the Fed’s perceptions of political risk constrained its adoption of climate-related policies, and eventually led to a retreat from climate following the re-election of President Donald Trump at the end of 2024.",

          "abstract": "In extended deterrence, a nuclear patron assumes a dual role: reassuring its clients while deterring adversaries. Policymakers and scholars widely recognise that for a patron, reassurance is more challenging than deterrence. Why? What makes reassurance harder? I argue that a patron’s deliberate introduction of ambiguity into its extended deterrence commitments – designed to reduce the risk of entrapment – makes reassurance more difficult. This ambiguity makes a patron’s security umbrella appear unreliable to clients, thereby producing uniformly negative effects on reassurance. Conversely, a patron’s ambiguous commitments have a net-neutral effect on adversaries, sustaining a consistent deterrent effect. Ultimately, this dual effect of ambiguity renders reassurance a more difficult task than deterrence. I illustrate the plausibility of this argument by examining how ambiguities in US extended deterrence have been perceived by South Korea and North Korea.",

It finds that coverage undermining legitimacy falls into three main areas: limiting or eroding national sovereignty, inadequate performance or effectiveness and disrupting the ‘natural order’. Coverage supporting or defending legitimacy is about providing a safety net, maintaining the international human rights system, and protecting freedoms and liberties. These are distributed unevenly across the six newspapers included in the sample. Critical coverage maps closely to legal scholarship on challenges for legitimacy associated with the identity of the United Kingdom as a political constitutionalist state. Supportive coverage, however, does not fully reflect the broad range of arguments in favour of the legitimacy of the European Convention on Human Rights as identified by human rights campaigners; it is also less abundant, narrower and more tactically defensive.",

Despite growing interest in impoliteness in international relations, little is known about its use by weaker states against stronger ones. This article addresses this gap by conceptualising impoliteness as a pragmatic bargaining resource in asymmetric relations, focusing on encounters between US leaders and their Middle Eastern counterparts. We argue that smaller states resort to impoliteness when political gains outweigh potential costs, particularly under conditions that reduce the risks of retaliation. In such moments, impoliteness serves to consolidate domestic legitimacy, project autonomy, express dissatisfaction with unequal partnerships, and signal aspirations for higher status. Drawing on case studies of US leaders’ receptions in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, we show that overt impoliteness is not a breakdown of diplomacy but a strategic instrument through which weaker states exercise agency and reframe hierarchy.",

While existing research analysed the imposition of multilateral sanctions and the success of economic sanctions, this question has not been systematically addressed. I develop a theoretical framework based on research on cooperation and sanctions, which I test through quantitative analysis based on an original dataset of suspension episodes in regional international organisations (1990–2024), as well as two qualitative comparative case studies of suspension terminations in the Economic Community of West African States and the Council of Europe. The paper finds that suspensions end through target state compliance if the regional international organisation is united, the target state is vulnerable to the international organisation’s pressure, and the international organisation perceives the transgression as a severe violation of its community norms – and through international organisation capitulation if otherwise. If these factors point into different directions, this increases the chance for suspensions to be terminated as draws.",

Drawing on a thematic analysis of 19 in-depth interviews with US-based journalists, social media editors, and independent news creators, it integrates critical political economy of media approaches with journalism and creator studies to analyze how workers navigate unstable revenue models, platform governance, and technological disruption. The findings reveal intersecting business- and labor-oriented crises characterized by algorithmic control, low pay, unpaid work, and varying degrees of autonomy and collective protection. While newsroom workers experience structural rigidity, independent creators—akin to freelance journalists—face intensified self-exploitation and financial risk through individualized branding and visibility pressures. Neoliberal platform capitalism reconfigures journalism labor around precarity, entrepreneurialism, and self-management, underscoring the need for sustainable public interventions to safeguard journalism’s democratic role.",

The theory of Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy describes three orientations social media users may display toward far-right content: endorsement of far-right content, ambivalence toward far-right content, or rejection of far-right content. Based on this theory, we created a survey measure in which participants were asked to rate their likelihood of responding in various ways to hypothetical social media posts that included far-right dog whistles. Our sample of 14 young adults aged 18–24 consisted of 57% Black participants, 71% full-time students, and 71% people who worked at least part-time. We conducted cognitive interviews to examine how participants interpreted these scenarios and their response items. Findings revealed the measure’s overall effectiveness and identified actionable revisions. This study can inform future measure development based on Anti-Oppressive Social Media Literacy.",

Conceptually, the article draws on key feminist perspectives, which have, over the past decades, been vital for turning sexual misconduct into a central issue of public concern. Our analysis of Dutch public broadcasting (1984–2019) and Twitter (2011–2019) reveals that Dutch television consistently advocated feminist perspectives and framed sexual misconduct as a national problem rooted in ‘internal’ structural failures. By contrast, Twitter discourse, particularly since 2015, was dominated by far-right rhetoric, framing the issue as an ‘external’ cultural threat linked to Islam and immigration. #MeToo was not visible in the dominant Twitter discourse on sexual misconduct but did appear on public television. Nevertheless, Dutch public broadcasters’ feminist agenda remained limited, failing to debunk the hypervisible racist and Islamophobic perpetrator myths circulating on Dutch social media.",

Yet, emerging discussions regarding toxic positivity (TP) suggest that positivity can backfire, showing the limits of emotional contagion. Through the perspective of neoliberal self-help ideology, this research investigated how people understand and perceive TP. Study 1 found, via focus groups, that social media posts containing TP involve two message characteristics—overgeneralization and commanding words—and two psychological processes—ignoring negativity and perceived poster privilege. Additionally, post ephemerality mitigates the negative effects of TP. Study 2 experimentally tested these findings. It found that the effect of post positivity (low positivity / high positivity / toxic positivity message characteristics) on post liking was mediated by ignoring negativity and perceived privilege . However, ephemerality did not moderate the aforementioned mediation relationships. Therefore, the concepts associated with TP—overgeneralization, commanding words, ignoring negativity, and perceived privilege—can be understood as boundary conditions for online emotional contagion.",

However, little education research has been done on how adolescents in general – including Black adolescents – learn the skills involved in these activities. Through analyzing data from the nationally representative National Survey of Critical Digital Literacy, this 7-day daily diary study found that Black and Latinx youth reported significantly higher daily frequencies of practicing critical race digital literacy skills than their White counterparts. Enactment of these skills also varied by day of the week and was reported more on weekdays than on weekends. These findings show that Black adolescents have practices of critical digital literacy skills they can build upon, and suggest White adolescents need additional support in developing these skills.",

Likes and affirming replies were commonplace, whereas Dislikes and negation replies were rare. Getting Likes and affirming replies decreased subsequent toxicity in the short term, as did getting no responses whatsoever. Getting Dislikes increased the hatefulness of users’ next original post and their posts over the next 3 months. Results challenge both the social approval theory of online hate and the need-threat approach to effects of responses to social media hate posting.",

          "authors": "John Tapper, Carolyn Bronstein",
          "abstract": "This article theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the article reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between children’s digital play and well-being remains under-researched, with debates often polarised and limited by a lack of holistic studies in diverse global contexts. This article draws on empirical data from an ecoculturally informed study of children’s (6–12) digital play in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and Cyprus to examine how individual and contextual circumstances influence children’s self-led digital play choices and practices. To do so, we theorise ‘contextualised digital play drivers’, understood as children’s own accounts, or adults’ interpretations, of the deep interests, needs and desires their play appears to fulfil. This approach moves beyond dominant lenses focused on individual autonomy, offering a more situated reading acknowledging the individual and contextual circumstances shaping digital play. Eleven contextualised digital play drivers are identified and discussed in relation to children’s well-being. The article concludes with implications for game designers, educators, families, policy and research methodology.",

          "authors": "Yanqing Sun",
          "abstract": "Although AI-driven fact-checking has been extensively applied on social media, it is unclear whether presenting AI rather than humans (e.g. social media platform administrators) as a fact-checker will affect people’s credibility perceptions of misinformation. Furthermore, most studies on machine heuristics have mainly focused on the positive machine heuristic and neglected the negative machine heuristic. In this study, a between-subjects online experiment was conducted to address these gaps in knowledge. The results show that presenting AI rather than platform administrators as fact-checkers indirectly led participants to perceive false short-form health videos as more credible via the mediation of the negative machine heuristic rather than the positive machine heuristic. In addition, among participants who initially held a stronger belief in misinformation, the fact-checking provided by AI (vs administrator) generated even more negative machine heuristic, which further led them to perceive the false videos as more credible.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how newspapers socially construct the topics of digital exclusion and inclusion in Flanders (Belgium) against a backdrop of substantial governmental investments in digitalization. Using critical discourse analysis, we examined how Flemish newspaper media (March 2020–March 2023) represented digital exclusion as a social problem, the proposed solutions of digital inclusion, and the actors portrayed as responsible for implementing these solutions. Our findings reveal that newspaper coverage predominantly frames digital inclusion through a neoliberal and techno-solutionist lens, emphasizing a “strong digital society” and attributing responsibility to “digitally unskilled” individuals to adapt. However, we also identified a counter-discourse which focuses on structural inequalities, digital access barriers, and the notion of responsible and sustainable digitalization. We argue that the prevailing neoliberal framing risks reinforcing exclusion rather than fostering inclusivity. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.",

Users’ assumption of these influences raises for them critical concerns about privacy, transparency, information insularity, targeted data manipulation, and the reproduction of societal biases in Autocomplete’s outputs. My analysis also shows that users view explanations as a promising mechanism to enhance accountability in Autocomplete systems. I highlight the factors that shape users’ mental models of Autocomplete and discuss how their algorithmic imaginaries stabilize platforms’ revenue models.",

How does this cue affect readers’ perceptions of the source and content of the post? To investigate this, we conducted a four-condition (user location: Beijing vs. Guizhou vs. the United States vs. no location) between-subjects online experiment ( N = 240) that examined how the displayed location of a social media user influenced viewers’ psychological responses to online self-disclosure messages. We also tested for two psychological mediators: perceived homophily and perceived spatial distance. We found that the displayed location of the poster (i.e., the individual who makes the social media post) affected readers’ perceived homophily and in turn their responses (empathy, source liking, perceived social distance) to support-seeking self-disclosure messages on social media.

Analyzing more than 20 million block log entries from 2004 to 2024, the study identifies shifts in block frequency, duration, and stated rationales. A significant increase in preemptive, automated blocking of open proxies since 2020 accounts for most block activity, but excluding these reveals a broader trend toward longer blocks and vaguer rationales such as “disruption.” These patterns suggest that volunteers are scaling labor through automation and normative adjustment, trading openness for efficiency and stability. Wikipedia’s blocking trends help to contextualize governance pressures on volunteer-run knowledge platforms.",

However, this need not be the path forward. We argue that now is an opportune time for greater policy emphasis on collaborative robots, or “cobots,” which are designed to complement rather than replace manual labor while raising productivity. To realize this potential, policies must properly align incentives, support training, and address often overlooked issues such as monitoring and privacy. Through an interdisciplinary lens, we examine the current state of cobot deployment and describe how well‐designed job tasks, paired with carefully integrated cobots, can preserve employment opportunities while improving ergonomics and enhancing productivity. Strategic policy measures aimed at redirecting investments can balance manufacturers' needs while ensuring stable employment, higher wages, and safer workplaces. With informed and deliberate policy, the adoption of cobots can mark a new phase of technological progress while averting the costly dislocations that accompanied past automation and offshoring.",

          "abstract": "The United States spends more than $4 trillion per year on health care, largely conducted by private providers and reimbursed by insurers. A major concern in this system is overbilling and fraud by hospitals, who face incentives to misreport their claims to receive higher payments. In this work, we develop novel machine learning tools to identify hospitals that overbill insurers, which can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious hospitals for both public and private health insurance systems. Using large‐scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, we identify patterns consistent with fraud among inpatient hospitalizations. Our proposed approach for fraud detection is fully unsupervised, not relying on any labeled training data, and is explainable to end users, providing interpretations for which diagnosis, procedure, and billing codes lead to hospitals being labeled suspicious. Using newly collected data from the Department of Justice on hospitals facing anti‐fraud lawsuits, and case studies of suspicious hospitals, we validate our approach and findings. Our method provides a nearly fivefold lift over random targeting of hospitals. We also perform a postanalysis to understand which hospital characteristics, not used for detection, are associated with suspiciousness.",

          "authors": "Larry L. Orr",
          "abstract": "Policymakers are often urged to rely on “evidence‐based policy” (EBP)—adopting only interventions proven effective (i.e., positive and statistically significant in multisite impact evaluations). EBP clearinghouses chronicle and rate tests of social policy interventions. But EBP clearinghouse standards are based almost entirely on internal validity. They largely ignore whether research findings from multisite trials apply to individual localities, where much of social policy is formulated. We develop a Bayesian model of the probability that the EBP rule is sound advice to local policymakers. The model allows a direct test of the probability of a correct policy decision under the EBP rule, its positive predictive value (PPV), and its negative predictive value (NPV)—the probabilities that an intervention deemed effective by that rule will in fact be effective in a particular site (PPV), and that an intervention deemed ineffective will not be effective in a particular site (NPV), given the true impact of the intervention. These intuitive, easily calculated probabilities are major contributions of this paper. In our illustrative analysis of six multisite randomized trials, we find that under the EBP clearinghouse rule the probability of a correct policy decision, PPV, and NPV are all unacceptably low unless the cross‐site impact heterogeneity is quite low.",

          "abstract": "We evaluate the effects of the nationwide transition in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) from paper vouchers to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards on store decisions to seek authorization to accept WIC benefits. We combine novel administrative data from “The Integrity Profile” (USDA administrative data on stores participating in WIC and their WIC reimbursements) with new nationwide policy data on WIC EBT implementation. Using a staggered adoption difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that the transition had heterogeneous and occasionally unanticipated effects across states. The number of WIC‐authorized independent vendors declined 10% following WIC EBT implementation. We find no significant effect of WIC EBT implementation on WIC redemptions in a subset of ZIP codes with sufficient vendors for data sharing. Vendors in states that were early adopters of WIC EBT have more negative effects on the probability of WIC authorization, which may be due to learning effects or improvements in technology over time. Past experience with EBT implementation by financial services providers hired by states to help them implement WIC EBT processing (processors) reduces the magnitude of these negative effects of EBT implementation on store participation in WIC.",

This study addresses this gap by examining elite interviewing practices and transparency using an original dataset of articles published in 13 leading political science journals between 2000 and 2023. Drawing on article content and supplementary materials, I analyze trends in the use and quality of elite interviews, highlighting an increasing reliance on this method, particularly in comparative politics. Findings show promising improvements in reporting practices over time. Systematic reporting and the inclusion of online appendices significantly enhance transparency, offering detailed insights into ethical considerations, confidentiality, and data-sharing practices.

          "abstract": "International organizations (IOs) are considered ideal scapegoats for opportunistic member state governments. Yet we know surprisingly little about whether and when governments indeed shift blame onto IOs. We argue that IO scapegoating is not as pervasive as commonly assumed because blaming IOs is costly. Blaming IOs undermines governments’ credibility and threatens their cooperation gains. To reap cooperation gains, governments can instead defend the IO and bear public discontent. We theorize a Cooperation-Contestation Trade-Off that explains when governments blame or defend IOs: governments that rely heavily on international cooperation are more likely to defend IOs while governments that expect costly domestic contestation are more likely to blame them. We assess our theory by examining governments’ communication about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – an IO commonly assumed to be a perfect scapegoat. With an originally collected dataset of more than 800 statements referring to the IMF made by heads of governments in major IMF borrower countries, we find supportive evidence for our expectations. Crucially, we observe that whilst governments do frequently blame the IMF, they in fact defend the Fund more than they blame it. Our findings yield important implications for international cooperation in times of heightened politicization of IOs.",

Sometimes, potential participants may be “hard to reach”—for example, they are physically located in remote areas where the lack of infrastructure necessitates extensive travel and/or difficult logistics. Alternatively, they may be “vulnerable” due to disenfranchisement (incarcerated populations), stigma (those living with HIV/AIDS), or at risk if they share their experiences (people living in authoritarian states). Or participants may be “hidden”—that is, no record of their experiences exists, which, in turn, makes it difficult to find and recruit them (Ellard-Gray et al. 2015). 1",

          "abstract": "This article examines how Latina Republican Congressional candidates frame themselves as both embodying and representing the “real Latino electorate,” who they claim has been ignored in the U.S. political arena. In this article, I engage in an in-depth analysis of these candidates — including content analyses of their public interviews, speeches, advertisements, websites, newspaper coverage, and social media presences — in four border districts in Texas. I find that the ways in which these candidates strategically reframe Latinidad and the immigrant experience to align with Republican ideology allow these candidates to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform while simultaneously engaging in the Latino threat narrative that dehumanizes the very community they claim to represent. More specifically, these candidates articulate an alternate, intersectional vision of Latinidad which presents Latino immigrant women and children as victims, Latino immigrant men as criminals, and themselves as unique authorities on immigration given their status as border patrol wives. These candidates’ race-gender consciousness also allows these candidates to express political anger, which has generally been denied to women of color in the Republican Party. In so doing, they offer a pointed critique claiming that Latinos are a captured group in American political parties.",

          "abstract": "Transnational private institutions (TPIs) operate at the intersection of technocratic efficiency and democratic accountability, raising important questions about when and why they adopt particular legitimation strategies. This study theorizes and empirically examines the role of regulatory issue area as an explanatory variable by analyzing the legitimation strategies of a prominent TPI: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which presents a unique case due to its expansion from technical to societal standard‐setting. Drawing on a two‐dimensional conceptual framework from the literature on international organizations and a novel dataset covering ISO's full standard portfolio, the study shows that ISO's legitimation strategies vary systematically depending on whether a standard addresses societal or physical issue areas. These findings reinforce the argument that issue area shapes the use of democratic and technocratic legitimation strategies among TPIs. The insights are especially relevant as TPIs increasingly engage in the governance of societal concerns, a development that, as this study suggests, significantly shapes how they seek legitimacy and merits further scholarly attention.",

          "abstract": "We approach public communication of bureaucratic organizations as a means of reputation management and argue that social media communication that abstains from making reference to other agencies is in line with a turf‐protective strategy, whereas communication that seeks to establish a link to other agencies is in line with a strategy to embrace new issues and expand policy competencies. Using climate policy communication by EU agencies on the social media platform Twitter (currently X), we show that agencies operating in policy fields traditionally linked to climate policy and holding a policy mandate refer less to their counterparts in their social media communication than agencies without such a climate mandate and operating in policy fields more recently linked to the issue. We find that agencies opt for either turf protective and risk‐averse or expansive and reputation‐building strategies, depending on what fits their interest best.",

          "authors": "Mandy B. Freund, Danielle C. Verdon‐Kidd, Kathryn J. Allen, Josephine R. Brown",
          "abstract": "The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) constitutes the largest single source of interannual climate variability on a global scale, yet our understanding of its characteristics is limited by a focus on the modern instrumental era. To study ENSO characteristics during the pre‐industrial era we rely on reconstructions of ENSO developed from a range of environmental proxies, documentary sources and palaeoclimate model simulations. Here we review the ENSO reconstructions from a range of sources covering the last millennium to assess characteristics of interannual ENSO variability and examine evidence for changes in ENSO characteristics over time. Despite differences in target variables (i.e., ENSO indices, seasonal window) and record durations, several reconstructions show broadly similar patterns, including periods of reduced ENSO variability in the mid 14th century, mid 18th and 19th centuries, whereas high variance periods were common around the early 14th, 15th and 19th century. Climate model simulations also exhibit modulation of ENSO amplitude over time. However, the extent to which this reflects a forced response remains uncertain. Key differences among reconstructions make it challenging to assess the likelihood of changes in ENSO event frequency or diversity. We suggest that ensembles of pre‐instrumental records, similar to climate model projections, may provide a way forward for improving our understanding of past ENSO variability. Future work that carefully selects or develops proxy records in a way that, for example, targets ENSO diversity or teleconnection stability over time will also lead to further progress.

          "authors": "Wout Jan‐Willem Sommerauer, Bregje van der Bolt, Saskia Werners, Wouter Julius Smolenaars, Fulco Ludwig",
          "abstract": "We examine how co‐creation and collaborative learning have been operationalized in climate adaptation pathway development over the past decade using a systematic review of 36 case study papers. While co‐creation and collaborative learning are increasingly recognized as important for effective adaptation planning, it remains unclear how different approaches can support adaptation goals. Our co‐creation analysis identifies three participation clusters: (i) information‐focused participation involving primarily one‐way knowledge extraction through interviews; (ii) researcher‐mediated participation featuring two‐way engagement through workshops, while researchers maintain process control; and (iii) co‐organized participation where stakeholders serve as co‐designers with defined leadership roles throughout the process. For collaborative learning, defined as structured knowledge exchange and capacity building among stakeholders, we distinguish between instrumental learning that emerges incidentally from stakeholder interaction versus process‐integrated learning that is explicitly designed and monitored throughout pathway development. Cases with co‐organized participation consistently aligned with process‐integrated learning, suggesting these approaches can be mutually beneficial. Analysis of reported impacts (including policy implementation, follow‐up research, and capacity building outcomes) reveals that more extensive participation combined with organized learning correlates with a greater likelihood of impacts. This review contributes to the growing body of knowledge on stakeholder engagement in adaptation pathways planning, and while the identified participation clusters and learning approaches offer systematic guidance for methodology selection, they should be viewed as flexible frameworks rather than prescriptive categories, adaptable to specific contexts and planning objectives.

A recent process is atlantification, the growing influence of warm and salty waters from the Atlantic on the Arctic with increasing ocean volume transport from the Nordic Seas to the Barents Sea playing a key role. Despite its importance and a multitude of hypotheses that have been tested, this trend remains mainly unexplained. Here we explore nonlinear effects and successfully link the flow trend through the Barents Sea Opening to a frequency shift of atmospheric synoptic. We show that a part of the flow through Barents Sea Opening is driven by topographic Rossby waves, and that they have a very sensitive response to atmospheric frequency over the Nordic Seas. These findings highlight how anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere are altering ocean processes, with implications for sea-ice extent and ecosystems in the Arctic.",

          "abstract": "Models of speech perception are centered around a hierarchy in which auditory representations in the thalamus propagate to primary auditory cortex, then to the lateral temporal cortex, and finally through lateral cortical areas to reach the frontal lobe. However, it is unclear if speech-evoked activity in frontal cortex strictly reflects downstream processing from this hierarchical pathway or whether there are long-range parallel connections from the low-level areas (thalamus, primary auditory cortex) to the frontal lobe. Here, we used high-density direct cortical recordings, high-resolution diffusion tractography, and hemodynamic functional connectivity to evaluate for evidence of direct parallel inputs to frontal cortex from low-level areas. We found that neural populations in the frontal lobe show speech-evoked responses that are synchronous with the shortest-latency responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and encode spectrotemporal speech content indistinguishable from spectrotemporal encoding patterns observed in the STG. Additionally, we find white matter tractography and functional connectivity patterns that connect the auditory nucleus of the thalamus and the primary auditory cortex to the frontal lobe. Together, these results support the existence of robust long-range parallel inputs from low-level auditory areas to apical areas in the frontal lobe of the human speech network.",

We develop surveillance for events of interest in label-free microscopy using dynamics-informed neural networks that trigger smart fluorescence acquisitions upon detection. This allows us to dramatically reduce phototoxic damage while obtaining specific and functional information from fluorescence when beneficial. We demonstrate how hybrid-EDA enables improved imaging acquisitions of organelle contacts and mitochondrial divisions.

However, the presence of high-density domains with varying polarization directions can severely degrade comprehensive performance. Here, we fabricate high-quality SrAl 11-δ TiO 19 (SATO) ferroelectric films through a solid-state reaction. The SATO film possesses a magnetoplumbite-type structure with polarization along the c-axis and exhibits the possibility of single-domain ferroelectrics. Ferroelectric performance tests show that the remnant polarization of SATO film reaches 7.8 μC/cm 2 and the polarization retention exceeds 500 hours. Optoelectronic performance measurements reveal that the SATO photodetector exhibits excellent performance with response wavelength of 330 nm, responsivity of 860 mA/W, detectivity of 1.63 × 10 13 Jones, switching ratio of 1.9 × 10 4 , and ultrafast rise/fall response speed of 6.8 ns/17.7 ns ( i.e ., nearly 10000 times faster than traditional photodetectors). The outstanding properties highlight SATO as an outstanding candidate for next-generation photodetectors.",

Herein, we report a tunable enantioselective electrolytic system for dehydrogenative allylation, dehydrogenative alkenylation, and hydroalkylation reactions with identical substrates to afford structurally diverse products. This success hinges on the rational design of the stereoselective coupling of an electrogenerated nickel-bound α-carbonyl radical species that can trap unactivated alkenes and engage in various subsequent radical termination processes to enable the intermolecular functionalization of unactivated alkenes. The mild reaction conditions and sustainable electrocatalytic radical platform guarantee excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with unactivated alkenes (63 examples, up to 98% e.e.), and the process evolves H₂ without the need for external chemical oxidants. The utility of this enantioselective electrolytic strategy is demonstrated by its application in the stereoselective formal synthesis of ( S )-SYK inhibitor, signifying substantial progress in synthetic methods.",

Our results indicate that, despite fluctuations in ventilation strength in the Labrador Sea over the past decades, the North Atlantic waters are generally aging.

In this work, we demonstrate a bunched photon source at telecom wavelength, incorporated in a photon-counting LIDAR system, which determines distances by measuring the second-order correlation. The source is a sub-threshold laser spectrally filtered to extend coherence time, producing an oscillating g (2) curve with an enhanced bunching peak. Utilizing this oscillating bunching increases the signal-to-noise ratio and decreases the number of correlation events required to perform a measurement. This system achieves 2 ps resolution in both fiber-based and free-space measurements with up to 65 dB attenuation and ranges up to 87 km in optical fibers. Our approach demonstrates the possibility of increasing the bunching of classical light sources and improving their usability for LIDAR.",

Conventional methods, limited to standalone reduction or oxidation processes, typically achieve low Faradaic efficiencies (&lt;40%) and yields (&lt;0.2 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²). Here, we present a tandem reaction system coupling cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation in a full-cell electrolyzer to enhance acetamide production. At the cathode, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite, which subsequently oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. This acetaldehyde reacts in situ with electrogenerated ammonia to form α-aminoethanol. The intermediate is then transported to the anode, where it undergoes oxidation to yield acetamide. The reaction pathway is confirmed through proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing efficient acetamide synthesis with a yield of 7.2 ± 0.3 mmol h⁻¹ (0.45 ± 0.02 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²) at a cell voltage of 2.4 V. Furthermore, the strategy extends to other amides, such as formamide and butyramide, underscoring its versatility. Techno-economic analysis highlights the viability of this route, with estimated production costs competitive against conventional thermal processes.",

Disruption can expose N-terminal degrons that trigger ubiquitin-mediated degradation, safeguarding the proteome. N-terminal acetylation usually protects proteins from degradation, but can also promote it through the Ac/N-degron pathway. Src-family kinases (SFKs), signaling enzymes implicated in tumorigenesis, require N-terminal myristoylation for function. Using peptide pull-downs, mass spectrometry, and AlphaFold 3 predictions, we identify DCAF10 as the E3 ligase substrate receptor for alternatively N-terminally acetylated SFKs. Combining siRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of endogenous Lyn with inducible Lyn-GFP variants confirms that DCAF10 regulates SFK levels by recognizing an N-terminal acetylated glycine residue. In vitro, a CUL4A-DDB1-DCAF10 complex ubiquitinates N-terminally acetylated SFKs. Thus, we define a novel N-degron pathway that monitors replacement of myristoylation by acetylation and activates degradation of SFKs upon acetylation. This mechanism may extend to other N-terminally myristoylated proteins beyond SFKs.",

Comparing high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), matched for time and workload, we identify versatile changes in the proteomic makeup of PBMCs and reveal profound alterations, related to effector function and immune cell activation pathways within one hour following exercise. These changes are more pronounced after HIIE compared to MICE and occur despite identical immune cell mobilization patterns between the two exercise conditions. We further identify an immunoproteomic signature that effectively predicts cardiorespiratory fitness, thus allowing insights into potential exercise-triggered adaptations and immunological health benefits that are mediated by exercise. This study provides a reliable data resource that expands our knowledge on how exercise modulates the immune system, and delivers biological evidence supporting the WHO 2020 guidelines, which highlight exercise intensity as a relevant factor to maintain health.",

When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density, $${S}_{I}/{I}^{2}$$ S I / I 2 , decreases linearly with current, $$I$$ I — a striking departure from the constant value of $${S}_{I}/{I}^{2}$$ S I / I 2 , observed in conventional conductors. No residual minimum noise level is reached for the current of the electron-lattice condensate in (TaSe 4 ) 2 I nanowires. Repeating the measurements for another charge-density wave conductor, NbS 3 -II, we found a similar reduction below the normal electron limit at room temperature.

In this study, we characterize H5N1 cross-reactive antibody landscapes in the current population (#NCT05794412 and #NCT01022905) and assess the effect of AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 and non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccination on H5N1 cross-neutralizing and IgG antibody titers targeting a range of influenza virus-derived antigens. We detect H5N1 cross-neutralizing antibodies using a vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudovirus system that correlate well with antibodies inhibiting the spread of authentic H5N1 viruses, anti-group 1 hemagglutinin stalk and anti-trimeric hemagglutinin antibodies. Additionally, we find that AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccination increases H5N1 cross-reactive antibodies significantly in a pandemic H1N1 immunologically partially naïve population. Furthermore, we show that immune imprinting causes distinct H5N1 cross-reactive antibody patterns pre-vaccination.",

Our work helps close the gap between these two regimes by designing an efficient quantum algorithm for learning periodic neurons in the QSQ model over a variety of non-uniform distributions and the first explicit treatment of real-valued functions. We prove that this problem is hard not only for classical gradient-based algorithms, which are the workhorses of machine learning, but also for a more general class of SQ algorithms, establishing an exponential quantum advantage.",

Here, we focus on identifying the specific profibrotic Shroom3 motif and separating this from its anti-proteinuric function. Given the role for Rho-kinases (Rock) in TIF, and the interaction of Rock with Shroom3 ASD2-domain, we hypothesized that Shroom3-mediated Rock-activation is crucial for profibrotic function. To test this, we develop transgenic tools that overexpress wild-type- (WT-Sh3) or ASD2-domain deletion- Shroom3 (ASD2Δ-Sh3). During TIF, Shroom3 and Rock co-expression occur in injured tubular cells and fibroblasts. In tubular- &amp; fibroblast- lines, ASD2Δ-Sh3 overexpression reduce Rock activation, and pro-fibrotic/pro-inflammatory transcripts downstream of TGFβ1/Wnt/Ctnnb1-signaling vs WT-Sh3. In vivo, inducible global-, or tubular-specific-, but not fibroblast-specific-, ASD2Δ-Sh3 overexpression mitigate TIF, vs WT-Sh3 overexpression. Importantly, ASD2Δ-Sh3 mice do not develop albuminuria, while overexpression of a distinct Fyn-binding deficient mutant Shroom3 (FBDM-Sh3) induces albuminuria. We then develop small molecule inhibitors of Shroom3-Rock interaction (P2Is) and confirm Rock inhibition with these agents in WT-Sh3 cell lines. Our lead P2I from these studies, BT1137, mitigates Rock-activation, profibrotic signaling and TIF in WT-Sh3 mice. Hence, we delineate the profibrotic Shroom3 motif and develop therapeutics for kidney disease from Shroom3 excess.",

          "abstract": "Genetic modules are often designed and implemented with inspiration from engineering disciplines. Although this approach can be successful because of the similarities underpinning physical and biochemical systems, it neglects a key factor that affects the performance of living organisms: evolution. Thus, it is crucial to incorporate the impact of inevitable mutations into the design and analysis of genetic modules. Combining computational modeling and in vivo mutagenesis experiments in Escherichia coli , we characterize how the interplay of gene dosage via plasmid copy number (PCN) and regulatory architecture affect the phenotypic mutation rate. For example, while greater PCN facilitates the emergence of gain-of-function mutations, it instead curbs the spread of loss-of-function mutations. We further reveal that mutations in the coding region are often masked at the phenotypic level, unlike those occurring in the regulatory region which become more prominent as PCN increases, both when the regulator is expressed constitutively and when it is self-repressed. Together, our results shed light on evolutionary organizing principles and aid the rational design of both evolutionarily stable and highly evolvable biocircuits.",

This convenient abstraction mirrors classical computations manipulating bits. It allows for a device-independent development of algorithmic primitives. Here we argue that an alternative approach centered on the physical setup can yield great benefits. As an example, we consider hybrid qubit-oscillator systems with linear optics operations augmented by certain qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. The continuous variable Fourier transform and certain arithmetic operations have native realizations in such systems. We put this to algorithmic use and give a polynomial-time quantum factoring algorithm which uses only one qubit and three oscillators, independent of the number being factored.",

          "abstract": "A widespread biological phenomenon is that higher reproduction rates are often accompanied by higher mortality. During tumor progression, variants can both reproduce and die faster; rapidly replicating viruses decay more quickly; arthropods with faster reproduction have shorter lifespans; and in ecological systems, more frequent reproduction can increase predation risk. Variants with proportionally scaled birth and death rates are termed quasi-neutral mutants . Although their lifetime reproductive success is unchanged, such mutants have fixation probabilities slightly lower (or higher) than neutral mutants if birth and death rates are proportionally larger (or smaller). Previous studies, limited to well-mixed populations, showed that quasi-neutral mutants deviate from neutrality but still exhibit fixation probabilities scaling with their initial frequencies. Here, we show that in deme- or spatially structured populations, variants with proportionally increased (decreased) birth and death rates become genuinely disadvantageous (advantageous). We calculate their effective fitness and further demonstrate that even when mutants have higher lifetime reproductive output, proportional increases in both birth and death rates can render them strongly disadvantageous—and vice versa. This effect intensifies in larger populations. These findings revise the relationship between lifetime reproductive success and selection, with implications for evolutionary dynamics across biological systems.",

Central to these advances are hyperbolic polaritons—nanometer-scale light-matter waves—spanning multiple energy-momentum dispersion orders with distinct mode profiles and incrementally high optical momenta. In this work, we report the mode conversion of hyperbolic polaritons across different dispersion orders by breaking the structure symmetry in engineered step-shape van der Waals (vdW) terraces. The mode conversion from the fundamental to high-order hyperbolic polaritons is imaged using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) on both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO 3 ) vdW terraces. Our s-SNOM data, augmented with electromagnetics simulations, further demonstrate the alteration of polariton mode conversion by varying the step size of vdW terraces. The mode conversion reported here offers a practical approach toward integrating previously independent different-order hyperbolic polaritons with ultra-high momenta, paving the way for promising applications in nano-optical circuits, sensing, computation, information processing, and super-resolution imaging.",

          "abstract": "Enveloped viruses are significant zoonotic disease threats with the potential to cause global pandemics. We identified a class of small-molecule sulfur-containing antiviral compounds (XM series) that broadly inhibit enveloped viruses. Multidisciplinary approaches revealed that XM compounds alter the viral membrane lipid chemical composition, enhance membrane order within the hydrophobic bilayer, and increase membrane phase transition temperatures. This mechanism inhibits membrane fusion and viral entry, while leaving the viral glycoproteins and genomes largely unaffected. Leveraging these unique properties, we develop a proof-of-concept whole inactivated influenza virus (IIV) vaccine using XM-01 (XM-01-IIV). In a mouse model, XM-01-IIV elicit significantly enhanced neutralizing antibody responses against hemagglutinin and neuraminidase compared to traditional paraformaldehyde-inactivated vaccines. Further, XM-01-IIV reduces morbidity and mortality following influenza challenge, achieving protection comparable to live virus vaccination. This promising class of broadly acting antivirals can be highly impactful in the development of highly potent inactivated vaccines for enveloped viruses.",

Using satellite data, we show that, globally, the mean rain rate of TCs increases by over 20% from 60 hours before landfall to the time of landfall. This increase occurs across hemispheres, ocean basins, intensity categories, and latitudes, although the magnitude varies. As a TC approaches the coast, land-sea thermal contrasts raise low-level humidity over land, while frictional differences enhance convergence, upward motion, and instability on the offshore side of the circulation. These conditions collectively promote increased convection and precipitation of TCs as they near landfall. Our findings critically strengthen the current understanding of TC precipitation dynamics and support more effective flood management.",

          "abstract": "Fungal parasites are associated with bloom-forming algae, yet their impact on N 2 fixation and the fate of newly fixed nitrogen during cyanobacterial blooms is poorly understood. We report infections on the ecologically important N 2 -fixing cyanobacterium Dolichospermum (formerly Anabaena ) in the Baltic Sea. Using single-cell isotope probing, microscopy, and biogeochemical analyses, we examine how infections affect carbon and N 2 fixation and elemental transfer within a natural community. Fungal sporangia infect up to 80% of filaments, mostly targeting storage cells (akinetes, 82% prevalence) and N 2 -fixing cells (heterocytes, 44%), but rarely vegetative cells (5%). Infections at akinete–heterocyte junctions extract 4- and 10-fold more carbon and nitrogen than those on vegetative cells, reducing host storage by 28% and 56%. Overall, 22% of newly fixed nitrogen is transferred to fungi, comparable to heterotrophic bacteria. Infections also occur in Nodularia and Aphanizomenon , suggesting fungi-like parasitism broadly affects bloom dynamics and the fate of new nitrogen.",

          "abstract": "The collective vibrational and magnetic response of a solid to external stimuli is encoded in the dispersion relations of phonons and magnons, respectively. Recently, the coherent drive and nonlinear manipulation of collective lattice and magnetic excitations via laser pulses has been explored, as a route to control the non-equilibrium properties of quantum materials. Device concepts that leverage coupled multiphysical dynamics must exhibit laser-induced frequency tunability controllable through external parameters. Although previous works have shown that optically driven excitations in the midinfrared can manipulate magnon frequencies, inducing deterministic red- or blue-shifts of the magnon frequency in the same material is still elusive. Here we demonstrate this concept in a nanometer-thick magnet at room temperature. Visible light pulses in combination with an external magnetic field (&lt;200 mT) can either raise or lower the magnon frequency by up to 40% of its original value. This effect results from the interplay of the optical excitation, magnetic anisotropy and external magnetic field. Our results show how an efficient manipulation of magnons can be achieved by light and provide perspectives for the realization of logic devices optically reconfigurable on the nanosecond timescale.",

High-performing machine learning models hold potential for addressing this gap, but their uncharacterized prediction performance across the wider range of chemicals undermines confidence in their results. We develop uncertainty-aware models to predict reproductive/developmental and general non-cancer human toxicity effect doses. Our well-calibrated models provide uncertainty estimates aligned with observed prediction errors and chemical familiarity. We predict toxicity with 95% confidence intervals for &gt;100,000 globally marketed chemicals and identify toxicity and uncertainty hotspots. These results can be applied to inform decisions aimed at reducing potential human health impacts and guide targeted data generation and modeling efforts to reduce prediction uncertainty. Here, we show that enhancing transparency in prediction uncertainty provides key insights for building confidence in toxicity predictions, supporting the sound integration of machine learning-based predictions in chemical assessments.",

          "abstract": "The continuous renewal of the skin relies on stem and progenitor cells, yet their differential susceptibility to oncogenic mutations in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains unclear. Rapid cSCC develops in melanoma patients on BRAF inhibitors due to paradoxical MAPK activation. To model this in mice, we use two complementary approaches: HRAS G12V with a BRAF inhibitor to mimic paradoxical MAPK activation, and BRAF V600E , which drives MAPK hyperactivation without further treatment. We target these mutations to the interfollicular stem and differentiation-committed progenitors of the basal epidermis. While stem cells rapidly form tumours, progenitors exhibit long-latency resistance despite retaining mutations and repopulating the basal layer. Ultimately, both populations produce similar tumours, showing a shared transformation process. However, SOX2 is uniquely upregulated in progenitor-derived tumours and is expressed in 20% of human cSCC, indicating it might mark tumours arising from committed progenitors. Here, we show that SOX2 overexpression, along with MAPK activation, in progenitors induces a stem-like state and renders this otherwise resistant population permissive to rapid transformation.",

          "abstract": "The ubiquitous CLC membrane transporters are unique in their ability to exchange anions for cations. Despite extensive study, there is no mechanistic model that fully explains their 2:1 Cl ‒ /H + stoichiometric exchange mechanism. Here, we provide such a model. Using differential hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, cryo-EM structure determination, and molecular dynamics simulations, we uncovered conformational dynamics in CLC-ec1, a bacterial CLC homolog that has served as a paradigm for this family of transporters. Simulations based on a cryo-EM structure at pH 3 revealed critical steps in the transport mechanism, including release of Cl ‒ ions to the extracellular side, opening of the inner gate, and water wires that facilitate H + transport. Surprisingly, these water wires occurred independently of Cl ‒ binding, prompting us to reassess the relationship between Cl ‒ binding and Cl ‒ /H + coupling. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and quantitative flux assays on mutants with reduced Cl ‒ binding affinity, we conclude that, while Cl ‒ binding is necessary for coupling, even weak binding can support Cl ‒ /H + coupling. By integrating our findings with existing literature, we establish a complete and efficient CLC 2:1 Cl ‒ /H + exchange mechanism.",

In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of fecal microbiome metagenomic data, paired with granular dietary assessments and phenotypic profiles, across a cohort of 818 children (462 with ASD, 356 without ASD; mean age = 8.4 years; 27.3% female). By integrating dietary indices, nutrient intake, and food additive exposures, we uncovered ASD-specific linkages to the microbiome. Poor dietary quality correlated with aggregated core autistic symptoms, gastrointestinal complications, and atypical eating behaviors. Notably, children with ASD exhibited a more pronounced diet-microbiome interaction network compared to neurotypical peers, suggesting heightened microbial sensitivity to nutritional inputs. Furthermore, synthetic emulsifiers—specifically polysorbate-80 and carrageenan—were associated with disrupted microbial connectivity in ASD, a phenomenon attenuated in neurotypical children. Our findings elucidate the mechanistic links between dietary factors—particularly synthetic food additives—and microbiome dysregulation in ASD, urging a re-evaluation of dietary guidelines for ASD populations and laying the groundwork for personalized nutritional strategies.",

NeuralMD employs a physics-informed, multi-grained, group-symmetric framework comprising (1) BindingNet, which enforces symmetry via vector frames and captures multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an augmented neural differential equation solver that learns trajectories under Newtonian mechanics. Across ten single-trajectory and three multi-trajectory tasks, NeuralMD achieves up to 15 × lower reconstruction error and 70% higher validity than existing ML baselines. The predicted oscillations closely align with ground-truth dynamics, establishing NeuralMD as a foundation for next-generation protein-ligand simulation research.",

Experimental realization of this effect has remained elusive because opposite surface contributions typically cancel. We engineered magnetic axion insulator heterostructures using molecular beam epitaxy. By positioning the Fermi level asymmetrically, we isolated one topological surface state within the magnetic gap while displacing the other into a metallic regime. This technique reliably produced a half-quantized layer-resolved AHC of e ²/2 h , termed the half-quantized layer Hall effect (LHE), across both parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations in over ten devices. Our findings provide direct electrical evidence of the half-quantized LHE, a boundary signature of the quantized axion field in the bulk, which resolves a key challenge in the experimental verification of this topological quantum state and establishes a framework for spatially engineering quantized topological response.",

          "abstract": "Neuromorphic photonics enables brain-inspired information processing with higher bandwidth and lower energy consumption than traditional electronics, addressing the growing computational demands of the Internet of Things, cloud services, and edge computing. However, even current state-of-the-art electronic and photonic platforms are incapable of delivering the scalable throughput, multitasking processing, and energy efficiency required by these applications. Here, we demonstrate a tunable photonic reservoir computing device based on a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM), leveraging a time-delayed, single-unit, all-optical architecture. By combining dense temporal encoding with wavelength-division multiplexing, the system supports concurrent multitasking across independent data channels, enabling scalable computational performance without additional hardware complexity. Experiments and theoretical validation on classification and prediction benchmarks demonstrate the device’s performance, achieving a throughput of 20 tera-operations-per-second and an energy efficiency of 4.4 fJ per operation. These results highlight a promising path towards reconfigurable, compact, and high-performance photonic processors for real-time intelligent applications.",

          "abstract": "The disturbance and relocation of coastal sediments by human activities constitutes a potentially large disruption to natural sediment and organic carbon fluxes, but large-scale estimates of these impacts are lacking. Here, we estimate the amounts of sediment and organic carbon disturbed and relocated in the North Sea resulting from (1) dredging in the form of mineral aggregate extraction and (2) material dumping during waterway maintenance. We show that despite disturbing less sediment than aggregate extraction, dumping causes greater carbon disturbance. We estimate carbon disturbance by both activities to be higher than by marine construction, but lower than by bottom-contacting fisheries. Simulations indicate that most dumped material re-deposits near the coast. Globally, dumping of organic carbon is estimated to 0.09–0.46 GtC yr −1 , and disturbance by material extraction to 0.04−0.08 GtC yr −1 . Comparison to natural processes suggests that these activities should be considered in regional to global sediment and carbon budgets.",

          "abstract": "Cancer detection is challenging, especially in patients with diffuse symptoms that overlap with non-malignant conditions. Here we show that plasma protein profiling can identify cancer among patients with non-specific symptoms. Using proximity extension assay-based proteomics of 1463 plasma proteins from 456 patients presenting with non-specific symptoms sampled prior to cancer diagnostic work-up and diagnosis, we identify 29 proteins associated with new cancer diagnoses. We develop a model able to stratify 160 cancer cases and 296 non-cancer cases with an area under the curve of 0.80, maintaining performance (0.82) in an independent replication cohort of 238 patients. The model also distinguishes cancer from autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. Designed as a triage tool, our model based on a blood test could help prioritize patients at higher cancer risk for rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic modalities such as positron emission tomography–computed tomography. These findings emphasize the potential of blood proteome profiling to support timely diagnosis and transform clinical medicine.",

In this work, we utilize temperature induced break and reconstruction of hydrogen bonds to drive the orientational motion and charge mobility of the ionic liquid [EtA⁺][NO₃⁻] in the poly-2-hydroxyethyl-acrylate, resulting controllable modulation of dielectric properties at microwave frequencies. Building on this mechanism, we applied machine learning algorithms to establish correlations between temperature, ionic liquid concentration, and dielectric constant, enabling the design of a reprogrammable dielectric microwave modulation surface. For example, the 2 mm-thick switchable microwave absorbing surfaces fabricated here can operate in two distinct modes during the temperature transition from low to high, namely, off-to-on and on-to-off. The corresponding tunable effective absorption bandwidths and reflection loss values reach 5.69 GHz, –6.04 dB to –46.21 dB, and 5.34 GHz, –50.48 dB to –6.47 dB, respectively. Using the developed active surface, we also demonstrate various device architectures fabricated by three-dimensional printing, including pixelated surfaces and self-sensing functionalities, which provide valuable guidance for the development of next-generation intelligent electromagnetic devices.",

Identifying these controlling factors helps constrain the potential updip extent of future megathrust ruptures. Here, we investigate the factors controlling the spatial extent of shallow slow earthquakes by integrating tremor locations with uncertainty estimates, detailed bathymetry data, and multichannel seismic data for the 2020–2021 slow earthquake sequence in the Kumano-nada region of the Nankai Trough. Tremor probability maps reveal that the updip, downdip, and lateral limits of tremor activity coincide with distinct structural boundaries. These include the kink or branching of the décollement, a deep-seated strike-slip fault, and the inner–outer wedge boundary. These structures likely act as geometrical or mechanical barriers, further influenced by variations in pore-fluid pressure and by the subducted Paleo–Zenisu ridge. The results indicate that megathrust geometry, material properties of the overriding prism, fluid distribution, and ridge subduction jointly govern the spatial extent of slow earthquakes, emphasizing the need to account for these factors in assessing the potential extent of future megathrust ruptures.",

Here we use depth-profiling positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy to study Sb 2 Se 3 crystals and thin films. The method is specific to neutral and negative charge states of vacancy-related defects. Both monovacancy and divacancy defects are identified in intrinsic and n-type samples but no monovacancy defects are detected in the p-type sample. Comparison of the experimental positron lifetimes with density functional theory calculated values provide evidence for the observation of Sb monovacancies in the –3 state and of Se monovacancies in the –2 state. The results are consistent with recent density function theory predictions that the Sb and the Se monovacancy defects both have accessible negative charge states.",

Our brain must account for the visual consequences of self-motion to perceive the 3D layout and motion of objects in a scene. We show that traditional models of visual compensation for eye movements fail when the eye both translates and rotates, and we propose a theory that computes both motion and depth in more natural viewing geometries. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, humans exhibit distinct perceptual biases when different viewing geometries are simulated by optic flow, and these biases occur without training or feedback. A neural network model trained to perform the same tasks suggests that viewing geometry modulates the joint tuning of neurons for retinal and eye velocity to mediate these adaptive computations. Our findings unify previously separate bodies of work by demonstrating that the brain adaptively perceives the dynamic 3D environment according to viewing geometry inferred from optic flow.",

ADGRL4 is upregulated in the tumour microenvironment and is implicated in tumour pathogenesis across a broad range of malignancies. Inhibiting ADGRL4 is a potential therapeutic treatment for currently intractable cancers such as glioblastoma. Previous work suggested that ADGRL4 does not signal through G protein coupled pathways. However, using a sensitive bioluminescent assay, we demonstrate here that ADGRL4 couples weakly to the heterotrimeric G protein G q , whilst there is no robust coupling to other G proteins (G s , G 12 , G o ) or β-arrestin 1 or 2. We determine the cryo-EM structure of ADGRL4 coupled to a heterotrimeric G q complex to a resolution of 3.1 Å. The overall fold of ADGRL4 is similar to that of other aGPCRs, but the coupling to G q is distinct with fewer interactions between the receptor and G protein. The structure is consistent with ADGRL4 being activated by its tethered agonist and represents an important step towards the development of potential inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumour types.",

Yet, the consequences for bee food resources remain poorly understood at continental scales. Here, we analyse 2 500 samples collected by honey bees ( Apis mellifera ) between May and August 2023 from 310 locations across Europe using ITS2 metabarcoding. We derive climatic response curves of floral resources and assess exceedance risks of interaction loss under projected climate scenarios. Our findings reveal that rising temperatures and reduced precipitation decrease the diversity of foraging resources across Europe, pushing many plants beyond critical limits. When both warming and drying coincide, the potential for resilience through temporal or spatial buffering is strongly constrained. These declines pose serious risks to bee nutrition, ecosystem functioning, and food security. Our study underscores the urgency of mitigating climate change to preserve vital plant-pollinator systems and the services they sustain.",

          "abstract": "Proteases, enzymes that play critical roles in health and disease, exert their function through the cleavage of peptide bonds. Identifying substrates that are efficiently and selectively cleaved by target proteases is essential for studying protease activity and for harnessing it in protease-activated diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the vast design space of possible substrates (c.a. 20 10 amino acid combinations for a 10-mer peptide) and the limited accessibility of high-throughput activity profiling tools hinder the speed and success of substrate design. We present CleaveNet, an end-to-end AI pipeline for the design of protease substrates. Applied to matrix metalloproteinases, CleaveNet enhances the scale, tunability, and efficiency of substrate design. CleaveNet generates peptide substrates that exhibit sound biophysical properties and capture not only well-established but also previously-uncharacterized cleavage motifs. To control substrate design, CleaveNet incorporates a conditioning tag that steers peptide generation towards desired cleavage profiles, enabling targeted design of efficient and selective substrates. CleaveNet-generated substrates were validated experimentally through a large-scale in vitro screen, even in the challenging case of designing highly selective substrates for MMP13. We envision that CleaveNet will accelerate our ability to study and capitalize on protease activity, paving the way for in silico design tools across enzyme classes.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) heterostructures formed moiré superlattices have emerged as a new platform for exploring correlated excitonic states and valleytronic phenomena. Despite the significant progress in moiré-trapped single excitons, the valley polarization and fine structure of moiré-trapped biexcitons remain poorly understood, with the existing studies reporting only limited or zero polarization and lacking insight into the underlying mechanisms. Here, we study the moiré-trapped interlayer biexcitons in WS 2 /WSe 2 heterostructures through power- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. We find that the valley polarization of these biexcitons can be effectively tuned, reaching ~ $$55\\%$$ 55 % at 120 K. This behavior is attributed to the different occupation of intravalley and intervalley biexcitons within the fine structure, with the intravalley biexcitons playing a dominant role. The power-dependent energy splitting and temperature-dependent polarization trends further confirm the existence of biexciton fine structure and its influence on valley polarization. Furthermore, the experiment revealed a fine structure splitting of 2.77 meV, consistent with theoretical calculations. Our study provides new insight into the rational control of excitonic states in moiré superlattices and establishes a basis for developing advanced valleytronic devices, such as polarization-sensitive photodetectors and quantum light sources.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the thalamus, particularly the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT), is a key region in mood regulation. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on 82 thalamic and cortical samples from 21 patients with BD and 20 controls to compare transcriptional pathology. PVT neurons showed the most striking abnormalities, including the largest number of differentially expressed genes and ~50% fewer cells in BD, whereas cortical alterations were comparatively modest. PVT neurons exhibited marked downregulation of synaptic and ion channel-related genes such as SHISA9 , CACNA1C , and KCNQ3 , which are linked to BD risk and serve as central nodes in downregulated networks. We also observed disrupted interactions between thalamic excitatory neurons and microglia. Overall, PVT neurons emerge as a central pathological substrate and a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target in BD.",

EVEN integrates quantitative image metrics into a Linear Discriminant Analysis model to detect and predict image quality, automatically optimising corrections. The method can be integrated into the optical microscopy pipeline to simplify further processing and analysis. Here, we show the implementation and application of EVEN in different processing scenarios, including multimodal nonlinear imaging of human and neck tissue slices and multichannel fluorescence measurements of stained cells, demonstrating its capability to automatically optimise image quality by assessing single-channel corrections.",

H-NS silences several Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs) essential for host infection. The stochastic expression of SPI-1 is required for invasion of host epithelial cells but complicates investigation of factors involved in SPI-1 chromatin structure and regulation. We performed functional genomics on sorted Salmonella populations expressing SPI-1 or not, to characterize how SPI-1 activation affects chromatin composition, DNA conformation, gene expression and SPI-1 subcellular localization. We show that silent SPIs are associated with spurious antisense transcriptional activity originating from H-NS-free regions. Upon SPI-1 activation, remodeling of H-NS occupancy defines a new chromatin landscape, which together with the master SPI-1 regulator HilD, facilitates transcription of SPI-1 genes. SPI-1 activation promotes formation of Transcription Induced Domains accompanied by repositioning SPI-1 close to the nucleoid periphery. We present a model for tightly regulated chromatin remodeling that minimizes the cost of pathogenicity island activation.",

          "abstract": "The circadian clock of Neurospora operates through a negative feedback loop in which FREQUENCY (FRQ), along with FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH) and casein kinase 1a (CK1a), inhibits its transcriptional activator, WHITE COLLAR COMPLEX (WCC), via phosphorylation. CK1a, anchored to FRQ, hyperphosphorylates FRQ at its intrinsically disordered regions in a slow, temperature-independent manner, forming a module suited for molecular timekeeping. However, the molecular processes triggered by FRQ’s hyperphosphorylation have remained unclear. Here we show that FRH, the folded binding partner of disordered FRQ, decodes FRQ’s time-dependent phosphorylation state by triggering a two-step remodeling of the FRQ-FRH complex: initially, two FRH molecules bind a FRQ dimer, keeping it inactive by blocking its interaction with WCC. Slow phosphorylation eventually triggers the dissociation of one FRH, thereby activating the complex by exposing a WCC-binding site. Due to the slow and stochastic nature of phosphorylation, the release of the second FRH occurs with a delay, promoting nuclear export and subsequent degradation of FRQ. This ensures precise activation and inactivation of FRQ and positions FRH as a hub for decoding temporal phosphorylation information.",

In this study, we show a 1MtCO 2 /year solar-driven process that adopts a hydrogen fluidised solar calciner with onsite catalytic conversion of CO 2 into sustainable aviation fuel. We find that replacing fossil-fuel heating with solar thermal energy lowers electricity consumption by 63% and reduces onsite CO 2 emissions by 59%. The analysis shows that the production cost of sustainable aviation fuel is cost-effective (US$4.62/kg) compared to the conventional process. Geographical sensitivity analysis indicates favourable deployment locations are low-risk countries with high solar irradiance and low hydrogen cost.

          "abstract": "Environmental co-contamination presents significant challenges. To tackle these, while microbial consortia offer advantages over single-strain, such as functional redundancy and synergistic degradation, rationally designing effective synthetic microbiomes for complex co-contamination scenarios remains a major challenge. Here, we utilize our advanced genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) tool, SuperCC, to simulate the metabolic behavior of communities consisting of six isolated key strains under single- and multi-carbon source conditions, mimicking single-pollutant or co-contamination scenarios respectively. By integrating multi-omics data with metabolic modeling of cultures, we systematically elucidate key strain interaction networks and adaptive strategies under co-contamination. This reveal that the specific secretory products of broad-spectrum resource-utilizing bacteria serve as key metabolites driving cooperation and highlight the pivotal role of indigenous keystone strains in stabilizing and enhancing community function. Consequently, we propose an innovative and rational paradigm for consortium design: DHP-Com (Degrader-Helper-Potentiator Consortium). Potentiators are top species with stable habitat abundance. Synthetic microbiomes built on this framework exhibit enhanced ecological fitness and substantially improve remediation performance across diverse co-contamination scenarios. Our findings advanced the practical application of GSMM predictions to decipher intricate multi-pollutant/multi-strain interaction networks, offering a powerful rational framework and robust methodological tools for engineering multi-functional and effective synthetic microbiomes for complex environmental remediation.",

In this paradigm of quantum learning, the imaging system functions as a physical learning device that maps input parameters to measurable features, while complex practical tasks are handled by training only the output weights, enabled by the systematic identification of well-estimated features (eigentasks) and their corresponding sample thresholds. Using this framework, we analyze both direct imaging and superresolution strategies for compact sources, defined as sources with sizes bounded below the Rayleigh limit. In particular, we introduce the orthogonalized SPADE method—a nontrivial generalization of existing superresolution techniques—that achieves superior performance when multiple compact sources are closely spaced. This method relaxes the earlier superresolution studies’ strong assumption that the entire source must lie within the Rayleigh limit, marking an important step toward developing more general and practically applicable approaches. Using the example of face recognition, which involve complex structured sources, we demonstrate the superior performance of our orthogonalized SPADE method and highlight key advantages of the quantum learning approach—its ability to tackle complex imaging tasks and enhance performance by selectively extracting well-estimated features.",

          "abstract": "Metazoan histone mRNAs are a unique class of mRNAs that lack the poly(A) tail present in all other eukaryotic transcripts. Instead, they end in a conserved stem-loop (SL) structure, necessitating a decay mechanism that is distinct from deadenylation-initiated degradation. Here, combining structural and functional approaches, we elucidate molecular mechanisms of initiation of histone mRNA decay. At the end of S-phase, the RNA helicase UPF1, the exoribonuclease 3’hExo and stem-loop binding protein SLBP all contribute to histone mRNA degradation, although how they are mechanistically coupled remained unknown. The cryoEM structure of an UPF1:SL RNA complex, presented here, shows that binding of UPF1 partially melts the RNA stem in the absence of ATP, harnessing the free energy derived from RNA-binding to unwind RNA. This melting event primes the SL-RNA for decay by 3’hExo. Using biochemical and cellular analyses, we demonstrate that SLBP directly engages the UPF1 helicase core to attenuate its unwinding activity and prevent premature degradation. Activation of UPF1 at a later stage promotes SL-RNA decay. We provide direct evidence that UPF1, SLBP and 3’hExo form a degradosome-like assembly that functionally couples SL unwinding and degradation, highlighting a dynamic and intricate network of UPF1-centric interactions that orchestrates timely histone mRNA decay.",

Yet, this enhanced functionality comes with significant amplification of the size and complexity of the datasets needed to characterize their properties, thereby challenging conventional approaches to analysis. To meet this need, we present BARCODE: Biomaterial Activity Readouts to Categorize, Optimize, Design and Engineer, an open-access software that automates high throughput screening of microscopy video data to enable non-equilibrium material optimization and discovery. BARCODE produces a unique fingerprint or ‘barcode’ of performance metrics that visually and quantitatively encodes dynamic material properties with minimal file size. Using three complementary material-agnostic analysis branches, BARCODE significantly reduces data dimensionality and size, while providing rich, multiparametric outputs and rapid tractable characterization of activity and structure. We analyze a series of datasets of cytoskeleton networks and cell monolayers to demonstrate BARCODE’s abilities to accelerate and streamline screening and analysis, reveal unexpected correlations and emergence, and enable broad non-expert data access, comparison, and sharing.",

          "abstract": "Endoglin (ENG) is a single-pass transmembrane protein highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), where it plays fundamental roles in EC functions. ENG is implicated in several cardiovascular disorders including hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and preeclampsia. However, molecular mechanisms underlying ENG function are not fully understood. Initially identified as a co-receptor for TGF-β signalling, ENG’s extracellular domain was later found to only bind BMP9 and BMP10 with high affinity. The relationship between these two observations is unclear. Here, we provide evidence for two primary functions of co-receptor ENG. First, ENG efficiently displaces prodomains from BMP9 and BMP10, enabling effective capturing of both ligands from the circulation. Second, ENG binds to and recruits TGFBRII into the BMP9 signalling complex, thereby explaining ENG’s involvement in both TGF-β and BMP9 pathways. We identify BMP9 target genes NOG and ADAMTSL2 as preferentially dependent on ENG and show that their transcript levels have strong positive correlation with ENG in human lung tissues; the expression levels of all three genes are significantly reduced in PAH. Our findings address an important gap in our understanding on ENG biology and provide crucial insight for therapeutic targeting these pathways in vascular diseases.",

Better description of risk factors for new infections would improve prioritisation of interventions.

Among 43,434 men and 55,919 women aged 15 to 49 there were 4,612 seroconversions. Education, marital status, male circumcision, new sexual partners, types of partner, prevalence of untreated HIV infection in the community and community partner acquisition rates were associated with HIV incidence. Only the prevalence of untreated HIV was a risk for both sexes and apparent at all ages. The prevalence of risk factors varied by age, sex and study. HIV incidence was higher in people aged 25-49 living in communities where men had high partner acquisition rates. Our results show potential for improved prevention through changed timing of prevention interventions relative to behaviour and the utility of using community characteristics to target prevention.",

          "abstract": "Efficient nuclear delivery of DNA remains a major challenge in non-viral gene therapy. While nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides have been explored for enhancing nuclear translocation of DNA, their efficacy has been limited by DNA-peptide conjugation strategies. Leveraging E. coli tRNA guanine transglycosylase, we present a modular workflow for generating DNA oligonucleotide-peptide conjugates which are ligated to linear DNA to generate peptide-modified gene cassettes (DNA-PepTAG). Using an eGFP reporter delivered via lipofection to growth-arrested cells, NLS-modified gene cassettes significantly increases nuclear localization, mRNA transcription, and expression up to ~10 fold compared to unmodified gene cassettes. Screening multiple NLS peptides in growth-arrested human cell lines reveal cell-type-specific preferences for nuclear translocation of DNA cargo. Two NLS peptides, PLSCR-1 and extSV40, exhibit consistently high expression across tested cell types, indicating broad applicability for nuclear delivery. We evaluate the generality of our approach by delivering DNA payloads encoding for both cytosolic and secreted proteins, as well as gene cassettes ranging in size from 1.3 kbp to 7 kbp. These findings support the potential of DNA-NLS conjugates as a viable strategy for non-viral gene therapy, enabling enhanced nuclear delivery of therapeutic genes while minimizing the required DNA dose.",

This phenomenon is a striking example of the evolutionary outcome of cytoplasmic sex determination, potentially arising from prolonged host-symbiont co-evolution. Although we recently identified Oscar, the Wolbachia -encoded male-killing effector targeting the host masculinizing factor OfMasc in Ostrinia moths, inactivation or loss of the host’s endogenous feminizer remains unknown. Here we identify a W-linked primary feminizer, OfFem piRNA, which targets an mRNA encoding an OfMasc-interacting protein Ofznf-2. We demonstrate that Ofznf-2 is essential for both masculinization and dosage compensation. We also show that OfFem piRNA is entirely absent in the Wolbachia -infected lineage, providing molecular evidence that a male-killing Wolbachia hijacks the host feminizing piRNA function by acquiring the Oscar protein during prolonged endosymbiosis.",

To address this, we develop a method that fuses high-resolution proprietary data with coarse Census data to create MIGRATE: annual migration matrices capturing flows between 47.4 billion US Census Block Group pairs—approximately four thousand times the spatial resolution of current public data. Our estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets and improve accuracy relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document demographic and temporal variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance—for example, rising moves into top-income-quartile block groups and racial disparities in upward mobility. Locally, MIGRATE reveals patterns such as wildfire-driven out-migration that are invisible in coarser previous data. We release MIGRATE as a resource for migration researchers.",

Here, we demonstrate that a subset of KRAS-mutant CRC cells transitions to a cellular state characterized by enhanced ribosome biogenesis upon KRAS signaling inhibition. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, trametinib, and AMG510 induce a cellular state characterized by a gene expression profile highly enriched for ribosome biogenesis. We find that they are vulnerable to the inhibition of RNA polymerase I, and they exhibit synergistic anti-tumor effects with trametinib in an autochthonous mouse model of intestinal tumors and human patient-derived organoids (PDOs). These observations demonstrate that high ribosome biogenesis induced by KRAS inhibition is indispensable to maintain this cellular state and is a potential therapeutic target. Overall, this study reveals novel mechanisms of drug tolerance to KRAS inhibition, thereby facilitating the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light-emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single, isolated chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence by studying the intramolecular exciton-exciton annihilation. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.",

The effects of cystine limitation stress (CLS) on PDAC progression are poorly understood. Here we report that adaptation to CLS (CLSA) promotes PDAC cell proliferation and tumor growth through translational upregulation of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OxPPP). OxPPP activates the de novo synthesis of nucleotides and fatty acids to support tumor growth. On the other hand, CLSA-mediated lipidomic reprogramming depends on triacylglycerides synthesis and lipid droplet formation to mitigate lipotoxicity. Through drug screening, we identify lomitapide as an inhibitor of CLSA PDAC tumor growth and a potent sensitizer of chemotherapy. Lomitapide inhibits triacylglycerides synthesis to interfere with CLSA and chemotherapy-induced lipidomic reprogramming. Taken together, we demonstrate that CLSA promotes PDAC tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and lomitapide could be used to target the dysregulated lipid metabolism in PDAC.",

Here we show that endothelial cell contraction and rearrangements underlie the inverse relationship between cell number and vessel diameter during development. Using high-resolution imaging and manipulation of actin cytoskeleton organisation, in vivo laser ablation experiments and mathematical simulations, we reveal that tension-bearing, circumferential actomyosin bundles form in the endothelial cortex to drive endothelial cell contraction and vessel constriction. The anchorage of circumferential actin bundles to cell-cell junctions is mediated by Ccm1/Krit1 protein. Importantly, the loss of circumferential actin bundles in ccm1 -deficient endothelial cells causes cell enlargement and impaired vessel constriction, culminating in vessel dilation characteristic of cerebral cavernous malformations. Our multiscale study demonstrates how circumferential actomyosin-driven endothelial cell contractions regulate vessel diameter and provides insights into mechanisms of both normal vascular development and disease pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has been widely used in biomedical studies to provide high-resolution 3D anatomical, functional, and molecular images of living subjects. While handheld PAM systems have been proposed to extend its applicability, it has proved challenging to achieve a compact device that combines fast imaging with high spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio. Here we demonstrate a handheld PAM probe integrating a fiber scanner and high-frequency transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT), called hPAM-TUT. The compact system (measuring 17 mm in diameter, with a 90 mm long rigid body) achieves high lateral and axial resolutions (7 and 47 μm, respectively), has a 2.6 mm diameter field of view, and delivers a single volumetric image in 1.5 s. In living rats, we used hPAM-TUT to visualize various abdominal organs, and in mice we used it to observe epinephrine-induced vascular changes and image the anatomy and functioning of lymphatic vessels after injection of Evans blue dye. Additionally, we successfully delineated murine vascular networks in early metastatic tumors. This handheld PAM probe shows promise for both clinical and research applications in such fields as dermatology, oncology, and intraoperative imaging.",

          "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced bone loss is a debilitating and common side effect of cancer treatment, though its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that, despite the systemic administration of chemotherapy, cellular senescence is restricted to bone marrow adipo-lineage cells specifically Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds). Induction of senescence within these populations promotes RANK ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclastogenesis, leading to significant bone loss. Notably, we find that inhibition of the p38MAPK-MK2 pathway suppresses the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), including RANKL production abrogating bone loss. Furthermore, treatment with the senolytic combination dasatinib and quercetin (D + Q) selectively eliminates senescent CAR cells and BMAds, effectively preventing chemotherapy-induced bone loss. Given that nearly all chemotherapy treated patients experience bone loss and associated fracture risk, our findings offer a promising therapeutic avenue to preserve bone integrity and improve quality of life for cancer patients.",

However, many aspects of Pol III transcription and processing, including RNA modifications, remain poorly understood, mainly due to a lack of available sensitive and systematic methods for their analysis. Here, we present DRAP3R (Direct Read and Analysis of Polymerase III transcribed RNAs), a modified nanopore direct RNA sequencing approach and analysis framework that enables the specific and sensitive capture of pre-mature Pol III transcribed RNAs. Applying DRAP3R to distinct cell types, we identify previously unconfirmed tRNA genes and other novel Pol III transcribed RNAs, thus expanding the known Pol III transcriptome. Critically, DRAP3R also enables discrimination between co- and post-transcriptional RNA modifications such as pseudouridine (Ψ) and N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) at single-nucleotide resolution across all examined transcript types and reveals differential Ψ installation patterns across tRNA isodecoders and other ncRNAs. Finally, applying DRAP3R to epithelial cells infected with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 reveals an extensive remodelling of both the Pol III transcriptome and epitranscriptome. Our findings thus establish DRAP3R as a powerful tool for systematically studying Pol III transcribed RNAs and their modifications in diverse cellular contexts.",

          "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection results in either productive or latent infection, the latter enabling life-long viral persistence. Monocytes support latent infection but become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation into macrophages. These differentiation-driven differences have been largely attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA, we observe markedly lower viral transcription at early stages of infection in monocytes compared to macrophages. Unbiased comparison reveals that this difference is partly explained by inefficient viral entry in monocytes: fewer viruses enter, and correspondingly, fewer genomes reach the nucleus. Indeed, ectopic expression of known HCMV entry receptors in monocytes enhances viral entry and enables productive infection, demonstrating that these cells can support full lytic replication if entry is efficient. We further identify integrin β3 as a differentiation-induced surface protein playing an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially accounting for the observed differences in entry efficiency. Finally, we show that cells receiving fewer viral genomes are the ones that establish latent infection and have the capacity to reactivate. Overall, our findings reveal that entry is a previously unrecognized factor contributing to latent infection in monocytes, adding a critical layer to the paradigm of HCMV latency.",

Using the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse panel, we mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that governs ILC2 prevalence in the lung after aeroallergen exposure. This QTL induces a large population of ILC2s in the lung that are resistant to activation and have diminished Type 2 effector function. We identified free-fatty acid receptor 3 ( Ffar3 ) as a gene responsible for this effect and demonstrated that FFAR3 signaling reprograms ILC2s to an anti-inflammatory state by promoting their survival, reducing Type 2 cytokine production, and enhancing IL-10 expression. This anti-inflammatory state is dependent on IL-2 signaling, is characterized by decreased ST2 expression, and is distinct from previously described IL-10-producing ILC2 phenotypes. FFAR3-dependent reprogramming is mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upregulation, and FFAR3’s anti-inflammatory effect is partially conserved in human ILC2s.",

We identified three populations of vesicular structures: one transporting degradation products originating from oxidative stress, one shuttling cargo and newly translated proteins for local organelle biogenesis and one consisting of small, functional mitochondria. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting that de novo peroxisomes biogenesis occurs via the fusion of endoplasmic reticulum and MDVs at mitochondrial sites.

ETEC pathogenesis is driven by various virulence factors, including toxins, adhesins, and noncanonical factors such as the protease EatA. The first line of host defense against intestinal pathogenic bacterial infections is the protective intestinal mucus layer. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism by which EatA degrades the core mucus component MUC2, thereby facilitating access to the epithelial cell surface and promoting infection. We identify the specific cleavage site region localized at the C-terminal of MUC2. EatA’s protease activity depends on the interaction between two distinct, uniquely spaced domains in human MUC2, which defines species specificity. We confirm this using a novel transgenic mouse model exclusively expressing human MUC2, which allows us to study the role of the mucus layer in the infection by human intestinal pathogens. These findings highlight how ETEC is adapted to specifically degrade the mucus layer of its human host.",

However, such transformations have proven challenging for unactivated alkenes, and the requirement for (super)stoichiometric amounts of reactive Grignard reagents has limited broader applications. Herein, we address these major challenges by integrating iron/ N -heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed C–H activation with mechanochemistry techniques. This approach enables mechanochemical iron-catalyzed anti -Markovnikov hydroarylations of unactivated alkenes using a bis( N -heterocyclic carbene) ligand, as well as regiodivergent hydroarylation of aryl alkenes by varying the N -heterocyclic carbene ligand. To this end, magnesium metal serves as a convenient reductant to form catalytically active iron(0) species by mechanochemistry, thereby improving the sustainability and functional group compatibility. Experimental and computational studies elucidate the possible catalytic mode of action, and a data science analysis captured the key features of the N -heterocyclic carbene ligands in controlling regiodivergent selectivity.",

          "abstract": "Fe-cyclopentadienone complexes have been widely utilized in various hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalytic processes, yet their applications have largely been restricted to non-asymmetric versions. This limitation is primarily due to the considerable challenge of constructing an efficient chiral environment around the active iron center. In this study, we present a structurally distinctive chiral Fe-cyclopentadienone complex with excellent enantiocontrol capabilities. This new iron complex features bulky side arms oriented downward toward the cyclopentadienone plane, which create an ideal chiral environment in front of the catalytically active iron center. It demonstrates excellent performance in the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of acylsilanes, exhibiting both high reactivity and selectivity. The broad substrate scope, encompassing aryl-, alkenyl-, and alkyl-acylsilanes, along with successful gram-scale synthesis, underscores its potential applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. Experimental and DFT studies reveal the structural stability and rigidity of the catalyst during catalytic intervals. Additionally, weak interactions between the catalyst and the silyl group in the substrate play a critical role in achieving efficient enantioselectivity. More importantly, this type of chiral iron complex also shows excellent catalytic reactivity and selectivity for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, utilizing i -PrOH as the hydrogen source.",

However, general information about these bacteria is still lacking. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of Fusarium wilt plants rhizosphere and comprehensive studies to obtain information about the robust variation in the rhizosphere microbiome of Fusarium wilt plants. We demonstrate that Fusarium infection reproducibly changes the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. The rhizosphere microbiomes of Fusarium wilt plants are characterized by the enrichment of Flavobacterium , gene cassettes involved in antioxidant functions related to sulfur metabolism and the root secreted tocopherol acetate. We further isolate antagonistic Flavobacterium anhuiense from the diseased tomato rhizosphere, and reveal that the growth of F. anhuiense and the expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in this strain are significantly stimulated by tocopherol acetate. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of F. anhuiense against F. oxysporum and F. anhuiense population enhancement by tocopherol acetate are confirmed in planta . The robust variation in the rhizosphere microbiome elucidates key principles governing the general assembly mechanism of the microbiome in the Fusarium wilt plants’ rhizosphere.",

          "abstract": "Despite its critical role in tumor evolution, a detailed quantitative understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of aneuploidy remains elusive. Here we introduce ALFA-K (Adaptive Local Fitness landscapes for Aneuploid Karyotypes), a method that infers chromosome-level karyotype fitness landscapes from longitudinal single-cell data. ALFA-K estimates fitness of thousands of karyotypes closely related to observed populations, enabling robust prediction of emergent karyotypes not yet experimentally detected. We validate ALFA-K’s performance using synthetic data from an agent-based model and empirical data from in vitro and in vivo passaged cell lines. Analysis of fitted landscapes suggests several key insights: (1) Whole genome doubling facilitates aneuploidy evolution by narrowing the spectrum of deleterious copy-number changes; (2) Environmental context and cisplatin treatment significantly modulate the fitness impact of these changes; (3) Fitness effects of copy-number changes depend on parental karyotype; and (4) Chromosome mis-segregation rates strongly influence the predominant karyotypes in evolving populations.",

          "abstract": "Controllable wetting of liquid on solid surface is meaningful for advanced science and engineering. Current researches about controllable liquid spreading are generally limited to unidirectional modes, while achieving multi-directional spreading on microstructured surfaces remains challenging. Herein, we propose a novel type of bulk-cusp microstructure, exhibiting 0 to 4-directional spreading of droplet without external energy input. This behavior occurs not only under single-drop deposition but also under continuous liquid injection. The bulk structure is assumed to have cross or square shape, implying relatively high and low coverage ratio of the precursor film, respectively. Owing to the drag effect of the precursor film, the cross-cusp microstructure facilitates controllable spreading of the main droplet, whereas the square-cusp microstructure just has guidance action on precursor film due to its low coverage ratio. Mechanism analysis reveals the capillary forces generated from the narrow gaps between adjacent cusps effectively separate the precursor film. The area coverage ratio of precursor film determined by the shape of the bulk influences the coupling or decoupling of the droplet body and precursor film. Such controllable multi-directional liquid spreading enables applications in lubrication enhancement and smart evaporation cooling.",

          "abstract": "Mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole to at-risk populations remains the primary strategy for controlling soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Despite its widely use, its efficacy varies among different STH species and remains sub-optimal, particularly in the treatment of T. trichiura . Currently, studies investigating the optimal dose and regimens for albendazole are lacking. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted to assess the efficacy of two single-dose albendazole 400 mg treatments given four weeks apart targeting STH infections compared with just one single-dose albendazole 400 mg on 375 schoolchildren in Bulang Shan, Menghai county, Yunnan Province, China from October to December 2015. The first round of albendazole resulted in cure rates (CR) of 92.5%, 63.1% and 5.1%, and egg reduction rates (ERR) of 99.2%, 87.9% and 41.1% for A. lumbricoides , hookworms and T. trichiura , respectively. With the second round, efficacy remains high against A. lumbricoides (98.9% CR), is increased against hookworm (92.2% CR), and remains low against T. trichiura (6.3% CR). The second round increased the ERR to 99.6%, 99.8% and 74.1% for the same species, respectively. In this setting, albendazole is thus highly effective against A. lumbricoides , reasonably effective against hookworm, but has low efficacy against T. trichiura following two rounds of treatment.",

Here we reveal a seemingly-familiar-yet-strange climate oscillation phenomenon, which we name Tropical-leaning Atlantic Oscillation (TAO). Statistical results show that springtime TAO can explain 56% of the variance in a dominant dipole mode of typhoon track variations during July–September of 1979–2023, suggesting that it possesses a robust predictive skill of peak-season typhoon tracks four months in advance. Specifically, springtime TAO is characterized by a sea-level pressure seesaw between the tropical North Atlantic and the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait, relating to the meridional shift of North America-Atlantic subtropical jet stream. It generates cross-seasonal North Atlantic-and-Pacific surface seawater temperature anomalies, thereby triggering Northwest Pacific cyclonic steering flows that tempt (obstruct) typhoons toward East Asian high-latitude (low-latitude) cities during July–September. Climate models project an increasing frequency of positive TAO events. This may potentially contribute to a poleward migration of typhoon activity toward East Asian high-latitude cities as climate warms, yet uncertainty remains due to model biases in simulating tropical surface seawater temperature patterns. Our results highlight an overlooked impact of an emerging internal climatic oscillation on the enhancing typhoon risks toward high-latitudes.",

          "abstract": "Microtubule polarity and dynamic polymerization arise from the self-association properties of the αβ-tubulin heterodimer. For decades, it has remained unclear how the tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, TBCC, and the Arl2 GTPase mediate the biogenesis of αβ-tubulin from individual α- and β-tubulins. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of tubulin cofactors bound to αβ-tubulin. TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 form a heterotrimeric cage-like assembly, we term TBC-DEG, around the αβ-tubulin heterodimer. The TBC-DEG-αβ-tubulin structures show that TBC-DEG wraps around β-tubulin while TBCE extends along α-tubulin. The TBC-DEG/TBCC-αβ-tubulin structures reveal that TBCC forms multi-domain interactions with Arl2 and TBCD to engage the αβ-tubulin intradimer-interface, promoting TBCE rotation while TBCD holds β-tubulin. TBCC engages the GTP-bound Arl2, multiple sites of TBCD, and the native αβ-tubulin intradimer interface near the α-tubulin N-site GTP. Together, these structures uncover transition states for αβ-tubulin biogenesis and degradation, suggesting a vise-like, GTP-hydrolysis-dependent mechanism in which TBCC binding to TBC-DEG modulates αβ-tubulin interfaces. Our studies provide structural evidence that tubulin cofactors act as enzymatic regulators that assemble the invariant αβ-tubulin architecture. By catalyzing α- and β-tubulin biogenesis and degradation, the TBC-DEG and TBCC assemblies regulate the polymerization competency of αβ-tubulin for microtubule formation.",

During the fragment optimization process, structures of WRN with key prioritized fragments reveal multiple conformations of WRN with significant domain rotations up to 180°, including a WRN conformation not previously described.

Our findings show that glioma cells selectively hijack specific subsets of neural signals, reshaping waveform properties and synchronizing their firing events with neural activity. This dynamic interaction plays a critical role in boosting glioma invasiveness, as tumor cells harness neural activity to promote their progression. Notably, targeted stimulation of glioma cells with these hijacked signal patterns—without direct neural involvement—is sufficient to induce hyper-invasive behavior, emphasizing the role of these electrical cues as drivers of tumor aggression.",

The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) from baseline at week 24. Between 29 December 2022 and 12 June 2024, 211 participants from 32 medical centres in China were randomised (2:2:1:1) to receive double-blind, once-weekly ecnoglutide (0.6 mg [n = 69] or 1.2 mg [n = 71]) or volume-matched placebo (0.6 mg [n = 36] or 1.2 mg [n = 35]) for 24 weeks. The randomisation, stratified by baseline HbA 1c (≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%), was conducted via an interactive web response system. Ecnoglutide and placebo were identical in appearance to achieve masking. The trial was completed. All randomised participants received ≥1 dose of the assigned treatment and thus were included for analyses. At week 24, the least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA 1c were −1.96% (95% CI −2.18 to −1.73) with ecnoglutide 0.6 mg and −2.43% (95% CI −2.65 to −2.20) with ecnoglutide 1.2 mg versus −0.87% (−1.09 to −0.65) with placebo.

Strain engineering has recently emerged as a powerful tuning knob for manipulating the properties of cuprates, in particular charge and spin orders, and their delicate interplay with superconductivity. In thin films, additional tunability can be introduced by the substrate surface morphology, particularly nanofacets formed by substrate surface reconstruction. Here we show a remarkable enhancement of the superconducting onset temperature $${T}_{{{{\\rm{c}}}}}^{{{{\\rm{on}}}}}$$ T c on and the upper critical magnetic field H c ,2 in nanometer-thin YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− δ films grown on a substrate with a nanofaceted surface. We theoretically show that the enhancement is driven by electronic nematicity and unidirectional charge density waves, where both elements are captured by an additional effective potential at the interface between the film and the uniquely textured substrate. Our findings show a new paradigm in which substrate engineering can effectively enhance the superconducting properties of cuprates. This approach opens an exciting frontier in the design and optimization of high-performance superconducting materials.",

A significant issue hindering GBM therapeutic development is intratumor heterogeneity and plasticity. GBM tumors contain neoplastic cells within a fluid spectrum of diverse transcriptional states. Identifying effective therapeutics requires a platform that predicts the differential sensitivity and resistance of these states to various treatments. Here, we develop scFOCAL ( S ingle- C ell F ramework for - O mics C onnectivity and A nalysis via L 1000), to quantify the cellular drug sensitivity and resistance landscape. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM tumors, we identify compounds from the LINCS L1000 database with transcriptional response signatures selectively discordant with distinct GBM cell states, and leverage this capability to predict combination synergy. We validate the significance of these findings in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and identify a combination of an OLIG2 inhibitor and Depatux-M for the treatment of GBM. Our studies suggest that scFOCAL identifies cell states that are sensitive and resistant to targeted therapies in GBM using a measure of cell and drug connectivity, which can be applied to identify new synergistic combinations.",

          "abstract": "Malaria is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites in the vertebrate host blood stream through repeated cycles of asexual multiplication inside erythrocytes. During these cycles, parasites dynamically change their transcriptome at each developmental step to express genes exactly when required; however, the mechanisms regulating these transcriptomic changes remain unclear. In this study, we reveal that the AP2-family transcription factor PbAP2-TR is essential for the asexual blood stage development of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei , as a transcriptional repressor. Conditional knockout of pbap2-tr causes developmental arrest at the trophozoite stage, i.e ., the cell growth phase of asexual blood stage development. The expression of PbAP2-TR target genes is upregulated in pbap2-tr -knockout parasites, and introduction of mutations into the binding motifs increases the promoter activity of the target genes. Time-course transcriptome analysis shows that PbAP2-TR is largely responsible for the transcriptional downregulation from early to late trophozoite development. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that PbAP2-TR recruits a putative chromatin remodeler, PbMORC, as a co-factor. These results indicate that transcriptional repression by PbAP2-TR-PbMORC complex contributes on precise control of transcription peak patterns during the asexual blood stage development.",

The process by which we identify navigable routes through the environment is termed navigational affordances. Here, using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and behavioural testing we report that the extraction of such navigational affordance information likely takes place rapidly within dorsal early visual cortex before higher-level scene selective regions. Whilst we replicate prior work showing the involvement of the occipital place area in navigational affordance coding, whole-brain analyses indicate the most likely cortical locus to be dorsal early visual cortex. Analyses comparing the spatiotemporal pattern of navigational affordances suggest such information is detectable within ~110 milliseconds post stimulus onset. Finally, through varying the presentation durations of scenes, we demonstrate that navigational affordance representations are emergent, but not strong with stimulus durations as short as 33-66 milliseconds but become robust with stimulus durations &gt;132 milliseconds. Taken together these data challenge previous views regarding the critical cortical locus for navigational affordance coding and suggest that such affordances can be extracted from very briefly presented stimuli.",

While typically realized by joining dissimilar materials, achieving such heterogeneity in single-component systems has remained a fundamental challenge. Here, we report an intrinsic optical heterostructure in a uniform organic nanosheet, manifesting as strongly enhanced fluorescence in the inner zone compared to the outer zone. We demonstrate that this emission heterogeneity stems from a spatially localized solid-state transition in the central top layer, which transforms the initial single crystal into an out-of-plane twin structure and significantly enhances the radiative recombination efficiency. This transition is driven by the competitive interplay between molecule-substrate and intermolecular interactions, as corroborated by multiscale structural, optical, and theoretical analyses. Our findings not only establish a platform for realizing optical heterostructures in organic materials but also open avenues for exploring structural-dynamics-governed photonic phenomena, offering broad implications for future materials design and micro-optical applications.",

Here, we show that elevated CO 2 levels (650 and 1000 ppm) consistently reduced net MeHg production across 45 freshwater lakes spanning 1200 longitudinal kilometers, particularly in eutrophic conditions (54–96%). Elevated CO 2 -driven shifts in carbon substrates favored hydrogenotrophic methanogens (e.g., Methanobacterium ) lacking the hgcA methylation gene over hgcA -harboring acetoclastic strains (e.g., Methanosarcina ), decreasing methanogen abundance (18–98% in hgcA copies) and activity (13–53% in net CH 4 production) and suppressing Hg methylation. Model simulations predict a 33%–74% global decline in lake MeHg production under future CO 2 scenarios, partially counteract MeHg increases associated with intensified algal blooms under warming. This overlooked pathway highlights the need to integrate interacting climate drivers to improve predictions of MeHg risks in a climate-changing future.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to result in rising seas, exacerbating coastal floods and erosion. Remote islands are projected to be among the most challenged regions, due to their geographic isolation and fragile economies. While, Small Island Developing States have been attracting the attention of scientists and policy makers, Europe’s Outermost Regions (ORs) and Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) remain poorly studied in terms of their impacts from Sea Level Rise (SLR). Here we carry out a data-modelling framework to comprehensively study risks of flooding, the submergence of flat regions, and coastal erosion along coastlines of ORs and OCTs. Our study shows that under a high emissions scenario by 2150 annually nearly 3000 km 2 is expected to be flooded, one third of which by tidal flooding, while 150 km 2 of land will be lost by coastal erosion. This translates into an annual exposure to coastal inundation of up to half a million of people and an economic damage of 5.9 € billion per year - a 40-fold increase from today. Our study shows the increasing benefits in time of stringent climate mitigation, which could nearly halve these impacts in the long run. However, sea levels will continue to rise long after net zero carbon is reached, and so will the consequent impacts, highlighting the critical importance of proactive efforts to increase the resilience of these vulnerable regions against rising seas.",

          "abstract": "Although Li-ion conductivity has been the primary focus during decades of solid-electrolyte research, the mechanical compliance is equally important. For most state-of-the-art solid electrolytes, the mechanical compliance is characterized by the hardness above 1 GPa and Young’s modulus above 15 GPa. Here, we report a particularly compliant solid electrolyte, 1.4Li 2 O-0.75ZrCl 4 -0.25AlCl 3 , whose hardness and Young’s modulus reach 0.22 and 1.41 GPa, respectively. Meanwhile, it shows an ionic conductivity of 2.55 mS cm −1 at 25 °C and an estimated cost of $43.70 L −1 , considerably lower than that of the Li 2 ZrCl 6 solid electrolyte known for cost-effectiveness ($140.01 L −1 ). The improved mechanical compliance and fast Li-ion transport in 1.4Li 2 O-0.75ZrCl 4 -0.25AlCl 3 enable decent cell performance. With high positive electrode active material loading above 20 mg cm −2 , these two types of cells achieve areal capacities of 3.62 mAh cm −2 (85.78% capacity retention) and 3.92 mAh cm −2 (90.11% capacity retention), respectively, after 100 cycles under 0.1 C at 25 °C. The simultaneous achievement of highly competitive mechanical compliance, Li-ion conductivity, and cost-effectiveness in 1.4Li 2 O-0.75ZrCl 4 -0.25AlCl 3 have the potential to pave the way for the realization of commercial, practical all-solid-state Li batteries.",

Discovery and optimization of LNPs remain challenging due to the complexity of input variables and low throughput workflows. To accelerate these processes, we report a broadly compatible barcoded Cre recombinase mRNA barcode platform that enables multiplexed LNP tracking in vivo in tdTomato reporter mice. We evaluate accumulation and degradation kinetics of mRNA encapsulated in Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) LNPs in the liver, lung, and spleen, and show that functional protein activity is associated with rapid organ enrichment. We further demonstrate how barcode multiplexing can streamline systematic kinetic studies, distinguish nanoparticles with distinct biological outcomes, and differentiate subtle, yet important, variations within a series of similar formulations. Finally, we use barcoding to identify and characterize nanoparticles with hepatic zonal bias and previously overlooked extrahepatic tropism. This approach could accelerate high resolution characterization of nanoparticles with desirable properties, enable large-scale systematic studies of diverse LNPs, and provide insights into optimizable parameters of LNP-mRNA delivery.",

          "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing globally, yet the earliest biological determinants remain poorly defined, particularly in general population studies. We studied the Swedish population-based ABIS birth cohort (n = 16,683) to identify early-life risk factors. Olink proteomic analysis (n = 286 controls, n = 146 cases) of inflammatory signals at birth shows differential abundance years before diagnosis (mean age 12.6 years), with proteins enriched for neutrophil migration, cytotoxicity, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune regulation. Several markers remain significant in spite of prenatal and perinatal factors including family history of diabetes, and are associated with differences in compounds like stearic acid, lysine, glutamine, and persistent, environmental toxicants perfluorodecylethanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Using machine learning, we identify a protein subset that predicts T1D with high accuracy (AUC = 0.89 ± 0.02), independently of HLA genetic risk. These findings suggest that innate and tissue-remodeling pathways are perturbed at birth, possibly reflecting early β-cell vulnerability. Identifying these disruptions at birth with a non-invasive method opens a window for prevention, protecting β-cells before the inflammatory attack on islets begins.",

          "abstract": "Rapid urbanization has driven widespread increases in artificial light at night, intensifying energy use, light pollution, and sustainability challenges. However, its ecological impacts, particularly on vegetation phenological transitions, remain poorly understood. Using 62,994 site-year in situ records and satellite observations across 452 cities from 2001 to 2022, we show that elevated levels of artificial light at night are associated with delayed dates of foliar senescence in urban areas. This delaying effect is spatially heterogeneous and nonlinear, being most pronounced at low light intensities ( &lt; 15 nW cm –2 sr –1 ) and decreasing or saturating at higher levels. Regional variability in effects of artificial light at night is primarily shaped by urban socioeconomic factors and vegetation traits. Mechanistically, the delaying effect may result from enhanced carbon assimilation and altered climatic responses. We further improve the phenological modeling by incorporating the effects of artificial light at night and project overall later foliar senescence dates than currently predicted. Collectively, our findings highlight a previously underrecognized pathway by which urbanization alters vegetation phenology, with implications for forecasting ecosystem dynamics under continued urban growth and climate change.",

However, existing displacement measurement approaches are incapable of performing flexible probing within complex equipment interiors.

Leveraging a multimode fiber probe empowered by deep learning, fine feature information can be efficiently extracted from superoscillatory speckles, achieving single-ended detection with 10 nm resolution and 99.95% accuracy. A physical model is established to correlate the displacement with higher-order modes proportion in the fiber. Sub-millimeter-sized probe enables detecting targets with different structures in confined spaces. Robust recognition is achieved through joint learning, under varying fiber bending conditions and different metal materials. With extreme compression ratios of less than 0.1%, the system delivers high accuracy, low training costs, and high-speed processing. The imaging capability of the probe is also experimentally validated, proving potential as a powerful tool in applications such as lithography, weak force sensing, and super-resolution micro-endoscopy.",

Here, we identified two potent, neutralizing single domain antibodies directed against the tetrameric receptor binding (H) protein of CDV. Structural analyses spotlighted two vulnerable sites within the H protein. While the first overlaps with the receptor binding site, the second encompasses amino acid residues of two protomers located at the distal dimeric head interface, which supports distinct mechanisms of neutralization. Upon application of an engineered tetravalent and biparatopic antibody, ferrets were protected at a remarkably low antibody dose (1 mg/kg) administered intra-peritoneally on days 3 and 7 post-exposure of a lethal CDV challenge. Collectively, this study spotlights the power of integrating multiple mechanisms of neutralization in a single format and provides a roadmap to design next-generation therapeutics against morbilliviral infections as well as other infectious pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Solid-state spin qubits offer a promising route toward scalable quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate that, despites of a nuclear-spin-rich host of halide double perovskites (HDPs), transition-metal centers (Cr 3+ and Fe 3+ ions) are a good candidate for spin qubits exhibiting long-lived electron spin coherence with $${T}_{2}$$ T 2 = 29.5 µs and 21.2 µs at 4 K, respectively. Notably, spin localization facilitates a well-defined electron-nuclear (e-N) spin rotation between the electron spin and the neighboring nuclear spins of 35,37 Cl and 133 Cs. The resulting e-N spin cluster is readily beneficial for a target nuclear-spin sensing. For the Cr 3+ spin centers, the optical transitions associated with Cr 3+ spin centers is spin-selective thereby paving a way for optical addressing of spins. Our findings from these spin ensemble studies establish HDPs as a new promising platform for creating solid-state spin qubits using simple and inexpensive solution-based single crystal growth methods, broadening material applications of halide perovskites.",

Here, we generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the endangered cycad fern Brainea insignis (8.62 Gb), the sole species in its genus within eupolypods II, and integrate comparative and population genomics to resolve its evolutionary history and vulnerability. The genome retains the ancient whole-genome duplication shared by leptosporangiate ferns; however, its exceptional size is driven primarily by recent repeat accumulation and further shaped by lineage-specific evolutionary signatures linked to functional specialization. Resequencing across the range identifies three geographically and environmentally structured lineages shaped by Quaternary refugia, limited postglacial expansion and localized admixture. Recently reduced populations show pronounced genomic erosion, including inbreeding and elevated genetic load, due to insufficient time for purging. We detect climate-associated local adaptation and project substantial future genetic offsets, with southwestern Indochina populations at highest risk. Our results expand fern genomics and support spatially tailored conservation strategies that maintains habitat connectivity and promotes adaptive gene flow.",

          "abstract": "Poliovirus remains a serious threat to human health. Complete eradication of wild-type poliovirus has not yet succeeded, making the development of successful antivirals critical. Microneutralization assays against all three poliovirus serotypes identified a panel of human monoclonal IgGs, which are either serotype-specific or cross-neutralizing. Here, through cryoEM single particle analysis, we solved high resolution structures of four distinct poliovirus-FAb complexes. These antibodies bind to capsids at the circular depression (canyon) surrounding the icosahedral five-fold symmetry axis, which is also the binding site of the poliovirus receptor (PVR). Analysis of these structures confirms overlap of FAb contacts on the viral capsid with those of PVR. For three of the FAbs, the capsid residues are identified that dictate serotype-specific recognition. Contacts for the cross-neutralizing mAb 10D2 are located deep in the capsid canyon. These structural analyses indicate that antibody competition with the receptor likely leads to neutralization of virus particles and inhibition of poliovirus entry into host cells. Thus, the human IgGs studied here may facilitate development of therapeutics for the ongoing efforts in global eradication of poliovirus.",

Using synthetic glycans and glycosylated antigens, we demonstrate the ability of the technique to automatically correlate glycan binding parameters in subregions of dendritic cell membranes with increased uptake and cross-presentation efficiency of these antigens. Additionally, we show how the method can uncover subtle differences in MR-mediated glycan binding across various MR-expressing primary cells and cell lines.

Furthermore, whether there are signaling differences that drive the gene-specific activation under insulin-resistant (IR) or ageing conditions is unknown. Here, we perform a phosphoproteomic analysis of insulin signaling in the bones of young, lean, insulin-sensitive versus old, obese, IR mice revealing a rewiring of phosphorylation. We target dysregulated phosphoproteins in a zebrafish functional genomic screen of bone development and mineralization revealing candidates important for skeletal formation. One of these is ALF Transcription Elongation Factor 4 (AFF4), the core scaffold of the Super Elongation Complex and we show that phosphorylation of S831 on AFF4 is an insulin-dependent substrate of P70S6K and attenuated in aged, IR bone. Phosphorylation of S831 is defective in IR osteoblasts and associated with reduced transcriptional elongation at discrete locations in the genome. Mechanistically, we show phosphorylation of S831 increases recruitment of chromatin remodelers, ENL/AF9 to crotonylated histone via the YEATS domain, and promotes gene-specific activation. Our analysis identifies regulators of insulin action on the skeleton, further uncovering a mechanism of IR via locus-specific changes in transcriptional elongation and gene activation.",

          "abstract": "Cell fate decisions in human endoderm development are tightly regulated, yet the role of metabolic products remains elusive. The endodermal posterior foregut gives rise to pancreas, liver, and intestine. Here, we identify Glutathione Peroxidase 2 as a critical regulator of human posterior foregut differentiation, revealing oxidative stress as a key determinant of pancreatic versus non-pancreatic cell fate. Cells lacking Glutathione Peroxidase 2 under pancreas-promoting conditions differentiate also into hepatic-like progenitors. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility profiling, and functional studies, we reveal that Glutathione Peroxidase 2 orchestrates lineage commitment by regulating key transcription factors, leading to emergence of multilineage liver and intestinal progenitors. Mechanistically, Glutathione Peroxidase 2 deficiency triggers extracellular matrix remodeling, activating bone morphogenetic protein signaling and skewing differentiation from the pancreatic lineage. Manipulating oxidative stress recapitulates or rescues Glutathione Peroxidase 2 loss effects, establishing oxidative stress as a gatekeeper of pancreatic fate. Controlling oxidative stress during in vitro differentiation could advance regenerative medicine applications.",

Brown adipose tissue in the anterior trunk is believed to derive from the somitic mesoderm, although some depots are of partially unknown origin. Here we show that the subscapular, lateral, cervical and peri-aortic brown adipose depots, but not the interscapular depot, are in part formed by a non-somitic source. Single-cell sequencing along with genetic lineage tracing indicates that at embryonic day 9.5 the dorsal aorta compartment harbors multipotent mesenchymal progenitors expressing the transcription factor Osr1. Spreading laterally from the dorsal aortic midline, these cells contribute to adipose, cartilage and myogenic lineages. This study uncovers an alternative source of brown adipose tissue and suggests that a fraction of dorsal aorta-associated mesenchymal Osr1 + cells may represent the in vivo correlate of a multipotent progenitor cell type so far only characterized in vitro, the mesoangioblast.",

          "abstract": "Vernalization-regulated flowering is vital for wheat yield and geographical distribution, and the diversity of flowering time genes is essential for the breeding of climate-resilient varieties. Sugars have long been recognized in regulating flowering; however, the intrinsic connection between carbohydrate metabolism and vernalization response remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify a fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) encoding gene, HtL1/FBA10 , as a modulator of heading time variation based on a genome-wide association study utilizing wheat core germplasm collections. Evolutionary analysis shows a decrease in the proportion of haplotype-2 of HtL1 , which is linked to delayed flowering, in Chinese and American wheat varieties compared to landraces. Vernalization reduces HtL1/FBA10 phosphorylation levels and increases its O -GlcNAcylation, which in turn enhances its enzymatic activity and facilitates VERNALIZATION 1 ( VRN1 ) transcription by regulating histone acetylation at the VRN1 locus. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between glucose metabolism and the epigenetic regulation of vernalization in winter wheat.",

SpbK is a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing antiphage defence protein from Bacillus subtilis that provides protection against the temperate phage SPβ via abortive infection. Here we structurally characterise SpbK and its interaction with the SPβ protein YonE. We demonstrate that SpbK is an NADase that produces both ADP-ribose (ADPR) and canonical cyclic ADPR with a N1-glycosidic bond (cADPR, also referred to as N1-cADPR). Combining cryo-EM, in silico predictions, site-directed mutagenesis, and phage infection assays, we show that formation of two-stranded head-to-tail assemblies of SpbK TIR domains is required for both NADase activity and antiphage defence. We also demonstrate that YonE is a dodecameric portal protein that activates the NADase function of SpbK by facilitating TIR domain clustering. Collectively, our results provide insight into how bacterial TIR NADases recognise phage infection.",

          "abstract": "Substantial scholarship has estimated the susceptibility of jobs to automation, but little has examined how job contents evolve in the information age as new technologies substitute for tasks, shifting required skills rather than eliminating entire jobs. Here we explore patterns of occupational skill change and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest re-skilling requirements in the United States. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are greatest for STEM occupations in the 2010s. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million online job posts covering 721 occupations, we find that when accounting for distance between skills, skill change is greater for lower-skilled occupations: those with fewer skills, lower wages, and less educational requirements. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer and market size, as well as social demographic groups. We find that jobs from small employers and markets experienced larger skill upgrades to catch up with the skill demands of their large employers and markets. While these varied skill changes could create uneven reskilling pressures across workers, they may also lead to a narrowing of gaps in job quality and prospects. We conclude by showcasing our model’s potential to chart job evolution directions using skill embedding spaces.",

Yet, tumor-driven immunosuppressive programs restrict efficient cDC1 recruitment, highlighting the need for strategies to increase cDC1 access to the tumor microenvironment. Here, we establish a proof-of-concept cell-based immunotherapy that enhances the infiltration of circulating cDC1 progenitors and supports their local expansion. Intratumoral engraftment of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express membrane bound FLT3L promotes cDC1 recruitment when combined with poly(I:C). We identify poly(I:C)-induced CXCL9 and CCL5 as essential chemokines controlling intratumoral cDC1 infiltration. Stromal cell–mediated local delivery of FLT3L together with CXCL9 and CCL5 is sufficient to enhance cDC1 infiltration in mice or humanized mice settings. Finally, this approach activates antitumor immunity and partially overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Collectively, our data support the therapeutic potential of expanding intratumoral cDC1s through local and sustained delivery of FLT3L, CXCL9, and CCL5.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages are central drivers of chronic inflammation, yet how a sustained inflammatory state alters their function remains unclear. Using GFP knock-in zebrafish targeting irg1/acod1 that marks macrophage activation, we track the dynamic transitions of macrophage states during acute muscle injury under homeostatic and chronically inflamed conditions, induced by genetic mutation of nlrc3l . In the chronic inflammation model, muscle repair is impaired and expression of the mannose receptor mrc1b/cd206 is severely downregulated in a myd88 -dependent manner. Two reparative macrophage subtypes, defined by their cellular behavior and single-cell transcriptomics profile, clustering and muscle-encasing, are lost. A chronic infection model recapitulates these defects, underscoring the link to macrophage mrc1b repression. Depleting either mrc1b or macrophages impairs muscle repair. Reinstating normal macrophage states by restoring macrophage nlrc3l expression or ablating myd88 -mediated inflammatory pathways rescues muscle repair in nlrc3l mutants. Contrary to conventional discrete states, we identify hybrid M1/M2 macrophage states post-injury. While transient during normal injury response, a pro-inflammatory hybrid state persists during chronic activation, which restricts macrophage heterogeneity, represses mrc1b , and inhibits intracellular cathepsin K accumulation, a hallmark of reparative subtypes. Thus, our study provides mechanistic insight into the dynamics of macrophage activation during muscle injury and repair, and how these processes are modulated under chronic inflammation.",

          "abstract": "Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of organ dysfunction. Preventing fibrosis in tissue pathological condition remains a significant clinical challenge. Here we investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) in mitigating fibrosis and promoting regeneration of load-bearing tendons. Fgf7 knockout mice exhibit impaired motor function and disordered matrix assembly in tendons. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals an enrichment of a pro-fibrotic cell subpopulation in Fgf7-deficient tendons, which is also predominant in human tendinopathy. Using ProTracer technology, we find that FGF7 deficiency drives proliferating cells toward this pro-fibrotic lineage. Furthermore, we find that FGF7 promotes the tenogenic differentiation of tendon stem/progenitor cells while suppressing their fibrotic differentiation. Importantly, a hydrogel loaded with recombinant FGF7 effectively reduces fibrosis and significantly promotes functional tendon regeneration in vivo. These findings elucidate FGF7’s dual role in driving tenogenesis and inhibiting fibrosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "The monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule CD1d presents lipid antigens to both αβ and γδ T cells. While type I natural killer T cells (NKT) display exquisite specificity for CD1d presenting α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), the extent of lipid specificity exhibited by CD1d-restricted γδ T cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) can recognise CD1d in either a lipid-dependent or lipid-independent manner with weak to moderate affinity. Using small-angle X-Ray scattering, we find that γδ TCR-CD1d binding modality is conserved across distinct CD1d-restricted TCRs. In functional assays, CD1d γδ TCR affinity was a poor predictor of γδ T cell line activation. Moreover, CD1d presenting endogenous lipids was sufficient to stimulate T cell activation and induce γδ TCR-CD3 clustering and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Elongation of the γδ TCR-CD3 complex by the inclusion of the Cγ2 and Cγ3 -encoded constant domains perturbed cellular activation whilst maintaining the ability to form functional γδ TCR clusters. The crystal structure of a Vδ1 γδ + TCR-CD1d complex showed that the γδ TCR sat atop of the CD1d antigen-binding cleft but made no contacts with the presented lipid antigen. These findings provide a molecular basis for lipid-independent CD1d recognition by γδ TCRs.",

We introduce Controlled Solvent-Activity Liquid-Assisted Grinding (CSA-LAG), a mechanochemical protocol that offers solvate phase boundary elucidation by varying the activity of a chosen solvent in defined binary/ternary mixtures and analysing the equilibrated resulting solid form. Using small API amounts, CSA-LAG reaches equilibrium within minutes and yields critical solvent activities that delimit neat, hydrated, solvated and competing-solvate domains. The method uses mixtures of known thermodynamic activities, requires far less material and time than traditional slurries and affords high reproducibility. Applied to four pharmaceutical compounds, CSA-LAG reproduces slurry boundaries and quantifies activity thresholds for single, stepwise and competitive solvations. Defining these boundaries enables rational form selection and process design either by avoiding or targeting solvates, whilst turning a month-scale empirical screening into a rapid, thermodynamically guided workflow.",

          "abstract": "The significant challenges pose by the high recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) persist in its diagnosis and treatment. Activating innate immunity in CRC treatment has the potential to reduce drug resistance and side effects. Here, we develop a biomimetic platform by utilizing antimicrobial peptide-functionalized CRC cell membranes to encapsulate a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (C), hereby called peptide-functionalized camouflage C (PfCC). When injected into tumour-bearing mice, PfCC will degrade under the acidic condition of the tumour microenvironment and release cobalt ions, which react with endogenous H 2 S to generate black stellate precipitates with good photothermal properties, recruiting NK cells and mitigates the immunosuppressive tumour-microenvironment. Simultaneously, the degradation of PfCC will release structure-protected antimicrobial peptides, inhibiting harmful bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio , and reducing H 2 S production. The abovementioned synergistic top-down regulation of H 2 S promote the polarization of macrophages and further activates the innate immune response. Moreover, experiments including the convex hull algorithm from AI deep learning of the segment anything model indicate that PfCC exhibites the most effective therapeutic effect compared with the single H 2 S-regulated therapeutic modality. Taken together, PfCC represents a potential anti-cancer therapy for CRC with the combined effect of immune-regulation and the regulation of the gut flora.",

          "abstract": "Diatoms are key contributors to global primary production, and have developed intricate partnerships with bacteria through long-term co-evolution. Here, we uncover a syntrophic relationship between the model obligate photoautotroph diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the rod-shaped bacterium Loktanella vestfoldensis , which enables the diatom to indirectly utilize glucose. To be specific, growth of the diatom depends on the support of L. vestfoldensis for the supply of necessary carbon source when glucose serves as the sole carbon source, while L. vestfoldensis shows dependence on P. tricornutum when CO 2 is the sole carbon source. Reanalysis of Tara Oceans metagenomic data shows frequent co-occurrence of Loktanella with diatoms including Chaetoceros and Thalassiosira , indicating the ecological relevance of this partnership. Co-culture with L. vestfoldensis supports robust growth of Chaetoceros muelleri and Thalassiosira pseudonana in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that P. tricornutum maintains a photoautotrophic metabolism in co-culture, as indicated by the up-regulation of genes involved in inorganic carbon concentration and photosynthesis, while the co-cultured bacterium likely supplies CO 2 and growth-stimulating metabolites such as indole-3-acetic acid. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial-algal interactions may shape diatom adaptation to carbon changes and contribute to marine carbon cycling.",

We show MAGPIE’s generalisability and scalability on spatial multi-omics data from multiple tissues, combining Visium with MALDI and DESI mass spectrometry imaging. MAGPIE was also applied to new multi-modal datasets generated with a specialised sampling strategy to characterise the metabolic and transcriptomic landscape in an in vivo model of drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis and to link small-molecule co-detection with endogenous lung responses. MAGPIE demonstrates the refined resolution and enhanced interpretability that spatial multi-modal analyses provide for studying tissue injury especially in pharmacological contexts, and delivers a modular, accessible workflow for data integration.",

          "authors": "Jacques Courbe, Julia Payson",
          "abstract": "Do voters punish local politicians for raising taxes? In California, proposed tax increases must be approved via local ballot measures. Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits the narrow passage of local tax initiatives, we find that incumbents do not generally suffer a penalty when cities raise taxes, with the notable exception of business taxes. We explore several mechanisms behind this result and uncover suggestive evidence that business interests may be particularly likely to mobilize following a tax increase. These results suggest that interest groups likely play an important role in determining whether new taxes generate voter backlash.",

          "abstract": "Using a model, we explain why propaganda in autocracies can be blatantly false and unconvincing. We model two news outlets that report on a hidden state of the world, motivated by the ex-post beliefs of the audience about the state of the world. News outlets face a tradeoff when making egregiously false statements. On the one hand, such statements are easily verifiable as false. On the other hand, a demonstrably false report reduces the credibility of the report made by the competing outlet. This is especially true for audiences in autocracies that are characterized by high media cynicism and are prone to making sweeping generalizations about the self-serving nature of all media.",

          "abstract": "This article advances the literature on media effects by examining how contrasting partisan narratives influence support for regulation after a real-world corporate scandal. Using both multi-wave observational and randomized experimental data, we show that self-selected media exposure and experimentally assigned information shape public opinion in distinct ways. While scandals are narratives of regulatory failure, partisan media environments differently attribute blame for that failure. In two separate observational waves, only Democrats exposed to news about the FTX bankruptcy increased their support for crypto regulation. In the experiment, only Republicans shifted in favor of regulation. Research on media effects needs to take into account not only media content, but also the partisan information environments that expose citizens to that content.",

          "abstract": "Inattentive survey respondents are a growing concern for social scientists who rely on online surveys for their research. While inattentiveness has been well documented in lower quality sample sources, there is less understanding of how common the phenomenon is in high-quality surveys. We document the presence of a small percentage of respondents in Cooperative Election Study surveys who pass quality control measures but still exhibit inattentive behavior. We show that these respondents may affect public opinion estimates for small subgroups. Finally, we present the results from an experiment testing whether inattentive respondents can be encouraged to pay more attention, but we find that such an intervention fails.",

The labels comprise 14,000 polygons corresponding to roughly 5,500 separate installations. The median polygon size is 13 m 2 , with a total area of close to 380,000 m 2 . Researchers may be interested in applying this dataset for the training of deep learning models for computer vision or to investigate deployment of photovoltaics in urban areas. While other similar datasets exist, there are several unique aspects of this location that make it attractive for further study: it encompasses a densely populated, urban environment; imagery contains four channels (three colors, plus infrared); and the source dataset is re-acquired periodically by the state of New York, offering the opportunity for these labels to form the basis of a time resolved study of photovoltaic deployment.",

To explore its genetic basis and evolutionary adaptations, we generated the first telomere-to-telomere (T2T) gapless genome using an integrated sequencing strategy that combined PacBio HiFi, ultra-long Oxford Nanopore (ONT), Hi-C, and BGI short-read technologies. The resulting 2.49 Gb assembly achieved a contig N50 of 107.02 Mb, comprising all 54 telomeres and 27 centromeres across 25 pairs of autosomes and the X/Y chromosomes, and reached 99.94% BUSCO completeness. Genome annotation predicted 907 Mb of repetitive sequences (36.52% of the genome) and 24,005 protein-coding genes. Comparative and technical analyses confirmed high assembly continuity, completeness, and accuracy, with a consensus quality value (QV) of 64.73, providing a robust genomic reference for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms and adaptive traits of this iconic high-altitude ungulate.",

Each SMI-NbS case study includes information on the location, NbS category, ecosystem types, societal challenges addressed, associated co-benefits, and links to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SMI-NbS compendium provides practical information on NbS implementation and identifies current research trends and gaps, such as the dominance of ecological and climate-focused NbS, with limited integration of other socio-economic challenges, thereby supporting further research and enabling knowledge exchange across the science-policy-practice interface to inform sustainable development pathways in SMI.",

The dataset includes hourly recordings of outdoor climate parameters (temperature, relative humidity, global tilted irradiance, and driving rain), indoor conditions across six functionally distinct rooms, and temperature–humidity profiles at three depths within the retrofitted south-east wall. The monitoring system was engineered for robust, long-term operation under harsh alpine conditions. Data are provided in CSV format, accompanied by comprehensive sensor metadata. The dataset supports: (i) validation of hygrothermal simulation models under extreme alpine conditions; (ii) evaluation of the long-term performance and durability of internal insulation within historic masonry; and (iii) benchmarking of moisture-related risk in high-altitude heritage structures. Moreover, the dataset offers a rare opportunity to examine hygrothermal responses in high-elevation-built heritage, a research domain where long-term, high-frequency data remain scarce.",

At the same time, the demand for rigorously constructed and extensively normed experimental materials increased as well. Here, we present the Figurative Archive , an open database of 996 metaphors in Italian enriched with ratings and corpus-based measures (from familiarity to semantic distance and preferred interpretations), derived by collecting stimuli used across 11 studies. It includes both everyday and literary metaphors, varying in structure and semantic domains, and is validated based on correlations between familiarity and other measures. The Archive has several aspects of novelty: it is increased in size compared to previous resources; it offers a measure of metaphor inclusiveness, to comply with recommendations for non-discriminatory language use; it is displayed in a web-based interface, with features for a customized consultation. We provide guidelines for using the Archive to source materials for studies investigating metaphor processing and the relationships between metaphor features in humans and computational models.",

The database also provides summary statistics for each contest (electorate size, voter turnout, majority size, rejected ballots, unreturned ballots), key demographic data for candidates (age, gender, ethnicity), and lineage data for political parties. MECo is the most well-curated open database on Malaysian elections to date, and will unlock new opportunities for research, data journalism, and civic engagement.",

New phenotypic trait monitoring methods are being proposed to reduce this so-called phenotyping bottleneck via automation.

To this end, we present the MuST-C (Multi-Sensor, multi-Temporal, multiple Crops) dataset, which contains field data from various sensors collected over a growing season, covering six crop species. All data was georeferenced for alignment across sensors and dates. To collect our dataset, we deployed aerial and ground robotic platforms equipped with RGB cameras, LiDARs, and multispectral cameras, aiming to capture a wide variety of modalities and observations from different viewpoints. In addition to sensor data, we also provide manually collected leaf area index and biomass reference measurements. Our dataset enables the development of novel automatic phenotypic trait estimation methods, allows comparisons across different sensors, and generalizability across crop species.",

          "abstract": "Building heights are crucial for sustainable urban planning and monitoring. While traditional methods use airborne stereo images and LiDAR data for accurate height estimation, their large-scale application is costly and slow, limiting the ability to conduct frequent large-scale monitoring. In contrast, satellite data offers a scalable alternative, further improved with Deep Learning (DL) models. However, the lack of representative open-source training datasets has constrained the progress in this field. In this paper, we introduce M4Heights, a multi-modal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal dataset designed for building height estimation, spanning diverse architectural styles, urban densities, and terrain complexities across Estonia, Netherlands, and Switzerland. The dataset includes ≈ 1 million images, comprising time series of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data, high-resolution aerial orthophotos, and high-quality building height reference maps. Additionally, M4Heights provides the largest associated multi-image super-resolution dataset to enhance height estimation accuracy. Our dataset supports a range of modeling approaches, offers extensibility to new geographic regions and provides opportunities to advance the development of DL models for building height estimation.",

We present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset designed for video-based long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA was recorded over seven months in four connected indoor environments using seven strategically placed cameras, capturing realistic movements with substantial clothing and appearance variability. The dataset includes 22 individuals, more than five hours of video, and about 1M bounding boxes with identity annotations obtained through semi-automatic labeling. We also define benchmark protocols for person tracking and Re-ID, covering diverse and challenging scenarios such as occlusion, reappearance, and multi-camera conditions. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios.

          "abstract": "Global climate change is intensifying the hydrological cycle, manifested through an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events that pose substantial threats to water security and ecosystem resilience. Precipitation concentration indicators are critical for diagnosing these changes, yet their application has been constrained by data limitations: a reliance on fragmented station observations and a critical disconnect between historical benchmarks and future projections. To bridge this gap, we present the multi-precipitation concentration indicators dataset (MPCID) for mainland China, a spatiotemporally continuous resource spanning 1961–2100. MPCID integrates historical in-situ and gridded observations (1961–2022) with high-resolution (0.25°), statistically downscaled CMIP6 projections across four SSP scenarios (2015–2100). The dataset incorporates four key indicators: the precipitation concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP), daily precipitation concentration index (DPCI), and monthly precipitation concentration index (MPCI). Rigorous validation against station data established PCD as the most reliable indicator, characterized by minimal errors, near-optimal correlation, and negligible bias across both historical and future scenarios. While DPCI exhibited moderate error control, its limited daily-scale correlation points to inherent stochasticity in short-term precipitation. MPCI demonstrated reduced sensitivity to extreme precipitation events, whereas PCP showed systematic limitations in temporal phase alignment despite retaining pattern recognition capability. By integrating historical fidelity with future scenarios, MPCID overcomes prior data fragmentation and establishes an indispensable foundation for investigating precipitation dynamics, assessing climate impacts on hydrology and agriculture, and informing adaptive management strategies.",

Its scale and diversity enable comprehensive process-structure-property analyses and support machine learning methods to gain insights into the complex electrospinning process. To assess the dataset’s reliability and utility, we verified data integrity against source publications and trained machine learning models as a proof of concept. These data are intended to accelerate fundamental research, model training, and process optimization across various electrospinning applications.

Here, we successfully assembled a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of N. japonicus by integrating Illumina, PacBio, and Hi-C sequencing technologies. The genome assembly spans 723.27 Mb, with a contig N50 of 30.83 Mb, and 97.04% of the contigs were anchored onto 22 pseudochromosomes, yielding a scaffold N50 of 30.96 Mb. A total of 23,514 protein-coding genes and 6,532 non-coding RNAs were predicted, with repetitive sequences accounting for 21.84% of the genome. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that N. japonicus has 218 expanded and 1,076 contracted gene families, with the divergence times of 56.9 to 85.9 million years ago from three Sparidae species. Positive selection analysis further identified 163 positively selected genes potentially involved in growth and development, reproduction, immune response, and DNA repair of N. japonicus .

The influence mechanisms of micro-ionic interactions and microstructure on physicochemical properties of NaCl-based molten salt mixtures play a decisive role in exploration of more efficient molten salt formulations. We present a dataset of microstructure and physicochemical properties of NaCl-based molten salt mixtures for concentrating solar power, which involves thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, specific enthalpy of fusion, specific heat capacity, density, and viscosity of mixtures, ionic self-diffusion coefficient, coordination bond angle and coordination bond length of ion pairs, and coordination number of ions across varying elemental compositions and a wide temperature ranges from 556 K to 1400 K, which significantly exceeds the current operating limits of commercial nitrate-based solar salt.

However, its natural sex reversal contributes to low egg production and fry shortages in aquaculture. The molecular mechanisms governing this process remain poorly understood, hindered by incomplete gene annotations and a lack of comprehensive multi-omics characterization of the gonad. To address this, we performed integrated Iso-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq profiling across nine key stages of natural female-to-male sex reversal. This approach revealed an extensive, previously unannotated transcriptome landscape, identifying 37,911 novel transcripts. These included 16,900 novel genes and alternative isoforms derived from 24,193 annotated genes. Furthermore, chromatin accessibility mapping identified 2,174 putative cis-regulatory elements, uncovering dynamic regulatory shifts correlated with gene expression changes during sex reversal. Our integrated multi-omics analysis delivers a significantly enhanced transcript annotation framework for M. albus , resolving precise polyadenylation sites and surpassing the current NCBI annotation in comprehensiveness. Collectively, this work establishes an essential resource for investigating gonadal development and deciphering sex reversal mechanisms in fish.",

The dataset comprises 421 heterogeneous anterior-posterior radiographs from 186 patients (mean age 45.88 ± 17.54 years; 37 females, 149 males), including normal and fractured knees. Fractures were classified by expert orthopedic surgeons and radiologists using the Schatzker system: type I (14.51%), II (18.27%), III (6.45%), IV (5.91%), V (6.45%), VI (17.20%), and normal (31.18%). All images were segmented to generate tibial bone masks, supporting morphological analysis, AI training, and automated fracture assessment. This dataset facilitates AI-driven fracture detection, classification, preoperative planning, and orthopedic assistant education.",

          "authors": "Skyler Wang, Marco Dehnert",
          "abstract": "As a burgeoning industry, artificial intelligence (AI) companion platforms capitalize on shifting societal attitudes toward tech-mediated relationships to introduce novel ways of connecting with nonhuman entities. But how are these platforms constituted, and how do they “sell” consumers the idea of human-AI relationships? By analyzing four prominent multimodal companions (AvatarOne, Digi, Paradot, and Replika), we argue that despite differences in architecture and style, state-of-the-art platforms converge on the following sociotechnical qualities: human-likeness, accessibility, customizability, and relationship progression. By creating technical affordances to augment these qualities, companion platforms ultimately project what we call a future of on-demand intimacy – intimacy that can be acquired in a truly frictionless manner. Beyond examining how commercial entities mobilize the grammar of human intimacy in tandem with on-demand culture to create new markets, this study offers a conceptual framework for future research into how platform dynamics shape not only the availability but also the meaning of intimacy in human–AI interactions.",

          "abstract": "Ambiguous loss, a profound sense of grief unrelated to death, is often overlooked in the context of incarceration, particularly among marginalized communities. Families of incarcerated individuals experience profound loss while also feeling disconnected due to systemic barriers and social stigma. This qualitative study explores how Black gang-affiliated youth in Chicago use multimodal posts, combined text, images, and emojis posts, to navigate incarceration-related ambiguous loss. Using Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) and a Strength-based Approach, we analyzed 65 multimodal posts to examine digital memorialization and advocacy. Findings reveal two key themes: Collective Advocacy and Ambiguous Loss and Commemorating Absence , highlighting social solidarity in coping and exploring digital memorialization. Results suggest that social media serves as a critical space for expressing grief, maintaining relationships, advocating for systemic change, and fostering community support. This study contributes to digital mourning and ambiguous loss research, emphasizing how youth use online spaces to process grief and build resilience.",

Although knocking down the TTR gene by CRISPR-Cas9 represents a promising strategy for treating ATTR amyloidosis, its efficiency and safety remain to be further investigated. Here, we report a systematic investigation of SpCas9-based TTR editing. Besides the target site, wild-type SpCas9 and the reported variants induced extensive off-target edits. To improve the fidelity, we performed structural analysis and designed a series of SpCas9 variants. Studies demonstrated that SpCas9-Mut5 is an ultrahigh-fidelity variant, which induces extremely low levels of off-target edits and translocations without substantial impairment of on-target editing activity. SpCas9-Mut5 is compatible with the adenine base editor (ABE) system, markedly reducing off-target edits and narrowing the editing window. In conclusion, our study suggests that SpCas9-Mut5 is an excellent candidate for TTR gene editing. Besides ATTR amyloidosis, SpCas9-Mut5 and its derivative ABE could be widely used in the treatment of other diseases.",

Previously, we induced tolerance to allogeneic islets in nonhuman primates by preemptive alloantigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells in situ. Here, mass cytometry phenotyping with incorporated donor-derived MHC-I peptide–loaded MHC-II tetramers revealed accumulation of allospecific CD4 + T cell clusters in the spleen of tolerant recipients. Areg + Tr1 regulatory and terminally exhausted EGFR hi T (Tex) cells represented the predominant allospecific subsets. Trajectory analysis showed that antigen-experienced effector memory T cells differentiated into suppressive Areg + Tr1 and EGFR + TOX + Nur77 + TCF-1 − Tex subsets. Cell-cell communication mapping showed that exhausted and effector memory T cells engaged with allospecific Tr1 cells via the Areg-EGFR axis. Gene silencing studies confirmed that Tr1 cells use Areg-EGFR signaling to drive the metabolic suppression and epigenetic reprogramming of CD4 + T cells through a Nur77-dependent pathway. These findings point to the splenic Areg + Tr1 cell-EGFR + Teff cell axis as a critical immunoregulatory pathway in peripheral transplant tolerance.",

Using an innovative method capable of detecting plastic particles as small as 200 nanometers, we quantified MPs and NPs in aerosols, dry and wet deposition, and resuspension in two Chinese megacities, Guangzhou and Xi’an. Airborne concentrations reached 1.8 × 10 5 MPs per cubic meter and 5.0 × 10 4 NPs per cubic meter in Guangzhou and 1.4 × 10 5 MPs per cubic meter and 3.0 × 10 4 NPs per cubic meter in Xi’an. Estimates revealed a variation of two to five orders of magnitude in MP and NP fluxes across major atmospheric compartments, dominated by road dust resuspension and rainfall-driven wet precipitation. Plastic particles were more heterogeneously mixed in deposition samples than in aerosols and resuspension, indicating enhanced aggregation and removal. These results provide an integrated assessment of MPs and NPs in urban atmospheric processes and offer critical insights into their transformation, fate, and potential implication for climate, ecosystems, and human health.",

Using the 60-centimeter Antarctic Terahertz Explorer, we present the first successful CO (4-3) and [CI] ( P 1 3 − P 0 3 ) mapping observations of two archetypal triggered massive star-formation regions at Dome A. These data, together with archival [CII], provide the first complete characterization of all three carbon phases in these environments. We find elevated C 0 /CO abundance ratios in high-extinction regions, plausibly driven by deep penetration of intense radiation fields from massive stars into a clumpy ISM. These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM.",

Our study investigates global changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance in the THP-1 cell line, a monocyte-macrophage lineage known for plasticity and immune reprogramming features. We identified pathways positively enriched with genes affecting muscle and cardiac contraction, neuronal system, and sensory perception. Available computational models identified links with health issues, including cardiac, neurological, muscular, and renal disorders and alterations in senses. Specific mechanistic networks were identified: retinoid metabolism, cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate)/CREB (cAMP response element–binding protein) signaling, and glutamatergic receptor signaling, which were associated with changes in vision, sleep, and movement, respectively. A considerable reduction is observed in E2F-regulated transcription of G 2 -M and DNA repair genes. A c-myc–regulated mRNA splicing pathway was identified and found commonly down-regulated in other mission datasets. Our results offer a stimulating framework for several health states encountered during spaceflight and can be further used as an accelerated disease and drug discovery model.",

          "abstract": "Transverse tubules (T-tubules) are invaginations of the muscle plasma membrane that facilitate rapid transmission of action potentials, ensuring synchronized muscle contraction. Despite their essential role in muscle physiology, the mechanisms underlying T-tubule formation remain elusive. Here, we identify LUBEL/RNF31, a ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for linear (M1-linked) ubiquitination, as a key regulator of T-tubule biogenesis in Drosophila . Loss of LUBEL leads to Amphiphysin (Amph)–positive membrane sheets instead of tubular networks. The ubiquitin ligase activity of LUBEL and direct interaction with Amph, a BAR domain protein involved in membrane tubulation, are crucial for proper T-tubule morphology. LUBEL and M1-linked ubiquitin chains assemble into puncta on membranes through multivalent interactions, facilitating Amph-mediated tubulation. Notably, the Amph-LUBEL/RNF31 interaction is evolutionarily conserved across species, underscoring a fundamental role for linear ubiquitination in membrane remodeling.

          "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disabling condition with pathological remodeling of different joints, resulting in impaired function of the whole musculoskeletal system in vertebrates. Fibrocartilage has poor self-repair capacity after OA, leading to restricted treatment strategies and unsatisfying clinical efficacy. Recently, we constructed the spatiotemporal multiomic landscape of fibrocartilage and connective tissue in human temporomandibular joint (TMJ)–OA, observing that adjacent connective tissue could transform to fibrocartilage in TMJ-OA. We found that the COL5A1 + fibroblast population, derived from perivascular niche, contributes to fibrocartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) transformation. Multijoint analysis showed that integrin α V /β 5 was universally activated in OA joints, which led to increased fibrocartilaginous transcription but disarranged ECM transformation in connective tissues. In OA mouse models and a TMJ-OA miniature pig model, inhibition of integrin α V /β 5 activity using cilengitide facilitated the transcriptional reprogramming of C o l5a1 + fibroblast and functional remodeling of the connective tissues. Our findings verified the effectiveness of cilengitide and provided a clinical route for fibrocartilage injury repair in OA.",

However, despite many years of intense research, no clear consensus on its mechanism has emerged. Here, we demonstrate that high survival under antibiotics may originate from two fundamentally different growth-arrest archetypes: either from a regulated growth arrest, leading to a protected dormant cellular state, or from a dysregulated disrupted growth arrest. Using modeling and experimental approaches including transcriptomics, microcalorimetry, and microfluidics, we unveil the characteristics and vulnerabilities of each growth-arrest archetype. In particular, disrupted bacteria show a general impairment of membrane homeostasis. This understanding resolves previous conflicting results regarding characteristics of persisters and allows tailoring treatments that target the different growth-arrested bacteria. The fundamental distinction between regulated and disrupted growth arrests should be broadly relevant for the description of cells under stress.",

Protein condensates have been implicated in bacterial dormancy, yet how these assemblies orchestrate dormancy entry remains unclear. We evolved persisters that enter dormancy before the stationary phase, most harboring mutations in serS , encoding seryl-transfer RNA synthetase (SerRS). These variants recapitulated persistence induced by serine hydroxamate (SHX), a serine analog and SerRS inhibitor. Both the serS mutation and SHX treatment trigger SerRS sequestration into conserved DEAD-box adenosine triphosphatase–associated condensates, coinciding with growth arrest and dormancy. In vitro, the SerRS variant preferentially partitions into DeaD granules, consistent with its distinct in vivo localization. Microscopy revealed spatially restricted translation silencing within condensates upon SerRS partitioning. Together, these phase-separated condensates act as hubs that coordinate the transition from proliferation to dormancy, paralleling eukaryotic cell fate control via localized translation. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into bacterial persistence and suggest that targeting condensates could help combat antibiotic tolerance and delay resistance.",

Drought prevalence in boreal zones rose by 5% over 20 years—three times greater than in tropical zones—because of reduced latent heat flux and increased surface albedo, which together suppressed convective rainfall. In contrast, tropical forests demonstrated greater ecological resilience, mitigating ~40% of meteorological drought intensification. Notably, forest loss–induced meteorological drought may further evolve into more severe agricultural and hydrological droughts. Therefore, we recommend implementing strategies tailored for each climate zone, including native forest conservation, proactive ecological restoration, and connectivity enhancement, to effectively reduce drought risk.",

While NAD precursor supplementation elevates total NAD levels, it does not reveal tissue-specific effects of an altered NADH [reduced form of NAD + (oxidized NAD)]/NAD + balance. To address this, we generated transgenic Drosophila expressing the genetically encoded xenotopic enzyme Lb NOX, which converts NADH to NAD + . Lb NOX expression modulated both NAD(H) and NADP(H) (reduced form of NAD phosphate) metabolites in a sex-dependent manner and rescued neuronal cell death induced by mutant αB-crystallin–associated reductive stress. We demonstrate that tissue-specific targeting of redox NAD metabolism shows distinct outcomes: Muscle-specific Lb NOX expression confers stronger protection against paraquat-induced oxidative stress than whole-body expression, emphasizing tissue-dependent redox sensitivity. Notably, Lb NOX expression in nonneuronal tissues restored youthful sleep patterns in aged flies. Together, these findings establish Lb NOX as an efficient xenotopic tool for in vivo redox manipulation and reveal tissue- and sex-specific NAD(P)H mechanisms underlying aging, stress resilience, and sleep regulation, providing a framework for NAD-based interventions in aging.",

By contrasting sex-specific gene expression and corresponding chromatin accessibility among progenitor and differentiated cells, we found that sex-specific chromatin regions in supporting cells are established shortly after sex determination, accompanied by the acquisition of active histone marks. The presence of potential transcription factor–binding motifs in the open chromatin regions revealed regulatory networks underlying ovary-enriched factors LEF1 and MSX1, which promote granulosa fate by inducing granulosa-specific genes such as Foxl2 and Fst .

This epidermal Spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, creating a “molecular imprint” of the nervous system. Disruption of this epidermal scaffold causes axonal damage, and we propose that it protects axons by restricting the endocytosis of cell adhesion molecules required for axonal-epidermal adhesion.

We generated a previously unknown type of breathing soliton to drive the mechanical mode of the microresonator into a forced oscillation at the breathing frequency. Once the breathing frequency is tuned close to the mechanical frequency of the system, the breathing soliton and the excited mechanical oscillation suddenly lock together into a synchronization. This state locks to an almost unchanged breathing frequency, and exists over a considerable frequency range of the pump laser.

Although Nat10-mediated RNA ac4C modification has been implicated in malignant hematopoiesis, its role in normal hematopoiesis remains unexplored. Here, we developed ULAC-seq to map ac4C in rare hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and revealed dynamic, cell-type–specific ac4C patterns, peaking in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), correlating with elevated Nat10 expression. Nat10 knockout disrupts HSC self-renewal and arrests MEP differentiation, leading to fetal and postnatal hematopoietic failure. Mechanistically, Nat10 deposits ac4C on mRNAs encoding key hematopoietic transcription regulators (e.g., Nfix), thereby enhancing their translation. Nat10 loss reduces Nfix protein levels and suppresses expression of its target genes (e.g., Mpl) that govern HSPC fate, while Nfix reconstitution rescues colony-forming defects in Nat10-null HSPCs. Our findings reveal that Nat10 orchestrates hematopoiesis through ac4C-dependent translational control of transcriptional factors, establishing an epitranscriptome-transcriptome regulatory axis essential for HSC maintenance and function.",

          "abstract": "The transcriptional repressor forkhead box N3 (FOXN3) has been reported to suppress pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting Smad transcriptional activity. However, FOXN3 becomes unstable in response to profibrotic stimuli. This study identifies poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP1) as a stabilizing partner of FOXN3, preventing its degradation by blocking p38-mediated phosphorylation. Lung-specific knockout (KO) of PARP1 promotes the development of pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the abundance of FOXN3. Conditional overexpression of FOXN3 notably mitigates pulmonary fibrosis resulting from PARP1 KO by impeding Smad signaling, underscoring the critical role of the PARP1-FOXN3 axis in pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, p38 is a Smad response gene that is transcriptionally repressed by the PARP1/FOXN3 complex. The disruption of PARP1 or FOXN3 increases p38 expression, which in turn facilitates FOXN3 degradation through a feedback mechanism. This cascade activates Smad signaling, leading to a profibrotic response and myofibroblast activation. Notably, levels of PARP1 and FOXN3 are significantly reduced in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting PARP1’s crucial role in suppressing the disease by regulating FOXN3-mediated Smad signaling.",

Offline “structural synapses” encode task-agnostic features, while online “plastic synapses” are configuration-specific parameters updated by error-gated rules consistent with long-term potentiation and depression. The contraction metric serves as a homeostatic constraint, providing a stability guarantee. We validate our approach on cable-driven and shape-memory-alloy soft arms across trajectory tracking, pick-and-place, and whole-body shaping tasks. Compared with baseline methods, our approach reduces tracking error by 44 to 55% and maintains more than 92% shape accuracy under perturbations, including varying payloads, dynamic airflow, and actuator failures.

Meanwhile, Mn SAs act as new active sites enhancing the adsorption of intermediate * CO, thus suppressing CO production, lowering energy barriers of hydrogenation, and changing the reaction path. In addition, the hydrogen overflow energy barriers decrease under the effect of spin polarization, promoting the rapid transfer of active H from Ni atoms to Mn SAs. As a result, the rate of CO 2 methanation is 195.7 millimoles per gram per hour with near-unity selectivity, and the catalytic activity of 1.0%Mn/NNSO increases by approximately 140 times compared with NNSO.

          "abstract": "Cancer persister cells which survive oncogene targeted therapies are sensitized to ferroptosis, but mechanistic understanding of this vulnerability remains limited. Here, we found that while levels of iron, glutathione, and various ferroptosis-suppressing enzymes vary among persister cell types, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) is down-regulated in multiple persister cell types, and persister cells which survive glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibition rely on residual FSP1 to survive. Furthermore, persister cells which survive GPX4 inhibition down-regulate oxidative phosphorylation, a key source of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species which are required for persister cell ferroptosis. We also found that persister cell treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors induces reactive oxygen species and sensitizes multiple persister cell types to GPX4 inhibition. Together, these findings reveal that FSP1 and histone deacetylases suppress persister cell ferroptosis.",

          "abstract": "Vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have attracted growing attention across fields, including optics and acoustics, for potential applications in particle manipulation and high-speed communication. Intracavity generation of OAM beams, such as OAM lasers, efficiently produces high-power, high–beam-quality vortices. This scheme, however, remains rarely explored in acoustics. Here, we propose and demonstrate an acoustic intracavity OAM generation mechanism with tunable topological charges via a single nonreciprocal nonlinear boundary in a compact resonator ring. In the linear regime, the boundary creates non-Hermitian complex effective magnetic fields piercing the ring, leading to a non-Hermitian Zeeman-like effect that splits clockwise and counterclockwise eigenmodes. Upon incorporation of nonlinearity to the boundary, all resonators are mutually locked, producing a single-mode self-oscillatory OAM radiation exhibiting hysteresis and bistability. Moreover, the topological charge is tunable by manipulating the boundary. Our work reveals intriguing physics related to nonlinear, non-Hermitian boundaries and offers potentials in the next generation of acoustic self-oscillatory OAM sources, switchers, and memory devices.",

          "abstract": "Impaired neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation/activation is associated with brain aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly find that DMTF1, a transcription factor that regulates the Arf/p53 axis in cancer, is down-regulated in the NSCs of a premature aging model driven by telomerase deficiency. DMTF1 up-regulation was able to rescue the impaired proliferation of telomere dysfunctional NSCs. Mechanistically, DMTF1 regulates the transcription of Arid2 and Ss18 genes, two subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes that mediate H3K27ac at E2F gene promoters to promote NSC proliferation. Accordingly, Arid2 or Ss18 depletion phenocopies DMTF1 loss in reducing H3K27ac levels, expression of E2F target genes, and NSC proliferation. Thus, our study has identified DMTF1 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the proliferation defect of aged NSC that is modeled by telomere attrition and unearthed a distinct genetic program controlled by DMTF1 in NSC.",

During extreme heat, trees fail to cool 25% of cities, while grasslands and croplands fail in 71 and 82%, respectively, due to reduced evapotranspiration under high vapor pressure deficits and impeded canopy conductance.

This achievement was made possible by combining a supersaturated, nucleus-rich active gel with a substantially enhanced crystallization rate, enabling uniform and sufficient nucleus loading on the support and the subsequent rapid formation of continuous zeolite membranes, regardless of support morphology or the presence of seeds. Using this strategy, we rapidly synthesized high-quality zeolite membranes that demonstrated record-breaking separation performance over previously reported counterparts—one order of magnitude higher in separation performance index.

By integrating gene dosage balance principles with phylogenomic reconciliation and probabilistic modeling, we revisit the debated ancestral seed and angiosperm WGDs. Leveraging dosage-sensitive orthologous gene groups (OGs) as evolutionary markers across representative plants for gene tree/species tree reconciliation, we demonstrate that gene retention patterns in Amborella and Aristolochia —early-diverging plants lacking post–angiosperm origin WGDs—reveal a single gene duplication peak predating the seed plant diversification, with no signal of ancestral angiosperm WGD. Correlation analyses of observed and expected OG copy numbers, given proposed WGD(s), further refute an angiosperm WGD. Probabilistic retention modeling analysis corroborates these findings and shows that retention rates of dosage-sensitive genes from the putative angiosperm WGD are extremely low. Besides, our study establishes that genes inferred to have higher dosage sensitivity based on their sequential retention following WGD events may have increased utility in resolving ancestral polyploidy.",

Here, we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased antiviral signaling in H1N1 and H3N2 infections. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production increase mvRNA and interferon production. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature, mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation.

We resolve the sponge phylogeny in good agreement with current knowledge and date their origin to the early Ediacaran. Our results suggest that early sponges were not biomineralized and that both biosilicification and biocalcification evolved independently multiple times across Porifera.

          "abstract": "Membrane fission is an energy-consuming process, critical for all domains of life. Prototypical fission machineries use local energy input such as nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to constrict and cut membranes. However, some membrane fission reactions paradoxically rely on protein scaffolds that by themselves stabilize rather than cut membranes. It turns out these proteins do not work alone; they use nonlocal energy input that generates a membrane tension gradient. Such a gradient mobilizes membrane flow that in turn tends to relax the membrane tension gradient. By interfering with membrane flow, the protein scaffold causes the membrane tension to increase unchecked to the point of mechanical failure, membrane fission. This friction-driven scission (FDS) mechanism is generic, conserved from bacteria to humans, and only requires two ingredients: a membrane tension generating process and a protein scaffold that hinders the associated membrane flow. Because both are often present in cells, it is likely that FDS contributes to membrane fission more frequently than previously appreciated.",

By modulating coordination strength between precursor salts and solvents, we identify solvent coordination-dispersion equilibrium as the governing factor for ink stability and develop a stable ink that exhibits a remarkable increase in the shelf life. It effectively tunes ink drying and film crystallization, resulting in blade-coated perovskite films with excellent uniformity and low defect density. This enhancement led to increased aperture efficiency of ambient-fabricated p-i-n perovskite modules to 23.5%. The resultant devices also exhibit high durability, and 99% of the initial PCE was retained after 1700 hours of maximum power point tracking following the ISOS-L-2 standard protocol.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric oxygen concentrations have remained remarkably stable over the past ~400 million years (Myr), suggesting the presence of robust regulatory mechanisms. Because of its sensitivity to oxygen, wildfire was traditionally assumed to control oxygen levels by limiting terrestrial vegetation; however, this feedback is nullified by high moisture levels in tropical ecosystems. Using vegetation modeling, we show that where oxygen-fire effects are dampened by high moisture, photorespiration becomes more effective through increased temperatures. Together, these processes interact to drive an 86% reduction in modeled global biomass when oxygen levels reach 35%. This coregulation imposes substantially tighter control of atmospheric oxygen than wildfire alone, providing previously unknown insights into the spatial and interactive feedbacks that may explain the remarkable stability of oxygen levels since the evolution of forests.",

Here, we introduce a physics-guided, self-supervised artificial intelligence (AI) framework called generative networks for disordered metamaterials (GNDM), trained on a progressively expanding dataset starting from a few initial samples. We integrate a formula writing module in the training process of neural networks to enforce the identification of the most selective set of hidden geometric invariants that dictate bulk properties. By inversely solving the formulae, GNDM manipulate disordered geometric features to extrapolate property space and design previously unknown structures via its generator module, validated by experiments. GNDM offers an all-in-one AI framework that closes the loop of feature extraction, property prediction, formula writing, and inverse design, unraveling the regulative role of disorder, a critical challenge in the study of metamaterials with complex microstructures.",

Multi-ignition fires account for 31% of the burned area in California and 59% in the Arctic-boreal domain, spread faster and persist longer than single-ignition fires, and disproportionately contribute to extreme fire years in California, Canada, and Siberia. They also generate stronger atmospheric feedbacks, produce more pyrocumulonimbus events, and strain firefighting capacity by dispersing suppression resources.

The earliest putative hominin, Sahelanthropus tchadensis (~7 million years old), was originally represented by a cranium, the reconstruction of which suggested to its discoverers that Sahelanthropus carried its head in a manner similar to known bipedal hominins. Recently, two partial ulnae and a femur shaft were announced as evidence in support of the contention that Sahelanthropus was an early biped, but those interpretations have been challenged. Here, while we find that both limb bones are most similar in size and geometric morphometric shape to chimpanzees (genus Pan ), we demonstrate that their relative proportion is more hominin-like. Furthermore, we confirm two features linked to hominin-like hip and knee function and identify a femoral tubercle, a feature only found in bipedal hominins. Our results suggest that Sahelanthropus was an early biped that evolved from a Pan -like Miocene ape ancestor.",

This flap was observed in both open and closed conformations using molecular dynamics simulations. The closed conformation is dependent on a hydrophobic patch of amino acids on the distal end of the flap. Functionally, YehD RBD is able to bind pectin, a polysaccharide ubiquitous in plant material. Mutations that interrupt the closed conformation increase the affinity of the protein to pectin, suggesting that the flap contributes mechanistically to pectin binding. Furthermore, in vivo, the pilus contributes to gastrointestinal (GI) tract colonization in the absence of the type 1 pilus. Hence, we report the ability of YehD to bind pectin representing a possible colonization mechanism of the GI tract via a structurally distinct CUP adhesin.",

Vacuum-driven layer jamming muscles in four tensegrity joints enable quick (≤1 s) stiffness modulation (stiffness ratio of 46.6) and gait switching. In thunniform gait, the robot reaches 1.24 body lengths per second, whereas in anguilliform gait, it achieves agile maneuvering with a turning radius of 0.26 body lengths. Fluid simulations show that the thunniform gait generates stronger vortices and 142% more thrust compared with anguilliform motion at 5 Hz, explaining its high-speed performance. The robot dynamically adapts gaits during locomotion—using thunniform for fast traversal and anguilliform for obstacle negotiation—demonstrating environmental adaptability.

Here, we combine SRS with 4Pi interferometry to enhance axial resolution nearly sevenfold. We report on improvements in imaging sensitivity and axial resolution using 80-nanometer polystyrene beads. Harnessing the improved axial resolution, we demonstrate super-resolution 4Pi-SRS imaging in resolving small lipid droplet structures in mammalian cells and lipid membranes in Escherichia coli cells. Because 4Pi-SRS uses interferometry to improve axial resolution, it is orthogonal to all previous super-resolution SRS techniques; thus, it is straightforward to integrate it with existing methods to achieve much higher resolution chemical imaging than previously possible.",

Here, we report the 2.59- to 2.88-Å cryo–electron microscopy structure of native human PLC bound to the HCMV immune evasin US6. US6 inhibits the transporter associated with antigen processing 1/2 (TAP1/2) by laterally attaching its transmembrane helix to TAP2 using a disulfide-rich domain to mimic a translocating peptide. This domain blocks the ER-lumenal exit and locks TAP in an outward-facing conformation with closed nucleotide-binding domains and asymmetric adenosine 5′-triphosphate/adenosine 5′-diphosphate occlusion. The structure also reveals how TAP’s amino-terminal transmembrane domains scaffold the MHC I chaperone tapasin. These findings elucidate the mechanism of US6-mediated immune evasion and highlight potential targets for therapeutic modulation of immune presentation in infection and cancer.",

By measuring the dynamic changes in phycosphere carbonate chemistry around single diatom cells, we show that DIC uptake is rapidly modulated. We find that external carbonic anhydrase (eCA) plays a major role in DIC uptake in large centric diatoms at ambient seawater CO 2 , but there is a strong switch to direct HCO 3 − uptake under low CO 2 . Inhibition of eCA leads to rapid activation of HCO 3 − uptake, which can compensate for the loss of eCA activity under lower irradiances. These different modes of DIC uptake have distinct influences on phycosphere carbonate chemistry that may directly affect nutrient acquisition and biotic interactions. Our findings reveal that dynamic modulation of DIC uptake allows diatoms to rapidly respond to changes in CO 2 supply and demand.",

We further demonstrate that NAMPT is both necessary and sufficient to drive APC proliferation and differentiation, with interleukin-33 (IL-33) acting downstream to mediate these effects.

The data show that myeloid cells phagocytose CNPs, undergo apoptosis, and release oxidized DNA [8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHG)]. Subsequently, Ag-specific CNP treatment increases the number of PD-L1 + cDC2 dendritic cells and the number of FoxP3 + , CTLA-4 + , PD-1 + , and IL-10 + regulatory CD4 + T cells via a stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR)–dependent pathway. In addition, these same pathways were found to be required for both Ag-coupled apoptotic leukocyte–induced and Ag-coupled red blood cell treatment–induced CD4 + T cell tolerance. Together, these results show that Ag-specific tolerance induced by the presence of apoptotic cells, and by CNP-induced apoptosis, requires the STING/IFNAR pathway, thereby illustrating a previously unknown function of this pathway.",

          "abstract": "Visual perception systems are evolving toward multifunctionality, miniaturization, and real-time intelligence, necessitating coadvancements in optical hardware and computational software. Computational optics enhances optical encoding through algorithms but faces computational limits, while optical computing offers photonic parallelism yet struggles with hardware complexity. Metaoptics, using subwavelength nanostructures for multidimensional light-field control, resolves this tension by serving dual roles: as an efficient computational optics encoder offloading algorithmic burdens and as a nanoscale optical computing processor enabling ultrahigh-density parallelism. This synergy drives computational optical integration for next-generation optoelectronics. This review outlines computational optics and optical computing fundamentals, analyzes metaoptics’ advantages in multidimensional optical information encoding and processing, and details recent metaoptics-based advances and challenges in computational optics, optical computing, and their convergence. The conclusion provides a future roadmap, highlighting metaoptics-driven integration’s potential for chip-scale intelligent visual perception by bridging the hardware-software divide to enable miniaturized devices with real-time adaptability, massive parallelism, and energy efficiency.",

          "abstract": "The CD4 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4-CTLs) with cytotoxic potential are reported to be the components of protective immune response in many diseases. However, the lack of understanding about their lineage, molecular character, and cytolytic potential in comparison to CD8 + (CD8)-CTLs has restricted their utility. Thus, here, by parallelly analyzing the human peripheral CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs, we demonstrate that they are indistinguishable for the cytotoxic program. Furthermore, using an integrative multiomics approach combining the transcriptome, T cell antigen-receptor repertoire, and open chromatin profile of CD4 + T cell memory subsets, we found a stem-cell memory subset that is precommitted to the cytotoxicity program. Through an in vitro differentiation model, we developed CD4 + T cells with cytolytic potential coexpressing and exhibiting progressive chromatin accessibility for cytotoxicity- and longevity-associated genes, hence generating long-lived CD4-CTL effectors of varying cytotoxic capacity. Together, our study advocates for exploring both CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs for vaccine development, vaccine efficacy testing, and immunotherapies and cell-based therapies for precision medicine.",

          "abstract": "Animals often display stereotyped behavioral patterns during timekeeping tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these behaviors are simply incidental—used by the animals to kill time—or whether they serve a functional role as part of the internal clock that enables animals to keep time. Here, using optogenetic stimulation of various brainstem, thalamic, and dopaminergic cell populations in mice trained on an action-timing task, we manipulated actions preceding the timing decision to causally test these hypotheses. Our findings show that bidirectional regulation of actions during the waiting period leads to corresponding temporal shifts in timing, with a consistent quantitative relationship between changes in the number of waiting-period actions and shifts in stop timing. Notably, nigrostriatal dopamine encodes actions, but not timing, directly, influencing timing only when waiting-period actions are modulated. These findings reveal a behavioral integration mechanism underlying action timing, in which actions performed during the waiting period function as a pacemaker for the internal clock.",

          "abstract": "Organic lateral heterostructures (OLHs) based on two-dimensional (2D) molecular crystals are formed through the coplanar assembly of multiple components, and they hold great promise for optoelectronic applications. However, the precise construction of 2D OLHs with noncoplanar epitaxial layers remains challenging, limiting further exploration of lateral heterojunctions. Here, we present a stepwise vapor-phase growth strategy for synthesizing 2D OLHs with interfacial fluctuation, forming convex, flat, and concave architectures. During the lateral epitaxial growth processes, higher growth temperatures enhance molecular deposition, driving the transition of the secondary component from in-plane to out-of-plane growth. Consequently, the epitaxial layer thickness is precisely tuned from 20 to 800 nm by increasing the growth temperature. The resulting OLHs exhibit orthogonally polarized exciton conversion, with dual photoluminescence emission bands at 450 and 670 nm, functioning as multimode photonic converters. These findings provide a strategy to regulate the epitaxial growth route of 2D OLHs, paving the way for integrated photonic circuits.",

          "abstract": "Airway basal stem cells (BCs) are recognized as resident stem cells responsible for reconstituting epithelial barriers and differentiating into multiple epithelial cell types following severe lung injury. However, the mechanism that the injured lung microenvironment uses to modulate BC-mediated lung repair remains unclear. Here, we showed that the profibrotic transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) gradient from the injured lung immune microenvironment can be sensed by BCs. Targeted degradation of Smad2/3 in human BCs via proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) disrupted TGF-β signaling, causing cell hyperplasia and barrier function loss after being transplanted into the alveolar area. Genetic ablation of the TGF-β receptor or Smad4 in mouse BCs impaired multilineage differentiation and suppressed migration to the alveolar injury site. These data indicated that TGF-β signaling is essential for BC-mediated lung repair. Moreover, we genetically engineered human BCs to release antifibrotic bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) in response to microenvironmental TGF-β stimulation. Transplantation of this iBMP7-BC enhanced lung repair and reduced fibrosis. Collectively, this study delineates how TGF-β governs BC behavior and provides a microenvironment-responsive cell therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.",

Using the imaging agent [ 68 Ga]AJ647, dynamic changes in the interaction of EV with Nectin-4 were measured across preclinical models and correlated with therapeutic responses. PET imaging identified dose-dependent variations in Nectin-4 engagement, with suboptimal EV doses resulting in incomplete Nectin-4 engagement and increased tumor growth. Crucially, PET-measured target engagement predicted therapeutic outcomes more reliably than either drug dose or baseline target expression. By defining effective target engagement levels needed for optimal therapeutic outcomes, PET imaging provides a clear benchmark for dosing decisions, maximizing efficacy while potentially reducing exposure to higher, toxic doses and thereby enhancing patient safety.",

We find a unique set of mis-spliced genes and differentially methylated CpGs in double mutants. Mis-spliced exons are enriched in CCNG splicing enhancers and in the corresponding DNAme changes. Using a machine learning model, we can accurately predict exon inclusion levels from proximal CpGs. These CpGs are more likely to overlap footprints of RNA binding and chromatin-modifying complexes but not transcription factors. We also report unique gene expression profiles associated with each genotype; however, the differentially expressed genes do not overlap with mis-spliced transcripts. Instead, the mis-spliced genes encode for proteins that interact with the complexes regulating these differentially expressed genes. Thus, aberrant DNAme and splicing lead to the mis-splicing of key regulatory complexes, resulting in the aberrant gene expression profiles characteristic of these AMLs.",

In contrast, certain magnetic semiconductors, such as chromium nitride (CrN), exhibit an increased thermal conductivity above its Néel temperature, predicted to be caused by strong spin-phonon coupling. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental verification and detailed understanding. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence showing that the enhanced thermal conductivity in CrN arises from anomalous temperature-dependent acoustic phonon lifetimes, driven by a dynamic coupling between spin fluctuations and acoustic phonons in the system. Temperature-dependent inelastic x-ray scattering measurements reveal that acoustic phonon lifetimes in CrN are strongly suppressed near Néel temperature but anomalously increase at higher temperatures. In contrast, the optical phonon lifetime decreases with rising temperature, akin to a nonmagnetic semiconductor, as it remains unaffected by spin-phonon coupling. This finding unveils the microscopic origin of anomalous heat transport behavior in magnetostructurally coupled materials, offering a pathway for effective thermal management in magnetic material–based devices.",

          "abstract": "What are the neural properties that make spatial contexts effective scaffolds for storing and accessing memories? Here we hypothesized that spatial locations with stable and distinctive (that is, reliable) neural representations would best support memory for new experiences. To test this, participants learned the layout of a custom-built 23-room virtual reality ‘memory palace’ that they explored using a head-mounted display. The next day, participants underwent whole-brain fMRI while watching videos of the rooms, allowing us to measure the reliability of the neural activity pattern associated with each room. Participants then returned to virtual reality to encode 23 objects placed in each of the 23 rooms and later recalled the rooms and objects during fMRI. We found that our room reliability measure (computed before encoding) predicted object reinstatement during recall across cortex; this was driven not only by group-level reliability across participants but also by idiosyncratic reliability within participants. Moreover, this effect did not arise through enhanced retrieval of reliable rooms during recall, because the relationship between reliability and object reinstatement remained significant when controlling for room reinstatement during retrieval; this suggests that, instead, room reliability promotes improved binding of rooms to objects at encoding. Together, these results showcase how the quality of the neural representation of a spatial context can be quantified and used to ‘audit’ its utility as a memory scaffold for future experiences.",

Here we conduct a preregistered systematic review and network meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42023403480) of randomized controlled trials evaluating well-being interventions in adults without diagnosed conditions. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and Scopus (to March 2023) identified 183 trials ( n = 22,811). Interventions included mindfulness-based, compassion-based, acceptance and commitment therapy and positive psychology interventions, as well as exercise, yoga, educational, nature-based programmes and combined exercise-psychological approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2, and data were synthesized using random-effects network meta-analysis. Most interventions improved well-being compared with inactive controls. Combined exercise-psychological interventions produced the largest effect (standardized mean difference of 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 1.20). Mindfulness, compassion, single positive psychology, yoga and exercise interventions demonstrated moderate, consistent effects (standardized mean difference of 0.41–0.49), with no significant differences between interventions. Nature-based interventions were not significantly more effective than controls, but evidence was limited by conceptual and methodological heterogeneity. Risk of bias was frequently moderate to high, and funnel plot asymmetry suggested potential publication bias. However, multiple sensitivity analyses (including grey literature, excluding studies with high risk of bias and small studies) supported the robustness of overall conclusions. Most comparisons (71%) were rated as moderate in certainty of evidence using CINEMA. These findings provide an integrated synthesis of the well-being intervention literature and highlight priority areas for future interdisciplinary, methodologically robust research.

Yet individuals systematically rate their personal risks as lower than those of others, believing themselves to be less at risk than others (that is, a self–other discrepancy). In a preregistered multi-level meta-analysis, we estimate the overall effect and boundary conditions for a self–other discrepancy in climate change-related risk perceptions. The synthesis incorporated 60 datasets, comprising 83 effect sizes from 70,337 participants across 17 countries. Results revealed that in 81 of 83 datasets, participants perceived their personal climate change-related risks as lower than others ( d = −0.54, 95% CI [−0.68, −0.39]). This skewness was robust across specific extreme weather-related hazards and general climate change-related risks. Notably, the self–other discrepancy was less pronounced when comparisons involved specific others (for example, neighbours) or high-risk regions (for example, Asia), and more pronounced when the referents were compatriots or humanity as a whole or when the context was low-risk regions (for example, Europe). These results highlight a critical implication for the general public and a challenge for risk communicators: a widespread misperception, where people perceive personal climate change-related risks as lower than others, may hinder public engagement in mitigation and adaptation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Cities are highly vulnerable to climate change, yet the interactions between urban and regional climate remain insufficiently understood, especially over climate changes timescales and when comparing cities globally. Therefore, this study assesses the capabilities of two CORDEX-CORE regional climate models (REMO and RegCM) in representing urban areas globally, focusing on land-surface characteristics and urban heat island (UHI) evaluation. Despite their relatively coarse resolution (~25 km), the two models can capture urban imprints of large cities. RegCM, with a single-layer urban canopy parameterization, represents the UHI, especially at night. REMO tends to underestimate nighttime UHI due to its simple bulk urban scheme. Across models, impervious surface areas are consistently underestimated, with notable geographic imbalances across the world. Going forward, regional climate model simulations for cities require both enhanced urban parameterizations and the integration of refined urban land-use data.",

          "abstract": "The EU Nature Restoration Regulation suggests the implementation of green space as nature-based solutions to enhance urban resilience toward increasing climate risks such as extreme precipitation events and floods in Europe. Scenario based approaches enable the evaluation of the potential of specific nature-based solutions to mitigate flood risk in high flood hazard and vulnerable areas. In this study, we explore the flood risks from heavy rainfall and the potential of nature-based solutions implementations in the city of Hannover, Germany. Using the InVEST urban flood risk mitigation model, we modelled the surface runoff from heavy rainfall and assessed the social vulnerability using population and infrastructure data resulting in a flood risk evaluation. To test flood mitigation under nature-based solutions implementations including grass grid pavers and green roofs, we estimated the runoff improvement under three nature-based solutions scenarios following recommendations from the EU Nature Restoration Regulation. Our analysis revealed that Hannover’s inner-city area is particularly flood-prone and socially vulnerable, while peripheral districts are less affected. The combined risk and vulnerability arise from the surface sealing in built-up areas and their higher population density and associated infrastructure. The scenario results demonstrate flood risk reduction potential when combining different nature-based solutions, though on a limited level calling for more explicit and ambitious regulations at EU, regional and local levels.",

          "abstract": "Urban livability is shaped by dominant values, often economic or aesthetic, and power dynamics that often overlook the lived experiences of deprived urban area (DUA) residents. As a result, conventional livability indicators risk reinforcing existing inequalities unless these are grounded in inclusive and participatory approaches. To address this issue, we developed lightweight deep learning models – ‘AI-voters’ – trained on livability preferences from both DUA residents and city planners, using open-source satellite imagery. Applied in Ghana’s Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, our approach reduced data requirements to map urban livability by 90% through a two-step urban form sampling strategy that enabled scalable participatory mapping. Training separate ‘AI-voters’ for planners and DUA residents revealed systematic differences: planners not only disagree among themselves but also consistently assign higher livability scores and overlook the preferences of DUA residents, such as avoiding coastal area exposure. The AI-voters mirrored human-voter behavior based on physical urban features such as greenery and building density, especially when trained on the preferences of DUA residents, demonstrating their potential as scalable proxies for local insights. These results highlight the importance of integrating community perspectives into AI models trained to map urban livability to expose hidden spatial inequities and promote more inclusive urban development.",

          "abstract": "Urban resilience and vulnerability are often paired conceptually, but the dynamics of their relationships are rarely tested with space-time-based data. We tracked the 2019 European heatwave across Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, combining hour-by-hour ambulance calls with district profiles identified from demographic, socioeconomic, health, and built environment attributes. We find significant differences in the factors driving vulnerability. The familiar rule of ‘more vulnerable, less resilient’ only partially holds: some vulnerable districts showed high resilience at particular times of the day, while seemingly less vulnerable districts showed low resilience. These swings point to the importance of local adaptive behaviours and urban social fabric in shaping dynamic vulnerability-resilience relationships. Our findings call for dynamic, district-specific planning: vulnerability assessments must look beyond averages, and resilience measures should flex with daily rhythms. Effective heatwave policy demands context-aware tools that treat resilience and vulnerability as intertwined, shifting properties of the urban social fabric.",
