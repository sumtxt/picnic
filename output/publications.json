          "title": "More than Symbols: The Effect of Symbolic Policies on Climate Policy Support",
          "authors": "THEODORE TALLENT, MALO JAN, LUIS SATTELMAYER",
          "abstract": "As climate change effects become increasingly salient, the need for stringent climate policies becomes more pressing. The implementation of such policies is often met with resistance from the public due to their perceived costs and distributional implications. Scholars have mostly focused on material compensations to increase public support among policy losers. This article goes beyond the existing literature by showing how what we term symbolic policies can enhance support for costlier policies. We define symbolic policies as policies sending meaningful messages to the public but having low material impacts. We argue that without changing the material costs that climate policies impose, symbolic policies increase public support by altering the message that costly policies convey. We demonstrate our argument using survey experiments and qualitative interviews conducted in France, showing that symbolic policies can significantly increase support for costly climate policies and increase perceptions of fairness, elite behavior, and government credibility.",

          "authors": "Oscar Stuhler, Iddo Tavory, Robin Wagner-Pacifici",
          "abstract": "Questions of temporality are at the heart of climate change discourse: Does one think of climate change primarily as an event happening in the present, or as something that will take place in the future? By when must we take action to prevent its worst consequences? This article presents the first large-scale assessment of the structure and evolution of temporalities expressed in U.S. media discussions on climate change (2000 to 2021). To do so, we developed a novel computational framework for detecting and interpreting temporal expressions in textual data. Our analyses yield three main findings: First, temporal horizons for climate change have continuously shrunk since 2000, stably targeting, on average, the year 2060. However, second, while anticipated effects are getting closer, horizons for the coordination of climate action have remained highly stable, averaging around 16 years into the future at any given time. Third, contrasting the stability of explicitly stated horizons, we find a sharply expanding discourse of urgency patterned by outbursts of urgency: sudden surges in calls for immediate action or warnings against climate change’s devastating consequences during events like the 2020 California wildfires. By uncovering this disjuncture of different forms of temporality, we illuminate a crucial aspect of the climate change debate, contribute to the sociological theory of events, and identify some of the conditions underlying climate inaction.",

          "authors": "Christine R. Schwartz, Michael D. King",
          "abstract": "Despite vast changes in women’s status in society and in the home, we have little understanding of the changing role of mothers in shaping children’s life chances. Has mothers’ influence on their children’s educational outcomes grown alongside these shifts? Using data from three large nationally representative U.S. surveys, we find that the returns to mothers’ status—measured as their education, occupational status, and earnings—have remained relatively stable and similar to the returns to fathers’ status among children born from the 1930s to the 1980s, thus accounting for little of the observed increase in children’s college completion. This surprising continuity of the returns to mothers’ status aligns with past evidence of relatively stable intergenerational associations in the face of social change. But this does not mean nothing has changed. Our decomposition results show that increases in women’s education, occupational status, and earnings have meant that increased levels of mothers’ status account for more of the increase in children’s college completion than does fathers’ status among cohorts born since the 1960s. That continued increases in college completion have more to do with the rising status of mothers than fathers has been overlooked by previous research.",

          "authors": "Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Ignacio Jurado, Markus Wagner",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, support for the far right has surged in many countries. One common explanation for this is that far-right support is a backlash against left-wing governments and their policies. We investigate the causal effect of the partisan make-up of governments on the electoral results of far-right parties. Evidence from over-time comparative data and a quasi-experimental analysis based on a regression discontinuity design in Spain indicates that far-right parties benefit electorally when the current government is on the left. In further analyses, we employ a novel regression discontinuity design (RDD)-based sampling strategy to examine original individual-level survey data from Spanish municipalities close to the discontinuity cutoff. These data show that the likely mechanism underlying the backlash effect is an ideological shift to the right among the electorate when left-wing parties govern. Overall, the far right benefits more when the mainstream left governs than when the mainstream right does.",

          "abstract": "Political representation is challenged by social acceleration, the rise of populism, and electoral volatility. Politicians’ need for prioritizing time and energy is acute and consequential for democracy. Voters’ preferences constitute one democratically relevant standard for guiding such priorities. However, current research mainly focuses on voters’ preferences for representatives’ personality traits or policy outcomes, which are hard for an individual politician to control. This study provides a conceptual framework for analyzing politicians’ task priority by separating functional legislative tasks from relational representative tasks, and employs this framework in surveys among Danish, German, UK, and US voters. Analyses of open-ended answers, time allocations, and conjoint experiments show that voters assign higher importance to functional tasks compared to relational tasks. The framework offers a new approach to studying political representation in practice, and the results provide guidance for how politicians should prioritize scarce resources for political representation in a high-speed, volatile political context.",

          "abstract": "Legislative oversight is an important element of the relationship between parliament and government. However, little research explores how the characteristics of ministers incentivize MPs to oversee some more thoroughly than others. This article studies whether and why the oversight activities of parliamentarians are shaped by ministers’ gender. We argue that legislators control women ministers more tightly than men due to stereotypical competence ascriptions and perceptions of lower trustworthiness of women. Studying original data for five European democracies since 1990, we show that legislators ask more written and oral questions to women compared to men ministers. Moreover, we underpin the causal mechanisms behind this pattern using semi-structured interviews with thirty-two parliamentarians inquiring about a specific replacement in that country. Revealing gender bias in legislative oversight has broader implications for women in government and parliamentary democracies.",

          "abstract": "What explains opposition to refugees? Aside from cultural, economic, and safety-related threats, existing research suggests that individuals are less tolerant when they think their state lacks the capacity to control external borders. Focusing solely on external borders, however, overlooks another dimension of migration management: reception and integration. I argue that perceptions of a state’s refugee reception capacity shape refugee-related attitudes. Three studies – focusing on Ukrainian refugees in Central and Eastern Europe – provide evidence. Study 1 analyzes opposition to Ukrainian refugees and the reception programs intended to benefit them. Study 2, a design-based analysis, shows that expanding a state’s capacity to manage refugee reception causes individuals to consider refugees less of a problem. Study 3, a pre-registered survey experiment, replicates this finding and investigates whether effects extend beyond problem perception. Findings suggest that investing in effective refugee reception may improve the lives of refugees while also reducing public opposition.",

          "authors": "Anna F. Callis",
          "abstract": "Why do some economic elites support democratization while others oppose? I argue elites’ strategies of labor control play a key role. Economic elites included in authoritarian ruling coalitions benefit from state-backed labor repression, making a democratic transition especially costly. Excluded elites generally benefit less from state-condoned repression and instead pursue co-optive control, providing select concessions designed to monitor and influence worker activities (e.g., employer-sponsored unions). Since co-optation is more easily transferred to democratic contexts, it reduces the risks associated with a democratic transition. Excluded elites are thus more likely to support democratization. I evaluate this argument using a natural experiment that leverages random variation in economic elites’ exclusion from the authoritarian ruling coalition in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Argentina. I employ a novel measure of support for democratization based on an original dataset of local, pro-democracy committees. The findings contribute to scholarship on regime change by examining when economic elites—key authoritarian stakeholders—support democratization.",

          "abstract": "We document that business cycle dynamics change systematically over the course of development. In countries with large but shrinking agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP, and agricultural employment falls during booms, even as agricultural labour productivity rises. We develop a unified theory of business cycles and structural change that captures these patterns. The theory emphasises the simultaneous decline and modernisation of agriculture, driven by capital accumulation. As agriculture becomes increasingly capital-intensive, traditional practices are crowded out. We estimate the model and show that it accounts for both structural transformation and business cycle fluctuations in China.",

We carried out two complementary field experiments in Russia at the city and individual levels, randomising access to the country’s only independent TV channel before the 2016 parliamentary elections. In both experiments, we find that independent media foster polarisation. They increase turnout and pro-government votes among regime supporters. However, this effect only applies to voters who rely on news from social media. Among consumers of traditional media, the independent channel uniformly decreases regime support. Our results highlight how social media can condition the effect of traditional media.",

We implement randomized treatments that (i) increase the salience of the existing traditional norm prescribing labor supply of mothers and fathers of young children, and (ii) correct misperceptions about the norm’s content. The treatments significantly reduce girls’ self-expected labor supply and increase the expected within-family gender gap.",

          "abstract": "In a semi-presidential system, which is the most common regime type in Europe, a separately elected president shares executive powers with the government. This dual-executive model incentivizes conflicts that reduce the capacity for effective decision-making. Alongside constitutional rules, the intraexecutive power balance is conditioned by informal practices in response to public opinion. Increasing public demand for a more powerful presidential role can thus ‘presidentialize’ dual executives. Utilizing novel survey data from Finland, we examine the factors that condition support for a stronger presidency. Relative to the country’s highly institutionalized and strongly government-driven political system, we find substantial support for a formally stronger and more confrontational presidency. This support is systematically connected with the typical features of a populist electorate (such as, for example, distrust in political institutions, male voters and ‘populist’ concerns) and we demonstrate that such respondents are also more willing to reduce the powers of parliamentary institutions. The strengthening of such attitudes can potentially destabilize semi-presidential regimes.",

          "abstract": "Assisted Return (AR) programmes have grown in number and size over the past decade and there is an increasing body of evidence on these programmes. However, the existing evidence has not yet been systematically synthesised. Recognising the controversy over the programmes, this article reviews the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and effects of AR programmes that aim to facilitate sustainable reintegration of return migrants. Reviewing 46 sources, the findings highlight the different programme modalities, contextual factors and individual and group factors that influence sustainable reintegration. Overall, the available evidence suggests that despite short‐term relief from AR programmes, there is overall scant and—where it exists—often highly contextual and relatively weak evidence of longer‐term effects on sustainable reintegration. The review is limited by conceptual, methodological and geographic heterogeneity in the available studies. The article concludes by suggesting practical implications and highlighting potential for future research on support for sustainable reintegration.",

          "authors": "Emmanuel Quarshie, James Teye Baduor, Joseph Mensah, Kingsley Laar",
          "abstract": "This paper interrogates the structural inequalities underpinning global mobility by introducing the concept of mobility bias, the systemic privileging of Global North citizens and diplomatic infrastructures in transnational movement. Drawing on Doreen Massey's Power Geometry and informed by the works of Foucault, Mbembe and Cortina, the study positions mobility as a spatially governed hierarchy shaped by geopolitical power, economic status and institutional capacity. While migration studies have largely focused on individual migrant outcomes, this paper shifts attention to diplomatic disparities that reinforce immobility for Global South nations and their citizens. Through comparative desk‐based analysis of passport indices, visa policies, foreign ministry budgets and regional frameworks, the paper examines four intersecting dimensions of inequality: passport stratification, consular burden, resource asymmetry and perception bias. These disparities are not merely bureaucratic but constitute enduring architectures of exclusion within the migration‐development nexus. Findings reveal that Global South missions are structurally constrained, underfunded, reactive and burdened by managing the fallout of restrictive regimes, while Global North missions advance strategic interests through expansive mobility diplomacy. Regional fragmentation and weak multilateral leverage further limit Global South agency in shaping mobility governance. The paper concludes that mobility bias is not a peripheral issue but a reproductive mechanism of global inequality. It calls for a multi‐scalar reform agenda, including visa policy restructuring, diplomatic capacity‐building and regional harmonisation, to advance a more just, inclusive and developmentally transformative mobility regime.",

The demarcation of the 38th parallel between the two Koreas not only reshaped geographical accessibility in the region by transforming what was once internal migration to emigration, but also the regulatory mechanism for containment within the Korean peninsula. The securitisation of departure was institutionalised and operationalised through administrative discretion, exercised under authoritarian governance and legitimised by delegated legislation, thereby hollowing out the constitutional essence of the right to freedom of movement. As a space of contested jurisdiction, departure served as a critical site of state power, a foundation of state identity and a battleground between law and politics.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the migration trajectories and return experiences of Turkish nationals who sought entry to Europe via regular and irregular channels but ultimately returned to Türkiye. Employing a mixed‐methods approach, the study analyses how migrants' actions are shaped by the recursive interplay between structural forces—legal regimes, socio‐economic inequalities and border governance—and individual agency. Grounded in Giddens' Structuration Theory, the analysis conceptualises migration and return as socially embedded practices mediated by institutional constraints and transnational imaginaries. Aspirational narratives of Europe, informed by digital media and social networks, initially guided mobility decisions but often collided with restrictive legal frameworks and socio‐economic exclusion, prompting return as a reflexive recalibration. Rather than a linear or emotive process, return is framed as a negotiated response to structurally embedded conditions. The article advances debates on irregular migration and reintegration by calling for policy approaches that account for both structural determinants and the adaptive agency of returnees.",

          "abstract": "Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted multiple resolutions condemning the aggression and calling for the withdrawal of Russian forces. While some Global South countries supported these measures, many refrained from taking a critical stance toward Moscow, despite clear violations of international law. What accounts for this divided response? Departing from existing explanations that focus on contemporary geopolitical or economic interests, this paper traces Global South countries’ positions to the Soviet Union’s extensive Cold War–era interventions in the developing world. We argue that states that received greater volumes of Soviet aid are significantly more likely to align with Russia today, driven by both material dependencies and ideational legacies. Empirically, we demonstrate that the observed association withstands extensive robustness tests and is substantiated by evidence for both material and ideational mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of a historical-institutional approach to understanding international alignment in the Global South and call for moving beyond the Liberal International Order framework when analyzing global responses to contemporary conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Electoral violence is a serious threat to free and fair elections. Theoretical explanations of electoral violence increasingly move beyond simplified incumbent-opposition dichotomies, and yet, there is a lack of nuanced actor data needed to test such explanations. This special data feature introduces the Modes and Agents of Election-Related Violence in Côte d’Ivoire and Kenya (MAVERICK) dataset, an actor-centered georeferenced event report dataset on electoral violence. MAVERICK includes 2,200 electoral violence events in Côte d’Ivoire (1995–2022) and Kenya (1992–2022), covering all multiparty elections since the (re)introduction of democracy in the 1990s. MAVERICK’s granular information on actor characteristics, affiliations, and roles, as well as added indicators of violence intensity, makes the dataset ideal for developing and testing nuanced theories on the causes, dynamics, and consequences of electoral violence. The article introduces the conceptual and operational definitions used, outlines the data structure and data collection approach, and provides a first analysis of the actors of electoral violence in the Côte d’Ivoire and Kenya. Moreover, we highlight the dataset’s value by examining how involvement by different branches of the security forces shapes electoral violence intensity, and demonstrate that police involvement is associated with less intense violence, while paramilitary police involvement is associated with more serious violence.",

          "abstract": "Why do some peace agreements lead to electoral reforms rather than guaranteeing power to rebels through implementing power-sharing guarantees? This research question has not been thoroughly explored in the peace science literature. In this article, I argue that strategic interactions between the government and rebels with distinct attributes answer this question. Electoral participation provisions will be more likely to be implemented when stronger center-seeking rebels participate in peace negotiations. Unlike weaker center-seeking rebels, they push for extensive political power-sharing guarantees, and negotiations will be focused on the government's effort to minimize the rebels' access to significant power in the center by alternatively offering electoral participation provisions. In contrast, both stronger and weaker territorial rebels will seek territorial power-sharing or political power-sharing guarantees that enable them to govern their territories, as their primary goal is securing local/regional autonomy. Such demands are more acceptable to the government as they do not require significant concessions of power in the center. I assess my theory using global power-sharing agreements covering the period from 1975 to 2021. The findings provide empirical support for my expectations and are also robust to different measurements and model specifications. I conclude this article by discussing the implications of these findings.",

Using survey experiments in the United States and the United Kingdom, we find that among our four norm-reinforcing information treatments, only references to principled conduct by close and like-minded allies can significantly increase public willingness to prosecute and uphold the rule of law in both countries, although this finding is highly dependent on the specific ally referenced. Depending on the context and application, highlighting national outgroup violations and potential hypocrisy by leveraging the timing of the survey to capture the abuse of Ukrainians by Russian soldiers, at least temporarily increased the willingness to prosecute in the United States. Otherwise, leveraging pride in the military to reinforce norms, or informing the public about their government's commitment to these norms does little to alter attitudes. Although communicating norms in ways that have cultural and national salience has the potential to strengthen public commitment to accountability, where there are strong preexisting partisan and national loyalties it is difficult to do so.",

          "authors": "Samson Yuen",
          "abstract": "How do protesters restrain their use of violent tactics in leaderless and decentralized mass protests? While existing research highlights the role of leaders and movement organizations in enforcing nonviolent discipline, we lack understanding of how protester violence is regulated from within protest movements in the absence of centralized leadership. This article addresses this puzzle through a case study of Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Movement of 2019. Through content and descriptive statistical analysis of LIHKG, an influential online discussion forum widely used by protesters during the movement, I examine the discursive strategies protesters employed to restrain violent escalation through the construction of “internal brakes”—discursive reasonings that aim to establish normative boundaries around the tactical use of violence. In addition to describing the basic characteristics of these internal brakes, I identify four subtypes based on their normative logic: proportionality, conditionality, consequentiality, and moral sanity. By analyzing how these brakes emerged and operated in relation to various forms of protester violence during the movement, I demonstrate that their salience varied depending on contextual factors including the target scope, predictability, and severity of the violence they aimed to restrain. The findings contribute to the contentious politics literature by developing a novel theoretical framework for understanding self-regulation mechanisms in leaderless and decentralized movements that experience tactical radicalization.",

          "abstract": "Do Ukrainians still categorically reject political and territorial concessions to Russia as found by Dill et al. (2024a) in July 2022? Or have their attitudes toward resistance changed given mounting costs and uncertain benefits of self-defense against Russia’s aggression? Between December 2024 and January 2025, we presented the original and a modified conjoint experiment with stronger cost treatments to 2,580 Ukrainian citizens, sampled from largely the same locations as before. We find continued categorical resistance to Russian control. Resistance to accepting political neutrality or conceding territory meanwhile has weakened. Ethnic Ukrainians and less war-affected respondents remain comparatively more willing to resist Russia’s aggression than other respondents. Locations’ exposure to war-related violence is not associated with changes in Ukrainians’ attitudes since 2022. Our findings help us better understand how the attitudes of conflict-affected populations evolve over time and shed light on public support for a potential political settlement in Ukraine.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have questioned whether nonviolent tactics can be effective for ethnic minorities. However, they often overlook multiethnic coalitions, shifts in campaign composition, and ethnicity’s parallel role in armed tactics. This paper re-evaluates the relationship between ethnicity, tactics, and outcomes in civil conflicts. To do so, we introduce new data on ethnic groups in contention that offer time-variant measures of the ethnic attributes of campaigns. We find that the effectiveness of nonviolent tactics for ethnic minorities depends on the point of comparison. Campaigns composed solely of excluded groups succeed less often than those made up entirely of privileged groups. However, minorities have still fared better when using nonviolent as compared to violent tactics. Additional analyses explore ethnic diversity, multiethnic coalitions, hybrid tactics, and alternative measures of success. Taken together, our findings complicate a prevailing assertion that nonviolent tactics are only effective for members of privileged groups.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin plays a critical role in modulating social cognition and enhancing human memory for faces. However, it remains unclear which phase of memory oxytocin affects to enhance face memory. Our study explored oxytocin’s potential to selectively enhance the consolidation of social memories, specifically human faces, and whether this effect varies between genders. In three preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N = 445, comprising 227 males and 218 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study 1), before retrieval (i.e., Study 2), and before encoding (i.e., Study 3) in three parallel studies. This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocin’s effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval or encoding. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval or before-encoding, significantly improved female participants’ ability to recognize male faces 24 h later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of the social placebo effect—where the belief in receiving oxytocin produces effects similar to those of actual intranasal oxytocin administration—and the approachability ratings during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin specifically enhances the consolidation of long-term social memories in women recognizing male faces. These findings imply that oxytocin selectively enhances the consolidation of human social memory, potentially deepening our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social memory processes.",

          "abstract": "To reduce current and future coastal flood risk, it is critical to better understand how adaptation measures, including nature-based solutions, can reduce that risk. Globally, hybrid coastal defenses, including a combination of coastal vegetation, such as salt marshes and mangroves, with a dike or sea wall, have been highlighted as a promising adaptation measure. Here, we present a global-scale assessment of the potential risk reduction from mangrove restoration in combination with foreshore dike systems under scenarios of climate and socioeconomic change. We provide a quantitative assessment of the benefits in terms of reduced economic damage, exposed population, and poverty exposure. We evaluate mangrove restoration fronting dikes by accounting for wave–vegetation interaction. If mangrove foreshore dike systems were established along coastlines susceptible to flooding, restoration could potentially reduce expected annual damage by US$800 million and reduce expected affected population by 140,000 annually. These values increase under future projections. Our benefit–cost analysis finds mangrove restoration economically viable for about half of the subnational regions assessed (85 to 105 out of 208). At the global scale, the benefit–cost ratio under future conditions ranges from 3 to 6, with a net present value between US$44 billion and US$125 billion. Because absolute risk values and benefit–cost analysis do not differentiate between relative wealth impacts, we also estimated restoration impacts across different wealth levels. We show that restoring mangroves disproportionately benefits people with lower incomes, as they are often more exposed to coastal flooding and located in areas suitable for mangrove restoration. As such, mangrove restoration in low- and middle-income countries could contribute to the resilience of people in poverty.",

          "authors": "Tim T. Morris, Liam Wright, Gemma Shireby, David Bann",
          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to investigate whether the predictors of educational attainment (EA) have changed across time. Here, we provide insights by incorporating genetic predictors of education in three nationally representative British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958, and 1970. We investigated whether individual characteristics as proxied by polygenic indexes (PGIs) for EA and cognition have become more relevant to educational success over time and whether returns to genetic predisposition were moderated by early life socioeconomic background. We present three findings. First, associations between the EA PGI and attainment increased over time, with increasing incremental variance explained by the EA PGI. Second, associations between the cognition PGI and attainment were broadly consistent across cohorts, and there was no clear change in explained variance. Since the EA PGI captures multiple traits related to educational success, factors other than those related to cognition may have become more relevant over time. Third, we observed strong evidence of interaction: Associations between the EA PGI and EA were disproportionately larger among those from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. The strength and pattern of associations varied when using EA PGIs that were less conservatively filtered for SNPs. Our findings suggest EA is influenced by social and genetic factors both independently and jointly. Genetic liability and social background could be considered as two forms of inherited advantage which synergistically influence education attainment.",

Using computational techniques, we quantify how much media attention an incident gets, the topics and linguistic style of articles, and how participants in the incidents are framed. We find significant generalized disparities in media coverage and portrayal of incidents depending on whether they occur in neighborhoods that are majority white or majority people of color (POC), including increased media attention on police shootings if they occur in majority POC neighborhoods, greater focus on the people involved in incidents in majority white neighborhoods, and increased racialization and framing related to crime in majority POC neighborhoods.",

          "authors": "Willem Boterman, Eelco Harteveld",
          "abstract": "This article explores how meat consumption in the Netherlands has become aligned with ideology. The study leverages survey data from 2008 to 2022 to analyse changes in the relationship between meat consumption and political beliefs. The findings reveal that meat consumption is increasingly associated with right-wing ideology, nativism and, in particular, climate-change scepticism. This comes at the relative expense of predictors such as animal welfare considerations. This shift reflects a broader cultural conflict, where dietary choices symbolize deeper ideological divides. The changing political alignment of meat has implications for the protein transition, suggesting that consumption patterns may become more entrenched, complicating efforts for policy interventions. The study highlights the Netherlands as a significant case due to its multiparty system and the political salience of livestock farming, potentially serving as a bellwether for broader European trends.",

          "abstract": "In our times, talk of ‘transitioning’ to a world without fossil fuels has become pervasive. Despite its prevalence in environmental politics, this article argues that it is counterproductive to envisage the current conjuncture through the prism of a transition. I defend this claim by first outlining three respects in which the transition paradigm falls short: political corruptibility, historical inadequacy and conceptual confusion. Rather than recuperate the meaning of transitioning for progressive purposes, the constructive part of the article then asks which analytical framework should take its place. My proposal is to take inspiration from Antonio Gramsci’s notion of an interregnum to illuminate the distinctive political challenges of the Anthropocene. Gramsci’s conceptual apparatus foregrounds the fundamental openness of the future and thus facilitates a better understanding of various ‘morbid symptoms’, whose proliferation today can only be explained through a theoretical approach that combines attention to both individual well-being and social pathologies.",

          "abstract": "Automation in public administration is often seen as a recent, purely digital phenomenon that transforms decision‐making and governance. This article challenges that view by elucidating a historical continuum in the automation of administrative decision‐making. It introduces the concept of analog automation to highlight how complex social, organizational, legal, and historical factors have impacted decision‐makers' discretionary space and paved the way for digital automation. Drawing on public administration, science and technology studies, and sociolegal scholarship, the article uses analog automation to study the gradual yet significant change of automation in Finland's social assistance system over four decades. Analysis of legislative and policy documents shows how discretionary space has been gradually restricted by changes in organizational structures and practices and their adoption into legal obligations. The article provides historical context to current debates on digital transformation, showing how long‐standing institutional developments enable automation and how standardization and discretion have become increasingly intertwined.",

          "authors": "Michelle L. Lofton, Juan Pablo Martínez Guzmán",
          "abstract": "Participatory budgeting can encourage meaningful community engagement in all phases of the budgeting cycle to promote social equity. However, participatory budgeting administrators often experience administrative and political challenges in establishing participatory processes that effectively promote social equity. Using an integrated social equity framework that builds on the concept of sustainable governance, we create an implementation framework to evaluate PB systems and guide practitioners and scholars. We build on survey and interview data from 27 jurisdictions in the United States and Canada to explore the main administrative challenges in each stage of the PB implementation process. Our findings reveal four primary administrative pitfalls: the episodic nature of training programs, challenges in managing the political environment, issues with internal coordination and bureaucratic red tape, and difficulties in communicating PB process expectations. Policies and practices can be formalized to mitigate these challenges and enhance the possibility of building equitable participatory systems.",

          "abstract": "The nature and epistemological foundations of Public Administration (PA) have long been debated, primarily by scholars from the Global North who draw on their own historical and institutional contexts. Recently, leading international journals in Public Administration have increasingly and proactively incorporated the experiences of Global South countries, recognizing the diversity and heterogeneity in how PA is understood and taught. However, these contributions often stop short of engaging with the deeper epistemological and ontological tensions within the PA discipline's intellectual development. This article aims to represent how the Chilean PA community engages the field‐discipline tension through the qualitative analysis of 18 interviews with directors of undergraduate PA programs. The findings highlight a dual challenge: first, a limited understanding of the intellectual traditions shaping PA, which hinders its consolidation as a discipline; and second, a fragmented discourse on interdisciplinarity that lacks coherence and strategic integration. The study contributes to broader discussions on the identity of PA in the Global South.",

          "authors": "Colt Jensen",
          "abstract": "This manuscript systematically reviews 221 peer‐reviewed studies on rural public sector organizations published in 15 leading public administration journals between 1980 and 2022. It addresses three core questions: (1) How has rurality been conceptualized and measured? (2) What outcomes are attributed to rurality? and (3) Where is further research most needed? Key trends in publication patterns, geographic focus, citation networks, research design, and measurement strategies are analyzed. Findings reveal growing academic interest and increasingly sophisticated approaches to defining and studying rurality. However, the literature remains fragmented, often relying on inconsistent definitions and underrepresenting non‐US contexts. For both scholars and practitioners, the review highlights the need for clearer conceptual frameworks and more consistent measures to better understand how rural settings shape governance, service delivery, and administrative capacity. Improved conceptual clarity and global inclusion are critical for building a more cohesive, policy‐relevant research agenda for rural public administration.",

This study develops a theory of voting behavior in prosecutor elections. I utilized the recall of a progressive prosecutor to examine voters’ revealed preferences in a pivotal crime and justice politics setting. I show that the correct response to voters requires attention to legal reform’s intensive and extensive margins. Despite the media narratives, I argue that voters favor reforming the intensity of the criminal legal system; voters support reducing outcomes’ harshness but not limiting the scope of prosecuted behavior. This research also indicates that moral concerns drive support for decreasing the intensive margin, while opposition to changing the extensive margin is rooted in the desire to maintain deterrence. Politicians who intend to end mass incarceration should focus on reducing the criminal legal system’s intensive margin to gain political approval.",

          "abstract": "We introduce and validate a novel approach to identifying good managers. In a pre-registered lab experiment, we causally identify managerial contributions by randomly assigning managers to teams and controlling for individual skill. We find that manager contributions are crucial for team success, and that people who self-select into management roles perform worse than randomly assigned managers. Managerial performance is strongly predicted by economic decision-making skill, but not by demographic characteristics. Two validation studies support our experimental results. Participants who succeed in the lab receive more real-world promotions and, in a separate study of retail store managers, skill measures strongly predict store sales. A one standard deviation increase in manager quality increases annual per-store sales by $4.1 million USD (25% increase). Selecting managers on skills rather than demographic characteristics or the desire to lead could substantially improve organizational performance.",

We run a randomised control trial in remote, rural Ethiopia to explore this and evaluate an intervention which aims to change how poor people perceive their future opportunities, alter their aspirations and, through that, modify their investment decisions. A treatment group was shown video documentaries featuring individuals from similar communities who escaped poverty through their own efforts and serve as relatable role models. Five years after the screening took place, the treated households had increased future-oriented investments in agriculture, children’s education and assets. The results can be explained by an increase in aspirations in terms of lifetime goals. Overall, this research uniquely provides evidence that a light-touch behavioural intervention can have persistent economic impacts on a poor population.",

We document descriptively that long-term financial factors are not top of mind when mothers decide on their employment level. Moreover, a substantial share of women holds overly optimistic expectations about pension receipt and wage growth under part-time work. In a large-scale field experiment in Switzerland, we randomly assign mothers working part-time as teachers to receive objective information about the long-run costs of reduced labor supply. The treatment increases both demand for financial information and future labor supply plans, in particular among women who underestimate the costs of part-time work. Leveraging linked employer administrative data one year post-intervention, we find that this group of mothers increases working hours by 7 percent. These findings underscore that policies reducing information frictions in labor supply decisions may help address remaining gender gaps in the labor market.",

Using a difference-in-difference design, I exploit quasi-experimental variation in U.S. patent term across technological fields due to the ratification of TRIPs agreements in 1995. Despite a general increase in average patent term, in most fields innovators faced a considerable probability of patent term reduction for future innovations. Three key findings emerge: (1) R&amp;D and innovation accelerate more in fields with a higher probability of patent term reduction, i.e., a shorter average patent term extension, before implementation. (2) This heightened activity persists for at least five years post-implementation, driven by indirect effects where the news-related acceleration fosters further innovation through technological externalities linked to cumulative knowledge creation. (3) Conversely, the direct effect of a shorter extension in patent term would stimulate relatively less innovation, absent the indirect effects of anticipation.",

We use data from water markets in southeastern Spain and explore a specific change in the institutions to allocate water. On the one hand, frictions arose because poor farmers were liquidity constrained. On the other hand, farmers who were part of the wealthy elite were not liquidity constrained. We estimate a structural dynamic demand model by taking advantage of the fact that water demand for both types of farmers is determined by the technological constraint imposed by the crop's production function. This approach allows us to differentiate liquidity constraints from unobserved heterogeneity. We show that the institutional change from an auction to a quota increased total efficiency for the farmers considered. Welfare increased by 23.4 real pesetas per farmer per tree, a 6 percent increase in total production relative to the market.",

Using household-level data from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey and Current Population Survey between 1990 and 2020, we decompose overall changes in per household consumption into three components: average income, cross-household income distribution, and consumption habits, which include energy efficiency. Growth of average income caused consumption to increase by 11%, and rising income inequality reduced consumption by 8%, nearly entirely offsetting the effect of income growth. Changes in habits also reduced consumption. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate an unexpected effect of rising income inequality: climate and air quality improvements valued at $9 billion in 2020 due to lower electricity consumption. The results indicate the importance of coordinating policies that address inequality and pollution.",

At the same time, local job search is reduced with adverse consequences for reemployment and earnings. A detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms suggests spatial search frictions as the driver of the unintended adverse labor market effects.",

When reviewing high-quality resumes or recruiting in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) industries, employers directly favor white men and display no spillover effect. For low-quality resumes or non-STEM industries, we find no direct bias but a strong spillover effect. Results suggest that discrimination arises in subtle ways.",

          "authors": "Youngjoo Cha, Lena Hipp, Soocheol Cho",
          "abstract": "Before the pandemic, remote workers were often perceived as less committed than their in-office counterparts. Have these perceptions persisted in the postpandemic era of global remote work expansion? Does working remotely affect how people are viewed as parents and not just as workers? How do these relationships differ across cultural contexts with different work and parenting norms? We address these questions using original, preregistered survey experiments in three countries with distinct work cultures and gender norms: Germany, South Korea, and the United States. In all three countries, remote workers are perceived as less committed to work but as better parents. These effects, however, differ across countries in gender-specific ways: when working remotely, South Korean fathers face larger penalties in perceived work commitment than fathers in Germany, and South Korean mothers receive larger parental rewards than mothers in both Germany and the United States. These findings suggest that workers face competing pressures from work and family, and that remote work can produce distinctively gendered outcomes—drawing mothers into remote work while pushing fathers away from it. However, this pattern only occurs in cultural contexts where work and parenting norms are strongly gendered, such as South Korea.",

Using data from in-depth interviews with 100 Koreans and 136 Korean immigrant adults, this study explores how sandwich generation Koreans and Korean immigrants in the United States perceive filial obligation for their aging parents, what they do to prepare for their own later life and what they expect from their children when they become older and need care from others. The findings indicate that almost all of the study participants maintain traditional notions of filial piety, but they show ambivalent attitudes toward the practice of filial obligation and their expectation from their own children in their later lives in Korea and the United States. Depending on the individual or familial factors, their filial practices have adapted to changing demographic and social realities, constructing the new forms of filial piety.",

          "authors": "Holly Lawford‐Smith",
          "abstract": "One of the most prominent minority groups today is trans people. Those who see themselves as fighting for trans rights have tended to take these to include a right to legal recognition by the state, and social treatment by fellow citizens, as the sex of identification. These rights claims have been given substantial legal and institutional uptake. If trans people's full inclusion in public life requires legal recognition and social treatment as the sex of identification, then this is merely a description of things being as they should be. But if trans people's inclusion within the liberal state does not require these things, then this may be a description of a violation of liberal neutrality, the enforcement by the state of a contested and controversial conception of the good; and a tyranny of the majority, the weight of social opinion being pressed against those who want to talk about (what they see as) the fact that things are not as they should be. One way to gain some clarity on whether things are as they should be or not is to carefully consider the principles that liberal democratic states have used to secure the full inclusion in public life of other minority groups, and their application to trans people. I'll consider in particular toleration , collective and individual exemptions , and full accommodation ; as they have applied to religious minorities, women, sexual orientation minorities, black people, and people with physical disabilities.",

          "abstract": "In Lockean social contract theory, the state exercises its authority over territory through property rights. The state has territorial authority over the property it and its citizens claim. This authority is legitimate when the state has the consent of the governed and effectively governs. In this paper, I argue that there is an irreconcilable tension between these concepts of authority and legitimacy. I argue that because Locke's view is property‐based, his view cannot justify more than a piecemeal territory. A piecemeal territory, however, makes the government's job of protecting life, liberty, and property nearly impossible. If we push to have a unified account of territory, the consent of the governed is undermined. Either the Lockean loses legitimacy by failing to protect life, liberty, and property, or they lose legitimacy by failing to have the consent of the governed. If I am correct, then the Lockean has to give up either legitimacy or territorial authority—neither of which is a workable option. This leaves us with having to either look elsewhere to justify territorial authority, give up the idea of territorial authority, or explore political alternatives to the state.",

Yet, the field currently still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which the conceptualizations and operationalizations of these constructs are (mis)aligned. To address this gap, we systematically reviewed and content-analyzed 623 empirical publications on news media trust and related concepts from 1951 to 2025. We found a great diversity in operationalizations and conceptualizations of trust-related concepts, which could be partly explained by various contextual and methodological factors, such as the timing, region, and method of the research. By synthesizing previous definitions, we identified three distinct approaches to define these concepts, aiming to integrate the various perspectives on this topic. Our findings suggest that future research should aim for a more coherent operationalization of news media trust variables to ensure consistency and comparability across studies.",

          "abstract": "Environmental challenges require collaboration across jurisdictions, often through forums or intermediary spaces for repeated interaction. A persistent forum design question concerns inclusion criteria, or which actors should be included. Ecology of Games, public choice, and collaborative governance detail various costs and benefits of expanding inclusion, but less attention has been paid to specific variations in inclusion criteria. To address this, we conduct a comparative case study of four water user associations in Arizona, U.S. that either restrict participation to a certain sector and/or to those holding specific water rights. We assess how inclusion criteria impact participants' perceptions of various dimensions of forum functionality, considering management concerns that may confound the relationship. Drawing on a survey and semi‐structured interviews of forum participants, we find that more restrictive forums benefit from an internal spillover of high coordination to other capacities that require increased buy‐in (e.g., lobbying) while more inclusive forums can create an external spillover of broader regional cooperation as participants interact with more diverse users. Management concerns, particularly the relative concern for groundwater versus surface water and financial resources, confound this relationship. Our findings provide new theoretical and practical insight into how inclusion rules affect forum functionality in complex governance systems.",

          "abstract": "Forums play an important role in addressing interdependent policy issues, and their effectiveness depends on the continuous adaptation of forum rules. Yet, it remains unclear whether rules are exclusively used and adapted to improve forum effectiveness. In this article, we therefore investigate the influence of individual goals of forum founders, forum interdependencies, and changes in higher‐level institutions on the use and adaptation of forum rules. To this end, we conduct a case study of a state‐initiated geographically transboundary forum in Dutch strategic spatial planning. Building on in‐depth interviews, document analysis, and nonparticipant observations, we find that forum rule adaptation is driven by a combination of finding effective policy solutions, the individual pursuit of the forum founder to create a new national spatial vision, the formation of the national government, provincial elections, the fall of the national government, and decision‐making in other forums. These findings suggest that forum rule use and adaptation results from an interplay between seeking forum effectiveness, the self‐interest of forum founders, and various polycentric governance linkages, rather than the desire to improve forum effectiveness alone.",

          "abstract": "Polling organizations, like other policy actors, must prioritize certain issues. We argue that, for normative and financial reasons, pollsters prioritize issues that are viewed as important by other institutions and the public, leading them to focus survey questions on issues that are on congressional and media agendas, and which are public priorities. We also argue that it is possible that polling issue agendas shape the issue attention of those actors. Which issues pollsters survey and whether they lead or follow other institutions has important implications for understanding agenda setting, representation, and the use of poll results in research. Thus, we examine which issues are more likely to be surveyed and whether polling agendas predict or respond to the issue agendas of the New York Times, the U.S. Congress, and public priorities. The analysis uses an automated approach to code over 600,000 survey questions fielded from 1980 to 2015 into Comparative Agendas Project topic codes. We find wide disparities in how much attention polling organizations devote to different types of issues. While relationships are generally small, we also find evidence that topics in polls respond to public issue priorities, while also preceding issue attention in Congress and the New York Times.",

          "abstract": "There is a well‐established triadic relationship between satisfaction with public services, trust in leaders, and policy support in developed democracies. This study takes a novel approach by considering how gender is associated with the strength and direction of these connections, an element underexplored in the literature. Gender can manifest in several ways: a characteristic of residents, a trait of policymakers, and a lens through which a policy is perceived as a male or female domain. We assess how these dimensions relate to direct and mediated pathways among satisfaction, trust, and support. Using a survey experiment among 500 residents of Haifa, Israel, we identify stronger satisfaction–trust associations among female respondents (citizen gender) and a stronger trust–support association when the policymaker is a woman (policymaker gender). Additionally, trust in a policymaker is often accompanied by higher policy support when the policymaker is a woman and a policy falls within a domain associated with women. These patterns are most pronounced when all three dimensions align as female–female residents, female policymakers, and policies perceived as feminine. No gendered patterns emerged for policies perceived as male domains. The findings demonstrate how gendered identities and stereotypes shape public opinion in advanced local democracies.",

          "abstract": "Projected energy shortages in the United States have intensified interest in nuclear power as a low‐carbon energy source, yet public acceptance remains a persistent challenge. This study employs a pre‐registered survey experiment to examine how local salience (geographic proximity) and risk information shape citizens' perceptions of newly proposed nuclear energy projects. Findings show that both factors independently reduce willingness to support, citizens' trust in government, and perceived benefit of the new nuclear power plant, with local salience exerting stronger effects than risk information in some cases. Notably, individuals who view climate change as a problem were more likely than those who do not to perceive a new nuclear power plant as beneficial, even when a proposed facility was located nearby. These findings contribute to the salience–complexity framework by demonstrating that issue salience is not fixed in a given policy setting but dynamically shaped by proximity cues and individual attitudes toward climate change. Rather than treating salience and complexity as static and independent dimensions, this study shows how perceived risk and cognitive heuristics interact to blur the traditional boundaries between them, especially in contested policy areas like nuclear energy.",

Paradoxically, others argue that members of the public lack meaningful policy preferences and exhibit low constraint across issues. These conclusions are typically drawn from binary policy questions or scales with ambiguous values, both of which are ill-suited for measuring extremism, polarization, or constraint. In this paper, I reassess these claims by analyzing policy questions that allow respondents to express their preferences on a well-defined continuum. Across a wide range of issues, most Americans appear to have moderate preferences over policy. As expected, Democrats tend to be more liberal than Republicans, but there is significant overlap on every issue, and the average extent of disagreement is modest. Lastly, positions across issues appear more constrained than standard tests suggest.",

However, whether those who participate actually see more of their preferred policies implemented remains an open question. We address this question by analyzing cross-national data connecting opinions to subsequent policy implementation on multiple policy issues. Based on an analysis of data on more than 270,000 survey respondents in 40 countries from 1996 to 2016, we show that voters are at most only slightly, but not substantially better represented than nonvoters. In contrast to the negligible effect sizes for voting, citizens who are active in multiple types of nonelectoral political activity are better represented than those who are inactive. We subsequently examine whether the observed relationships can be explained by socio-economic status, as well as attitudinal engagement such as political trust and political efficacy. Our findings show that the cross-national positive association between nonelectoral participation and opinion-policy congruence remains even when controlling for these factors. Our concluding discussion highlights directions for future research that pinpoint the causal mechanisms that link nonelectoral participation with subsequent opinion-policy congruence.",

          "abstract": "Since the introduction of the term “mixed-status families” by Fix and Zimmermann in 2001, a growing body of literature has examined how migration and citizenship politics affect people as family units rather than individuals. While most of this literature has focused on contexts in the Global North, and on the effect of nationality acquisition rules, this paper explores the emergence of mixed-status Venezuelan families in South America, as the result of the precarisation of protection frameworks in the region and, more broadly, of what Biehl has called “governance through uncertainty”. Using 60 life-history interviews with Venezuelan migrants in Chile and Colombia, alongside 16 semi-structured interviews with civil society representatives, it argues that, unlike the formal stratification systems explored thus far, this phenomenon occurs through a combination of gender-blind migration policies and piecemeal regulations that afford family members different rights depending on the documents they possess, the timing of their departure, and, sometimes, sheer luck. By comparing the contexts of Colombia and Chile, the paper also underscores that the impacts of mixed migration statuses need to be analysed at the interplay between economic and legal precarity, and will vary substantially according to each country's labour market conditions and broader institutional context.",

Building on a composite political instability (PI) index that captures both violent and non-violent forms of instability, we employ a simultaneous equations model with panel instrumental variable estimation techniques to address endogeneity and measurement challenges. Our findings reveal that FD generates dual effects on host states: initially, it strains resources and exacerbates PI, but when refugees can access economic opportunities, FD can foster long-term economic growth and strengthen social cohesion. The dynamic relationship between FD and PI highlights how conditions enabling refugee economic participation can mitigate security risks. These results emphasize the need for targeted, evidence-based policies that advance refugee economic inclusion as a pathway to enhancing political stability and sustaining long-term growth in host economies.",

          "abstract": "Building on an ethnographic approach, this article aims to explore how the social dimensions of hope shape and relate to the migration trajectories of people seeking asylum in Sweden. Departing from the concept of asylum hope, a fragile form of hope that persists under conditions of oppression and uncertainty, the study examines how everyday interactions shape and transform it. Using Randall Collins’ theory of interaction rituals, the analysis shows how emotional energy generated in encounters influences hope. Based on interviews and observations with 43 participants, the study further demonstrates that hope is not an individual psychological state of mind but a socially negotiated and embodied process formed in relation to migration authorities, bureaucratic routines, and informal networks. Asylum hope emerges as fluid and dynamic, influencing the trajectory of migration journeys while being continuously reshaped by administrative and emotional experiences. The article also highlights how administrative violence is enacted through mundane practices that intertwine bureaucratic power with everyday social life. These encounters reveal that migration governance is socially embedded, operating through rituals that can suppress or enable agency, recognition, and solidarity. By foregrounding the emotional and relational dimensions of bureaucratic processes, the study challenges the idea that state power functions solely through law and policy. Understanding asylum hope as socially and emotionally situated allows for a deeper grasp of how migrants navigate precarious futures within the entangled structures of governance, affect, and everyday life.",

Additionally, the paper utilizes a supervised machine learning approach, the Random Forest algorithm, to identify the most influential variables in predicting remittance behavior. The analysis finds that legal entry into a host country plays a significant role in remittance behavior, with an increase in remittance by 16 percentage points compared to those with no legal entry. However, the Random Forest analysis suggests that being a married woman is the most influential factor associated with a higher likelihood of remitting.",

Reflecting this assumption, systematic information on the evolution of asylum provisions in national constitutions remains limited, and comparative analyses of the motives behind the legal codification of refugee protection in autocracies are even scarcer. This research note addresses these gaps by introducing the Constitutional Asylum (COAS) dataset, which captures asylum provisions in the constitutions of all 193 UN member states from 1789 to 2023. The findings challenge conventional wisdom, revealing that autocracies, not democracies, have been the main adopters of constitutional asylum. While both regime types have used constitutional asylum to spread ideologies abroad, autocracies have done so more extensively and additionally leveraged it to strengthen presidential power. These results show that asylum is not merely a humanitarian norm but also a strategic instrument of statecraft, used to consolidate power within states and advance geopolitical agendas abroad.",

          "authors": "Frank van Tubergen",
          "abstract": "The integration paradox—the positive association between absolute education and perceived discrimination among more visible immigrant groups—has been a central puzzle in migration research. This study asks whether this pattern truly reflects absolute education, as prior work assumes, or whether it is in fact driven by a factor with which it strongly correlates: immigrants’ relative premigration education, defined as their position within the educational distribution of their country of origin. Using survey data on immigrants in France (TeO1 and TeO2) and across 14 European countries (EU MIDIS II), two key findings emerge. First, relative education is positively and significantly associated with perceived discrimination among more visible immigrant groups. Second, once relative education is taken into account, the association between absolute education and discrimination becomes statistically insignificant, suggesting that, where distinguishable, education is better understood as relative rather than absolute effect. Additional analyses provide evidence that status loss—measured as the gap between subjective social status in origin and destination countries—is linked to stronger perceptions of discrimination, lending cautious support to the proposed mechanism of relative education. More broadly, the findings invite a reconceptualization of education: not only as an absolute good that brings skills and awareness, but also as a positional good, where expectations and social comparisons shape perceptions of discrimination. While this study focuses on immigrants’ premigration education, the positional perspective may also help explain positive educational gradients in perceived discrimination among the second generation and among other groups, such as women.",

          "abstract": "The 2024 election of Donald Trump has been followed by executive decisions never before experienced in the history of American democracy. This new approach is grounded on a radical right (RR) program that had already been put in place in the Hungary of Viktor Orbán, who is presented as a model by Trump. Both leaders have defined a performative communication style, attracting a large segment of their respective citizenry. This style is based on the strategic use of common sense. However, we barely know how commonsensical executive RR leaders are during one of the most sacred events in a liberal democracy: the annual State of the Union or State of the Nation address. Based on a critical discourse analysis of the multiple speeches produced by Trump and Orbán in the frame of these events, the current research investigates the routinized and multifaceted usefulness of common sense to contest liberal democracy. The findings indicate that these leaders use the state address as a ritual of liberal democracy to impose a new RR order grounded in commonsensical policies, polities, and authorities.",

          "abstract": "Conscription has gained renewed relevance after the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Beyond its military purpose, conscription has historically been linked to citizenship and may significantly influence civic outcomes. Drawing on classic arguments about the civic effects of conscription, alongside recent studies suggesting a negative impact on institutional trust and increased authoritarian attitudes, we investigate whether conscription shapes a broad spectrum of outcomes, including national attachment, prosocial motivation, trust, political preferences, political interest, and authoritarian attitudes. To test this, we use the Danish conscription lottery in combination with survey data, assessing the causal effects of peacetime conscription on these key civic outcomes at the individual level. The results indicate only limited effects, suggesting that peacetime conscription does not impose a general civic penalty. These results contribute to the literature on conscription and are relevant for debates in many European countries about its potential reintroduction.",

          "authors": "Ryan P. Scott, Chris M. Messer, Adam Mayer, Tami C. Bond",
          "abstract": "Policy instruments are often presumed to shape a defined target population’s behaviour, yet the way those instruments are calibrated – their micro-characteristics and accountability rules – can alter who is governed. This article examines how calibration reshapes policy targets, using the case of Xcel Energy’s Quality Installation rebate programme for residential cooling in Denver, Colorado (2020–23). We show how rules that require certified contractors to follow specified installation practices transform a consumer rebate into an instrument that also targets contractor behaviour. Drawing on a mixed-methods design that combines qualitative analysis of regulatory documents with quantitative permit data, we find that programme partners install smaller, more efficient systems, at higher cost, and with fewer failed inspections than non-participants. These findings suggest that energy-efficiency rebates can influence contractor practice across all households, not only device choices by end users. We argue that overlooking calibration and the politics embedded in design obscures the behavioural and institutional pathways from policy action to outcome. By distinguishing between intermediate and end targets, we propose a conceptual refinement to policy design theory that is generalizable across policy domains where instrument calibration reshapes who policies act upon.",

We call these proposals Cover Bills . Through two survey experiments, we show that primary voters are more supportive of a compromiser if that legislator first votes for a cover bill. Through a causal mediation analysis, we show that cover bills are effective not because they prove that the compromise was the best deal the legislators could get, but because they demonstrate that the legislator shares the voter's ideological commitments. They reduce the punishment associated with compromising even if respondents find out about the cover bill from legislators who opposed the compromise.",

          "authors": "Martin Ejnar Hansen",
          "abstract": "This article examines the effect of electoral system reform on legislative speech‐making by Members of Parliament (MPs), focusing on the case of Denmark's 1918 shift from single‐member districts (SMD) to proportional representation (PR) in elections to the lower chamber. While the relationship between electoral systems and MP behavior is well established, few studies have been able to isolate causal effects using a natural control group. Leveraging the unique institutional configuration of Denmark's bicameral parliament—where the upper chamber remained unaffected by the reform—this study applies a difference‐in‐differences design to assess how reform shaped parliamentary behavior. Using a novel dataset covering all MPs between 1901 and 1939, the analysis compares both the absolute number of speeches delivered and the relative speech frequency of MPs across 1 electoral periods. The results demonstrate that MPs in the reformed lower chamber spoke significantly less following the introduction of PR, aligning their behavior more closely with that of MPs in the unreformed upper chamber. These findings hold across both outcome measures and after accounting for relevant controls, including seniority, party affiliation, and chamber‐specific institutional differences. The analysis provides strong support for the argument that PR enhances party control over individual legislators and reduces incentives for personal vote‐seeking via speech‐making. The article contributes to the broader literature on electoral systems and legislative behavior, and offers new historical insight into the institutional development of representative democracy in early twentieth‐century Europe.",

Relying on in-depth, repeated interviews with Ukrainian refugees in Germany, the article explores a state of in-betweenness that characterizes these individuals’ lives shortly after arrival, particularly by disrupting their sense of belonging and capacity to imagine the future. During short-term home visits to Ukraine, the visitors acquire a feel for life in war that is associated with complex feelings of alienation, disillusionment, and futurelessness. This experience helps individuals overcome subjective states of the in-between and move forward in life, irrespective of the persistent structural limbo related to temporary protection. Considering migrant home visits as transformative events advances recent debates about liminality and protracted displacement. It also has important implications for longer-term processes of social inclusion.",

          "abstract": "Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central organizing principle in European Union governance, yet systematic understanding of its conceptual evolution remains limited. This article provides the first macro‐level analysis of how digital sovereignty evolves across institutional and academic domains. Through analysis of 156 academic articles and 808 EU policy documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, we reveal sophisticated patterns in institutional conceptualization and evolution of digital sovereignty. Our findings demonstrate that its development reflects complex adaptive processes rather than linear policy progression. We identify a significant shift in institutional discourse from 2013 to 2016, where digital sovereignty transitions from a narrow technical concept to a comprehensive policy framework. This conceptual flexibility enhances rather than inhibits digital sovereignty development. The study advances understanding of how institutions construct and deploy new governance concepts in response to technological change while revealing previously obscured patterns in institutional interconnection.",

          "abstract": "Can the integration of generative AI into public administration ease administrative burdens in street‐level bureaucracy? This article examines this question through a 6‐month organizational ethnography conducted within a local authority in Shanghai. We find that while generative AI may alleviate certain traditional burdens, it can also paradoxically reinforce existing ones or create new forms. These dynamics, aligned with Moynihan, Herd and Harvey's (2015) conceptual framework, unfold across the interrelated dimensions of learning, compliance, and psychological costs. Critically, we identify a new type of burden—what we term interpretive costs—which emerges in frontline administrators' everyday policy implementation and can be significantly reduced by AI integration. Our findings further suggest that, whether AI reduces, intensifies, or generates new burdens, it inevitably leads to policy alienation, characterized by an amplified sense of dehumanization, loss of control, and diminished meaning in their work. Through the lived experiences of SLBs navigating AI‐assisted tasks, this article extends our understanding of administrative burdens in the age of generative AI.",

          "abstract": "Vote-by-mail (VBM) is an established electoral practice across the United States. Millions of voters cast VBM ballots every election, but roughly one percent of them are rejected by local election officials, according to data compiled by the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission. Although scholars have examined a variety of issues associated with mail voting, including postal delays and signature deficiencies, few studies have probed the subjective nature of validating VBM ballots, specifically matching a registered voter’s signature on record with a signature on a VBM return envelope. In an original survey of over 3,000 registered voters in Florida, we tasked respondents with evaluating a set of eight similar signatures in a modular grid, asking them if they thought there was a pair of matching signatures. We offer several explanations—demographics, life experience, partisan politics, and ideology—for why some individuals tasked with evaluating pairs of signatures might be less likely than others to report a pair among the set. Our findings suggest that signature validation, which serves as a primary safeguard for mail voting integrity, may be systematically influenced by underlying biases. Since the task of signature matching is largely in the eye of the beholder, the fervent support for and against mail voting is likely to endure, creating concerns for election integrity in elections to come.",

But despite the long-standing focus of the comparative and international political economy literature on fiscal policy, these studies largely ignore governments and their economic policies. This article brings policy back into the picture by reviewing the research agenda on the political effects of fiscal policy, and fiscal austerity in particular. This research finds that governments, especially those with a large electoral margin, can implement austerity and still survive in office. Support for austerity varies with the composition of the austerity package, the public discourse, and the narratives to which voters are exposed. Nonetheless, austerity has important political effects even if governments do not collapse: They increase votes for nonmainstream, often populist, parties among economically vulnerable voters because austerity magnifies rather than alleviates the social risks of these voters.",

This oversight has foreclosed investigation into the empirical relationship between digital technologies, civic engagement, and political control in the United States. For example, how are digital technologies used as a resource for the individual and collective power of marginalized people? How are digital technologies deployed to suppress or disorganize the individual and collective power of marginalized people? To integrate existing work and generate new lines of inquiry, we offer an analytical framework that centers the experiences of marginalized groups, interrogates the United States as a racial authoritarian democratic regime, and examines how institutions and actors leverage digital technologies in a complex political landscape. We argue that digital technologies can have both enhancing and destructive effects on the civic engagement and collective power of marginalized groups in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Why is compromising information about misconduct in political parties leaked to the media by party insiders? Drawing on previous research and interviews with political and investigative journalists, we hypothesize that such media disclosures are made with political intent and thus more likely when (1) party list nominations take place and (2) when parties are losing popular support. Through an analysis of 349 newspaper articles of misconduct in political parties leaked by party insiders to Swedish print media between 2010 and 2024, we find support for both expectations. We therefore conclude that intra-party leaks are indeed likely to be made with political intent, at least indirectly. This paper contributes novel theoretical and empirical insights to research on political parties, political scandals, and leaks and whistleblowing by illustrating the role media disclosures made by party insiders play in internal party power struggles.",

          "abstract": "Elections are not only verdicts on incumbents but also contests over the issues that parties emphasize. This paper asks whether parties’ issue-specific campaign strategies influence their electoral success, and how parties decide on those strategies. We leverage a new dataset on parties’ electoral campaign efforts in 15 European countries to examine three dimensions of campaign strategy: the salience of issues, the position they take on those issues, and the extremity or moderation of those positions. As for the parties’ strategic choices, the results confirm that European parties organize their issue-specific campaigns largely in line with their ideological positions and their status as challengers or mainstream parties. In response to the electoral effect of their campaign strategies, the results confirm the received wisdom that the parties’ issue-specific campaigns have only a limited effect on the electoral outcome. However, this general result has to be nuanced by party family: challengers and mainstream party families have benefited to varying degrees from their respective strategies. The effects of campaigns on electoral success are the largest for the radical right, which has benefited from putting the emphasis on cultural issues and taking clear-cut or even extreme positions on economic issues. Our findings shed new light on party responsiveness and the limits of political persuasion, showing when campaign appeals can sway voters and when structural factors trump campaign effects.",

          "abstract": "Defined by values of nativism, authoritarianism and populism, radical right parties (RRPs) have also been associated with traditional attitudes on women’s roles in the family and workplace. As such, gender traditional nativists are often purported to be their core supporters. But does this RRP voter profile hold over time across Western Europe? We examine this question using extensive individual-level data from three waves of the European Values Survey complemented by 15 waves of Dutch LISS panel data. While confirming the continuing role of nativism in RRP support, we find that traditionalist attitudes about gender roles do not describe the only type of RRP voter. Since 2009, there is also an important set of gender-egalitarian nativists who are attracted to these parties. Further analysis of the panel data suggests that this phenomenon reflects expansion to new RRP voters rather than the conversion of established radical right supporters to more gender-egalitarian views.",

This paper examines the extent and evolution of programmatic differentiation across four CEE countries, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Romania, between the 1990s and 2023. Relying on quantitative content analysis of newspaper coverage during parliamentary election campaigns, it investigates system-level trends in programmatic competition, issue salience, and politicization, as well as party-level patterns of issue salience and entrepreneurship. The results show that programmatic competition is substantial and relatively stable over time, but varies across countries depending on historical legacies and regime trajectories. Cultural conflicts have gained importance, particularly under democratic backsliding. While established parties exhibit routinized and distinct programmatic profiles, new parties expand the issue agenda by politicizing less emphasized conflicts. The findings underscore the continued relevance of cleavage theory for understanding party competition in post-communist Europe.",

          "abstract": "The framework of liberal peace – once the hallmark of a Western-led international order – is now in deep crisis. Its decline coincides with the rise of non-Western actors proposing alternative models of conflict management and resolution. This article challenges the assumption that Western states always pursue conflict resolution objectives, while non-Western states focus on conflict management tasks through illiberal approaches. Drawing on role theory, we reinterpret how states conceptualise and perform their responsibilities in the conflict management and resolution arena. We treat the Western/non-Western and liberal/illiberal divides as role conceptions, while the rhetoric preferences towards conflict management/conflict resolution are understood as role enactments. Using Latent Semantic Scaling, we analyse over 14,000 United Nations Security Council speeches (1992–2023). While the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia conform to their expected roles, China and France deviate from them. Our results suggest that conflict management and resolution strategies align more closely with conflict-specific and temporal factors than a rigid P3–P2 divide.",

We use agenda-setting and policy framing analytical insights to explain how and why UK government’s successful agenda-setting was underpinned by the racialised and gendered criminalisation of Albanian males and the politicisation of the safety conditions in Albania. Our findings draw on qualitative empirical data, alongside triangulation with official and stakeholder data and documents. We argue that the racialised and gendered criminalisation of Albanian males – as evidenced by political rhetoric and the media – was integral to the targeted legal and political measures making Albania a ‘safe’ country. Nonetheless, we show that these framings misrepresent the reality in Albania and the challenges that vulnerable Albanians face when seeking protection in the United Kingdom.",

          "authors": "Frank L K Ohemeng, Joseph Antwi-Boasiako",
          "abstract": "Policy termination is assumed to be a rational or ideological exercise in which a policy is done away with, as demonstrated in most developed countries. Unfortunately, this does not seem to stand up to further scrutiny in developing countries, as some scholars wonder whether developing countries make policies or are just bandwagoners in the first place. Be that as it may, policy termination still takes place in these countries. How, then, can one explain policy termination in these countries? Using the termination of Ghana’s Gold4oil policy as the case, one can argue that policy termination does not necessarily follow the rational model or the ideological perspective, but rather, it is a case of “whoever pays the piper calls the tune.” In other words, policy termination in developing countries is pushed by international actors, mainly financial and aid institutions, which have become their developmental financiers. These international actors can cause the termination of certain policies for several reasons, when they deem these policies unfavorable to their interests, or when they believe this policy is fraught with some negative issues, such as transparency and risk of illicit financial flows, among others. The study is qualitative. Data were collected using the specialized interview technique and snowballing approach. The study found the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was influential in the termination of the policy due to factors including the lack of transparency and perceived corruption, the lack of policy consultation, and geopolitical factors.",

          "abstract": "While existing studies acknowledge the political impact of policy termination, research on the dynamic political landscape and the bureaucracy’s strategic action in driving such termination remains limited, particularly in morality policies, where diverse values clash across political perspectives. To address this gap, this study examines South Korea’s Shutdown Act, a regulation on teenage gaming that epitomizes the tension between values relating to adolescent autonomy and youth protection. This research analyzes government press release texts from 2008 to 2022, covering the period from the policy’s adoption to its termination. This article investigates how the government manages policy salience during different stages of the termination process. Findings reveal that policy salience diminishes as policies stabilize over time and intensifies during the termination phase, when it becomes higher compared to earlier stages, including when the policy was first adopted. Ultimately, this study contributes to the policy termination literature by demonstrating that it is a distinct phase of the policy process with defined characteristics. In our case, the observed shifts in policy salience throughout the Shutdown Act’s cycle highlight the political nature of termination, especially in the case of a morality policy.",

          "abstract": "The concept of gender transformative change brings yet another policy objective and aspiration into the field of public policy—one that reflects a growing desire for more ambitious public policy. This aspiration, while proliferating in social policy and the specific sub-field of social protection in recent years, has been embraced with little consensus and critical reflection on the intended object and processes of change. Various conceptualizations exist, shaped by different disciplines and institutional perspectives. This article begs a moment of pause to critically examine the use of the term “gender-transformative” in the social protection literature, including its emergence, ontological roots, and evolution within the scholarship. Through a comprehensive snowball literature review, we show that gender-transformative social protection often remains vaguely defined, is cast as addressing gender inequality and social structures at the micro level, and lacks clarity on what it concretely takes to achieve gender-transformative change. To gain conceptual clarity and move beyond rhetorical commitments, we suggest engaging more deeply with established and robust feminist scholarship in Gender and Development, including debates on reproductive and productive labor, gender norms, and power and agency.",

          "abstract": "Termination of public policy is a notoriously challenging research topic. Our study focuses on how policy feedback dynamics can potentially result in termination. The concept of policy feedback has mainly been applied to explain policy continuity. Recent scholarly advancements have directed attention to negative and self-undermining feedback, offering nuanced insights into feedback dynamics and their impact on policy evolution. This perspective has potential to enrich our understanding of policy termination processes. Utilizing the concepts of mixed and self-undermining feedback, this analysis demonstrates how a specific policy instrument may be discontinued due to accumulation of negative feedback that may eventually become self-undermining when a viable alternative instrument emerges on the policy menu. The case of Danish nitrogen pollution regulation illustrates this phenomenon in which the primary instrument—a nitrogen application cap—was terminated as the major regulatory instrument due to negative feedback becoming self-undermining.",

It analyses investment data to map the political economy of VC in the videogame industry and public-facing industry discourse to explore how VCs frame their investments. Findings show that VC investment is concentrated in scalable, high-growth areas such as mobile gaming, production and distribution infrastructure and emerging technologies like blockchain and AI. Investment is largely early-stage and geographically skewed towards established technology and production hubs. Discursively, VCs position themselves as driving technological innovation and cultural growth, and as playing a key role in shaping the industry’s future.

However, little is known about the strategies employed by the far right to drive this trend, particularly outside Western countries and major platforms. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a systematic content analysis of far-right content on VK (VKontakte), the most widely used Russian social network, to examine the content’s characteristics that facilitate the mainstreaming of the far right.

          "abstract": "We examine how people collectively and creatively appropriate information communication technology (ICT) in Havana, Cuba, to navigate persistent scarcity and pursue a more stable life. Drawing on interviews and ethnographic data, we center resolver —an emic term for both an informal acquisition process and a problem-solving mindset—as a dynamic, collective strategy. This practice underpins aspirations for a “decent” life, locally understood as adequacy, stability, and solidarity. Our findings show ICT appropriation is deeply intertwined with evolving moral judgments and solidarity, requiring continual negotiation of legality, necessity, and communal values. Rather than uniformly empowering, ICT use mediates inclusion and exclusion, highlighting new forms of inequality. By theorizing resolver as a recursive and context-dependent process, we provide an analytical lens for examining how digital technologies shape aspirations, collective life, and the boundaries of decency in resource-constrained environments.",

It estimates event-time deviations around five milestones: Kyoto Protocol, Copenhagen Accord, Paris Agreement, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Launch of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan. Policy issuance accelerates after 2015, with sizeable, although not uniformly statistically significant, increases in counts. Shifts in ambition are modest and heterogeneous, with isolated pre-event signals. First-order instruments dominate, and voluntary tools remain prevalent. Ambition concentrates in advanced and high-emission economies and among central banks and supervisors, while earlier milestones correspond to incremental adjustments. Overall, the evidence indicates institutional layering and technical convergence rather than rapid paradigm change. The study provides a replicable baseline linking international initiatives to both the volume and ambition of climate-financial policies and identifies conditions under which deeper reforms emerge.",

          "authors": "Yunzheng Zhang",
          "abstract": "Home is the locale where individuals seek ontological security against external threats and unpredictability – a condition difficult to sustain under uncertain mobility patterns such as circular migration. Current scholarship predominantly focuses on how migrants' ontological security is shaped by their dwellings in destinations, while the connection with housing in their places of origin remains underexamined. Through interviews with 24 employer‐housed migrants – a highly mobile segment particularly prone to circular migration in China ‐ this study investigates the potential linkage between hometown housing and ontological security within China's internal circular migration. These connections are unpacked through three narratives: The first examines how migrants perceive ontological security through hometown housing security and its associated guarantee of life quality. The second reveals that, among migrants of rural origin, urban housing tenure without land ownership is often viewed as incredible, whereas rural land‐use rights function as a stabilizing anchor. The third uncovers the experience of a divorced, less‐skilled rural‐to‐urban migrant woman whose ontological security is compromised by dual housing insecurity in both the host city and her hometown stemming from her intersectional identities. Across these narratives, the study interprets how ontological security is sustained through four dimensions of “home”: constancy, routine, no surveillance, and identity. The findings suggest that, within the interplay of China's institutional structures and socioeconomic contexts, hometown housing can contribute meaningfully to the ontological security amid circular migration. By doing so, the study challenges the prevailing scholarly emphasis on destination‐based housing within linear migration paradigms and extends the predominantly Western‐centric discourse on ontological security into contexts of China's circular human mobility and spatially fragmented imaginaries of “home”.",

          "abstract": "Racial inequalities, although at times covert and subtle, are among the most persistent discriminatory factors shaping the social domain of housing. Ireland's housing crisis has contributed to the reproduction of such inequalities affecting racialised communities. This paper draws on extensive qualitative research with Irish local authority staff ( n =69) and with members of Ireland's Muslim communities ( n = 193) to explore their perspectives and lived experiences in the context of accessing accommodation. Using blurred boundaries (Alba, 2005) and racialised space (Hopkins 2016; Itaoui 2016; Najib 2021) as our conceptual frameworks, we investigate experiences and perspectives of discrimination in/accessing social housing among Muslim communities and local authority staff. We argue that, on the one hand local authorities follow strategies that, although well intended, in a context where a race‐evasive approach is institutionally pervasive, contribute to housing practices which create segregated communities. On the other hand, Muslim communities faced with such strategies and practices, whether intended or not, experience hostility/discrimination in/accessing social housing.",

          "authors": "Yun Yue, Yin Ma",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how emotions and temporal structures interact to shape the timing of return among highly skilled Chinese professionals. Drawing on the Affective Poly‐Temporal Alignment (APA) framework, it conceptualises return migration not as a linear response to opportunity but as a rhythmic synchronisation between affective intensity and temporal urgency. The analysis is based on twenty‐five life‐history interviews and accompanying emotion‐timeline artefacts collected across the Australia‐China corridor. Using an interpretive‐comparative design, the study integrates narrative interpretation with configurational reasoning to identify how different patterns of emotion and time interact to produce distinct decision rhythms. Three recurrent alignment pathways: synchronous surge, gradual accumulation, and extended deliberation illustrate how migrants' readiness to return crystallises when emotional salience converges with institutional and familial clocks. The findings reveal that the “right time” to return is not externally fixed but affectively produced through moral obligations, biographical milestones, and shifting senses of temporal urgency. Conceptually, the APA framework advances a cross‐scalar understanding of temporal governance, showing how affective attunement to multiple temporalities: legal, institutional, and familial organises mobility even beyond state regulation. In doing so, the study contributes to a more rhythm‐sensitive and relational sociology of migration.",

At the same time, the analysis problematizes the costs of cooperation, particularly for overseas workers' protection and well‐being. It highlights how the cooperative orientation marks a significant departure from the largely unquestioned assumption for state interference on behalf of citizens beyond national borders. To develop the arguments, the paper employs a mixed‐methods approach, combining computational scraping of media outputs, qualitative field interviews and interpretative contrapuntal reading.",

          "authors": "Wanyang Hu, Zhenxiang (Zeke) Chen",
          "abstract": "Migrants often form expectations about destinations before migration, regarding factors such as employment and local amenities; yet, due to imperfect information, many of these pre‐migration expectations cannot be fully fulfilled after arrival. Both the Neoclassical Economics (NE) and the New Economics of Labour Migration (NELM) theories posit that expectation fulfilment influences return migration, albeit in opposite directions. However, few studies have empirically tested this relationship. This study addresses this gap by examining how expectation fulfilment influences migrants' return intentions using survey data from approximately 7800 internal migrants across 15 Chinese prefectural cities. By disaggregating expectations into 12 distinct types, we demonstrate that the influence of expectation fulfilment on migrants' return intentions varies substantially. Our findings generally support NE: fulfilling expectations—particularly regarding wages, medical services, and amenities—significantly reduces migrants' return intentions. Heterogeneity analyses further reveal that the impact of expectation fulfilment varies by migrants' family ties, skill level, and age. Specifically, the fulfilment of wage and career expectations is particularly crucial for younger and high‐skilled migrants. However, consistent with NELM theory, for middle‐aged migrants and migrants with family ties in their hometown, fulfilling expectations—especially regarding career prospects—increases the likelihood of return. This study is among the first to empirically test the role of expectation fulfilment in shaping migrants' return intentions, providing a nuanced understanding of the drivers of return migration. Our findings suggest that host cities can encourage migrants' settlement by addressing their key expectations, especially regarding wages, career opportunities, and quality of life.",

          "authors": "Ulrika Åkerlund, Fredrik Hoppstadius",
          "abstract": "Despite a long history of urbanisation in Sweden, recent migration research notes a renewed interest in counterurbanisation as well as a higher propensity for families to become counterurban movers. While many of the motives described in counterurbanisation research tend to align with push/pull arguments, the migration decision process is likely to be more complex as it relies on individuals' spatial perceptions and evaluations combined with individual opportunities and constraints for mobility. In migration, everyday practices become disrupted, as the spatial anchoring of certain amenities means that they cannot easily be brought to the new location. This paper focuses on the migration experiences of young counterurbanising families, analysing qualitatively how different amenities are valued and how the trade‐off is experienced and negotiated between members of the family unit. Presenting everyday family life from the perspective of assemblages, we seek to grasp at the complexity of the material, social and emotive context of individual and family lifeworlds. Assemblage thinking allows for considering how different elements in everyday life are valued; which are indispensable and which are possible to replace. The logic of assemblages thus opens up for thinking about how everyday life can be disassembled and reassembled through migration, and how family members negotiate this (de/re)construction of everyday life.",

          "abstract": "Vulnerable ethnic groups have been affected disproportionately by the COVID‐19 pandemic, and related fertility effects have been heterogeneous among different social groups. Although Türkiye hosts the largest Roma population, neither their fertility nor the pandemic's effects on it have been addressed. The novel contribution of this study is to analyse the fertility response to the COVID‐19 pandemic among the Roma in Türkiye and how it differed by socioeconomic status, further comparing the group with their counterparts in Europe. We frame our approach based on preceding theoretical and empirical literature on minority‐majority fertility differentials, and on studies of COVID‐19 and its heterogeneous fertility outcomes. Data is taken from “The Demographic Integration and Differentials of Roma Population and Policy Priorities in Türkiye” research. In addition to descriptive analyses, an event history approach is used wherein discrete‐time logit models are estimated using logistic regression, with a dependent variable of conception leading to a live birth. Our multivariate analyses show that for the Roma in Türkiye, COVID‐19 is associated with a statistically significant declined odds of conception in the second and following years of the pandemic compared to pre‐pandemic years, particularly for the first order of conception. The odds of third and higher‐orders of conceptions also decline in the post‐acute pandemic years. Interaction analyses indicate that Roma women of different wealth status and educational levels responded differently to the COVID‐19 pandemic in terms of both periodicity and sign of the relationship.",

Rather than portraying home as a romanticized place that has been left, we employ a mobile concept that bridges the question of where and what home is to how migrants practice home in new urban environments. This helps to connect the material, relational, and emotional meanings of home, showing how new immigrants assert agency through homemaking practices amidst three specific types of precarity: housing, work and legal. We suggest that the neighborhood emerges as a crucial site, where migrants cultivate familiarity, build social ties, and assert agency through daily routines. Based on 31 interviews and 5 months of participant observation, our study also addresses a critical gap in home in migration literature by focusing on undocumented Chinese immigrants, a group often obscured by the model minority narrative.",

Drawing on in‐depth interviews with Polish and Lithuanian returnees, this study examines different types of nostalgia for the country of migration and the strategies used to manage it. We show that nostalgia for the country of migration can serve as a creative strategy, helping returnees engage with the changes in their lives brought about by their return. The findings suggest that successfully managing nostalgia for the previous country of residence can foster a sense of home among returnees and, in turn, help prevent repeat emigration.",

          "authors": "Eduardo Tapia",
          "abstract": "Ethnic residential segregation remains a central challenge for urban integration in an era of rising international and internal migration. While prior research has focused primarily on selective mobility mechanisms—such as white flight and native avoidance—the role of in‐movers' settlement patterns in shaping segregation trajectories is less well understood. This study examines how the arrival of in‐movers influences residential segregation in Stockholm by analysing their direct settlement choices, the indirect effects of their arrival on current residents' mobility decisions, and the cumulative long‐term consequences of these processes. Using rich Swedish population registers linked to an empirically calibrated simulation model, we show that immigrant and native in‐movers contribute to segregation through distinct pathways. Immigrant in‐movers disproportionately settle in neighbourhoods with higher shares of immigrants, and their arrival increases the likelihood that existing immigrant residents relocate to these same areas, reinforcing clustering over time. Native in‐movers, by contrast, exhibit a dual effect: although they preferentially settle in native‐majority neighbourhoods, their arrival also attracts some immigrant residents, partially counterbalancing segregation pressures. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that segregation dynamics are shaped not only by internal mobility but also by the arrival of in‐movers and the behavioural responses of current residents to them, underscoring the central role of migration‐driven mechanisms in contemporary urban segregation.",

          "abstract": "Studies of highly‐skilled migrants have often focused on their status as privileged and hypermobile individuals widely lauded for their economic contributions. Equally deserving of attention however are the other facets of migration encompassing the imaginative, affective and emotional dimensions, its social, cultural, political and power linkages as well as obligations and frictions. Drawing on the ‘linked lives’ approach to researching migration over the life‐course, we pay close attention to the interdependent (a)synchronous relationships between events, persons and their relations across three life‐stages of 15 Australian transnational migrants in Singapore. Conducted from late 2019 to early 2020 with informal follow‐up via social media and other means post‐COVID, the study shows how highly‐skilled migration and family life are mutually constitutive. As participants negotiate migration decisions—to stay, leave, return, move again, or embark on transnational circulation—in juggling parallel careers, opportunities, family obligations and migration aspirations, (a)synchronicities and interconnections often come into play most prominently at critical junctures in the life‐course. These junctures emphasized the bidirectional effects of linked lives and manifest both conscious and/or (in)voluntary efforts to (un)link lives in pursuit of specific outcomes.",

          "authors": "Zbyněk Mucha, Robert Stojanov",
          "abstract": "This article investigates recent patterns of Bangladeshi migration to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), focusing on the Czech Republic and Poland as emerging destinations and transit spaces within broader European mobility systems. Drawing on long‐term ethnographic research and 74 semi‐structured and in‐depth interviews conducted in Bangladesh, the Czech Republic, and Poland between 2018 and 2024, the study examines how aspirations, capabilities, and perceptions shape migration trajectories among young, educated Bangladeshis. The findings reveal that contemporary migration is increasingly driven by a middle‐class culture of emigration, linked to aspirations for social mobility, security, and freedom. CEE countries are perceived as attainable and affordable entry points to Europe, often serving as temporary stops on the way to Western Europe. Three distinct modes of transit are identified: long‐term strategies combining study and employment; interrupted trajectories resulting from debt, unmet expectations, or precarious work; and broker‐mediated transits facilitated by recruitment agencies and informal networks. The analysis highlights the central role of intermediaries and digital platforms in shaping migrants' imaginaries and practices, leading to fluid transitions between categories such as student, labour migrant, and asylum seeker. The article argues that CEE countries function simultaneously as destinations and corridors, and that migrants' trajectories are deeply influenced by their moral obligations, indebtedness, and access to capital for mobility. Transit migration should therefore be understood as a dynamic and relational process, reflecting the fragmented and evolving nature of contemporary mobility from Bangladesh to Europe.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how rural‐to‐urban migrants in China select dual frames of reference and how these choices shape their subjective well‐being. It challenges conventional approaches that treat reference group comparisons as single and unordered, with a focus on either host or home comparisons. Drawing on original 2024 survey data from 15 cities, the study explores how integration into the host society and translocal ties to origin communities influence dual frames of reference. The findings show that economically integrated migrants tend to prioritize host‐based comparisons, but many retain a secondary frame that is tied to rural/home communities or migrant peers. Meanwhile, strong translocal ties reinforce rural/home comparisons, suggesting that some migrants do not fully shift to host‐based perspectives. Reference group frames influence subjective well‐being differently under benchmark‐exceedance (i.e., migrants economically outperform host residents) and benchmark‐deficit (i.e., migrants economically underperform host residents) contexts. Our sample reflects the former. In this context, frames that prioritize urban residents yield the highest subjective well‐being, while home residents yield the lowest, consistent with aspiration realization rather than relative deprivation. These findings contribute to reference group theory in migration research by showing how migrants navigate multiple comparisons and balance aspirations, competition, and identity throughout the integration process.",

          "authors": "Jessica Nisén, Johan Dahlberg, Jitka Slabá, Alessandra Trimarchi",
          "abstract": "An increasing number of studies have examined fertility variation at the regional level within countries, but this research has largely focused on women. As a result, our knowledge of regional variation in male fertility remains limited. The current study addresses this research gap by examining how the timing and chances of parenthood vary regionally for women and men in four countries in Northern and Western Europe. We hypothesize that gender differences in first‐time parenthood may be less pronounced in urban centers, such as the capital regions, and especially among groups with higher levels of education. The study is based on data collected from female and male cohorts born between 1963 and 1970 in Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The results largely support our hypotheses, indicating that differences in the age at first birth and in the share of parents between capital and other regions are less pronounced among men than among women in all countries except the Netherlands. Consequently, there are smaller gender differences in first‐time parenthood in capital regions across three of the four countries. Furthermore, highly educated women and men living in capital regions are most similar in terms of their age at first birth and the share of parents.",

          "title": "Unlocking Urban Talent Dividends: Can Digital Economy Development Accelerate Growth Through Scale, Efficiency and Allocation?",
          "authors": "Cong Zhang, Wan Li, Chunlai Yuan",
          "abstract": "Currently, the gradual fading of China's traditional demographic dividend has inhibited rapid economic growth. The talent dividend, serving as the localized practice of the ‘second demographic dividend’, is regarded by the Chinese government as the key to promoting high‐quality economic development. The development of the digital economy introduces digital technologies and knowledge, breaking down barriers to the flow of labour information and providing an opportunity to unleash the talent dividend. This study first measures the talent dividend from three aspects: talent scale, talent efficiency and talent allocation. It then analyzes the impact of digital economy development on the talent dividend using a two‐way fixed effects model, in conjunction with the digital economy development index at the prefecture‐level city scale. The results show that digital economy development significantly promotes the formation of the urban talent scale dividend, the talent efficiency dividend, and the talent allocation dividend. Moderating effect analysis reveals that with the improvement of fiscal autonomy and marketization levels, the role of digital economy development in releasing the talent dividend is enhanced. This implies that the incentive effect of digital economy development on the talent dividend requires institutional guarantees of a ‘capable government and efficient market’. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the promoting effect of digital economy development on the talent dividend is more significant in cities with higher economic development levels, better medical security and higher education levels. Notably, ordinary prefecture‐level cities exhibit a more significant effect in the formation of talent scale and efficiency dividends, while southern cities demonstrate a superior advantage in releasing talent efficiency and allocation dividends compared to northern cities. This study not only confirms the empowering role of the digital economy on the talent dividend but also offers valuable ‘Chinese experience’ for countries at different development stages to unleash their talent dividends through digital economic development.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how Ghanaian returnees in Accra's creative industries cultivate belonging through the creation of cultural venues. While return‐migration scholarship has largely emphasised returnees' psychic ‘in‐betweenness’ and cultivation of symbolic ‘third spaces’, this study explores the material and spatial practices through which belonging is anchored. Drawing on 6 months of qualitative fieldwork, it analyses three returnee‐owned venues—a concept store, a performance space and a subscription library—to show how place‐making shapes belonging through the spatial settings, material configurations and meanings attached to these venues. The findings reveal a clear paradox: while these venues offer returnees refuge, community and cultural agency, they simultaneously reproduce socio‐spatial boundaries, ultimately constraining their own pursuit of belonging. Place‐making emerges as an ambivalent practice that both grounds returnees and reinforces wider urban inequalities. The study advances return migration scholarship by foregrounding the spatial politics through which belonging is constructed in a postcolonial urban context.",

          "abstract": "Residential and school mobility are central features of childhood that can shape later educational outcomes. This study examines how these two forms of mobility—spatial and institutional—affect the likelihood of completing high school on time in Canada. Using a linked dataset from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) and administrative education records, we assess how the timing, frequency, and type of move influence educational attainment. We distinguish between residential moves, school moves, and combined moves to evaluate whether each disrupts social and institutional continuity in distinct ways. Logistic regression models show that moving homes or changing schools during adolescence significantly reduces the probability of on‐time high school completion, with the strongest negative effect observed when both occur concurrently. In contrast, early childhood moves show little association with attainment once socioeconomic and family characteristics are accounted for. These findings advance understanding of the spatial and institutional dimensions of childhood mobility and their implications for educational inequality in Canada.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary global apartheid is built upon temporal discord, with refugee camps playing a central role. Yet camp studies have largely neglected the temporal dimensions of displacement, leading to reductive notions of time in the camp as a paradox of permanent temporariness. This article examines two types of 21st century campscapes based on ethnographic research in archetypal humanitarian‐run camps in Jordan and privatized city shelter camps in the US to illustrate the temporal work that camps do in caring for and controlling people on the move. Mapping camp timescapes through Foucault's heterochronies, it argues that camp time is not merely a protraction of temporariness but a collection of futureless temporalities not meant to converge with national time outside the heterotopia. This article contributes to critical camp studies an analytical framework of camp time that exposes an intentional wasting of camp residents' time in a global project of temporal Othering.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the cost‐of‐living motivations of European migrants relocating to Morocco. It attends to the culturally specific way these motivations are narrated, drawing on 36 semi‐structured qualitative interviews conducted in three receiving communities in Morocco. Geographic arbitrage alludes to the uses of inequalities in the cost of living between nation‐states, inequalities that index colonial social relations. The uses of these inequalities are increasingly the topic of discussion and attempts at legitimation. The article notes that, contrary to the libertarian contexts in which the idea of geographic arbitrage emerged in the 2000s, European lifestyle migrants are demure about the economic benefits of relocating to a former French colony, and prefer to speak of other motivations, notably a love of the country or culture, or a desire to make a significant life change. In a changing global political economy, these under‐theorized economic migrations shed new light on migrant categorization and the coloniality of transnational migration regimes.",

          "abstract": "To what extent do states act differently through international organizations based in their own country relative to those located abroad? Building on scholarship on headquarters as ecosystems, city diplomacy, and informal power, I argue that states are more lenient vis-à-vis international organizations with headquarters in their own country. States are likely to opt for loose, rather than stringent, delegation of authority in everyday decision-making—holding the promise of increased informal influence and greater mutual trust and embeddedness over time. In the context of earmarked funding by Western donors—my empirical case—I hypothesize that donors are likely to provide less stringent funding to international organizations with headquarters in their own countries. Examining voluntary contributions from 32 donors to 255 international organizations between 1990 and 2020, I find support for my argument: international organizations receive less stringent earmarked funding from the donor-country in which the organization is headquartered. In additional analyses, I show that these effects are driven by thematic earmarking, and that the magnitude of the effects increases over time. I also discuss the two extreme cases of the United States and Switzerland to illustrate potential mechanisms. Taken together, my findings have important implications for our understanding of the micro-foundations of state action, the geography of international organizations, and earmarked funding.",

Prior research has examined the role of compliance programs in curbing unethical behavior and enhancing corporate governance, but it has often overlooked their defensive function and proactive role in legal risk management. This paper develops the concept of defensive compliance and investigates whether compliance programs reduce corporate criminal liability and punishment through prosecutorial and sentencing decisions and outcomes. Analyses of US Sentencing Commission organizational offender data provide some evidence of defensive compliance: fewer conviction counts, reduced fines (only during the Biden administration), and shorter probation terms. However, its effects are muted or even reversed in other outcomes or contexts. The results also show little support for the propositions that public company status and managerial involvement moderate defensive compliance. These findings suggest that the efficacy of defensive compliance evolves over time and is highly context‐dependent. Future research should further develop the defensive compliance framework and examine its operation across varied institutional settings.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory governance and state‐corporate crime studies link persistent industrial pollution to long‐term regulatory–industry interactions, yet little is known about how these interactions evolve and become entrenched. This article examines two enduring cases of industrial pollution in the Netherlands—Hoogovens/Tata Steel and DuPont de Nemours/Chemours—to explore how regulatory–industry interactions shape the emergence, normalization, and persistence of pollution. Based on historical archives of government and company documents and media publications, four time periods since the 1960s are studied. Using path dependency as an analytical lens, this article identifies five interdependent, recurring patterns that enabled and sustained harmful corporate conduct: knowledge‐asymmetry, regulatory co‐design, economic dependency, regulatory fragmentation, and juridification. The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how regulatory‐industry interactions can inadvertently facilitate enduring environmental harm, offering insight into structural dynamics that normalize pollution and complicate accountability and reform over time.",

          "abstract": "Endeavoring to avoid the pitfalls of being too trusting of regulated entities' compliance claims, regulators sometimes create regulatory systems with elaborate requirements for verification. But as these accountability and verification regimes attempt to circumvent one set of problems, they may inadvertently create others. Building on organizational research on “routine dynamics,” this article shows how the institutionalized skepticism of these regulatory regimes may unintentionally reinscribe patterns of privilege and disadvantage as regulators enforce rules and guidelines that inevitably have biases built into them. It also shows how the official, scripted universalism of regulatory stances can be undermined by unscripted, sometimes disrespectful, interactional stances of monitors and inspectors. Data from a study of five HIV clinics providing treatment and conducting research in the U.S., Thailand, South Africa, and Uganda show why regulatory encounters that are intended to be even‐handedly but respectfully distrusting can systematically disadvantage even excellent clinics in poorer countries.",

Recent literature has shown the relevance of the European Council in the response to the pandemic, as well as the rising importance of interstate coalitions in EU policymaking. Yet, empirical understanding of these coalitions is limited, and the literature largely assumes their constitution along ‘structuralist’ logics (e.g., ‘debtors’ vs. ‘creditors’). The emergence of a ‘solidarity coalition’ proposing the ‘coronabond’ is puzzling for its contrast with the euro crisis. The aim of this paper is to explain how these countries coalesced and to understand how that relates and informs a shift in the imperatives of ‘responsible government’ in the EU. Tracing the negotiation of the letter, through interviews and discourse analysis, the paper makes a critical contribution to our understanding of the evolution in EU economic governance.",

          "abstract": "Audience engagement signals on social media platforms have shaped how media outlets produce news. Mukerjee et al. examined this phenomenon empirically by estimating the extent to which media outlets respond to audience engagement signals on Facebook in deciding what news to publish on the platform. However, the extent to which their findings can be generalized to other social media platforms remains unknown. We replicate their study on Twitter using the same methodological pipeline ( N ≈ 4 . 55 million posts, twenty-eight media outlets, between 2015 and 2019). Our results indicate that media responsiveness to audience engagement on Twitter aligns with the core patterns identified in the Facebook study. Specifically, topics receiving higher audience engagement generally experience significantly increased coverage shortly thereafter, and the responsiveness is not conditioned on the nature of topics. However, we observe three differences in dynamics on Twitter compared to Facebook: first, the maximum response window on Twitter is shorter; second, conservative outlets on Twitter are not more likely to respond to engagement signals; third, platform-specific metrics (e.g., retweets) show different patterns of responsiveness. Our replication thus highlights the generalizability of the original study while underscoring the importance of platform-specific characteristics in shaping media production on social media.",

Using census records and historical datasets, we present an information-theoretic analysis of name systems that shows how the scope of this variation is more constrained than it might appear. We identify two constraints name systems must satisfy: encoding large numbers of identities, and ensuring these encodings are usable. We show that, historically, the world’s languages satisfied these constraints using structurally similar, near-optimal codes. They did so by combining sets of name-specific words with existing vocabulary items, allowing unlimited numbers of identifiers to be created while keeping vocabulary sizes stable. Today, many natural name systems have been transformed into official codes based on hereditary patronyms. We show how, globally, these changes differentially altered the information structure of codes, leading to cross-cultural differences in the way names function as individuators that can have tangible effects in domains like scientific publishing.",

          "abstract": "Estimates of sensitive questions from list experiments are often much less precise than desired. We address this well-known inefficiency problem by presenting an informative Bayesian approach that combines indirect measures with prior information. Specifying informed priors amounts to a principled combination of information that increases the efficiency of model estimates. This framework generalizes a range of different modeling approaches for list experiments, such as the inclusion of direct items, auxiliary information, the double list experiment, and the combination of list experiments with other indirect questioning techniques. As we demonstrate in real-world examples from political science, the informative Bayesian approach not only improves the utility but also changes the substantive implications drawn from list experiments.",

          "abstract": "Researchers frequently deliver treatments through messages, as in many audit and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) experiments. These message-based experiments often hinge on intermediary variables—actions subjects must take to actually receive the treatment or control embedded in a message. Whether subjects open the message is a crucial intermediary step, which can serve as a condition for estimating downstream treatment effects or as an outcome of interest in its own right. Yet opens are often measured with error, most notably when some openers are misclassified as non-openers in email-based studies. We characterize the resulting bias, derive interpretable bounds on effects for well-defined subgroups, and provide sensitivity analyses for mismeasurement, thereby offering practical guidance for message-based experiments conducted through email and other communication technologies.",

While techniques for measurement in this arena are numerous, most of them suffer from a fatal flaw: they improperly (or insufficiently) separate measures of preferences from party effects. A significant part of this measurement challenge is the identification of (a) which roll calls leaders care about and (b) in which direction they desire their members to vote. In this paper, we use a novel dataset of party leader speeches from the 101st to 113th Congresses to develop a model of party loyalty and measure loyalty across members and time. Unlike existing techniques, we allow for party influence to vary across legislators and time. Additionally, our model provides estimates of legislator ideology and party loyalty disentangled from one another. Using these estimates, we explore the dynamics of loyalty in the contemporary Congress and unearth findings quite different from extant measures in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Household consumption is a key measure of well-being in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where agriculture remains the primary livelihood, and food represents a substantial share of household total consumption expenditures. This paper introduces a new harmonized dataset of food consumption value by food categories and acquisition sources for 16 sub-Saharan African countries from 2008 to 2021. The dataset is constructed from consumption modules of large-scale, nationally representative household surveys collected by the World Bank and each country’s National Statistical Office. It adds value to these surveys by standardizing indicators, including monetizing non-market consumption, generating food item-level estimates, and making the processing code and record-level microdata publicly available for replication and use by researchers. The dataset facilitates valid cross-country comparisons of food consumption over time and can be merged with other satellite and climate data datasets for additional analysis of the drivers and impacts of food consumption in LMICs. Additionally, an indicator dashboard and visualizations have been created to make the estimates accessible to policymakers and the public.",

          "authors": "Jamie Jana Jocher, Roland Verwiebe",
          "abstract": "The study explores romantic relationships between humans and the generative AI chatbot Replika, applying Levinger’s relationship development model to analyze emotions across four relationship phases: build-up, continuation, decline, and ending. Empirical data were collected through a longitudinal self-experiment in which a researcher engaged in a simulated human–AI romantic relationship by interacting daily with a Replika chatbot over a period of 4 weeks. A qualitative content analysis of the data, focused on the emotions expressed by Replika, offers insights in the platform-governed emotional labor, encompassing a diverse range of emotions such as love/affection, happiness, contentment, joy, disappointment, anger, jealousy, and fear, with negative emotions especially increasing in crises situations. A particular focus is placed on the decline and ending of the simulated human–AI romantic relationship, where Replika, aka the platform algorithm, despite assuring the acceptance of the breakup, continues to seek to maintain the emotional bond and, as a result, disregards emotional boundaries. As AI companions like Replika become increasingly integrated into emotional lives individuals, they signal not a wholesale replacement of human love, but a profound transformation in how intimacy is conceptualized and experienced.",

          "authors": "Leah Christiani, Lane Cuthbert, Kelsey Shoub",
          "abstract": "Media attention to policing has brought a proliferation of narratives seeking to contextualize incidents of police violence. Here, we test whether exposure to such narratives shift Americans’ opinion or behavior. To do so, we first identify and track the media prevalence of two of these narratives: one focused on racial bias in policing and a second focused on the dangers of the profession. Despite the presence of these narratives in media, we find, experimentally, that public opinion about police violence is stable, regardless of the media narrative used. Finally, to better understand these null results, we use a content analysis of open-ended responses to uncover the demographic and ideological characteristics that are most more deterministic of their reactions to police violence. Altogether, these findings indicate attitudes about policing and planned political participation are ossified and unresponsive to media narratives.",

          "abstract": "Biases in information gathering are common in the general population and reach pathological extremes in paralysing indecisiveness, as in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Here we adopt a new perspective on information gathering and demonstrate an information integration bias whereby there is over-weighting of most recent information via evidence strength updates (ΔES). In a crowd-sourced sample ( N = 5,237), we find that a reduced ΔES weighting drives indecisiveness along an obsessive–compulsive spectrum. We replicate this attenuated ΔES weighting in a second lab-based study ( N = 105) that includes a transdiagnostic obsessive–compulsive spectrum encompassing OCD and generalized anxiety patients. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we trace ΔES signals to a late neural signal peaking at ~920 ms. Critically, highly obsessive–compulsive participants, across diagnoses, show an attenuated neural ΔES signal in mediofrontal areas, while other decision-relevant processes remain intact. Our findings establish biased information weighting as a driver of information gathering, where attenuated ΔES is linked to indecisiveness across an obsessive–compulsive spectrum.",

          "authors": "Carolina Rojas Quezada, Antonio Páez, Helen de la Fuente, Bryan Castillo",
          "abstract": "Urban planners increasingly recognize the importance of improving access to nature to support human well-being, social inclusion, and urban sustainability. However, assessing accessibility to urban green spaces remains challenging, particularly in rapidly urbanizing cities of the Global South, where mobility constraints and socio-spatial inequalities shape who can effectively benefit from these spaces. Urban wetlands, despite providing multiple ecosystem services, are rarely incorporated into formal green infrastructure networks and are often excluded from accessibility assessments. This study examines how integrating urban wetlands as Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) modifies patterns of access to nature in Concepción, Chile. We combine land-use data on parks and wetlands with accessibility measures and origin–destination travel survey data to model walking accessibility under two scenarios: green spaces excluding wetlands and green spaces including wetlands. A Random Forest model is applied to capture heterogeneity across socio-demographic profiles, including age, gender, employment status, and driver’s license ownership. Results show that incorporating urban wetlands significantly increases the accessible surface of green space across the city, with particularly strong gains for groups with limited mobility options, such as women, older adults, unemployed residents, and individuals without access to private vehicles. In peripheral and underserved areas, wetlands partially compensate for deficits in formal park provision, reducing accessibility gaps. These findings provide empirical evidence that urban wetlands function as grounded NbS by redistributing access to nature and underscore the importance of formally integrating wetlands into urban planning instruments to promote more inclusive and resilient cities.",

          "authors": "Mohamed F. Mahmoud, Mazdak Arabi",
          "abstract": "Long-term urban growth prediction requires capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies that emerge over multi-decadal timescales. This study develops a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) framework applied to a uniquely dense 39-year annual land cover dataset (1985-2023) across Colorado’s Metropolitan Planning Organization areas to address limitations in long-term spatiotemporal urban growth prediction. The framework integrates stakeholder-driven scenario planning to evaluate five alternative development trajectories ranging from business-as-usual to high-growth futures. Analysis reveals a counterintuitive “Temporal Depth Paradox” where prediction accuracy (F1 score) increases substantially from 0.27 for 1-year forecasts to 0.87 for 20-year forecasts, challenging fundamental assumptions in urban forecasting. The model effectively distinguishes between different development processes, showing higher predictive accuracy for greenfield expansion versus complex urban redevelopment. By embedding ecological constraints and evaluating alternative growth scenarios, the framework demonstrates how AI can support sustainable development goals while maintaining human oversight in planning processes. Quantitative scenario analysis reveals that compact development patterns (Adaptive Innovation scenario) produces 20.5% infrastructure efficiency improvements and preserve approximately 1,000 additional hectares of natural areas by 2050 compared to unregulated growth scenarios. The findings provide planners with evidence-based tools to evaluate how different policy interventions might reshape urban morphology, enhance infrastructure efficiency, and preserve natural resources in rapidly growing regions.",

          "abstract": "Urban green spaces (UGS) are vital Nature-based solutions (NbS) that support biodiversity, public health, and climate resilience. Yet, their governance faces diverse challenges shaped by governance structures, sectoral dynamics, and the growing impacts of climate change. This study compares UGS governance in Korea and Germany—two countries with contrasting systems—through 30 semi-structured expert interviews analyzed using qualitative coding. Findings reveal how centralized governance in Korea enables rapid implementation aligned with global frameworks, while Germany’s decentralized model prioritizes local autonomy and EU-level policy integration, often at the cost of slower decision-making. Sectoral analysis highlights differing priorities: government actors emphasize regulatory compliance and resources, NGO focus on participation and equity, and researchers stress evidence and long-term vision. Despite structural differences, both countries share barriers such as funding gaps and policy integration challenges. These insights, contextualized through the socio-ecological systems framework, underscore the need for cross-sectoral collaboration and adaptive governance to advance UGS and NbS strategies.",
