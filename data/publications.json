          "authors": "GUADALUPE TUÑÓN",
          "abstract": "Social scientists routinely characterize religious influence in electoral politics as conservative and left-wing parties as fundamentally secular. Against these claims, I argue that the relationship between religion and electoral politics is shaped by the redistributive beliefs and preferences of religious leaders, who can become valuable allies of left-wing parties. I evaluate this argument in Brazil following the appointment of Pope John Paul II, leveraging as-if random variation in municipalities’ exposure to progressive Catholic bishops. I show that bishops who actively supported state-led redistribution were essential to the electoral success of the left-wing Workers’ Party ( Partido dos Trabalhadores [PT]). Voters in municipalities with longer exposure to these bishops supported the PT at higher rates. The findings highlight the under-examined role of religious leaders in shaping the electoral influence of religion and provide evidence that these leaders can, in fact, be key for the development of left-wing parties, especially in the developing world.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the developmental consequences of slave-raiding in Eastern Europe, the largest source of slaves in the early modern world after West Africa. Drawing on a wide-ranging new dataset, we estimate that at least five million people were captured from hundreds of locations across Eastern Europe between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries. We hypothesize that, over time, raids encouraged an economically advantageous process of defensive state-building linked to raided societies’ resistance to and lack of integration into the slave trade. Using difference-in-differences and instrumental variables strategies, we find that exposure to raids is positively associated with long-run urban growth and related indicators of demographic and commercial development. Consistent with our posited mechanism, raided areas constructed more robust defensive infrastructures and attained higher levels of military, administrative, and fiscal capacity. Our findings suggest that the structure of slave production conditions its developmental legacies, cautioning against drawing generalizations from the African context.",

          "abstract": "This article argues that folklore (orally transmitted group knowledge) shapes far-right voting by inculcating feeling rules that resonate with nativist and autocratic ideas. Drawing on recently rediscovered archives of nineteenth- and twentieth-century folklorists, we pair a dataset of local support for the far-right in all Reichstag elections in Germany’s Weimar period, with unique information on the prevalence of ethnic bogeymen in local folktales. Using spatial autoregressive models, we find a robust and considerable effect of the presence of fearful folktales on radical right voting. These effects are particularly strong for localities where citizens face political and economic threats. We use an instrumental variable analysis drawing on folklore data from the 1860s to establish the long-term roots of this pattern, disentangle the effect of folktales from contemporary political influences, and establish causal order. Our findings suggest that folklore plays a key role in aligning the supply and demand for far-right movements by shaping how citizens see and feel the world around them. In addition, we illustrate that folklore archives provide a unique opportunity to unpack affective-discursive canons across space and time.",

          "authors": "Bartholomew A. Konechni",
          "abstract": "Political leaders play a potentially important role shaping behaviors and beliefs during crises. In the pandemic, a number of high-status politicians, notably leaders of populist parties, were seen to diminish compliance with institutional recommendations by casting doubt on COVID guidelines. But what happens when such leaders change position and endorse previously discouraged behaviors? Using longitudinal data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America panel with fixed-effects modeling, this article examines how Trump’s unexpected endorsement of facemasks in July 2020 affected individuals’ likelihood of wearing a facemask and belief in masks’ efficacy. I find that Trump’s pivot lifted Republicans’ use of facemasks, closing 40 percent of the preexisting gap with Democrats and with stronger effects among individuals who were more exposed to the early-summer spike in COVID cases. Additionally, I provide evidence for the unique significance of this moment in the history of the pandemic, showing that at almost no other time did partisan behaviors converge as sharply. However, in contrast to expectations from most dominant theoretical models of behavioral change, especially the health belief model, no corresponding shift in beliefs about facemasks can be detected. These results have important theoretical implications for understanding how pivots can shape behaviors during crises, the validity of existing models in public health, pandemic populism’s causes, and directions of future research.",

          "authors": "Alec P. Rhodes, Davon Norris, Jason Houle, Rachel E. Dwyer, Sarah K. Bruch, Lawrence M. Berger",
          "abstract": "Low-income households in the United States draw on public and private resources to manage economic risk. Cross-national scholars describe a “credit–welfare state tradeoff” where credit markets become particularly important when state benefits are less supportive. The United States is frequently highlighted in this regard, with its often-inadequate market-first safety net. Both credit markets and the safety net are, however, highly unequal and segmented across U.S. states. We provide new empirical insights on the credit–welfare state nexus by leveraging a large national sample of credit record data that allows us to distinguish between credit instruments. We link these data to a comprehensive dataset on state safety nets with comparable measures of program supportiveness. We estimate two-way fixed-effects models that exploit temporal variation within states in safety net supportiveness. We find that living in states with more supportive safety nets is associated with a lower probability of high-cost alternative payday, installment, and personal finance loan use, and a higher probability of mainstream credit card access, particularly among low-income households. In the context of the relative inadequacy of the U.S. safety net, state safety net supportiveness matters less for whether people borrow than for what credit instruments they use. Our findings suggest that efforts to restrict the U.S. safety net are likely to increase reliance on high-cost loans among low-income households, furthering the unequal burden of interest and fees levied on these households.",

          "abstract": "Can online conversations with a marginalized outgroup member improve majority group members’ attitudes about that outgroup? While the intergroup contact literature provides insights about the effects of extended interactions between groups, less is known about how relatively short and casual conversations may play out in highly polarized settings, or how conversation topic can affect outcomes. In an experiment in India, I pair Hindus and Muslims for five days of conversations on WhatsApp, a popular messaging platform. I investigate how chatting with a Muslim about randomly assigned discussion prompts affects Hindus’ perceptions of Muslims and approval for mainstream religious nationalist statements. I find that intergroup conversations greatly reduce prejudice against Muslims and support for religious nationalism. Intergroup conversations about non-political issues are especially effective at reducing prejudice, while conversations about politics substantially decrease support for religious nationalism. I further show that political conversations and non-political conversations affect attitudes through distinct mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "To combat global warming, climate policies like carbon taxes, renewable subsidies, and carbon tariffs must be implemented to phase out fossil fuel consumption and lower emissions. Who are the winners and losers of such policies? Through a simple Integrated Assessment Model with heterogeneous countries and international trade in goods and energy, we study both the costs of implementing these policies unilaterally, and the local costs and global gains of international policy cooperation. To do so, we express and decompose welfare changes under different policy regimes to the first order as a function of sufficient statistics that depend on observables and identifiable elasticities like nations’ energy mix, energy rents, trade shares, energy supply and demand elasticities, and damage parameters. We show that climate change has non-trivial reallocation effects through international trade in goods and energy. Pursuing unilateral policies generates strong leakage effects, primarily through energy trade. Global climate policy cooperation mitigates leakage, but not all countries have an incentive to participate. Regional climate clubs operate differently: an EU-wide club reduces global emissions but creates internal winners and losers, while an ASEAN climate club achieves smaller global gains but delivers welfare increases for member nations.",

          "authors": "Gülay Türkmen",
          "abstract": "Migration scholars often present democratic decline as an emigration driver. This effect is more pronounced among highly‐skilled citizens who have the resources and capability to settle abroad. Yet, not much attention has been paid to why highly‐skilled emigrants would opt to return to their autocratizing countries, even if they are concerned about the political path the country has taken. This article provides answers to this puzzle through 41 semi‐structured interviews with highly‐skilled Turkish citizens who were born and raised in Turkey and who, after living abroad, voluntarily returned after 2016, when Turkey's autocratization reached its peak. In line with the existing literature, it finds that socio‐economic and affective reasons play an important role in shaping return decisions. However, as a novel contribution to the literature, it finds that autocratization paradoxically acts as a motivating factor for some migrants who want to move back to contribute to the fight for democratisation. Building on this, the article conceptualises “return migration as voice” (a la Hirschman), a new analytical lens to approach highly‐skilled migration flows in autocratizing countries.",

          "authors": "Sally Sharif",
          "abstract": "Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) is a crucial component of transitions from conflict. DDR starts the demilitarization of politics, a critical first step in reducing the feasibility of political success through violence and preventing conflict recurrence. Existing research on DDR is hampered by the absence of cross-national data. This paper introduces DDR-40, a pioneering global dataset documenting 83 DDR programs with 57 yearly attributes, encompassing 407 program-years (1980–2020). DDR-40 captures detailed program-specific characteristics, including target groups, membership size, group type, cantonment period, budget, implementation scores for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration, implementation bodies, and program outcomes. For the duration of every program, the dataset also codes the implementation of other peace agreement provisions, including commitments to amnesty, prisoner release, boundary demarcation, women’s rights, and children’s rights, as well as provisions for various institutional reforms, such as executive, legislative, electoral, constitutional, judicial, and military reform. The paper outlines the dataset structure, provides descriptive statistics, and shows how the data can be used to explain conflict recurrence during DDR.",

To address this question, we focus substantively on apologies for war atrocities and trace experimentally the effects of different policy counterfactuals. Conducting survey experiments dyadically in both countries, we randomized different forms of war apologies from Japan and official reactions from China. We show that direct apologies have significant positive effects. We also find two distinct sender-receiver gaps: The sender side (Japan) sees the apology signal as significantly more sincere than the receiver side (China) seeing the same signal; but the sender side also significantly underestimates the receiver’s willingness to conciliate. Finally, we trace how the receiver’s official reaction shapes both receiver-side (Chinese) domestic support for conciliation and sender-side (Japanese) public support for apologizing. These findings offer the first dyadic-level experimental evidence on the domestic dynamics of international conciliation between rival states.",

          "abstract": "This paper describes a process for generating academic papers using large language models (LLMs) and demonstrates this process’s efficacy by producing hundreds of complete papers on stock return predictability, a topic well-suited for our illustration. After mining over 30,000 potential return predictors from accounting data, we generate template reports for 95 signals passing rigorous criteria from the Novy-Marx and Velikov (2024) Assaying Anomalies protocol. These templates detail signal performance predicting returns using a wide array of tests and benchmark performance against more than 200 documented anomalies. Finally, for each template we use state-of-the-art LLMs to generate multiple complete versions of academic papers with distinct theoretical justifications for the observed return predictability, incorporating citations to literature supporting their respective claims. This experiment illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for enhancing financial research efficiency, but also serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating how it can be abused to industrialize hypothesizing after results are known (HARKing).

We trace his intellectual formation as a student of the German Historical School of economics, analyzing his pioneering use of empirical methods to document the plight of Black Americans. Du Bois emphasized the role of power and institutions in structuring distributional outcomes and the importance of economic and social uplift. One implication is that by conducting intra- and intergroup analyses of racial, health, occupational, income, and wealth disparities, Du Bois anticipated the empirical and theoretical aims of stratification economics.

This article examines an emerging complementary literature focused on strengthening the “sinews” of state capacity: tax administration. We argue that reforms to the organizational structure, personnel management, and task management of tax authorities have potential to raise tax capacity in developing countries. We also argue that efforts to improve the state’s legitimacy—popular acceptance of its right to tax—can increase capacity and may complement investments in tax administration. Our approach bridges a long-standing divide between how scholars in public finance and political economy approach tax capacity building in developing countries.

          "abstract": "Central banks have a primary goal of price stability. They pursue it using tools that include the interest they pay on reserves, the size and the composition of their balance sheet, and the dividends they distribute to the fiscal authority. We describe the economic theories that justify the central bank’s ability to control inflation and discuss their relative effectiveness in light of the historical record. We present alternative approaches as consistent with each other, as opposed to conflicting ideological camps. While interest-rate setting may often be superior, having both a monetarist pillar and fiscal support is essential, and at times pegging the exchange rate or monetizing the debt is inevitable.

          "abstract": "Whether sanctions push conflict parties to reach a negotiated settlement and contribute to ending violent conflicts is disputed in the literature. So far, discussions on the effect and success of sanctions have primarily centered around their costs for the target and proper implementation. Building on individual-level experimental insights from political psychology, we argue that the effectiveness of sanctions as a conflict management tool also depends on the conflict context. We focus on intrastate conflicts, suggesting that sanctions have different effects depending on the conflict’s incompatibility. In territorial conflicts closely linked to identities and immaterial values, we expect sanctions to cause a negative backlash that makes the conflict parties less willing to compromise. In government conflicts, however, the additional costs of sanctions could lead the parties to make more far-reaching concessions. We study the impact of sanctions on the outcome of peace negotiations in intrastate conflicts between 1990 and 2012, using a novel measure of conflict parties’ willingness and ability to make concessions. In line with our theoretical argument, our analysis presents evidence for a differential effect of implemented sanctions according to conflict type. The analysis also provides insight into how these effects evolve, indicating that both effects diminish over time.",

          "abstract": "How does fear of election violence affect electoral participation? We study how fear of election violence affects different forms of political participation important during electoral processes in African democracies. While the literature has focused almost exclusively on the way that election violence impedes voting, we argue that voting is not the only or even the most affected form of participation depressed by fear of violence. Instead, fear of violence is more likely to depress key pre-electoral forms of participation, such as campaign participation and public political deliberation. Empirically, we rely on experimental and observational survey data of almost 3,000 randomly selected respondents in Lusaka, Zambia. We find that respondents report a lower willingness to engage in pre-electoral forms of participation when the hypothetical electoral environment is more violent. When such violence is present, they also assess the physical risk of participating in such activities as higher. Moreover, violence reduces pre-electoral forms of participation more than turnout. We corroborate these survey experimental findings with observational data. Our findings contribute to a fuller appreciation of the way that violence erodes the quality of democracy and exacerbates political inequalities.",

To address this gap, we introduce the Disloyalty During Campaigns (DDC) dataset (1970–2013), the first global disaggregated dataset documenting acts of disloyalty by security forces during nonviolent and violent campaigns. DDC records the type of disloyalty, number of participants, ranks, branches, and whether disloyalty originated at upper or lower levels of the security forces. We show that disloyalty occurred in only 13% of campaign-years but in 45% of campaigns, with widespread shifts often originating from individual acts. We also find that disloyalty is positively correlated with campaign success but becomes statistically significant only when participation exceeds 1,000. Coups significantly increase success on their own, while other forms are only effective in combination.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has explored how militant leaders' backgrounds shape their decision-making while in power. However, existing studies primarily focus on leaders of rebel groups participating in civil wars, overlooking smaller, yet lethal and influential, armed groups that operate outside civil war contexts. To address this gap, we introduce the Jihadist Leaders Dataset (JLD), which provides original, systematic data on the backgrounds and prewar experiences of 237 leaders from 110 jihadist organizations. The dataset covers organizations operating across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East between 1976 and 2023, capturing a broad range of actors that are central to contemporary conflicts. Drawing on Arabic, English, French, German, Turkish, and Urdu sources, we document biographical information on 31 leader-level variables, offering the potential for analyzing how jihadist leaders' prior experiences shape their preferences and the behavior of the groups they command. We detail our data collection procedures and present descriptive statistics before illustrating the JLD's utility through a quantitative analysis of the leader-level determinants of suicide bombings. The JLD advances research on militant leaders, jihadist actors, and the role of individual decision-makers in shaping conflict processes and provides multiple avenues for new research on leader-level explanations of various consequential outcomes in conflict zones, including organizational splintering, tactical choices, and militant alliances.",

          "authors": "Sean Paul Ashley",
          "abstract": "When do nonviolent revolutions result in stable democratic regimes? Existing scholarship is optimistic about the positive relationship between nonviolent revolutionary transitions and postrevolutionary democracy. However, several regimes established following nonviolent revolutions fail to consolidate into democracy, often being derailed by coups and civil wars. Nevertheless, we know comparatively little about when and why nonviolent revolutions lead to unstable or undemocratic regimes. I theorize that security force defection during nonviolent revolutions undermines stability and democratic consolidation in the regimes that follow. Security force defectors possess distinctive motives, opportunities, and coercive capabilities that equip them to destabilize democracy in the postrevolutionary era. Empirical analysis using global data capturing nonviolent revolutions from 1945 to 2013 reveals that security force defection both significantly increases the likelihood of postrevolutionary coups and civil wars and diminishes the democratic character of postrevolutionary regimes. This article thereby revises the scholarly consensus regarding the benefits of security force defection during nonviolent revolutionary movements.",

          "authors": "Kyuri Park",
          "abstract": "How do secondary states in the Asia-Pacific enhance their security and strategic autonomy in a networked strategic environment? Conventional studies of balancing, bandwagoning, and hedging often adopt linear frameworks that position secondary states along a spectrum of alignment—whether with the United States, China, or somewhere in between. Yet such approaches overlook how secondary states manage networked interdependence—conditions that both enable and constrain their security and autonomy—by abstracting them from the broader relational structures in which they are embedded. Drawing on the network power perspective, I argue that secondary states actively cultivate and manage security ties to improve their positional standing within regional cooperation networks to reduce vulnerability to coercion and expand relational leverage and access to information and resources. The study identifies 3 key network strategies: (1) vertical diversification with great powers, (2) horizontal diversification with peer secondary states, and (3) bridging disconnected or weakly connected states. Using a unique dataset of Asia-Pacific joint military exercises (JMEs) from 1970 to 2024, constructed for this study andanalyzed through network analysis and descriptive statistics, the findings show that over the past 2 decades, U.S. allies and partners—including those with maritime disputes with China—have expanded JMEs with Beijing while maintaining cooperation with Washington and regional peers. These patterns reveal that secondary states strive to move away from the network's periphery and a shift from a hub-and-spokes system to a more decentralized, networked regional security architecture characterized by reduced structural asymmetry.",

          "authors": "Antonia Juelich",
          "abstract": "Why do noncombatants trapped inside militant organizations both actively participate in and resist insurgent activities? This article explains such turbulent cooperation with frequent shifts in behavior among the often-overlooked category of noncombatant rebels—those who provide the manpower of spying, cooking, and portering in war. Drawing on in-depth interviews with former Boko Haram members and extensive fieldwork in Nigeria, this study argues that turbulent cooperation emerges as a specific manifestation of incomplete socialization within militarized hierarchies. The analysis reveals how organizational realities create competing pressures that disrupt adaptation processes and prevent linear progression toward norm internalization. Specifically, individuals alternate between embracing and resisting militarism as they navigate social mobility opportunities and threats within a spectrum ranging from enslaved to elite positions. While advancement offers protection and resources, it simultaneously introduces new vulnerabilities through escalating demands for violent participation. The findings move beyond conventional assumptions that link recruitment tactics to subsequent participation patterns, demonstrating how socialization processes unfold among noncombatants whose seemingly inconsistent behavior reflects their struggle to survive within a militarized power structure that requires them to continuously adjust to new roles, responsibilities, and rights. This analysis thus provides insights into rebel organization, socialization processes among noncombatants, and strategies of survival in a context that is representative of increasing Islamic extremist contestation in Africa, while offering implications for counterterrorism interventions and post-conflict rehabilitation and reintegration programs.",

          "abstract": "Do individuals in conflict settings misperceive the extent to which their ingroup supports peace? If so, what drives these misperceptions, and can correcting them build further support for peace? To answer these questions, I conduct survey experiments in South Sudan in the midst of ongoing conflict. I document large misperceptions of ingroup pro-peace attitudes, with the average respondent substantially underestimating support for peace within their group. I also show that underestimation is greatest among individuals who have less access to information. However, providing information about rates of pro-peace ingroup attitudes does not cause individuals to update their perceptions of ingroup attitudes, and it therefore has no impact on individuals’ own attitudes. Exploring mechanisms, I provide evidence that the most likely reason individuals do not update their perceptions of ingroup attitudes is that they do not believe the information they are provided. The findings suggest that it is common for individuals in conflict settings to underestimate the extent to which their ingroup supports peace, but correcting these misperceptions is not straightforward. More generally, the results underscore the difficulty of building pro-peace attitudes in conflict-affected settings through information provision.",

We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers’ use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164 k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75 k papers published since 2023, only 76 (~0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use. Our findings suggest that current policies have largely failed to promote transparency or restrain AI adoption.

People closer to new renewable energy and green manufacturing facilities are more likely to notice these investments but are not more likely to credit the Biden Administration. Instead, the public sees governors as most responsible. This credit allocation pattern aligns with the political message environment: Governors more frequently claim credit than the White House and companies spread recognition broadly across political actors. This fragmented information environment illustrates the limits of using less traceable forms of green spending to generate electoral gains and public support for climate policy.",

          "abstract": "As humans, we store and share information. This allows us to distribute knowledge necessary for survival and to coordinate large groups. Our hominin ancestors harnessed the surfaces of mobile artifacts and cave walls as information carriers since the Paleolithic time period. Theories abound as to the meaning and function of these Paleolithic signs. However, very little is known about their basic, measurable properties. We here analyze a corpus of more than 200 mobile objects of a 43,000 to 34,000 y old Aurignacian culture—associated with the first modern humans to settle in Central Europe. These objects are adorned with several thousand geometric signs. We apply classification algorithms and statistical models to capture their quantitative properties. First, our analyses illustrate that these sign sequences are clearly distinguishable from modern day writing. Second, however, their statistical properties are comparable to sign sequences on the earliest protocuneiform tablets. Third, Paleolithic signs were systematically applied to yield higher information density on certain types of objects, e.g. ivory figurines compared to tools. These results cannot be taken to strictly prove that Aurignacian sign sequences encoded numero-ideographic information as in the case of protocuneiform. However, they prove that the first hunter-gatherers arriving in Europe already applied sign sequences of comparable complexity in a deliberate, systematic, and conventional manner—several ten thousand years before the advent of genuine writing.",

          "abstract": "Natural ecosystems are increasingly threatened by global agricultural supply chains, and a narrow policy focus on forests has fueled agricultural expansion into ecologically significant but severely overlooked non-forest ecosystems, including grasslands and open wetlands. While a few emerging policies attempt to protect non-forest ecosystems, a globally consistent assessment of their conversion extent and drivers, especially related to livestock production and commodity-specific supply chain demand, remains lacking. Here, we conducted a spatially explicit analysis to identify pasture and cropland expansion into non-forest ecosystems between 2005 and 2020, as well as conversion-linked primary agricultural commodities and their underlying demand drivers (end uses and final market destinations). We found that the conversion rate of natural non-forest ecosystems was nearly four times that of lands with tree cover exceeding 5 m (a common forest height threshold), with Brazil contributing 13% of the global total and Russia, India, China, and the United States each contributing about 6%. While drivers varied greatly across regions, globally 50% of the conversion was linked to pasture, and 27, 17, and 6% to cropland for food, feed, and other uses (mainly bioenergy), respectively. Among conversion-linked commodities, most livestock-associated products served domestic demand, while 32% of feed crops and 20% of all crops were exported, with export shares reaching 70 to 80% in Brazil and Argentina. These findings reveal important areas for non-forest ecosystem conservation and highlight the need for integrated policies to prevent leakage across different ecosystems and different sustainable development goals while also aligning local actions with global supply chain governance.",

According to some scholars, our craving for mind-altering drugs is an evolutionary mistake—a hijacking of our reward system. In contrast, the “drunk hypothesis” argues that intoxication has been adaptive and essential for the rise of large-scale societies because it promotes social bonding, increases cooperation, alleviates stress, and enhances human creativity. Here, we test this hypothesis using the example of kava, a traditional Pacific beverage with a range of psychoactive effects, made from the root of Piper methysticum . Our analysis of 83 Oceanic-speaking societies shows a positive relationship between traditional kava consumption and both political complexity and social stratification. However, the results are not robust to controls for nonindependence. Moreover, we found no evidence of coevolution between kava drinking and either of the two sociopolitical traits after controlling for spatial nonindependence. Despite the cultural significance of kava in many Pacific societies, our results suggest that its consumption was unlikely to have been a major driver of sociopolitical complexity, underscoring the importance of controlling for nonindependence in cross-cultural studies.",

          "authors": "Eric A. Baldwin, Takuma Iwasaki, John J. Donohue",
          "abstract": "The American public consistently supports stricter gun laws. We show that the gun lobby is most concerned that this support will translate into federal legislative action when fatal school shootings occur. Leveraging a dataset of political action committee (PAC) contributions and school shootings, we implement a staggered difference-in-differences design to estimate the causal effect of fatal school shootings on contributions to House candidates. We find progun Political Action Committees increase contributions by 31% to candidates in districts with fatal school shootings, and 20% for gun safety PACs. Neither show any significant response to nonfatal school shootings or mass shootings. The temporal pattern also reveals strategic behavior: For both progun and gun safety PACs, contribution spikes emerge in the wake of fatal school shootings, with effects dramatically amplified as Election Day approaches; when a shooting occurs within two months of Election Day, contributions from progun PACs increase by 2,820% while gun safety PAC contributions increase by 917%. These effects are concentrated in competitive districts ( ≤ 5% margins) where the two-sided surge in contributions offsets any measurable electoral impact. These results provide robust evidence that PACs strategically deploy contributions after school shootings, with the magnitude and timing suggesting a deliberate mobilization to advance its agenda. Our findings underscore a gap in democratic accountability: While public opinion should drive policy change, campaign contributions are wielded to blunt electoral responsiveness, providing insight into the inability of Congress to adopt broadly supported gun safety measures.",

          "abstract": "Why is discrimination morally wrong, and how does political partisanship shape moral judgments of discrimination? Several theories locate the distinctive moral wrongness of discrimination in its disrespectfulness. However, such theories disagree on whether disrespect derives from the deliberation of the discriminating agent, or from the expressive content of the discriminatory act. In a preregistered vignette-based experiment (N = 1019), we tested the extent to which people are sensitive to deliberation and expressive content in their moral judgments of gender-based workplace discrimination, and whether this sensitivity is moderated by political partisanship. Results suggest that while all participants are sensitive to expressive disrespect, only Independents and Republicans are sensitive to the difference between high and low deliberation-based disrespect.",

          "abstract": "This article offers a critique of both the overall focus and key substantive arguments associated with growth model analysis and, in particular, of Baccaro and Pontusson's account of how and why governments adopt policies favourable to the promotion of particular growth models. Our critique centres upon two arguments. First, existing work downplays the role of the state in the politics and governance of growth models and, conversely, overstates the significance of producer coalitions and business actors. Second, we introduce a life cycle account of growth models and argue that current growth model analysis focuses almost exclusively upon the functioning of existing and established growth models, neglecting two other stages in their life cycle relating to their initial establishment and eventual decline or termination. We argue that the relations between producer groups and states vary across these different stages of growth model dynamics. Our ‘state-centric relational’ account emphasises how state actors, while they may sometimes find it in their interests to work with business interests, should not, by default, be viewed as being subservient to them.",

          "authors": "Alexis R. Kennedy, Youngsung Kim, Taryn Moran",
          "abstract": "Social equity is politically polarized, with advocates contending that it is a governance mandate and opponents claiming that it promotes reverse discrimination and inefficiencies. When implementing policies and programs, local bureaucrats must maneuver within this legal, ethical, normative, and political battlefield. This polarization can also be seen in budgeting processes when municipalities decide what to prioritize within their budgets. While some are leading their budgeting process with social equity, others may be incorporating equity considerations into budgets directly but calling it something different, indirectly through processes and programming on the back end, or not at all. Through a mixed methods approach, we investigate how Colorado bureaucrats infuse social equity into their 2024 budgets, informing a framework we present that maps types of social equity infusion. By categorizing current social equity budgeting (SEB) practices into Leading with Equity, Equity Considering, Implicit Equity, and No Equity, this study shows that SEB practices vary across municipalities based on context. Overall, we find that equity infusion does not often occur. When it does, most of the work is done through internal training and culture shifts through social equity officer leadership. However, we also find that municipalities are seeking out other ways to support historically marginalized populations, including leveraging external grants and taxes to fund necessary services such as workforce housing and childcare.",

Recent surveys have moved toward presenting it explicitly. Those that do produce estimates of pure independents that are much larger than in past surveys. We present evidence of this phenomenon across multiple surveys and ask: Are self-administered surveys overcounting independents, or are traditional live-interviewer surveys undercounting independents? We answer that question by comparing live-interview and self-administered samples from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, by undertaking tests to rule out mode effects (including an experiment), and by seeing which question wording correlates more strongly with measures of latent ideology, vote choice, and ratings of the parties. Our findings suggest that surveys that include an explicit response option, allowing Americans to self-identify easily as “(pure) independent,” offer a more precise measurement of the concept of party identification. This has implications for the study of independents, as well as for discussions about polarization and party-system dealignment.",

          "abstract": "This paper shows that CEO’s trust enhances innovation within firms, providing a novel micro-foundation for the well-known trust-growth relationship. I build a new matched CEO-firm-patent dataset covering 5,753 CEOs in 3,598 US public firms and 700,000 patents during 2000–2011. I exploit variations in generalized trust across CEOs’ ethnic origins, inferred from their last names using de-anonymized historical censuses. Following CEO turnovers, a one standard deviation increase in CEO’s generalized trust is associated with 6% more future patents and 4–6% higher average patent quality, driven entirely by higher-quality patents. Text analysis of employee reviews shows that CEO’s trust enhances a firm’s trust culture. These results are consistent with insights from qualitative interviews suggesting that CEO’s trust and firm’s trust culture encourage researchers to undertake high-risk explorative R&amp;D. In addition, changes in CEO’s bilateral trust toward inventors in different countries have comparable effects on inventors’ patenting, controlling for CEO and other fixed effects.",

          "authors": "Kunal Sangani",
          "abstract": "Empirical studies find that the pass-through of input cost changes to prices is incomplete: a 10 percent increase in costs causes downstream prices to rise less than 10 percent, even at long horizons. Using microdata from gas stations, food products, and manufacturing industries, we find that incomplete pass-through in percentages often disguises complete pass-through in levels: a $1/unit increase in input costs leads to $1/unit higher downstream prices. Pass-through appears incomplete in percentages due to a gap between prices and costs. Complete pass-through in levels contrasts with workhorse macroeconomic models that feature homothetic demand systems. We identify an alternative class of demand systems that yields pass-through in levels and highlight four implications. First, measuring pass-through in percentages can lead to spurious evidence of asymmetry and size-dependence. Second, pass-through in levels leads to systematic fluctuations in relative price and markup dispersion that are not associated with changes in allocative efficiency. Third, pass-through in levels can explain dynamics of industry gross margins, operating profits, and entry in the data that are at odds with workhorse models. Finally, incorporating pass-through in levels into an input-output model of the U.S. economy better matches the volatility of consumer price inflation and the response of inflation to identified shocks.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a New Keynesian model with sovereign default risk. Inflation is set by forward-looking firms, monetary policy is an interest rate rule, and the fiscal government borrows externally, long-term, with an option to default. In this framework, default risk creates inflation pressures through an expectations channel, and tight monetary policy disincentivizes fiscal overborrowing. The model sheds light on temporary inflation events in emerging-market data: short-lived spikes in inflation, spreads, and domestic policy rates. As spreads rise, firms increase their prices in expectation of higher future inflation and low consumption during default. Monetary policy tightens, which reduces inflation and helps bring spreads down by disciplining government borrowing. These monetary-fiscal interactions imply that delivering the flexible prices allocation may not be optimal for monetary policy.",

          "abstract": "We show how to use randomized participation incentives to test and account for nonresponse bias in surveys. We first use data from a survey about labour market conditions, linked to full-population administrative data, to provide evidence of large differences in labour market outcomes between survey participants and nonparticipants, differences which would not be observable to an analyst who only has access to the survey data. These differences persist even after correcting for observable characteristics. We then use the randomized incentives in our survey to directly test for nonresponse bias and find evidence of substantial bias. Next, we apply a range of existing methods that account for nonresponse bias and find they produce bounds (or point estimates) that are either wide or far from the ground truth. We investigate the failure of these methods by taking a closer look at the determinants of participation, finding that the composition of participants changes in opposite directions in response to incentives and reminder emails. We develop a model of participation that allows for two dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity in the participation decision. Applying the model to our data produces bounds (or point estimates) that are narrower and closer to the ground truth than the other methods. Our results highlight the benefits of including randomized participation incentives in surveys. Both the testing procedure and the methods for bias adjustment may be attractive tools for researchers who are able to embed randomized incentives into their survey.",

We consider two channels: technology adoption and habit formation. Using data from 38 natural field experiments, we isolate the role of technology adoption by comparing treatment and control homes after the initial resident moves, which discontinues the treatment for a home. We find that fully half of energy reductions persist in the home after treatment ends and show this persistence is consonant with a technology adoption channel. The role of technology in creating persistent behaviour change has important implications for designing behavioural interventions and evaluating their long-term social impacts.",

          "abstract": "Climate governance has historically grappled with regulatory deadlock over corporate accountability for the climate crisis. Within this context of regulatory impasse, climate disclosure emerged as the central framework in financial regulatory approaches to climate change. Extending theories of legal endogeneity to advance socio-legal studies of climate governance, this article explains how private actors institutionalized climate disclosure from a voluntary corporate practice into a cornerstone of international accounting standards and financial regulation. Drawing on seventy-four interviews with sustainability professionals, fifteen months of participant observation, and analysis of public documents, this article shows how climate finance practitioners from a key nongovernmental organization, the Carbon Disclosure Project, repurposed financial disclosure toward the disclosure of climate metrics, developed increasingly specific iterations of metrics that formed the basis of climate disclosure standards, and stabilized voluntary climate disclosure within reporting standards by incorporating climate into financial risk management. This analysis contributes to charting the development of corporate climate governance in two ways. First, cooperation from the financial community and corporations was secured by incorporating climate issues within information-based risk management approaches that used financial disclosure as a tool to facilitate the flow of climate information between companies and investors. Second, the institutionalization of climate disclosure within financial regulation reframed climate change into new forms of risk to companies, rather than accounting for the risks companies pose to the climate and environment.",

          "abstract": "Studying the relationship between neighborhoods and individual-level outcomes such as crime, labor market success, or intergenerational mobility has a long history in the social sciences. As local processes like gentrification constantly change neighborhoods’ composition and spatial expansion, time-constant one-size-fits-all neighborhood measures fail to capture important local dynamics. This article presents a flexible and data-driven approach for efficiently estimating overlapping and arbitrarily shaped neighborhoods with time-dynamic boundaries. Constructed in a two-stage clustering design, the first stage identifies homogeneous groups within a city, while the second stage clusters homogeneous groups by spatial proximity. In an analysis of 86 million person-year observations from 76 German cities, the paper shows that a larger spatial expansion of affluent neighborhoods negatively correlates with city crime cases, while higher neighborhood fragmentation and heterogeneity correlate positively with crime rates. The findings stress the importance of flexible neighborhood estimation techniques and the necessity to view neighborhoods as nonconstant entities.",

          "abstract": "Despite considerable focus on clustering as a dimension of segregation and the explosion of big location data, the extant literature has not explicitly examined residential racial segregation and the clustering of racially segregated space as an influence on mobility. Drawing on urban sociological theories, we test criteria contributing to individuals’ selection of key activity neighborhoods. Using a range of spatial data sources, we compare White and Black individuals’ choice of frequently visited neighborhoods in Chicago, stratified by whether residing in a contiguous segregated cluster (CSC). Discrete choice models show evidence for the impact of clustered residential segregation in individual decision-making. Net of distance, all groups are drawn to White CSC neighborhoods. White residents exhibit a pattern of geographic isolation, gravitating toward White CSC tracts and away from Black spaces, CSC and non-CSC alike. Black residents of Black CSC neighborhoods are more likely to have activity locations in White CSC neighborhoods than their own residential CSC, largely because of the relative institutional, amenity, and crime-related advantages of these areas. Results are robust to alternative specifications of choice sets and institutional deficits. Implications for understanding the social context of routine location choice and designing desegregation policies through behavioral “nudges” are discussed.",

          "authors": "Dávid Erát",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the association between national identity, defined as individuals’ cognitive and emotional attachment to the nation, and fertility intentions. A form of social identity, national identity shapes everyday interactions and choices, and individuals with a strong national identity are more likely to adjust their behavior and to follow the expressed or inferred norms for the “good of the nation.” This study argues that a stronger national identity results in fertility intentions that are aligned with the nation's needs (whether higher or lower fertility) through its effects on personal attitudes, conformity to childbearing norms and expectations, and perceived control over fertility. The findings indicate that in a pronatalist context where higher fertility is actively encouraged by the nation, a stronger national identity is associated with a lower probability of intending to remain childless and a higher probability of intending to have two or more children, with variation by age, gender, and relationship status—highlighting national identity as an important factor when considering fertility‐related decisions.",

          "abstract": "Fertility rates in developed countries have declined to historically low levels, yet the reasons remain incompletely understood. This study examines the relative importance of diverse macro contextual constraints on childbearing intentions among young adults (aged 20–35) in Poland, a country emblematic of Europe's fertility decline. Using a factorial survey design ( N = 1,337), we compare how the availability of stable and gainful employment, opportunities to purchase a dwelling, access to childcare, the overall level of men's involvement in domestic work, climate change prospects, and access to abortion shape the decision to have a first or second child. Results confirm the enduring salience of economic security—both employment and housing—for fertility intentions across gender and parenthood status. Access to abortion rights emerges as the most influential factor for childless women and a significant consideration for mothers and partnered men. Access to childcare and overall men's involvement in the domestic sphere positively influence women's intentions but matter less for men, particularly those single and childless. Climate concerns are comparatively less influential. Men's intentions appear less responsive overall. Findings highlight the interplay of institutions and gender norms, and the limits of pro‐natalist policies that neglect reproductive autonomy and gender equality.",

          "abstract": "Stanley Milgram's Obedience to authority experiments are widely known to have demonstrated the human proclivity to follow violent orders coming from a legitimate authority. The present paper examines the extent to which Milgram's participants, during the obedient phase of their sessions, did in fact follow the full set of instructions that was given by the experimenter: a recursive sequence of procedures in a fake laboratory experiment on “Memory and learning.” Results show that while participants did not fail to administer electric shocks, (1) no entirely “fully obedient” participant fully obeyed the procedures Milgram's experimenter instructed them to do; (2) violations of the procedures occurred on average 48.4% of the time in “fully obedient” sessions; and (3) violations occurred significantly more frequently in “fully obedient” than in the obedient phase of “disobedient” sessions. In sum, in sessions traditionally regarded as fully obedient legitimate violence got to a substantial extent transformed into illegitimate violence. The paper concludes with the possibility that, the context of illegitimate violence that has been constructed implicitly by the experimenter constituted a coercive environment and thus made a causal contribution to obedient participants' inability to resist the experimenter to the point of disobedience.",

          "abstract": "Deliberative processes are often proposed to strengthen democracy, yet we know relatively little about how citizens evaluate their legitimacy. With a focus on deliberative citizens’ assemblies (or deliberative mini-publics), an increasingly common institutional form, I argue that experience with deliberation increases legitimacy by enhancing perceptions of process fairness and shifting views about citizens’ capacity to deliberate. I test this claim in Honduras with an experiment that pairs real deliberation and survey-experimental measures of legitimacy. Those without deliberative experience view deliberative processes as less legitimate than the status quo. Experience substantially boosts legitimacy, even among those who disagreed with the policy outcome—a strong test of legitimacy. The results advance research on deliberative democracy, democratic innovations, and citizen engagement, and carry implications for efforts to scale deliberative projects.",

          "authors": "Giovanni Castro-Irizarry",
          "abstract": "Scholars and politicians often refer to a “Latino vote” or a shared set of Latino political attitudes. This paper argues that such characterizations are, in part, an artifact of analytically aggregating Latinos across distinct racial classifications. Disaggregating Latinos by racial self-classification reveals systematic political sorting along the broader U.S. racial hierarchy. Using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), I examine how Latino racial self-classification and a new measure— Linked Fate Prioritization —shape political attitudes and behaviors. Analysis 1 shows that racial self-classification influences Latino political views; Latino whites tend to lean more conservative, Latino Blacks tend to lean more liberal, and Latinos who do not select a racial category tend to fallf between. Analysis 2 shows that among Latino whites, those who prioritize white linked fate over Latino linked fate tend to be more conservative and show less support for Black political causes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Latino political attitudes are structured by racial self-classification and linked fate prioritization, challenging the notion of a unified Latino political ideology and underscoring the importance of race in shaping Latino political behavior. I offer some theoretical explanations for these patterns.",

          "abstract": "The integration of refugees is a widely debated issue, yet scholarly discussions often overlook a crucial factor: The role of host society hostility in shaping this process. Across Europe, the erosion of social norms has emboldened xenophobic discourse, fueling a surge in anti-refugee sentiments. As hostility toward refugees intensifies, a critical question emerges: How does this environment affect the lived experiences of refugees themselves? One key yet underexplored aspect of refugee experiences is social marginalization, the perception of being unappreciated, excluded, or unwelcome in society. This paper contributes to the growing literature on host society antagonism by examining how anti-refugee violence in Germany influences social marginalization among refugees. Drawing on the German Socio-Economic Panel surveys from 2016 to 2017, linked to administrative data on anti-refugee violence from the Anti Refugee Violence in Germany (ARVIG) project, the study employs multilevel modeling to assess this relationship. The findings show that refugees living in counties with higher levels of anti-refugee violence report significantly greater social marginalization. These results underscore the importance of considering the broader socio-political climate of the host society when analysing integration and assimilation outcomes.",

          "authors": "Adina Akbik, Christina L. Toenshoff",
          "abstract": "Since the euro crisis, national stereotypes have often been present in the political and media discourse on European Union (EU) economic governance. Yet, despite the frequency of such stereotypes in political rhetoric and media coverage, little is known about their prevalence in public opinion or in connection with citizen preferences on EU redistribution. This article examines the relationship between national stereotypes held by EU citizens and their policy preferences for EU redistribution. We conduct an observational survey in four countries capturing regional differences in the EU: Germany (Western Europe), Italy (Southern Europe), Romania (Eastern Europe), and Sweden (Northern Europe). Our findings show that, on average, individuals who attribute more positive economic stereotypes (e.g., trustworthy, hardworking, efficient) to other EU nationalities tend to be more supportive of general solidarity in the EU, reducing inequality between member states, and the establishment of an EU-wide welfare state. Conversely, those who attribute more negative economic stereotypes (e.g., corrupt, greedy, lazy) to other EU nationalities are less likely to support such redistributive measures. We also find substantial heterogeneity between country samples, which may reflect differences in economic standing within the EU and historical experiences with stereotypes. Taken together, the findings reveal that national stereotypes are not only widespread in public opinion but also systematically linked to preferences for redistribution. The study contributes to the public opinion literature on transnational solidarity by showing how enduring national stereotypes can precede and inform narratives of deservingness.",

However, group sympathies or group affect constitute another, often overlooked subjective component of the relationship between social groups and vote choice. Based on reference group theory and drawing on ANES data as well as recent Danish and Austrian election surveys, we examine how voters’ sympathies with a range of groups are related to party choice across time and space. We find that group sympathies are related to vote choice in all three countries, even when controlling for objective group memberships and social identities. Across time, most relationships are stable or strengthening and comparable in strength to the relationship between group memberships and party choice. The relationship between group sympathies and vote choice is, furthermore, conditioned by perceived linkages between groups and parties. Hence, analyses of the role of social groups in voting also need to include group sympathies to grasp the full influence of social groups.",

          "abstract": "For many years, political scientists have debated over voter competence in direct democracy. At the core of the discussion is whether this central institution enlightens citizens about political facts. However, scholars have primarily examined if direct democracy fosters general political knowledge even though referendums and ballot initiatives are policy-specific in nature, as citizens vote on particular political proposals. By utilising a range of unique panel survey data collected around four Danish European Union referendums, I show that voters’ knowledge of policy-specific information markedly increased during the campaigns. I also combine the survey data with an original media content analysis and find that the learning of issue-specific facts is more related to the opportunities provided by the media information environment than to individual ability or motivation. These results suggest that a broad group of voters acquire policy-specific facts that help them make informed choices when they are granted full control of political decision-making.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the mobilizing capacity of the middle class in fostering civic activism under authoritarian rule. In particular, we examine whether the middle class has the potential to recruit other strata in civic activism. We use a boutique N=2017 survey conducted in Moscow, Russia, in December 2021, with an embedded conjoint experiment that identifies the reaction of respondents to an invitation from a hypothetical neighbor to take part in a civic action. We find that self-reported willingness to engage in civic activism is positively associated with the share of the middle class in the respondent’s district of residence. Furthermore, middle-class individuals are perceived as more knowledgeable and thus have higher mobilizing capacity; however, we find no evidence that individuals are more likely to be mobilized by someone from a similar social stratum. In districts with a low middle-class share, middle-class individuals exhibit higher willingness to engage in civic activism, but this difference disappears in high-middle-class districts. Finally, for civic activism, unlike the anti-regime protests, we find no evidence that dependence on the state reduces the self-reported willingness to engage in civic activism. A survey-based measure of past civic engagement augments findings from the conjoint experiment. Our findings contribute to research on authoritarian politics by refining our understanding of state–society relations, the middle class, civic activism, and local politics in autocracies, as well as to the general studies of impact of social context on civic activism, with implications beyond the Russian case.",

We argue that competition policy has critical importance for populist governments as its control helps them advance their policy objectives and facilitates their political survival. We propose that populist governments interfere in competition policy through one of three strategies, co‐optation, sabotage, and dismantling, which we argue are adopted contingent upon the degree of populists' legislative majority. Through a structured comparative analysis of the three cases, we find that although populist governments prefer to co‐opt competition agencies, they can do so only if they command large majorities in parliaments, such as in Hungary and Turkey. Those with weaker majorities, such as in Mexico under Andrés Manuel López Obrador, sabotage them, a strategy that may result in agency resistance, and eventually the dismantling of the agency if populists end up gaining a majority in the parliament.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that interactive and networked governance aiming to co‐create solutions are potent tools for addressing complex problems and that a configurational approach can improve our understanding of how governance conditions combine to produce effective collaboration and innovative results. We argue that the concept of generativity, which refers to social mechanisms that prompt, drive and scaffold co‐creation can complement and improve configurational approaches. To understand how governance factors not only combine but also coalesce into generative social mechanisms spurring co‐creation, we conduct a comparative mixed‐methods case study of local green partnerships in Denmark, South Africa, the U.S., and Vietnam. Based on this analysis, the paper identifies six generic functions of governance generativity: Catalyzing storylines, distributed action models, institutional templates for action, innovation triggers, productive technologies, and leadership creating internal cohesion and public support. Generative mechanisms with these generic functions can be expected to advance the co‐creation of sustainability transitions.",

          "abstract": "Many authoritarian regimes seek mass support through policy performance – delivering material benefits to citizens. When do citizens respond to these appeals? Standard explanations emphasize national‐level outcomes and individual patronage, along with regimes' messaging “spin.” By contrast, we argue that historical legacies of coalition building have an enduring impact on citizens' attitudes regardless of more recent, objective performance. We test this proposition by examining mass perceptions of the Saudi monarchy's job‐creation efforts, drawing on time‐series polling and an original survey experiment. Saudi citizens from the kingdom's western and southern regions – where narratives of marginalization and exclusion circulate – hold more negative views of regime policy performance compared with individuals from the more‐favored Central regions, regardless of the monarchy's objective jobs performance. Messaging strategies are likewise clearly effective only for Central‐region respondents. Our findings suggest that historical legacies of development substantially affect perceptions of regime performance in the long run.",

          "authors": "Lanny W. Martin, Georg Vanberg",
          "abstract": "One of the most robust empirical findings in political science is that in multiparty democracies cabinet ministries are distributed in rough proportion to parties’ legislative seat shares, a pattern known as Gamson’s Law. Yet existing research often overlooks the fact that portfolio and seat shares are compositional—mutually dependent parts of a whole. Standard methods treat them as unconstrained, risking bias, misleading uncertainty estimates, and flawed inference. Unfortunately, the most common strategy for handling compositions—the additive log-ratio (ALR) transformation combined with seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)—fails when the number and identity of compositional elements (like parties) vary across cases. We propose the isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation—new to political science—as an alternative that both respects compositional geometry and adapts to differing compositional structures. Monte Carlo simulations show that ILR sharply outperforms standard approaches, reducing bias, improving coverage probability, and increasing statistical power. While we apply it to portfolio allocation, ILR provides a general solution for modeling compositional outcomes with other potential uses, including in electoral competition, where ALR+SUR has required strong assumptions or ad hoc adjustments. Using this improved methodology, we find that seat–portfolio proportionality is weaker overall than conventionally reported and varies substantially across governments.",

          "abstract": "We model attitude stability and constraint, using a dynamic discrete choice framework for multiple attitudes, to identify influential attitudes within attitude systems. Its value-added includes insights about different sources of (in)stability, the direction of causation between attitudes, and their relative degree of influence; capturing time-invariant individual traits with a multiple factor structure; and addressing the ordinal nature of attitudinal measures, together with heterogeneity in time intervals between interviews, across waves, and people. We examine five core political attitudes concerning how people view the political world and their role in it. Most of their variance reflects infrequently-changing individual characteristics and time-specific effects. Permanent heterogeneity plays a modest role. External efficacy is most influential concerning evaluations of the external political world, while internal efficacy is influential for views on one’s role in politics. Another application examines the role of ideological and party identification on attitudes toward government spending and immigration. The attitudes form a weakly constrained attitude system. Party identification is the most influential, through spillovers to ideological identification. Party and ideological identifications are stable, time-invariant traits explaining most of their variance, with transitory shocks that hint at measurement error and/or expressive responding. Issue attitudes are unstable, driven mainly by transitory shocks.",

          "abstract": "Members of the majority party in Congress sometimes vote against bills that they prefer over the status quo. We estimate a model of congressional roll-call voting that allows for this kind of non-ideological protest voting. We find that protest voting has significant implications for roll-call-based estimates of ideology and other analyses that rely upon them. For example, a traditional item response theory model curiously identifies members of the Squad as relatively moderate Democrats, but our protest-voting-adjusted scores identify them as the most liberal members of Congress. We also find that previous studies may have underestimated responsiveness, the effects of ideology in elections, the utility of non-roll-call-based measures of ideology, and the increase in congressional polarization. Although the implications for most substantive applications are likely modest, our analyses suggest that future researchers can better measure legislative ideology by accounting for a small number of non-ideological votes.",

          "abstract": "Political parties play important roles in contemporary and historical contexts. With the digital turn in the humanities, historians and, increasingly, political scientists are turning to party archives for doing comparative analysis. Party archives provide unique insights on the role of party structures, actors, motivations, and discourses in real time. Yet despite their institutional and scholarly importance, comparative analysis is difficult given the heterogeneous landscape of party archives. This article aims to facilitate comparative analysis. We show that the establishment of different types of party archives follows distinct motivations before we link common obstacles (location, content, searchability, and usage) arising in comparative archival work to them. These obstacles’ severity is often connected to the type of archive, where personal and scholarly archives mark the extremes. The findings can help scholars gain deeper, broader, and, above all, comparable insights about political parties.",

          "abstract": "Despite the ubiquity of self-reported data in social science and public administration research, widespread concerns persist regarding common method variance (CMV) and its potential to distort observed correlations. In this article, we estimate CMV’s biasing effects through five preregistered studies (including eight survey experiments) with UK and Chinese civil servants (N = 3,159), focusing on the relationship between public service motivation (PSM) and job performance–a proposition of PSM theory often subject to CMV concerns. Our findings indicate that procedures widely advocated by methodological scholars to mitigate CMV did not substantially attenuate the PSM-performance relationship. A single-paper meta-analysis integrating these survey experiments reinforced this result, revealing a negligible overall moderating effect (mean effect size = -0.018, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.04]). Our results offer insights into the quality of self-reported measures, call into question the notion that CMV uniformly biases self-reported correlations, and strengthen the PSM theory by providing evidence for the validity of its core theoretical relationships against the CMV’s biasing effect.",

          "abstract": "The inclusion of non-trade issue (NTI) provisions in preferential trade agreements (PTAs)—extending beyond traditional trade matters to encompass labor, environmental, and gender commitments—has become a notable trend in international trade. While existing research has focused on the motivations behind such provisions and their effects on non-trade objectives, there remains a significant gap in understanding their impacts on bilateral trade flows, especially in the context of North–South trade partnerships. Gender provisions, in particular, have fallen outside the main focus of research. To fill this gap, we ask: How do gender-related provisions in US PTAs with developing countries affect trade? We argue that gender provisions decrease US imports by raising production costs for developing countries, with stronger effects in sectors with higher female employment in the US. Using industry-level bilateral data encompassing all US trade with developing countries (1996–2022), we find that gender provisions reduce US imports, especially in female-dominated manufacturing industries. Our study highlights the hidden protectionist potential of deep trade agreements in rich democracies, while contributing to research on gendered policy outcomes and trade and development.",

Recent advances in AI have moved those media musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as “companions,” yet there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71; 2017–2025). Works varied widely in considerations of MC according to guiding theories, dimensions of a priori specified properties (subjectively positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts (with more than 50 distinct measured variables). We ultimately offer a literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive; through a facet-theoretical lens, we suggest how this definition can scaffold future research.",

Honing an ethnographic sensibility increases the fidelity of our theories to the real world; improves researchers’ sensitivity to the ethical, emotional, and moral stakes of research; and sparks creativity. As more researchers in political science adopt an ethnographic sensibility, they are increasingly engaging in ethnography-plus research, which may include other qualitative or quantitative methods. To assess the promise of these approaches, we consider new directions in digital research methods, especially for difficult-to-access settings in authoritarian regimes that involve navigating the thorny ethics of state surveillance. Digital research with an ethnographic sensibility could benefit from an ontological and epistemological examination of what ethnography can and cannot deliver. The emerging generation of researchers looking to embrace an ethnographic sensibility should practice participant observation, embrace reflexivity, and attune to the body and sensations.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how reductions in individual legislators’ political incentives affect their relationship with their party in a party-centered environment. We develop a principal-agent framework to argue that the absence of re-election incentives and diminishing prospects of attaining higher legislative offices increase the likelihood of agency loss, manifested in weaker adherence to party positions in parliamentary speeches. We hypothesize that when MPs are unable to run for re-election and face increasingly limited career advancement opportunities over the course of the electoral period, the mechanisms party leaders rely on to foster party unity become less effective, making these MPs more likely to deviate from the average party positions. To test these expectations, we leverage the case of the Five Star Movement’s party-imposed term limits in Italy. We draw on an original dataset of speeches delivered in the Italian Chamber of Deputies between 2013 and 2022. The results support our hypotheses, showing that reduced individual political incentives are associated with systematic increases in intra-party deviation in parliamentary speech.",

          "abstract": "Political finance regulation commonly aims to prevent private money from unfairly affecting electoral outcomes and unduly influencing elected officials. A totalising option is to ban all private funding of parties and candidates – to replace it fully with public funding. South Australia, a sub-national jurisdiction in Australia, has done just that, by legislating to ban donations to parties and candidates and to replace party finances with public funding based on legislated metrics and drawn from consolidated State revenues. This article analyses the South Australian model of a ban on donations and full public funding. It offers a critique of the idea of full public funding, a quantum leap into cutting parties off from any private funding (aside from limited membership fees). It argues that in the process of sanitisation of parties from the risk of undue influence, it poses another risk, of sterilising parties by further cutting them off from broader social relations.",

Building on referendum instrumentalization studies as well as cognate literatures, an analytical framework identifies five potential strategic factors that might explain why parties participate in referendum campaigns and formulates corresponding hypotheses regarding their effect. The framework is applied to 33 recent Swiss referendums, using social media and newspaper advertisements as a proxy for party participation. Binomial logistic regression reveals that public attention for a referendum, its issue’s salience to a party, and (to a lesser extent) a party’s initiator status significantly favor the likelihood of campaign participation, suggesting that Swiss parties primarily leverage referendum campaigns for policy-seeking and image-building strategies. This study therefore contributes to understanding of the interplay between referendums and party strategies in contemporary political contexts, and allows for the expansion of instrumentalization perspectives to include non-initiating parties.",

From a normative perspective, however, one does not imply the other, and the reasons to value parties seem stronger than the reasons to value partisanship. Although there is value in the joint and sustained commitment to a political cause, partisans are less likely than other citizens to adopt a critical attitude toward their party in case of betrayal of its basic principles, and they are less likely to see the truth in the opponents’ arguments. For a well-functioning democracy, it seems important to have citizens who are politically committed yet open-minded, capable of revising their political views, and willing to sanction their preferred party at the ballot box. And while partisan commitment certainly does not impede this, it is often in tension with the ethics of voting.",

          "abstract": "The inaugural issue of Party Politics in January 1995 was led off by Richard Katz and Peter Mair’s Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy: The Emergence of the Cartel Party . The article outlined a convincing and influential account of the evolution of party organisation from the late 19th century and of its consequences for representative democracy. The notion of party cartelisation, famously associated with the article, has since become one of the most common axioms of comparative party scholarship. In this article we revisit Katz and Mair’s core argument, clarifying what it did and did not say. We show how the article both shared common ground with earlier accounts of political cartelisation and innovated in important respects. We assess the critical reaction to the article, the core evidence on party cartelisation itself, and the article’s influence and legacy. And at a time of great political uncertainty, we evaluate what the thesis and its proponents have to say about future developments in party-based democracies and the future direction of scholarship on party politics.",

          "abstract": "We complement previous partial global identification results for the non-Gaussian SVAR model by showing that in the absence of co-skewness among the strucural shocks, the skewed shocks are identified and in the absence of excess co-kurtosis, the shocks with nonzero excess kurtosis are identified. The former case has the advantage that dependent conditional heteroskedasticity is allowed for. In each case, the remaining shocks are set identified, and these results can be combined to identify both skewed and non-mesokurtic shocks. To capture the non-Gaussian features of the data, versatile error distributions must be specified. We discuss the Bayesian implementation of an SVAR model with skewed t-distributed errors that exhibit dependent stochastic volatility, including the assessment of identification and checking the validity of exogenous instruments potentially used for identification. The methods are illustrated in an empirical application to U.S. monetary policy.",

          "abstract": "Managing multiple accounts on social networking sites (SNSs) like Instagram is a common strategy for users to tailor self-presentation and manage privacy by segmenting audiences and content. This practice supports privacy management and reflects identity processes such as identity evolution (how users perceive their self-concepts to shift over time) and identity synchronization (how these identities are integrated across accounts). Grounded in privacy management theory, this study uses survey data from 408 Instagram users and a structural equation modeling approach to examine how two distinct types of privacy management, platform-enabled and interpersonal privacy concerns, shape identity construction. Our findings reveal that content management and curation significantly contribute to both identity evolution and synchronization, while interpersonal privacy concerns are tied to network-based self-presentation. These results challenge assumptions of the privacy paradox, showing that users engage in deliberate, context-sensitive strategies and privacy strategies. In addition, audience segmentation, more than content itself, shapes identity work on SNSs.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms increasingly offer users control over their feeds, promising to reduce toxic discourse. This study tests how the mere offer of algorithmic control shapes user experiences. Respondents evaluated identical posts from a fictional platform, with half given the option to filter out toxic political content. Those given this choice reported greater platform satisfaction. However, those who opted for filtering rated content as more hostile than similar respondents who were not offered the choice. A follow-up experiment showed that exposure to only positive content did not reduce hostility ratings; it heightened them compared to exposure to both positive and negative content. These findings challenge the assumption that user autonomy will improve content experiences. Instead, algorithmic choice raises expectations, prompting users to scrutinize content more critically or attempt to “train” the algorithm to align with their preferences. Platforms must consider how expectations, not just content exposure, shape online experiences.",

Despite growing concerns about risks (e.g. illegal material generation and sex worker exploitation), AI pornography platform governance remains largely undocumented. We conceptualize AI pornography governance as fantasy arbitration, the process by which platforms determine which sexual fantasies can be technologically instantiated. Using an inductive content analysis of governance materials from 98 AI pornography platforms, we examine content prohibitions, moderation strategies and enforcement mechanisms, liability allocation, intellectual property rights, and privacy policies. Findings reveal heterogeneous governance regimes that create differential risk environments and illuminate how platforms independently dictate legitimate sexuality, determine who captures value from content generation, and commodify intimate data. Collectively, these governance practices position AI pornography platforms as corporate arbiters of sexual possibilities, with broader implications for intimate freedom, labor exploitation, and our co-evolution with technologies.",

          "abstract": "This study explores online deliberation and discursive (in)civility within Vietnam’s authoritarian context, focusing on Facebook discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how different types of Facebook pages (i.e. government information pages, state-sponsored media, foreign media, and private discussion groups) shape deliberative quality and how (in)civility can both facilitate and hinder public discussion. Quantitative analysis reveals that foreign media pages foster more rational, diverse, reflexive, and interactive discussions, despite higher levels of incivility. In contrast, government and state-sponsored media pages maintain greater civility but demonstrate lower deliberative quality, while private groups show high incivility with minimal deliberation. To further contextualize these patterns, a close reading identifies emotional triggers and target-induced behaviors in uncivil comments. By integrating macro-level metrics with micro-level discursive practices, this study offers valuable insights for scholars and policymakers seeking to enhance deliberative engagement in digital environments under varying degrees of state control.",

It uncovers dominant conventional narratives, experiences, and understandings of online concerts, captured under the term ‘live music imaginaries’. Recent scholarship, journalism, and other commentary typically emphasise the limitations of online music events compared to in-person performances. Most pressingly, online concerts are pervasively viewed as merely a temporary lifeline for live music during the COVID-19 pandemic. They need not be. Commentators also frame technology as determining online performance practices, based on speculation about some inevitably virtual future of entertainment. Yet the history and variety of online concerts as a media form and cultural practice are under-considered. By highlighting and evaluating the historically and culturally situated live music imaginaries that shape the experience of online concerts, this article sets the stage for a theoretical reframing of the value of online music events.",

          "abstract": "This article explores “soft launching,” a digital phenomenon predominantly associated with female users that involves deploying deliberately “askew” photographs to subtly reveal one’s romantic partner on their Instagram profile. I use soft launching as a case study to interrogate the relationship between intimate publics and platformization, especially as it concerns feminized cultural production. I argue that intimate publics are platform-specific, and I recenter cultural production as a tool for studying intimate public spheres. Following this, I analyze the cross-platform existence of soft launching by applying discursive and textual methods. Examining the cultural products that surround and constitute soft launching reveals how platform-specificity contours both intimate publics and what I call meta-intimate publics , defined as intimate publics that reflexively and ambivalently repackage others. I offer meta-intimate publics as a framework for identifying and understanding how users (in particular, women and historically disenfranchised users) construct and present themselves across hypercommodified platform ecologies amid the “impasses” of contemporary digital life.",

This article offers a systematic, cross-disciplinary review of empirical research on digital populism published between 2015 and early 2025. Analysing 188 studies from political communication, media studies and political science, we map how platform affordances structure populist communication, how digital populism is conceptualised and how it is studied. The literature portrays digital populism as the communicative enactment of populist ideology in environments that privilege personalisation, affective intensity and direct leader–follower engagement. Methods span qualitative, computational and experimental designs, with research concentrated on Twitter/X and Facebook. Most studies examine exclusionary, right-wing cases in European and Western contexts and associate them with polarisation, misinformation and declining institutional trust. Evidence remains largely correlational, and inclusionary or participatory variants are underexplored. We identify key gaps and call for greater analytical precision in assessing democratic consequences.",

Methodologically, the study was conducted in 2024 using a social lab framework and the idea of a ‘social lab’ space, in which 19 older people with intersecting vulnerabilities creatively shared insights into their experiences of good aspects of the digital. By combining manual and NVivo-assisted thematic and discourse analysis with visual analysis, we found that the digital good coexists with challenges in the digital domain, and that participants emphasised challenges more than positive experiences in all life domains except education and training. Regarding interventions, they recommended practical assistance, skills training and other support from those with lay knowledge or professional expertise, while discursively placing responsibility for support-seeking on themselves as individual users.",

It evaluates theories relating to pivotality in the policy space, agenda-setting power, strategic anticipation of interinstitutional bargaining, and internal group cohesion. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial because parliamentary agreements structure trilogue negotiations, ultimately affecting the European Union's legislative outcomes. Drawing on an original interview-based dataset covering 31 legislative proposals in the 9th Parliament (2019–2024), the study directly measures party group preferences and compares them to the positions adopted in parliamentary opinions. The findings show that mandates tend to follow the grand coalition median rather than the body's median as a whole, rapporteurs systematically benefit their groups, and internal cohesion unexpectedly reduces bargaining success. The negative impact of proximity to the Council suggests strategic positioning for trilogues, whereas alignment with the Commission and non-lead committee rapporteurships shows little effect. Together, the results provide a systematic account of bargaining in the modern European Parliament, offering a platform for future research.",

          "abstract": "Although perceptions of party issue competence affect electoral choice, multilevel systems may condition their impact. Issue voting can depend on perceptions of which governmental level is responsible for policymaking. This article investigates the role of issue competence in European Parliamentary (EP) elections and whether voters account for the multilevel nature of governance by considering at what level, and how clearly, voters attribute responsibility. Beyond a general competence effect, competence may matter more when voters perceive Europe to be primarily responsible, and/or less when responsibility attributions are perceived as unclear/shared between the European and national level. We use data on the 2019 EP elections in 10 countries, assessing the impact of competence perceptions on four issues ( N = 7348). Our findings show that issue competence matters in EP elections, and for the issues of Europe and the economy, even more so when voters attribute at least partial responsibility to the European level.",

We examine how IMF lending impacts economic congruence—the alignment between government policies and public preferences for economic freedom and market competition. Lack of congruence can weaken government legitimacy and hinder development. We find that participation in IMF programs is associated with more liberal economic policies across all countries: greater economic congruence in autocracies but reduced congruence in democracies. These findings help explain the unpopularity of IMF programs, especially in democracies.",

Drawing on both participant observation at bitcoin meetups and the 2023 Bitcoin Conference, as well as digital ethnography on X, the article presents a thick description of how bitcoiners construct specific beliefs about the world and their place in it, as well as ritual practices that vivify these beliefs and sanctify those who hold them. These beliefs and practices constitute bitcoin, in turn, as a distinct moral community in which bitcoin is symbolized as an instrument of salvation from a failing institutional order. This Durkheimian analysis contributes to understanding how money in modern society carries with it religious meanings about the world and human history. And it also contributes to an understanding of the specific ideological formation driving techno-libertarianism as an ascendant political interest today.",

          "abstract": "State-led decarbonization efforts increasingly rely on a derisking approach, where public resources absorb investment risk and create “bankable” green projects to mobilize private capital. Yet, growing research highlights significant challenges in putting derisking into practice. I examine the Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) to assess how derisking shapes low-carbon infrastructure development. Drawing on document analysis and a review of its partners’ financial structures, I find that the CIB has struggled to mobilize investment at scale despite adopting a derisking strategy. Moreover, several of its partnerships involve firms connected to offshore tax havens, raising concerns about the redirection of public resources toward private gain. These dynamics call into questions the bank’s capacity to support Canada’s decarbonization goals. More broadly, the study contributes to research on the structural limits of derisking by showing how reliance on green finance can undermine decarbonization efforts, reproduce global inequalities, and shift climate policy away from public accountability.",

          "abstract": "American politics is characterized by an implicit rights-centrism, for example, when public discourse champions the freedom of speech in absolute terms. This article proposes instead an ends-centric mode of deliberation that underscores the myriad ends beyond rights that are also necessary to a polity’s health. Grounded in republican theory, the ends-centric mode maintains space to (re)prioritize ends and to redraw the boundaries of rights as required by a given moment or issue. Rather than displace rights-centrism or the courts’ role in enforcing rights, the ends-centric mode prompts other institutions also to engage in rights reasoning, thereby elevating the larger conversation and process of deliberation. It thus allows a separation-of-powers logic to operate more fully in the realm of rights by leveraging diverse institutional perspectives and capacities toward a multi-sided dialogue over rights questions. We draw from historical debates on speech and press freedom from the early republic and the twentieth century to find sight lines for an ends-centric approach in American politics. We further examine how ends-centric arguments would benefit deliberations over the regulation of social media today. Specifically, arguments that overemphasize speech in social media crowd out other desirable ends, such as protecting young people online and combating misinformation. Ultimately, we argue the benefits of rights-centric and ends-centric modes operating alongside each other across constitutional fora, as the polity deliberates rights in old and new forms.",

This article challenges and complicates this perspective. As hegemonic masculinities, which formerly gained their power through their invisibility, are increasingly contested, they engage in a strategic hybridization by borrowing aesthetic elements from marginalized identities. In contrast to the established hypermasculinity thesis, we contend that right-wing populists, exemplified by Donald Trump, incorporate queer elements in their embodied gender performances. Trump’s masculinity appropriates the subversive spirit of queerness. It conveys reactionary content through rebellious aesthetics, which results in fake subversion. By drawing together insights from populist research with masculinities studies and queer theory, the article makes sense of (1) why Trump employs queer aesthetics, (2) why his followers appreciate his queer performance, (3) why the queer dimension of his masculinity goes unnoticed, and (4) what new light the case of Trump’s queerness sheds on the concept of hybrid masculinities.",

Driven by changes in taxation, markups, and asset prices, the model accounts for the observed trends in income and wealth inequality in France since 1984, up to the top 1% income and wealth shares. We combine counterfactual simulations with a simple accounting decomposition of wealth accumulation to assess the contributions of these driving forces to inequality dynamics and to identify the channels through which they operate. We identify rising markups as the primary driver of income inequality, while all three forces – taxation, markups, and asset prices – contribute significantly to wealth inequality. Our findings highlight both the mechanical impact of differential asset price movements and the central role of endogenous saving responses in shaping wealth inequality over time.",

Letting individuals choose whom to compare to increases productivity to the same extent as a targeted exogenous matching policy designed to maximize motivational spillovers. These effects are significantly larger than those obtained through random assignment and their magnitude is comparable to the impact of an increase in pay of about 10 percent. A downside of targeted peer assignment is that, unlike endogenous peer selection, it leads to a large increase in stress. The key advantage of letting workers choose whom to compare to is that it allows those workers who want to be motivated to compare to a motivating peer while also permitting those for whom social comparisons have little benefits or are too stressful to avoid them. Finally, we show that social comparisons yield stronger motivational effects than comparable non-social goals.",

We develop a new firm-level Bartik instrument for firm rents that combines the firms’ predetermined energy input mix with national energy carrier price changes. Instrumental variable estimation yields a rent-sharing elasticity of approximately 0.20 implying that a 10% change in rents leads to a 2% change in wages. Rent-sharing induced by energy price variation is asymmetric and driven by energy price increases, such that, on average, workers do not benefit from energy price reductions but are harmed by price increases. Reduced-form evidence shows that a 10% increase in firm-level energy prices depresses firm-level wage growth by 0.34%.",

          "abstract": "Transparency is a key concern in global governance scholarship, yet its contribution to good governance remains deeply ambivalent. Scholars are increasingly questioning the idea of transparency as a silver bullet, emphasizing the need to better understand its potential, pitfalls, and regulatory challenges. This article focuses on the field of business and human rights (BHR), and recent regulatory advancements in human rights due diligence (HRDD) in the European Union specifically, to examine the conditions under which transparency supports business responsibilities for human rights. Drawing on expert and policymaker interviews from the negotiations of the EU Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, complemented by document analysis of related laws, policies, and research, the study identifies four interrelated dimensions that condition transparency as a regulatory pivot in HRDD: the design and audience of disclosure, the operationalization of reporting standards, the balance of accountability mechanisms, and the role of stakeholders and their modes of engagement. The analysis demonstrates that transparency operates within complex tensions—between capacity‐building and control, politics and law, and cooperation and contestation. By tracing how these tensions are addressed in EU‐level policymaking, the article advances understanding of how integrated communicative practices, clear and fair standard‐setting, accountability governance, and a culture of plural and deliberative stakeholder engagement can shape transparency as a means of good governance rather than an impediment to it. The findings extend beyond BHR to broader global governance debates on information disclosure, effectiveness, accountability, and democratization, while underscoring the need to recognize businesses as global governance actors.",

          "abstract": "As climate activism has expanded, governments have increasingly repressed disruptive but non-violent protests. Yet evidence remains mixed regarding whether repression inhibits or galvanizes activism. In this study, we examine how anticipated and experienced repression predict intentions to engage in normative (rule-conforming) and non-normative (rule-violating) collective climate action, over and above past activism and core psychological antecedents. Survey data from Extinction Rebellion UK mailing list subscribers ( n = 1,375) showed that experienced repression positively predicted non-normative action intentions and showed a positive indirect predictive effect on non-normative action via reduced fear. Although anticipated repression was not directly associated with either action type, it had positive indirect predictive effects on both action types via anger/outrage and on non-normative action via contempt. Conversely, it also had a negative indirect predictive effect on non-normative action through heightened fear. These findings predominantly reflect a galvanizing effect of repression on disruptive collective climate action among committed activists.",

          "abstract": "Television is a widely used medium for climate information worldwide, yet its role in public engagement remains underexplored. Here we examine both the representation of climate change on television and the audience engagement with it. We analysed 23,478 hours of programming across 20 German television channels over 61 days in 2022 and further assessed audience engagement with climate content through a representative survey ( n = 1,445). In the beginning of the polycrisis context of autumn 2022—including war, inflation and energy insecurity—2.2% of broadcast hours addressed climate topics. Climate coverage was concentrated in news formats, reaching mostly to the climate-engaged majority, but remained largely invisible for climate-distant groups who prefer entertainment programmes. In addition, the results reveal unequal gender representation in television programmes and a perceived over-representation of politicians. Taken together, these findings suggest that strengthening inclusive storytelling, diversifying representation and innovating formats may enhance the reach and inclusivity of televised climate communication.",

          "authors": "Xintong Yao, Yipeng Xi",
          "abstract": "Existing research on AI hallucinations has largely framed them as technical flaws undermining user experience, with little attention to their role as emergent risk signals in sociocognitive processes. To address this gap, this study applies the Social Amplification of Risk Framework to examine how hallucination‐driven risk perception relates to perceptions of media narratives and government performance. Using survey data from 811 generative‐AI users in mainland China, we test a dual‐path mediation model exploring the associations between perceived hallucination, perceptions of media hype and governance ineffectiveness, and subsequent risk perception and information behaviors. Results show an asymmetrical pattern: hallucination is linked to elevated risk through the media hype pathway, which is further associated with higher information‐sharing intention, whereas the governance pathway shows no direct association unless moderated by perceived behavioral control. Neither pathway is related to enhanced verification, revealing a decoupling of risk perception from epistemic vigilance. Implications for theorizing risk processing in opaque AI environments and for designing responsive governance strategies are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is linked to income. However, lower well-being among lower-income individuals may reflect either economic relative deprivation or the lower social status associated with a lower income rank. Here, using Gallup World Poll data from 109 countries and over 90,000 individuals, we test a general model that includes both relative income deprivation and income rank as special cases. In 80% of countries, subjective well-being is more strongly associated with within-nation rank of income than with absolute income or relative income deprivation. Income rank coefficients are over three times larger in the most materialistic countries, but smaller in countries with higher social capital: In countries with the highest civic engagement, the association between income rank and well-being is about 80% smaller. Results replicated in multiple survey years and are consistent with a link between income-related social status and subjective well-being that is stronger when social capital is low.",

Here we show that U.S. counties located closer to operational nuclear power plants have higher cancer mortality rates than those farther away. Using nationwide mortality data from 2000-2018, we assess long-term spatial patterns of cancer mortality in relation to proximity to nuclear facilities while accounting for socioeconomic, demographic, behavioral, environmental, and healthcare factors. Cancer mortality is higher across multiple age groups in both males and females, with the strongest associations among older adults, males aged 65–74 and females aged 55–64. While our findings cannot establish causality, they highlight the need for further research into potential exposure pathways, latency effects, and cancer-specific risks, emphasizing the importance of addressing these potentially substantial but overlooked risks to public health.",

          "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with alteration of gut microbiome, but the influence of familial structure on it remains poorly understood. We investigate gut microbiota across 429 children from multiplex families with multiple affected children, simplex families with one affected child, and single-child ASD families, alongside typically developing controls. We found that children from multiplex families exhibit the most distinct microbiome compositions. Cohabiting siblings in ASD families display higher microbiome similarity than those in healthy families, with a clear gradient in strain-sharing rates that is highest in multiplex, intermediate in simplex, and lowest in healthy siblings. This increased sharing involves specific taxa with reported opportunistic pathogenic potential, such as Eubacterium rectale , alongside reduced sharing of the commensal bacterium Bacteroides xylanisolvens . This suggests that their gut microbiome configurations, which are potentially influenced by shared environmental and host factors, are associated with increased persistence or detectability of specific bacterial strains. Our results underscore the significant contribution of family type to microbial heterogeneity in ASD and provide a hypothesis-generating context for future studies to explore the role of the shared microbial environment in a familial context.",

          "abstract": "Black and Hispanic faculty – underrepresented minorities (URMs) within academia – face career barriers that come to a crux in promotion and tenure decisions. Leveraging a natural experiment in choice architecture within a dataset of 1804 promotion and tenure decisions across six universities, we find that joint (906 faculty) vs. separate (898 faculty) evaluation reduces racial disparities in faculty outcomes. Specifically, in joint evaluation, an analysis of the simple slopes finds that Black and Hispanic faculty receive, on average, 9% fewer negative votes at the department level than in separate evaluations when controlling for research productivity, school, gender, rank, discipline, department size, and grant acquisition. Using moderated mediation analyses, we calculate that this translates into a 16.2% increase in the likelihood of a Black/Hispanic faculty member receiving a promotion. In a survey of 289 professors who have served on promotion and tenure committees (i.e., the key P&amp;T decision-makers), we find that only 17% of faculty expect joint evaluation to improve underrepresented minority faculty outcomes and, conversely, 43% expect separate evaluation to improve underrepresented minority faculty outcomes. This natural experiment suggests that altering evaluation mode or simulating joint evaluation mode could help address academia’s underrepresentation problem, but not in the way decision-makers expect.",

          "abstract": "Inter-party communication is crucial in representative democracies, facilitating information exchange and dialogue among political parties. Despite its importance, research on this topic remains limited due to lacking conceptual clarity and challenges in large-scale measurement. This article offers a comprehensive definition of inter-party communication as public communication by parties about others, with a positive, neutral, or negative stance, focusing on collaboration, policy, or personal issues. To effectively measure this phenomenon, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach capable of automatically classifying large volumes of text. Case studies on coalition signals in Germany and negative campaigning in Austria demonstrate its effectiveness. The study deepens our understanding of party competition, advances methods of automated text classification, and enables new research on political communication.",

          "abstract": "Why would a strong authoritarian state choose not to enforce its own policy? We extend the theory of forbearance to autocracies, highlighting its distinct incentives and characteristics. Using China’s social insurance policies as a case study, we argue that promotion-driven local officials under intense interjurisdictional competition allow firms to evade payroll taxes to boost economic performance and advance their careers. This effect is most significant among domestic private firms and foreign firms. We conduct one of the first systematic analyses of firm-level social insurance contributions in an authoritarian context, supplemented by individual-level survey data. Our findings show that bureaucratic forbearance of China’s social insurance policies has a pro-business bias, undermining the policies originally designed to address inequalities during market reforms.",

          "abstract": "District-based elections are a central feature of local governance throughout the United States. Prior work has explored whether district-based elections impact racial/ethnic descriptive representation in local office; much less is known about the impacts of local district-based elections on other dimensions of representation. We consider another such dimension: socioeconomic class. To explore how district-based elections shape the composition of locally elected officials on class dimensions, we focus on city councils and study the dramatic shift towards district-based elections in California in the 2010s. We construct a statewide mapping of newly drawn council districts; we also draw on rich and partially hand-collected data on council candidates and members. We find that district-based elections increase the share of candidates and council members from lower-income and higher renter share neighborhoods, and lead to fewer members with business backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "Geographic representation is a central feature of democracies: elected politicians are expected to speak and act on behalf of their constituency. Yet, politicians differ in how strongly their communication and behavior reflect territorial attachments, for instance, in mixed-member proportional systems. This study examines these differences using a two-dimensional measure of geographic representation that captures both the localness of referenced places, that is, their proximity to an MP’s constituency, and their deprivation, that is, their lack of access to essential public services. Using named entity recognition and Wikidata linkage in a novel and scalable pipeline, we analyze over 50,000 tweets and 190,000 Facebook posts by all members of the 19th German Bundestag (2017–2021). Our results reveal a clear mandate effect: via district elected MPs refer to locations closer to their constituencies and mention deprived areas within constituencies more often than list MPs. Overall, the study advances our understanding of geographic representation and showcases the potential of computational text analysis for studying spatial aspects of political behavior.",

          "abstract": "Jihadist organizations and their supporters have long used social media to spread propaganda, creating enduring content moderation challenges. Despite TikTok’s purported zero-tolerance approach to violent extremism, terrorist propaganda persists on the platform. This study investigates how supporters of ISIS and Al-Qaeda employ TikTok’s features to exploit algorithmic recommendations and evade content moderation, increasing their visibility within a hostile platform environment. We strategically enrolled the platform’s recommendation system to surface terrorist propaganda and inductively developed a typology of five communicative techniques: audio camouflage (manipulating recorded audio and metadata), meme infiltration (embedding extremist content within pop culture references), blurred intent (distorting sensitive visuals), emoji codes (using coded language and symbols), and bait-and-switch (deferring the reveal of extremist messaging). Together, these tactics constitute a form of everyday extremism embedded within TikTok’s vernacular practices, aesthetics, and pop culture references, exposing the limitations of TikTok’s moderation and state regulations. Our study underscores the need for improved governance, culturally informed moderation, and greater collaboration between platforms and governments to combat online radicalization and extremism.",

          "abstract": "Nuanced studies have scrutinized the facilitative role of digital media in fostering political deliberation and in contributing to the prospect of democratization in (semi-) authoritarian societies. This study illuminates a less-explored facet of non-democratic contexts’ digital politics by shedding light on discourse quality in cyberspace. Guided by Gastil and Black’s analytical–social framework of deliberation, we propose an integrated analytical model comprising seven dimensions and employ a case study approach combined with supervised machine learning to analyze Chinese netizens’ digital engagement with the public policy of “delaying retirement age” on the popular Q&amp;A platform. The findings reveal deliberative virtues—topic relevance, rationality, and civility—alongside a low presence of political alienation and minimal institutional alignment, suggesting generally strong analytical performance. In contrast, the social dimension, represented by argument reciprocity and transpositional consideration, remains weak, reflecting a lack of sustained interaction. Based on these empirical results, we coin the concept of the “ solo of deliberator ” to describe a pattern of online deliberation where analytical reasoning prevails while social engagement is subdued. Implications for deliberative democracy in non-democratic nations are discussed.",

          "authors": "Mathilda Åkerlund",
          "abstract": "Sexual hate and violence are core tenets of incel ideology, yet few studies have examined in detail how rape is understood and articulated within these digital communities. This article addresses this gap through a critical discourse analysis of 3,353 posts published in one of the largest international incel forums. It investigates (1) how women are portrayed in the context of rape; (2) how rape is understood among incels and how these understandings are substantiated; (3) how incels situate themselves in these discussions; and (4) how claims about women and rape are mitigated or reinforced through user interactions. The analysis highlights the contradictions and inconsistencies embedded in incel discourse about sex, rape and women, as well as incels’ strategic use of victimhood. The article further demonstrates the extremism of gender-based hate and the abhorrent language used to construct meaning around women and rape. Importantly though, the article shows how incel articulations of rape do not fundamentally diverge from mainstream misogyny. Instead, they are intensifications of ideas about rape and women which persist through the rape culture and rape myths in mainstream society, but are exacerbated by collective culture, lack of moderation and the separatist nature of the incel communities.",

          "authors": "Mariah L. Wellman",
          "abstract": "The line between “influencers with expertise” and “experts with influence” in the health and wellness industry has blurred and has confused the public on whom they can rely for their health information. Influencers with expertise in the wellness industry are those who have amassed authority through their online content and their ability to reflect an authentic self, often questioning and even outright denying the role of institutional experts and science. Experts with influence, on the contrary, are institutionally credentialed leaders with professional acumen in health and medicine who share credible information while attempting to debunk rampant misinformation. First, I describe the relationship between knowledge, expertise, and credibility, the last of which is considered a central norm of the influencer industry. Then, I offer differentiation between influencers with expertise and experts with influence. Then, through semi-structured interviews, I ask how influencers understand their perceived expertise and how they navigate and communicate their role to their audiences. The findings explicate the utilization of embodied knowledge in the wellness influencer industry, the use of disclaimers and claims to knowledgeability as protection from critique, and how many wellness influencers ultimately see themselves as a “different kind” of expert.",

          "authors": "Julian Wamble, Jared Clemons",
          "abstract": "Existing research on descriptive representation maintains that political candidates often receive more political support from in-group voters than their out-group competitors. Scholars claim this is due in large part to the assumption that descriptive candidates have a greater inclination to act in ways that benefit their shared identity group. This paper explores the other side of these heightened expectations and asks—How do voters evaluate a descriptive representative whose actions are perceived as being at odds with group expectations? Moreover, how do those evaluations compare to out-group candidates who behave in similarly? Using an experimental test, we examine the costs leveraged against political candidates who meet voters’ expectations and those who do not, and seeing whether the shared identity conditions voters’ evaluations. In doing so, we provide a more holistic view of the ways in which descriptive representation matters to voters.",

          "authors": "Sherry Dongqi Bao, Micah G. Edelson, Todd A. Hare",
          "abstract": "People are often faced with choices whose outcomes will affect other individuals in addition to themselves. Being responsible for deciding on behalf of others alters choice behavior and increases delegation rates in decisions involving risk and ambiguity. However, it is unknown whether the influence of social responsibility on decision-making acts primarily or directly on risk, loss, and ambiguity attitudes versus more general aspects of cognition. We report a series of experiments on objective magnitude judgments that demonstrate that the influences of responsibility on cognition and behavior extend beyond risk or ambiguity and act at the metacognitive level. Specifically, responsibility for others changes metacognitive biases, leading to a decrease in decision confidence without affecting choice accuracy. Last, we propose and empirically test a normative computational framework based on decision confidence that can explain decisions to assume or delegate responsibility for others without needing to assume changes in risk preferences.",

          "abstract": "We show that existing “production approaches” to markdown estimation do not separately identify factor price markdowns from factor-augmenting productivity levels. We propose a method to overcome this challenge and apply it to study the effects of ownership liberalization in Chinese nonferrous metal industries. We find that private firms have much higher labor-augmenting productivity levels than state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, we also find that private firms exert higher monopsony power over their workers than SOEs, although this only holds for domestically owned firms. This suggests that privatization policies imply a trade-off between increased productivity and monopsony power. (JEL D24, F23, J42, L33, L61, L72, P31)",

          "abstract": "Decision-makers can exhibit biases when they overemphasize particularly salient features under limited attention. We exploit a sudden salience shock involving individuals of Moroccan descent to examine biases within the Dutch criminal justice system. The salience shock concerned the assassination of a defense attorney by organized crime and thus specifically targeted the justice system. Leveraging high-quality data covering arrest through appeal, we find no impact on police or prosecutor decisions but uncover a 71 percent increase in sentence lengths imposed by judges on salient individuals. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that judge experience with minority suspects can mitigate bias in more discretionary decisions. (JEL D91, J15, K42)",

We use these results to discuss findings in the empirical literature on information provision experiments that can be explained by rational inattention of survey respondents and what this interpretation implies about behavior outside the survey.

Using restricted-access 2021 Canadian census data linked to tax records, we find that nonbinary individuals assigned male at birth, transgender men, transgender women, and cisgender women all earn significantly less than comparable cisgender men. Nonbinary individuals assigned female at birth experience an additional earnings penalty. Differences in job sorting explain some of these disparities. (JEL J16, J31, J71)",

          "abstract": "Central bankers argue that programmable digital currencies may compromise the uniformity or singleness of money. We explore this view in a stylized model where programmable money arises endogenously, and differently programmed monies have varying liquidity. Programmability provides private value by easing commitment frictions but imposes social costs under informational frictions. Preserving uniformity is not necessarily socially beneficial. Banning programmable money lowers welfare when informational frictions are mild but improves it when commitment frictions are low. These insights suggest that programmable money could be more beneficial on permissionless blockchains, where it is difficult to commit but trades are publicly observable. (JEL D83, E42, E52, E58)",

          "abstract": "Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that eligible household heads surveyed just after an unconditional cash transfer in Indonesia report a 0.4 standard deviation improvement in sleep quality compared to those surveyed just before, and they perform better on cognitive tasks sensitive to sleep deprivation. The cash transfer appears to alleviate financial concerns for household heads—typically the breadwinners—improving their sleep. Postdisbursement, eligible households increase savings and reduce debts, and household heads feel less worried, frustrated, and tired. These effects are not observed in ineligible household heads or other members of eligible households. (JEL D12, D91, G51, I38, O12, O16)",

          "abstract": "We systematically review studies of how unemployment benefits affect unemployment duration. Statistically significant findings are eight times more likely to be published. Correcting for publication bias cuts the average elasticity by a third. Meta-analysis is a data-driven way to aggregate estimates across policy contexts and generalize sufficient statistics methods to compute the global optimal policy. Although existing consumption drop-based approaches typically imply an optimal replacement rate near zero, our corrected estimates imply an optimal replacement rate of 28 percent in the United States. We are unable to reject the hypothesis that the “micro” elasticity is equal to the “macro” elasticity. (JEL E24, J64, J65)",

          "abstract": "This paper compares measured inflation in true and fixed-weight price indices. We construct model-based inflation measures in time-dependent pricing models that are analogous to measures of inflation in the data—for example, the consumer price index. In the standard new Keynesian model, when inflation rises rapidly, the differences between inflation in those indices and true price indices are increasing in the degree of price stickiness and the elasticity of substitution across goods. For commonly used parameter values, those differences are large and persistent for increases in inflation of the size seen after 2020 in the United States. (JEL E12, E31)",

          "authors": "Yiyi Chen, Chun Yin, Yuyao Ye",
          "abstract": "Urban greenness has been recognized as a potential correlator of loneliness, yet evidence from rapidly urbanizing and aging contexts remains limited. Using a longitudinal panel design based on three waves (2011, 2013, and 2015) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this study examined the association between city-level greenness cover ratio and loneliness among Chinese older adults (aged ≥ 60 years, N = 11,718). We assessed social activity participation as a mediator and PM₂.₅ as a moderator. In unadjusted random-effects models, one standard-deviation increase in green cover ratio was associated with a 0.052-unit decrease in loneliness (β = −0.052; 95% CI: (−0.073, −0.031); P &lt; 0.001). After adjustment for sociodemographic, health, and city-level covariates, the inverse association remained statistically significant (β ranges from −0.023 to −0.020; all P &lt; 0.05). Mediation analyses suggested that social activity participation contributed only a very small indirect component to the greenness–loneliness association (approximately 2% under lower PM 2.5 conditions), while the indirect pathway becoming weaker and imprecise at higher pollution levels. In subgroup analyses, inverse associations between green cover ratio and loneliness were more consistently observed in some age and health subgroups. These findings provide modest associative evidence that urban vegetation, air quality, and social activity participation are linked with loneliness among older adults.",
