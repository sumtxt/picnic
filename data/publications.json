          "authors": "JAY C. KAO",
          "abstract": "Authoritarian regimes have increasingly leveraged foreign media to project influence within democracies, yet evidence of these co-opted outlets’ actual effects remains scarce. This study presents findings from a field experiment conducted during Taiwan’s 2020 general election, assessing the impact of The China Times, a Beijing-backed media conglomerate, on voter behavior and attitudes. The experiment incentivized participants to engage in sustained consumption of real-time news from this outlet in the weeks leading up to the election. Results from a panel survey linked to individual-level web-tracking data reveal that exposure to The China Times sways voters in favor of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These effects, however, are primarily driven by nonpartisan and PRC-friendly voters. To the extent that I find effects among PRC-skeptics, they show evidence of backfiring. As Beijing’s media co-optation extends beyond Taiwan, my findings have broader implications for understanding the effectiveness and limitations of authoritarian influence operations.",

          "authors": "Stephanie L. DeMora, Benjamin J. Newman",
          "abstract": "The growth in economic inequality in the United States over the past forty years has stimulated interest among scholars in the effects of exposure to inequality on the American people. A prominent vein of scholarship explores whether exposure to inequality diminishes belief in a key pillar of the ‘American dream’ – the meritocratic ideal that hard work will translate to economic success. We offer this literature a novel test that explores the relationship between quotidian exposure to economic inequality in one’s adolescent residential context and belief in the American dream among roughly 1.3 million late-adolescent Americans entering college. We find that adolescent residence in high-inequality areas is associated with decreased belief in the American dream upon entering adulthood. Further analysis revealed that this relationship is most pronounced among young Americans raised in higher income households.",

          "abstract": "Do people form risk assessments to justify their actions? We investigate this question in a field experiment studying the dynamics of risk assessments for visiting a café during the Covid-19 pandemic. By randomly varying the incentive for a visit, we find that participants with a high incentive visit cafés more often and downplay the risk compared to those participants with a low incentive. Importantly, the downplaying happens in anticipation of the visit and without new information, suggesting that the assessment update justifies engagement in risky behaviour. This finding is inconsistent with Bayesian updating but consistent with the notion of motivated reasoning.",

We characterize the evolution of populism over 60 years and show empirically that it is significantly impacted by the skill-content of globalization. Specifically, imports of goods which are intensive in low-skill labor generate more right-wing populism, and low-skill immigration shifts the distribution of votes to the right, with more votes for right-wing populist parties and less for left-wing populist parties. In contrast, imports of high-skill labor intensive goods, as well as high-skill immigration flows, tend to reduce the volume of populism.",

Given the recently documented relationship between pollution and social media, I exploit exogenous variation in local air quality as an instrument for online aggression. An event study analysis shows that air pollution increases by 5.8 standard deviations (SD) when refineries experience unexpected malfunctions. On pollution spike days, surrounding areas see 0.11 SD more aggressive tweets and 0.24 SD more crimes; geographically distant but socially networked regions see aggressive tweets increase by 0.008 SD and crimes by 0.015 SD.

When political power is indivisible, voting is a substitute for fighting—provided the losing side accepts the outcome. We study a theoretical model of this substitution, and use a country-level panel dataset to assess empirically whether the economic factors influencing fighting also shape voting. They do. We contribute several theoretical and empirical innovations. First, we apply a recently developed method for analysing conflict resolution functions to derive robust theoretical results. Second, we introduce a new explanatory variable—productive efficiency as measured by income relative to the global frontier—and we explain the theoretical and empirical relevance of this variable. Finally, we show that absolute income levels do not matter, whereas oil wealth and ethnic divisions do—though their influence is less important than that of productive efficiency in explaining patterns of fighting and voting. A key implication of our analysis is that reducing global inequality is crucial for decreasing conflict and fostering democracy.",

          "abstract": "As democratic institutions around the world confront rising authoritarian pressures, the imperative to understand when and how citizens justify illiberal governance has increased. This study investigates how ideological orientations condition the relationship between populist attitudes and public support for martial law, drawing on the unprecedented 2024 declaration of martial law in South Korea as a focal case. Using original, nationally representative survey data, we find that populist attitudes do not uniformly predict support for martial law; rather, their influence is fundamentally shaped by respondents’ ideological leanings. Among citizens with strong populist orientations, those on the ideological right exhibit a significantly greater propensity to endorse martial law, whereas their counterparts on the left display pronounced resistance to such authoritarian measures. These findings highlight the ideologically contingent nature of populist attitudes and show how populism can serve to either legitimize or challenge authoritarianism, depending on individuals’ ideological orientations.",

          "abstract": "In the face of populist challenges, citizens’ conceptions of democracy and process preferences are increasingly being studied, based on the assumption that democratic resilience is dependent on citizen support. However, the attitudes and behaviour of political elites are just as relevant. Elites were long assumed to lean towards an elite-centred, ‘institutional’ style of democracy. However, recent developments such as the rise of populism and political polarization suggest a different trend, as politicians themselves seem to be losing trust in institutions. We explore the actual distribution of legislators’ preferences in the process space today based on novel data from the United States and Germany, offering a comparative perspective. We measure process preferences on a continuum ranging from support for people-centred democracy to support for elite-centred democracy. Our findings demonstrate that the preferences of legislators in Germany are normally distributed along this continuum, while those of legislators in the more polarized United States lean towards a people-centred process. In both countries, control of government, seniority and electoral security are found to be important determinants of process preferences.",

          "abstract": "This study tests the hypothesis that foreign remittances compensate for the effects of outward migration. It uses a panel dataset of 51 African countries, a dynamic estimator, and selected socio‐economic performance indicators. On a macroeconomic and procyclical scale, the study finds that human capital flight (HCF) constrains the manufacturing sector performance, per capita GDP growth, and labour force participation in the sending countries. In addition, on a microeconomic and countercyclical scale, infant mortality and out‐of‐pocket spending increase as HCF intensifies. Foreign remittances can mitigate this by providing financial support for households' private health expenditures and capacity development. This study illustrates that in the present era of transnationalism, reliance on the microeconomic need for remittances as a justification for HCF is counterproductive. For remittances to serve the expected compensatory role and yield macroeconomic benefits, African governments need to have incentive structures that can attract, mobilise, and channel the flows to critical socioeconomic sectors.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the practice of geoarbitrage, as carried out by middle‐level private actors when engaging with Chinese migrants aspiring to access the Golden Visa programme in Portugal. Based on interviews with experts and Chinese migrants, content analysis of migration policies as well as of online promotional materials produced by migration consultants, we investigate the role of intermediaries in the (re)production of Portugal's desirability as a mobility destination for relatively wealthy Chinese migrants. While the concept of geoarbitrage has been mainly used regarding the micro‐level of mobility decision‐making, we hereby extend it to shed light on how intermediaries act as geoarbiters between legal frameworks and migrants' aspirations and resources. By examining the role of the meso‐level actors involved in the geoarbitrage between Portugal and China, we aim to edify the enduring appeal of Portugal as a desirable destination for wealthy Asian migrants and to discuss key policy implications.",

          "authors": "Sung Eun Kim, Krzysztof Pelc",
          "abstract": "Why do some economic shocks have political consequences, upturning elections and ushering in radical candidates, while others are brushed off as structural change? We address this puzzle by looking to geographically concentrated industries, and how they relate to regional identity. While most often presented as a source of regional strength, we show that industrial hubs in the United States have accounted for more job losses than gains over the last twenty years. We then show how this matters through three original survey studies. Workers in geographically concentrated industries belong to denser, more deeply-rooted peer networks; these are associated with a stronger view that politicians are responsible for preventing layoffs. Those same individuals also perceive economic shocks of equal magnitude as more damaging to their region’s standing, compared to the rest of the country. Perceptions of lost regional standing, in turn, are associated with greater demand for populist leadership traits. Finally, we show how these individual attitudes translate into aggregate political behavior. Employment losses in industrial hubs are tied to greater support for Republican candidates, while equivalent losses in non-hubs show no analogous effect. Our account presents a competing picture to the dominant narrative of industrial hubs as founts of innovation and productivity. When threatened by structural forces, such hubs can turn instead into founts of political resentment.",

To facilitate the review, we devised two novel classification schemes to distinguish between longitudinal and non-longitudinal studies and to measure how time is treated. We manually coded a random sample of 1,080 research articles, supplemented with computerized keyword scanning of the study population. The results show that longitudinal studies have steadily accounted for about 9% of the publications. Panel data studies outnumber time-series studies in a ratio of 3:2. Three-fourths of the longitudinal studies treat time as a timing index and aim to test causal effects, whereas a quarter treat time as a parameter to capture temporal dynamics. Longitudinal studies make more conceptual contributions and receive more citations than non-longitudinal studies. We offer practical recommendations for longitudinal communication research.",

          "abstract": "Ethnic federalism, a system that devolves power to subnational states drawn along ethnic lines, is a widely debated approach to managing ethnic conflict. While scholars have studied its macro-level consequences, little is known about micro-level preferences within these countries. We examine two key dilemmas of ethnic federalism: (1) the “minorities within minorities dilemma”, where many ethnic group members live outside their designated state, and (2) the “devolution dilemma,” which concerns which powers should be held by the central versus state governments. Using survey experiments among Ethiopian university students, we find no average effect of changing power distributions on support for ethnic federalism, but substantial heterogeneity: politically and ethnically intolerant respondents respond strongly to devolving state power. We further find security policy is the primary concern in debates over devolution, followed by cultural policies. Our findings highlight the importance of micro-level perspectives in understanding the stability of ethnofederal systems and the political consequences of their reform.",

While citizen crowdsourcing is often seen as a cost-effective alternative to traditional monitoring, we argue that monitors offer unique advantages through their training and insulation from local pressures. Our field experiment during Côte d’Ivoire’s 2020 presidential election assessed whether monitors enhance election violence documentation when used alongside citizen reporting. We found that the presence of a monitor increased the likelihood of violence being reported by 10.7 percentage points without affecting citizen behavior. Monitors with more geographic experience were more likely to report incidents, regardless of their proximity to their home communities. These findings highlight the importance of monitors in revealing latent violence and in enhancing the scope and depth of reports. This demonstrates the critical value of monitors, even as crowdsourced data become more prevalent.",

This “superiority-credibility” thesis has long been supported by scholars and policymakers, but surprisingly little attention has been paid to testing this idea empirically. This paper tests the thesis using conflict initiation data from the superpower-led alliances during the Cold War. My statistical analyses find that there is no evidence that the degree of a superpower patron's military nuclear advantages vis-à-vis another nuclear-armed superpower significantly reduces the likelihood that the patron's allies become targets of militarized disputes. This finding holds across multiple model specifications and a wide range of measures of the balance of nuclear forces. This paper contributes to theoretical debates on the role of the nuclear balance in interactions between nuclear-armed states and policy debates on the size of the American nuclear arsenal in the coming era of deterring 2 nuclear-armed peers.",

          "abstract": "Human sex ratios at birth (SRBs) shape population composition and are closely linked to maternal health and gender discrimination. In the context of environmental change, SRBs may theoretically be skewed by physiological or behavioral responses to exposure to extreme heat. However, evidence for this is limited. In this study, we estimate the effect of prenatal exposure to temperature on birth sex by linking survey data on 5 million live births in 33 sub-Saharan African countries and India with high-resolution temperature data. To distinguish between spontaneous and induced abortions, we exploit sociodemographic differentials, exposure timing, and regional differences in son preference. We find that days with a maximum temperature above 20 °C are negatively associated with male births in both regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, we observe fewer male births after high first-trimester temperature exposure, consistent with increased spontaneous abortions from maternal heat stress. This is particularly true for births by mothers in rural areas, with little formal education, and for higher birth orders. By contrast, in India, we find that second-trimester temperature exposure is associated with fewer male births, consistent with reductions in induced sex-selective abortions. As expected, these reductions are concentrated in high birth orders and older mothers. We also find large reductions in male births by sonless mothers in northern Indian states, where son preference is greater. These findings demonstrate that heat exposure harms maternal health, increases prenatal mortality, and influences family planning behavior, leading to a complex effect on SRBs.",

          "abstract": "The presence of high levels of PM 2.5 pollution is a major health threat in India. We evaluate the benefits of reducing ambient PM 2.5 and household air pollution from a 2019 baseline, when over 70% of the population of India was exposed to annual average PM 2.5 of more than 40 μg/m 3 and 56% of households burned solid fuels for cooking. We estimate the health benefits from reduced mortality that arise when lowering ambient PM 2.5 to the India standard (40 μg/m 3 ) and to two World Health Organization (WHO) interim standards (25 μg/m 3 and 15 μg/m 3 ). The benefits of the ambient standards are moderated by the high levels of household air pollution to which people are exposed due to the concavity of the exposure–response function. We therefore examine the benefits of achieving each standard paired with a 50% reduction in the percentage of households burning solid fuels. Annual mortality reductions from the combined policies exceed 300,000 lives saved for the India standard, 500,000 lives saved for the WHO 25 μg/m 3 interim standard, and 675,000 lives saved for the WHO 15 μg/m 3 interim standard. The economic benefits of each of these joint policies equal 2.2%, 3.6%, and 4.9% of Indian gross domestic product (GDP), using a Value per Statistical Life of 100 times per capita GDP. Results underscore the importance of considering household air pollution when evaluating ambient standards and the synergistic benefits of combined policies when the exposure–response function is concave.",

          "abstract": "Negative social ties, or “hasslers,” are pervasive yet understudied components of social networks that may accelerate biological aging and morbidity. Using ego-centric network data and DNA methylation-based biological aging clocks (i.e., DunedinPACE and age-accelerated GrimAge2) from saliva from a state representative probability sample in Indiana, we examine how negative social ties are associated with accelerated biological aging and a broad range of health outcomes, including inflammation and multimorbidity. Negative relationships are not rare within close relationships, as nearly 30% of individuals report having at least one hassler in their network. These hasslers tend to occupy peripheral network positions and are more likely to be connected through weak, uniplex ties. Importantly, exposure to negative social ties follows patterns of social and health vulnerability, with women, daily smokers, people in poorer health, and those with adverse childhood experiences more likely to report having hasslers in their networks. Having more hasslers is associated with accelerated biological aging in both rate and cumulative burden: Each additional hassler corresponds to approximately 1.5% faster pace of aging and roughly 9 mo older biological age. Moreover, not all hasslers exert the same influence; kin and nonkin hasslers show detrimental associations, whereas spouse hasslers do not. Finally, a greater number of hasslers is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes beyond epigenetic aging. These findings together highlight the critical role of negative social ties in biological aging as chronic stressors and the need for interventions that reduce harmful social exposures to promote healthier aging trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy promotes important psychological outcomes. Although cooperation and competition are the building blocks of social interactions, little is known about how they shape feelings of autonomy in dyads, teams, and work organizations. We hypothesize that cooperation liberates relative to competition and situations that are neither cooperative nor competitive. We theorize that this effect emerges because cooperation facilitates social support and psychological safety, whereas competition promotes social threat and stress. We found support for this hypothesis in nine studies ( N total = 16,669) that used survey, archival, and experimental methods, diverse samples, and different operationalizations of cooperative and competitive environments, as well as two kinds of environments that are neither cooperative nor competitive (i.e., independence and unknown interdependence). Studies 1 to 3 found that perceived situational cooperation correlated positively with feelings of autonomy among varsity athletes and employees. Study 3 also provided initial evidence for the proposed mechanisms. To provide causal evidence, Study 4 used an incentivized decision-making task in which we experimentally created cooperative, competitive, and independent situations. Participants felt greater autonomy under cooperative vs. competitive and independent incentive structures. Study 5 found evidence for our hypothesized mechanisms in an experiment conducted in the context of negotiation. Four supplemental studies replicated our experimental findings, extended them to another incentivized decision-making task, and established the causal effect of social threat and stress on autonomy. Overall, our findings underscore the liberating effects of cooperative situations relative to competitive situations and situations that are neither cooperative nor competitive, with consequences for people’s feelings, motivation, and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Pluralistic ignorance—the systematic misperception of others’ attitudes—can entrench suboptimal norms, yet its dynamics remain poorly understood. We develop a mathematical model of the coevolution of actions, private attitudes, and beliefs about others, with societal tightness as a central parameter. Our framework integrates theories of spirals of silence, preference falsification, and cultural mismatch into a single dynamic system capturing the effects of material payoffs, cognitive forces, and social influence. The model shows that pluralistic ignorance can arise from lags between attitude change and belief updating, even without silence or deception. Dynamics unfold faster in loose cultures and slower in tight ones: loose societies display sharp but transient peaks of pluralistic ignorance, while tight societies sustain slower, persistent mismatches. Both can experience cultural evolutionary mismatch but through distinct pathways—internalized norm adherence in loose cultures vs. conformity pressure in tight ones. These mechanisms may help explain global patterns where private support exceeds perceived support, such as climate action, women’s rights, and abortion attitudes. Interventions must therefore be culturally tailored: accelerating attitude change through highlighting benefits is effective in loose cultures, whereas lowering expression costs (via anonymity or legal protections) empowers norm entrepreneurs in tight cultures. Our framework identifies policy levers and clarifies when apparent opinion stability conceals underlying shifts, offering insights for democratic societies navigating rapid social change.",

          "abstract": "Pedestrian routing choices play a crucial role in shaping collective crowd dynamics, yet the influence of interactions among unfamiliar individuals remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.",

          "abstract": "Democratic backsliding raises new challenges for bureaucracies as politicians undermine democratic institutions and the rule of law. Although bureaucracies can play a central safeguarding role, little is known about the organizational conditions that foster resistance to undemocratic pressure. This study tests whether organizational networks (peers and professional associations) and resources (expertise and voice mechanisms) influence bureaucrats' willingness to oppose undemocratic demands from political superiors. Drawing on a preregistered conjoint survey experiment with Brazilian bureaucrats ( N = 2481; 14,886 evaluations), we find that support from peers, professional associations, and credible voice channels increases open resistance, whereas peer disagreement reduces silent resistance. This study is among the first large‐scale survey experiments to manipulate organizational attributes in democratic backsliding. We advance scholarship by developing a meso‐level organizational framework that connects networks and resources to micro‐level resistance, bridging research on democratic backsliding and behavioral public administration, and providing practical guidance for strengthening democratic guardianship in organizations.",

Our review of the state of the discipline suggests that a core strength of British Public Administration has been the complementarity between scholarship and practice, responding to existential threats. We analyze changing relationships between the discipline and practice in British public administration over three eras: Applied, fragmented, and impactful. The applied era saw mutual exchange, but a lack of criticality. The fragmented era was one of a retreat to over‐specialization and identity crises. The impactful era has tried to revivify synergies but has struggled for coherence and criticality. Looking to the future, the nascent sub‐field of Positive Public Administration is identified as providing an opportunity to radically redefine the scientific quality and social relevance of the discipline due to the way it blends constructive engagement with independent criticality.",

          "abstract": "While public administration research has made important strides in understanding social capital, less is known about how its effects vary across populations and contexts. This study investigates how racial segregation and citizen ideology shape the relationship between community social capital and flu vaccination rates among White and Black Medicare beneficiaries. Findings reveal that although social capital is associated with higher vaccination rates, its benefits are unequally realized, favoring Whites over Blacks. Racial segregation weakens the positive effect of social capital for Blacks and exacerbates health disparities. Liberal ideology amplifies the influence of social capital on vaccination rates for Whites, but this amplifying role is not statistically significant for Blacks or the racial gap. The results highlight the need for scholars to incorporate social equity more explicitly into social capital research, to measure group‐specific social capital, and to account for the structural and cultural contexts that condition its effects.",

          "abstract": "Institutional quality in Africa has evolved over the last two decades, fuelling an extremely fertile literature. In this article, we examine the effects of democracy and regime sustainability on inclusive growth. Based on a sample of 48 African countries, we specify and estimate a panel data model by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the Driscoll–Kraay method, whose robustness is confirmed via the Lewbel 2SLS method, and a dynamic panel data model proved by the System Generalized Method of Moments (S‐GMM) over the period 1995–2020. Our results show that democracy and regime sustainability significantly and statistically improve inclusive growth in Africa. The robustness of these results is confirmed by taking into account governance indicators and the homogenization of resource‐poor countries. However, regime sustainability and democracy significantly reduce inclusive growth in resource‐rich countries. Plausible explanations for the contradictory results lie in the curse of natural resources and the rentier behavior of certain political leaders, which complicate the structural transformation of natural endowments. We suggest an institutional optimisation by consolidating the institutional environment through the establishment of economic and political rules.",

          "abstract": "Mandated networks, as a distinct form of collaborative governance, have received increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Yet their effectiveness remains debated, and the mechanisms through which mandates shape interorganizational collaboration in crisis response are not well understood. Drawing on institutional and network perspectives, this article examines the direct and indirect effects of mandates on collaborative tie formation during crises. Using social network analysis of collaborative ties among 424 organizations—including members of 62 legally mandated safety and disaster committees—during the 2015 epidemic in South Korea, the study shows that both direct bureaucratic and network‐mediated mechanisms shaped these ties, with indirect effects predominating. It reveals how relational dynamics at the dyadic and group levels mediated collaborative ties, accounting for sequential and feedback effects between levels and comparing these effects in mandated versus voluntary ties. The findings highlight mandated networks' potential as institutional arrangements for preserving governance stability under turbulent conditions.",

Yet understanding what and how some innovation projects survive and thrive in a competitive landscape—or public sector innovation—is often challenging. The challenges not only rest in the invisibility of the features of an innovation to human eyes but also in the lack of their accessibility for analysis. This study showcases a methodological framework using a generative pre‐trained transformer (GPT) for scale development and synthetic data generation to measure, predict, retrodict, and calibrate innovation outcomes using real‐world and synthetic data and a human‐in‐the‐loop process. This study demonstrates the epistemic gains of the framework in predicting and manipulating competitive texts to simulate the past, present, and possibly the future. The approach offers avenues for future research on a wide range of competitive phenomena using large‐scale text analysis across the social sciences.",

The Capitol insurrection of January 6, 2021—and the widespread sympathy for it that endures among Republican citizens and elected officials—can be understood as an unprecedented denial of that Consent. We hypothesize that insurrectionist sympathies among 2020 election losers are structured in part by hypercompetitiveness—a psychological need to win at all costs. Using original survey data collected in the spring of 2022, we find strong suggestive support for our hypothesis. Many of the Americans who fail to condemn the Capitol riot may not be simply knee-jerk partisans, well-intentioned victims of propaganda, or sycophants in thrall to a would-be authoritarian leader. Substantiating the anxieties of many observers, those people may instead be unwilling to abide by democratic rules if it means they have to lose.",

          "abstract": "This paper estimates that the macroeconomic damages from climate change are an order of magnitude larger than previously thought. Exploiting natural global temperature variability, we find that 1○C warming reduces world GDP by over 20% in the long run. Global temperature correlates strongly with extreme climatic events, unlike country-level temperature used in previous work, explaining our larger estimate. We use this evidence to estimate damage functions in a neoclassical growth model. Business-as-usual warming implies a present welfare loss of more than 30%, and a Social Cost of Carbon in excess of $1,200 per ton. These impacts suggest that unilateral decarbonization policy is cost-effective for large countries such as the United States.",

In our empirical analysis, we field surveys with more than 10,000 US households and 100 academic experts, measure economic narratives in open-ended questions, and represent them as Directed Acyclic Graphs. Households’ narratives are strongly heterogeneous, coarser than experts’ narratives, focus more on the supply than the demand side, and often feature politically charged explanations. Moreover, narratives shape how households form inflation expectations and interpret new information, which we demonstrate in a series of experiments. Informed by these findings, our theoretical analysis incorporates narratives into an otherwise conventional New Keynesian model and demonstrates their importance for aggregate outcomes through their effect on agents’ expectations.",

In this paper, I introduce and analyze a generalization of Bayes' rule—Coarse Bayesian updating—accommodating much of the empirical evidence. I characterize the model axiomatically, show how it generates several well-known biases, and derive its main implications in static and dynamic settings. Each axiom expresses a property of Bayes' rule but, conditional on the others, stops just short of making the agent fully Bayesian. The model employs standard primitives, making it suitable for applications; I demonstrate this by applying it to a standard setting of decision under risk, leading to a close relationship with the Blackwell information ordering and comparative measures of cognitive sophistication and bias.",

By deviating from the standard approach of estimating MPC heterogeneity using interactions with observables, we can recover the full distribution of MPCs. We find households spent between 4 and 133% of the rebate within a quarter, and individual households used rebates for different goods. While many observable characteristics correlate individually with our estimated MPCs, most of these relationships disappear when tested jointly. Notable exceptions are income and the average propensity to consume, which correlate positively with the MPC. Household observable characteristics explain only 8% of MPC variation, highlighting the role of latent heterogeneity.",

We uniquely characterize the minimax-regret optimal rule that least frequently randomizes, and show that, in some cases, it can outperform other minimax-regret optimal rules in terms of what we term profiled regret. We analyze the implications of our results in the aggregation of experimental estimates for policy adoption, extrapolation of Local Average Treatment Effects, and policy making in the presence of omitted variable bias.",

Drawing on forty-three in-depth interviews, I show that officers actively seek out elements of applicants’ claims that elicit intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance. This investment not only reinforces their self-image as morally committed professionals—distinguished from colleagues perceived as disengaged—but also reorients their professional mission around intentional, affectively engaged adjudication. Crucially, officers come to treat their aspirational mode of interaction as a moral lens through which they evaluate claims, granting greater worth to those that provoke the desired emotional response—often irrespective of applicants’ demographic characteristics or the formal merits of their cases. This analysis advances sociological theorizing on how aspirations, affect, and morality interact to shape frontline organizational practice.",

Drawing on social closure theory, we analyze how class origin contributes to between-occupation earnings disparities and class origin earnings inequality at the individual level. Using fine-grained data on the class origins of occupational incumbents, we construct a robust indicator of the concentration of privileged class origins within labor market niches, “occupational elitism,” measured as the percentage of incumbents with parents in the higher salariat (ESeC class 1) within an occupation. Our results reveal that occupational elitism of micro-occupations is positively associated with earnings, after accounting for indicators of positional closure mechanisms, such as educational credentialing, licensure, and unionization. However, these collective earnings premiums are unevenly distributed, with earnings advantages for individuals from upper-class families emerging in occupations with higher levels of occupational elitism.",

          "abstract": "Siblings do not always benefit equally from parental wealth transfers. This study examines how different asset types evoke distinct distributive principles, thereby contributing to our understanding of unequal intergenerational transfers within families. Based on a multifactorial survey experiment in Germany (N = 11,968 observations based on 2,992 respondents), we test whether the application of three distributive principles (equality, entitlement, dynastic succession) varies across three distinct asset types (cash, housing, and business). We deliberately oversampled substantial wealth owners to highlight differences in attitudes toward wealth transfers between those at the top of the wealth distribution and a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 40 and older. In line with previous research, equality emerges as the dominant principle for all asset types. Siblings’ gender and birth order do not consistently affect evaluations of unequal transfers. However, the wealthy are less likely to endorse equality if one child is older or seems better positioned to maintain the family business than their sibling. Our findings suggest that the wealthy legitimize unequal transfers based on concerns for continuous wealth accumulation and the perpetuation of key economic assets across generations.",

          "authors": "Kathryn Christine Beck, Julia Hellstrand, Mikko Myrskylä",
          "abstract": "Period fertility has declined rapidly in Norway in the 2010s, reaching record lows. Although there is a clear education‒fertility dynamic, significant educational shifts have occurred and it is unclear how much this contributed to recent fertility declines. To disentangle this, we utilize high-quality Norwegian register data and model yearly transitions between educational enrollment, educational attainment, and childbearing for men and women born in 1964‒2006. Using a counterfactual simulation approach, we explore the contribution of educational expansion versus lower fertility within educational groups to the decline in period and cohort fertility. Forecasting is used to complete fertility for cohorts aged 30+. We found that educational expansion contributed partially to the observed cohort fertility decline (2.11 to 1.98 children) for 1964‒1978 female cohorts but stagnated for younger cohorts. The predicted decline thereafter (to 1.59 children by the 1992 cohort), as well as the 2010s period fertility decline, was fully driven by decreased fertility across educational levels. For men, educational expansion was slower and did not contribute to fertility decline. For both genders, the contribution of changed fertility behavior was strongest among the low and medium educated, particularly for predicted ultimate childlessness. Our results suggest that increased education is not the main fertility barrier in contemporary Norway. Instead, falling birth rates, particularly among lower educated groups, are driving the fertility decline for both genders.",

Our strategy relies on restricted-use data linking respondents of the Current Population Survey to Social Security records. A successful match with Social Security records, along with survey information, is used as evidence that an immigrant is authorized. Using a successful match with Social Security records allows us to rule out as being unauthorized half of all individuals otherwise classified as unauthorized. Our results indicate that unauthorized immigrant men have significantly lower earnings than authorized immigrant men over the first 15 years since arrival. However, despite facing additional obstacles, immigrants without work authorization make the same amount of progress in catching up with the earnings of native Whites. Unauthorized immigrant women have similar earnings as women with work authorization for much of their careers. Overall, we find a pattern of persistent inequality whereby both authorized and unauthorized Hispanic immigrants make modest progress catching up with natives’ earnings. We test alternative explanations for the observed pattern in earnings trajectories and find that the occupation and industry in which immigrants are employed, along with the number of hours worked, appear to explain a large part of the disparity relative to native Whites.",

          "abstract": "Across Europe, the extension of working lives has been a central policy goal for more than three decades. Working life expectancy (WLE) and working years lost (WYL) are well-suited demographic indicators for assessing a country's progress toward achieving this goal. This article reviews all previous estimates of WLE and WYL for European countries and then uses the largest available micro-level dataset to estimate and project WLE and WYL for cohorts of men and women aged 55–64 and 65–74 in 21 European countries. The findings indicate that WLE has generally increased, most rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe and in Western Europe. Northern European countries reach the highest levels of WLE. However, country and gender differences remain large, especially when WLE is adjusted for working hours. Correlational analyses suggest that higher WLE has been gained primarily from successive birth cohorts losing fewer working years to retirement. Over the coming years, the remaining WYL to retirement and to inactivity among women will constitute the main barriers to the extension of working lives in Europe.",

We simulated the prevalence of cognitive impairment under different assumptions about the prevalence of such impairment in the Mortality Cohort. We constructed a random forest classification model to predict cognitive impairment in the Mortality Cohort and compared it with observed estimates in the HAALSI Cohort. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was sensitive to assumptions about the prevalence in the Mortality Cohort. The predictive model revealed meaningfully higher predicted probability of cognitive impairment in a counterfactual scenario with no prebaseline deaths. Researchers should consider prebaseline mortality in the interpretation of prevalence estimates, especially when the magnitude of prebaseline deaths is likely large.",

          "abstract": "This paper lays some groundwork for a critical theory of trust. It challenges widespread assumptions in trust research according to which “thick” forms of trust emerge in socially and culturally homogeneous communities, which regard trust and conflict as opposing terms, or that view trust generally as a value. The paper suggests a distinction between a general, non-normative concept and various normative conceptions of trust, depending on context. With regard to the justification of trust, a distinction between particular and full justification is introduced, and the justification of trust is linked to relations of justification between trusters and trusted. Finally, it argues that trust in conflicts emerges where such relations exist among the parties of a conflict.",

          "authors": "Emanuela Ceva, Patrizia Pedrini",
          "abstract": "Conceptual change is commonplace in political theory. Recent scholarship argues that improving a concept, or “engineering” it, can sharpen its normative and explanatory power. This article illustrates what political theory can learn from conceptual engineering (CE) by examining the evolution of “corruption” as a case study. Traditionally defined as the “use of entrusted power for private gain,” corruption has been revisited to capture broader institutional dysfunctions. We show how the recent re‐engineering of corruption as a “deficit of office accountability” enhances the concept's ability to capture uses of office power that may undercut institutional functioning beyond illegal acts, including individual wrongdoing and faulty institutional design. Re‐engineering corruption has normative value insofar as it helps policymakers and scholars alike to identify and address questionable uses of office power—including in nondemocratic regimes and nonpublic organizations. The article thereby argues that CE can enhance political theory's methodological toolkit and corroborate its practical relevance.",

          "abstract": "Many dictatorships end up with a series of disastrous decisions such as Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union or Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait. Even if a certain policy choice is not ultimately fatal for the regime, such as Mao's Big Leap Forward or the Pol Pot's collectivization drive, they typically involve both a miscalculation by the leadership and an institutional environment in which better informed subordinates have no chance to prevent the decision from being implemented. We offer a dynamic model of nondemocratic politics in which repression and bad decision making are self‐reinforcing. Repression reduces the immediate threat to the regime, yet raises future stakes for the dictator; with higher stakes, the dictator puts more emphasis on loyalty than competence, which in turn increases the probability of a wrong policy choice. Our theory offers an explanation of how rational dictators end up in an informational bubble even in highly institutionalized regimes.",

We explore this question through the case of abortion, using a large‐scale panel dataset ( n ≈ 130,000) and applying three key diagnostics: coherence, stability, and changes in vote choice. First, we demonstrate that abortion policy preferences exhibit logical coherence, both within and across reasons for seeking an abortion. Second, we show that these preferences are highly stable over time–more so than personality traits–suggesting that abortion attitudes are deeply engrained rather than fleeting opinions. Lastly, we find that abortion policy preferences, measured before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, predict shifts in intended voting behavior between 2020 and 2024. This overall pattern helps rule out key theoretical alternatives, such as non‐opinions, attitudes following vote choice, and elite cues. Additionally, these findings highlight the significant and independent role of abortion attitudes in shaping American political behavior.",

          "abstract": "An emerging literature suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) can greatly enhance autocrats' repressive capabilities. This paper argues that while AI presents a powerful new tool for authoritarian control, its effectiveness is constrained by the very repressive institutions it is designed to serve. This constraint stems from what I term the “authoritarian data problem”: citizens' strategic behavior under repression diminishes the amount of useful information in the data for training AI. The more repression there is, the less information exists in AI's training data, and the worse the AI performs. I illustrate this argument using an AI experiment and censorship data in China. I show that AI's accuracy in censorship decreases with increasing repression, especially during times of political crisis. I further show that this problem cannot be easily fixed with more data. Ironically, international data—especially data from less repressive settings—can help improve AI's ability to censor.",

          "authors": "Laurent H. Wang, Lindsay B. Miller, Miriam J. Metzger, Robin L. Nabi",
          "abstract": "Can discrete emotions be leveraged to combat privacy powerlessness and motivate privacy protection? Extending theorizing and research that exclusively focus on cognitive processes underlying online privacy decision-making, this study builds on gain/loss framing research and the emotions-as-frames model to understand the effectiveness of emotional appeals (i.e., hope and fear) in generating attitudinal and behavioral change in online privacy. Two online experiments that differed in message topics (Study 1: changing social media privacy settings; Study 2: rejecting website cookies) were conducted with demographically-stratified samples of U.S. adults. Results showed that gain-frame-induced hope consistently led to reduced privacy powerlessness, which was associated with increased privacy protection intention across both topics, whereas loss-frame-induced fear only led to increased protection intention in the social media context. This study advances theorizing on the role that discrete emotion plays in online privacy management from a communication perspective and highlights the novel effect of hope in motivating attitudinal and behavioral change. Findings also help to answer recent calls for remedies to privacy powerlessness and inform message-based intervention designs for consumer empowerment.",

          "abstract": "Getting restful sleep is essential to people's academic achievement, cognitive functioning, life satisfaction, mental and physical health, pro‐sociality, and vigilance. Our study translates these insights for political science by examining the relationship of sleep quality with turnout and non‐electoral participation across multiple countries in four major datasets. Using a multilevel approach, we find that getting good sleep is strongly linked with a higher likelihood of turnout. Conversely, we observe that poor sleep quality motivates greater non‐electoral political participation. Additional analyses indicate that the previously documented curvilinear relationship between sleep duration and turnout emerges primarily among those with poor sleep quality, while duration shows no association with turnout among well‐rested individuals, suggesting duration may serve a compensatory function when quality is compromised. We also find that these results are robust to asynchronous timing between sleep quality and civic participation measures. We argue that creating societies where high‐quality sleep is accessible to the public is vital to the sustainability of democratic regimes.",

          "authors": "Dimiter Toshkov, Honorata Mazepus",
          "abstract": "Causal judgments are ubiquitous in politics and crucial for assigning responsibility and blame. Cognitive science has demonstrated that people are more likely to pick factors as “causal” when they make a difference for the outcome across a range of counterfactual scenarios, with the scenarios sampled based on statistical and prescriptive normality. We propose that this makes causal judgments susceptible to motivated reasoning and ingroup favoritism in particular. We hypothesize that people will be less likely to assign causal efficacy and responsibility for counternormative outcomes to groups they support, and that the bias will be greater for more complex causal structures. We test these propositions in two pre‐registered survey experiments run on representative samples in Poland. The context of the experimental vignettes is a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We find that, in all scenarios, respondents assign significantly higher causal power and responsibility to the attackers when the attackers are Russian rather than Ukrainian, consistent with our theory and the very high levels of public support for Ukraine in Poland. Contrary to our expectations, the responsibility of the attackers is not significantly lower when they hit a public building as a result of defending combatants moving there rather than when unprovoked.",

          "abstract": "This research examined whether state‐level collective narcissism, a belief that one's state is exceptional and entitled to special treatment, predicts support for policies that prioritize state independence even if they harm fellow residents. Three pre‐registered studies focused on controversies around the independent power grid in Texas, which has been linked to major power shortages in the state. In Study 1 ( N = 223), Texan collective narcissism was strongly linked to support for energy isolationism. Study 2 ( N = 217) replicated this finding, even when costs were emphasized, but the effect was weaker for those who supported the state Governor. In Study 3 ( N = 543), emphasizing personal costs of energy isolationism reduced support for grid independence among those high in collective narcissism. This finding suggests that self‐related motives might be behind the appeal of isolationist policies for those high in collective narcissism. The effects we observed were similar even when adjusting for political beliefs and regional identification (Studies 1–3), national narcissism and identification (Study 2), as well as individual narcissism and self‐esteem (Study 3). These studies highlight the role of narcissistic regional identity in policy preferences.",

Yet, we know very little about the ‘new’ third generation—that is, the grandchildren of immigrants who immigrated in the postwar era to Europe. Here, we rely on new, large-scale French data providing a unique opportunity to study the socioeconomic attainment of third-generation individuals in adulthood compared with the second generation and French natives. We jointly analyze educational and labor market attainment using five indicators at both the top and bottom of the distributions, leading to a comprehensive understanding of immigrant incorporation across generations. We report three major results. First, we find a master trend across groups and outcomes reflecting parity with natives, often already achieved at the second generation. Second, third-generation attainment is moderated by gender and national origins: we document lasting educational disadvantages for North African, third-generation males, while Southern Europeans are more likely to experience economic incorporation within the lower class. Third, mixed ancestry ceases to positively predict socioeconomic attainment by the third generation. These results have important implications for ongoing scholarly discussion of immigrant incorporation in France and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Compensatory policies for the losers of trade are a key feature of the liberal economic order established after the Second World War. Legislators have a variety of policy options to choose. But do political elites and the public have the same attitudes toward compensatory policies? We expect an elite–public gap with the public relatively less supportive of spending policies and more supportive of tax cuts and trade restrictions than political elites. Moreover, we reason that ideology should matter more for elites than the public. Unique data from a survey with legislators in 19 European countries and public opinion surveys in three countries allow us to test this argument. We find that elites and the public indeed differ in their attitudes toward compensatory policies. However, these differences pale in comparison to variation in support for various compensatory policies. These findings shed light on the politics of compensation and on the political attitudes of elites and the public more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that increased participation of women in parliaments benefits climate change outcomes. Yet, the actions taken by women parliamentarians to shape these outcomes have not been identified in the literature. I assert that a primary step by which women may generate impact is by championing environmentalism in their speeches before parliament. To test this, I analyse speeches from the UK House of Commons from 2010 to 2021, and find that women MPs both speak proportionately more about the environment than their male counterparts, and bring environmentalism into debates that are not explicitly coded as environmental. Finally, while Conservative women are outnumbered by men, they contribute significantly more to environmental speeches than their male counterparts. These results suggest that women are disproportionately responsible for embedding environmentalism into political discussions across Parliament and the Conservative Party, and prompt questions around the true cost of unequal representation for our climate.",

          "abstract": "Peaceful transfers of power are a fundamental principle of democracy. Yet, in times of heightened affective polarisation, election losses may trigger strong negative emotional reactions in partisans, which in turn undermine support for fundamental democratic principles among partisans. We test this idea through two pre-registered survey experiments conducted after the 2022 and 2024 elections in the United States. We randomly assign partisans to receive either a placebo or an emotive reminder about the election that their party lost, containing others’ angry or worried reactions at the election outcome. Contrary to our pre-registered expectations, we do not find evidence that priming negative feelings about electoral loss affects support for political violence or democratic norms. Emotive reminders about salient political events can momentarily turn up the heat on politics, but are not enough to propel partisans to adopt extreme anti-democratic attitudes. By linking the study of emotions to democratic norms, this article contributes to our understanding of when negative emotions (fail to) radicalise partisans.",

          "abstract": "This is a study of how opposing cultural values influence support for minorities’ civil liberties. We build on a rich body of work, which establishes that culturally liberal Europeans are more likely to value diversity and favor minority rights than are cultural conservatives. Our contribution is to bring attention to how a second dimension of value conflict upends this established pattern. If a religious minority, in this case Muslims, wants to use their religious freedom to call on Muslims to adhere to conservative Islamic values – to preach them – support for their civil liberties plunges. We report substantively large and remarkably consistent results from seven classical tolerance experiments conducted in three European countries. In each trial, we observe the tendency of non-Muslims to deny Muslims their right to freedom of religion. We consistently observe that culturally liberal citizens join cultural conservatives in turning against Muslims’ right to hold a public rally when Muslims intend to exercise their right to freedom of expression to preach (the speech-act dimension) culturally conservative ideas in Islam ( the substantive dimension ). Preaching is a performative utterance, an instance of when saying something is doing something. What is being done, in addition to what is being said, is to call for compliance. This study finds that conflicts with religiously grounded values in contemporary European liberal democracies often have an additional order of intensity, because stating religious beliefs in the form of performative utterances is an integral part of religious practice.",

          "abstract": "Multiple rounds of European Union (EU) enlargement and the rise of the populist radical right have affected the organisation of political competition in the European Parliament (EP). This study probes how the EU’s efforts to redress democratic backsliding in several EU member states crystallise deepening divides between European lawmakers. Our empirical analysis examines 17 roll-call votes on rule of law issues and well over 900 discursive statements from corresponding parliamentary debates held between 2009 and 2019. Our unique approach enables us to analyse discursive and voting patterns both separately and jointly to understand how they affect each other. We find that behaviour across these different arenas is generally consistent and aligns with an ideological divide that pits Eurosceptic Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) against representatives from pro-EU European party groups. Once we account for ideological orientations and strategic motivations, the often-claimed East–West divide on rule of law issues becomes much less salient, emerging primarily under specific conditions of ongoing democratic erosion and national incumbency in Central and Eastern Europe. Our findings speak to the literature on EU responses to democratic backsliding as well as to the changing dynamics of political competition in the EU more broadly.",

Recent crises—such as COVID-19, the Great Recession, and environmental disasters—expose limitations of the standard social science toolkit for studying poverty and offer lessons for improving poverty and policy research. Regarding measurement, evidence suggests that the intrayear volatility of incomes and blurred boundaries between resource-sharing units deserve greater focus in poverty measurement debates. Regarding consequences, research emphasizes the need to quantify poverty's distinct roles as a risk factor versus stratifying feature during crises. Regarding sources, evidence from recent crises offer direct tests of competing theories of poverty and offer clear lessons for policy strategies to reduce poverty. I conclude that sociologists’ conceptual toolkit is uniquely well-suited to capture the multifaceted nature of poverty; the discipline should more forcefully incorporate its principles into a renewed study of poverty and public policy.",

However, direct measures of legislator contact by members of the public are elusive. This study leverages a unique data source to evaluate partisan and ideological bias in public outreach: witness slips in the Illinois General Assembly, online forms individuals can use to support or oppose specific pieces of legislation. Using these expressed positions, we document two key facts. First, witnesses are significantly more supportive of Republican‐sponsored legislation than Democratic‐sponsored legislation. Second, after estimating ideal points for witnesses, we find witnesses are ideologically closer to Illinois Republicans than Democrats. Additional analyses reveal important ideological heterogeneity by policy jurisdiction and interest group affiliation. Together, the results support one theoretical explanation of why legislators systematically mischaracterize public opinion: the views they are exposed to differ significantly from those of the general public.",

The proposed model considers the emergence process in three stages: (1) the arrival of distinctive clusters of objects and their producer, (2) conceptualization of the labeled clusters in high-energy social structures that we call a “scene,” and (3) whether a scene’s coordinating concept becomes generally taken for granted. We first develop an ontology for analyzing these processes. We then analyze the role of social structure in these stages and define the emergence process in terms of hazards, that is, the event rates of each stage. The proposed account can explain the emergence of worlds in a variety of social contexts, including organizational forms in markets, genres in creative industries, disciplines in science, and forms of social protest.",

This article presents a pilot project in an undergraduate political science methods course at the University of Toronto Mississauga designed to familiarize and engage students with digital archival research in an entertaining way. In collaboration with the campus library, students were invited to imagine themselves as rookie detectives and investigate a “cold case” of a potential Unidentified Flying Object encounter in Canada during the Cold War. They explored a digital archive curated explicitly for this purpose and made available in the course’s online learning-management system, with related documents and photographs accessible from the Library and Archives Canada; visited the library that presented archival research; and answered questions relevant to the case. Results from a subsequent participants’ self-assessing survey indicate that this assignment was beneficial in enhancing student comprehension of archival research. This suggests that such innovative pedagogical activities can render topics like methods more appealing and learning about them more enjoyable.",

Qualitative methods have an important role in both the discipline and the professional development of students but do not occupy a commensurate space in research pedagogy.

We identify four common themes in the four symposium contributions: (1) the importance of including the ethical and epistemological foundations of qualitative work; (2) the possibilities of teaching qualitative methods across the entire research cycle; (3) the importance of carefully structuring and designing active and experiential learning in research pedagogy; and (4) the unique opportunities of moving beyond the classroom in teaching qualitative research.",

          "abstract": "Instructors must balance advancing student knowledge and fostering civic abilities as dual objectives of political science education. Combining these objectives has informed various approaches in course design that often follow the idea of learning by doing, with a strong emphasis on the doing. This article presents a pedagogical frame—“community-based learning as research methods learning”—that focuses on the learning side of learning by doing and centers research instruction. It suggests that community-based learning must come before community-based research and that research methods learning must come before carrying out research tasks. The article invites those who aim to address the dual objectives of political science education in their course design to do so with a methods-learning mindset rather than solely with a research-output trajectory.",

          "abstract": "Interviewing is a widely used method in political science. Nevertheless, the emphasis on teaching quantitative methods means that proper training for interviewing is lacking at the undergraduate level. In this article we provide tools for instructors to better prepare students to conduct interviews as a research method. Anchoring our discussion on developing good and ethically sound interview questions, we introduce a rubric to assess question development and explore best practices in developing interview questions in three courses in educational institutions with distinct characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Epistemological positioning is foundational to any analysis, yet pluralist epistemologies are taught unevenly in political science methods courses. This article draws attention to this crucial foundation and suggests that a basic grounding in positivist and interpretivist research paradigms would give students conceptual tools to adjudicate between competing claims and contradictory evidence in the empirical world—even as it would highlight comparative advantages of different approaches to knowledge production. Using an optical illusion as a heuristic guide, the article proposes a practical classroom exercise to illustrate the central differences between positivist and interpretivist approaches to political science and to elucidate how these differences play out in research design and inquiry.",

          "abstract": "Administrative burdens can deter individuals from engaging with government programs before they ever encounter formal application requirements. Drawing on the administrative burden framework and theories of heuristic decision-making, this study examines how prospective applicants form early judgments about program accessibility when presented with varying levels of compliance costs. Using three survey experiments centered on a fictional grocery benefit (N = 2407, N = 965) and a one-time federal tax rebate (N = 1004), we assess how documentation requirements and effort cues shape perceptions of eligibility, willingness to apply, and perceived accessibility. We find that greater documentation requirements or mismatched time cues lowered perceived eligibility and willingness to apply. Yet asking respondents to pause and estimate the effort reversed those effects, but only for individuals who already possessed the documentation or could form a concrete time estimate about the effort. These findings highlight the role of expected burden and heuristic judgments in shaping pre-application decisions, extending administrative burden research beyond realized experiences to the earliest stages of program engagement.",

          "authors": "Jinfeng Zhang, Minjie Song, Zengqiang Qin, Ran Xu, Rong Ran",
          "abstract": "Public officials are traditionally thought to be more risk-averse than private sector employees, yet consistent empirical evidence is lacking. Prospect theory posits that individuals’ risk decision preferences are influenced by the framing of gains or losses, but it does not distinguish whether gains and losses pertain to personal or public interests. This study incorporates the type of interest with gain–loss framing to construct decision scenarios and compare risk preferences between public officials and private sector employees. In Experiment 1 (Npublic officials = 897, Nprivate sector employees = 685), using a 3 (public interest vs. public-private mixed interest vs. private interest) × 2 (gain frame vs. loss frame) design, public officials were found to exhibit greater risk aversion than private sector employees when the loss frame involves the public interest, while no significant differences were observed for a gain frame involving either the public interest or private interest. Applying blame avoidance theory, accountability is positioned here as a core factor to further explore why public officials are more risk-averse than private sector employees when facing public interest losses. In Experiment 2 (Npublic officials = 625, Nprivate sector employees = 630), using a 2 (reward vs. punishment-oriented accountability) × 2 (process vs. outcome-oriented accountability) design in a public interest decision-making context, public officials were found to be more risk-averse than private sector employees in the case of outcome-oriented punishment accountability. In the other three types of accountability conditions, public officials exhibited a similar risk preference to private sector employees. These findings reveal the situational factors underlying public officials’ risk aversion, and offer practical insights for designing accountability systems that effectively guide decision-making in the public sector.",

          "abstract": "One critical way that public agencies can improve administrative performance is through its discretionary efforts at detecting program errors. This requires an alignment between political and administrative objectives within executive branch governance. Specifically, we hypothesize that agency efforts for detecting benefit overpayment errors from state unemployment insurance (UI) programs will be higher under Republican partisan gubernatorial control of state UI agency heads compared to Democratic counterparts. Based on panel data consisting of 999 observations covering fifty state UI agencies between 2002-2021, our lognormal maximum likelihood estimates reveal a partisan differential between Republican and Democratic governors with direct appointment control over UIP agency heads are associated with a within-state average of $ 2.647 million higher correction of benefit overpayments to unemployed claimants (i.e., a per claimant overpayment case partisan differential of $ 618.68). State UIP agencies investments in performance improvement that identify program waste reflect the importance of partisan incentives, coupled with unity in executive branch governance.",

          "abstract": "States are partisan laboratories of democracy where policy is misaligned with constituency preferences. Yet governors are popular. To resolve this puzzle, we argue governors use aligned rhetoric to make up for out-of-step policymaking, and this alignment has improved as nationalization, polarization, and policy extremity have increased. To test our argument, we measure the partisan slant of gubernatorial rhetoric in 2,400 State of the State Addresses (1962–2023). We fine-tune BERT models to predict the partisanship of held-out speeches using other contemporaneous addresses as training data. When a governor “sounds like” her co-partisans, the model labels her speech as more partisan. This predicted probability provides a dynamic, time-varying measure of gubernatorial partisan slant. We show governors have polarized, but these changes increasingly correlate with constituency partisanship. We also find rhetorical alignment predicts gubernatorial approval as well, which may help explain why governors are so popular.",

          "abstract": "The rise of uncivil speech in digital public spheres has prompted concern about its effects on democracy. This paper explores the relationship between incivility in social media and democracy, moving beyond simplistic claims that uncivil discourse is inherently harmful. It argues that different conceptions of why democracy is valuable—versions of egalitarian and electoral conceptions—offer distinct evaluative standpoints for the democratic consequences of incivility. Under egalitarian conceptions, incivility undermines democracy by silencing marginalized voices, reinforcing hierarchies of social status, or by degrading the deliberative processes that contribute to democratic legitimacy. Under electoral conceptions incivility poses a democratic problem either when it reduces political trust that impairs the value of accountability or when it erodes norms of legitimate opposition that are essential for civil peace. By analyzing these frameworks, the paper clarifies when and why incivility may pose a genuine threat to democracy while also proposing how to navigate conflicts between restraint and inclusion by advancing a novel account of the duties of civility in the public sphere.",

          "abstract": "Why do presidents reference executive actions in their public commentary on Supreme Court cases? We contend that presidents are motivated by their policy and reelection goals to respond strategically through executive action on Court cases that they address publicly. Presidents who tie their executive actions to Court cases may add legitimacy to those actions, thereby bolstering their policy choices in the eyes of the public, Congress, and the Court. We examine the factors shaping presidents’ decisions to tie their executive actions to Court cases using a novel database covering the Eisenhower to Biden presidencies (1953–2024). We find that the president’s ideological proximity to the Court, agreement with the Court’s decisions, and approval ratings are especially important factors. These findings contribute the literatures on executive action, the separation of powers, and the public presidency providing new insight into how presidents leverage Court decisions to justify executive actions to achieve their goals.",

          "abstract": "Judicial councils are often seen as institutional safeguards that protect courts from political interference and uphold the rule of law. Yet their real-world effects on executive behavior vary widely across countries. This paper investigates the conditions under which judicial councils promote or undermine government compliance with court rulings. I develop a model in which executives strategically design or reform judicial councils to influence court assertiveness, depending on the level of transparency and reputational risk. The model yields clear empirical expectations about when councils facilitate compliance and when they serve symbolic or even suppressive functions. To test these claims, I construct an original panel dataset of 47 European and neighboring countries (1945–2025) that includes detailed institutional features of judicial governance. Using multilevel regression models and extensive robustness checks, I find that councils only promote compliance when they are judge-dominated, institutionally empowered, and embedded in transparent political environments. By contrast, politically dominated or merely symbolic councils are associated with lower levels of compliance. The findings challenge the assumption that judicial councils are inherently democratizing and highlight how institutional design interacts with political context to shape executive-judicial relations.",

          "abstract": "A substantial literature documents persistent gender gaps in voter turnout in general elections, yet far less is known about whether these disparities extend to low-salience contests such as congressional primaries. This omission is consequential, as primary elections increasingly determine representation in Congress due to partisan gerrymandering and declining general election competitiveness. This study investigates whether a gender gap exists in congressional primary turnout and whether it varies by party. Using individual-level administrative voter-file data from all fifty states, we analyze turnout in the 2018 and 2022 congressional primaries, leveraging panel models that account for prior voting behavior. The data include five million observations and avoid common biases associated with survey-based turnout measures. We find a small but significant overall gender gap in congressional primary turnout, with women more likely to participate than men, consistent with research findings that women are stronger partisans. However, there is substantial partisan asymmetry: Republican women are significantly more likely than Republican men to vote in primaries, whereas Democratic women are equally or less likely to vote in primaries, depending on the electoral context. These findings suggest that gender gaps in primary participation are driven by women’s partisan attachment and party-specific mobilization dynamics, with implications for representation.",

It arises out of the combination of the corporate self-governance of medieval universities and the spirit of disciplinary scientific inquiry in modern research universities. It combines a principle of antiorthodoxy as to conclusions with the robust associational self-governance of scholarly communities whose members evaluate one another as participants in that shared enterprise. It has never been easily or wholly embraced by wider societies; today it is under wholesale attack. This article combines conceptual, normative, and historical analyses of academic freedom as a general norm with attention to conflicts over it in the mid-to-late 2010s and early 2020s. Some genuinely hard cases and questions tested the meaning of academic freedom and university values well before the current crisis.",

We apply our approach to an original dataset of 205 leadership contests from 29 parties in six consolidated democracies between 1990 and 2024. Empirically, we find that rates of factional conflict in mainstream parties increased from the first decade of the twenty-first century onwards. Niche parties had significantly less factional conflict during this period.

To bridge this divide, this article develops a tripartite differentiation of competing, coexisting and complecting relations or, correspondingly, of bilateralism or, and , as well as in multilateralism. It then scrutinises the bilateral link between France and Germany as a particularly developed case of minilateral relations mingling with the multilateral politics of the European Union. Analysing three pivotal episodes which span 50 years of European integration and different policy domains, we document why and how France and Germany repeatedly came together bilaterally to promote multilateral European polity stabilisation and development. The article contributes to an emerging but so far dispersed scholarship on bilateralism within multilateralism in Europe and beyond.",

This trend has been most visible in Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. By analysing over 500 state media texts, this article deciphers the meanings of the so-called ‘Anglo-Saxons’ in Russia’s wartime narratives to understand how global actors cast the Anglosphere in geopolitical imagination. It identifies nine key narratives that construct the Anglosphere as a civilisational ‘other’, consistent with Eurasianism in Russian geopolitical thought. The findings demonstrate how Russia invokes the ‘Anglosphere as other’ to justify atrocities in Ukraine while seeking ontological security but it cautions against dismissing ‘Anglo-Saxons’ as a mere propaganda trope. Instead, it argues that the increasingly visible ‘Anglo-Saxon’ ethnonym signifies ongoing shifts in how global actors conceive geography and international order amid uncertainty and transformation. This article contributes to the burgeoning research agendas on the Anglosphere, Russian geopolitics, and non-Western civilisational discourse.",

          "authors": "Erik Baekkeskov, Olivier Rubin",
          "abstract": "Policy studies suggest that policy termination is rare, just as stability is common. Yet, international relations studies suggest that national policies based on international agreements terminate easily. What makes the difference? Widespread discontinuation of national action plans (NAPs) for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a case in point. NAPs are national strategic plans—and hence, national policies—for combatting AMR. More than 170 countries produced them in the years following global agreement to combat AMR in 2015, seeming to represent great success for new international norms. However, this article shows that 51% of countries with NAPs on record have terminated them, and terminations appear to be increasing. It probes plausibility of two conventional termination reasons and one novel: lost policy capacity, policy subsystem support loss, and the new one, domestic political rootlessness. The article shows that the last is clearly plausible in the AMR NAP case. This finding advances policy termination theory by illustrating how policies lacking firm roots in domestic institutions and policy subsystems—such as some originating in internationally agreed norms—can be easily abandoned by national governments once international attention and pressure move elsewhere. Keywords: policy termination conditions; politically rootless policy; placebo policy; international norms; antimicrobial resistance national action plans",

          "abstract": "During the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and amid uncertainty over a TikTok ban, Xiaohongshu (RedNote) unexpectedly emerged as a site of transnational environmental discussion. This study examines how transnational conversations unfolded and their implications for community empowerment and environmental justice during a crisis. Drawing on qualitative content analysis and social network analysis of 505 wildfire-related posts, we find that user engagement centered on participatory practices (44.45%), including reporting and the circulation of practical information. Another substantial share of posts focused on building social ties through emotional support (16.33%), while critically questioning the causes of the fires (11.02%). Social network analysis further shows that grassroots users occupied central positions in the discourse. Together, these findings suggest that Xiaohongshu enabled communicative agency and empathetic transfer across borders, facilitating emergent forms of collective resilience. However, such potentials remain contingent, as algorithmic visibility and geopolitical conditions unevenly shape participation and recognition in digital spaces.",

My specific focus is on the LunaNet’s interoperability discourse which situates it within the technical, historical, and political trajectories of the Internet and within socio‑technical structures that shape power here on Earth. By analyzing this discourse, I argue that, when applied to outer space, the visions of interoperability are limited, overlooking what makes LunaNet distinctive—its ability to function without continuous connectivity. To foreground this point, I introduce the concept of extraoperability, a speculative framework that challenges Earth‑bound assumptions about Internet connectivity and proposes that alternative modes of relation may emerge when we network beyond our Blue Planet.",

          "abstract": "Large social media platforms are criticized for commodifying user data, corporate surveillance, and perceived censorship of political speech. As a result, some users flock to alternative platforms, like Telegram, Signal, VK, Parler, or Gettr. This study examines the roles of political ideology, anti-establishment views, and privacy concerns in the use of these five platforms. Based on survey data gathered in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany ( n = 1500 each), we find that alternative platform use is highest in the United States and in Germany. Digitally skilled, young, male, educated, and right-wing individuals are drawn to alternative social media. Across all five platforms, right-wing ideology is a stronger predictor of usage than anti-establishment views. In the pooled sample, privacy concerns do not correlate with usage. However, given inconsistencies in the roles of privacy concerns and anti-establishment views, we highlight the importance of specific platform affordances and national context.",

Rather than a uniform or convergent process, financial globalization emerges as an uneven and differentiated field structured by distinct professional communities, institutions, and socio-political legacies. In this article, I examine how financial practices and products circulate within the global offshore finance system through variations in professional characteristics. Using novel empirical evidence and an innovative combination of geographic and geometric data analysis, I map 17.622 offshore finance professionals and identify patterns in practices and geographies. I identify sites of distinct offshore practices and thereby provide evidence for how financial globalization in the offshore space develops in differentiated hubs and circuits through professional mediation and innovation. The broader implication here is that professional specialization produces institutional variation in the aggregate.",

          "authors": "Florian Fastenrath, Paul Marx",
          "abstract": "This article explores why left-wing parties tend to avoid advocating higher taxes for the rich—and why they sometimes do put them on the agenda. The ‘tax taboo’ is driven by electoral calculations. Public opinion on taxing the rich is ambivalent. Narratives of taxes harming the economy are nurtured by right-wing parties and business lobbies. This discourages the left from mobilizing on the issue. However, recent campaigns by the German Social Democrats (2021) and Labour in Britain (2017) overcame this taboo with distinct pro-tax programs. Our comparative analysis traces common factors and strategic considerations of party actors. It highlights the role of policy entrepreneurs, who act as catalysts through their exceptional motivation and competence. Additionally, our case studies point to party competition as an important factor. Right-wing parties face a trilemma between the goals of balanced budgets, low taxes, and investment, making them less compelling critics of left-wing tax plans.",

          "authors": "Mehdi Nemati",
          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of residential water‐efficiency standards on household water consumption, utilizing billing data from California. I examine both the short‐ and long‐term impacts of the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen), comparing homes constructed just before and after its implementation in 2010. The findings show that, on average, CALGreen homes use 11.7% less water than comparable pre‐code homes, with savings persisting over time at approximately 10.9%. Notably, engineering‐based (ex ante) estimates of water savings are nearly twice as large as the realized reductions, likely reflecting the “offsetting behavior” effect. The analysis further reveals that most water savings occur during warmer months when outdoor water use peaks. In addition, CALGreen homes exhibit lower sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, with smaller increases in use during hotter months and smaller reductions during cooler months. Finally, when accounting for compliance costs and the opportunity cost of water, the results suggest that CALGreen policy passes a cost‐effectiveness test. These findings highlight the effectiveness of building codes as a durable policy tool for achieving long‐term water conservation in fast‐growing, semi‐arid regions.",

          "authors": "Thilo N H Albers, Charlotte Bartels, Moritz Schularick",
          "abstract": "German history over the past 125 years has been turbulent. Marked by two world wars, revolutions and major regime changes, as well as a hyperinflation and three currency reforms, expropriations and territorial divisions, it comprises extreme shocks to study the role of historical events, taxation, asset price changes, portfolio heterogeneity in affecting the wealth distribution in the long run. Combining tax and archival data, household surveys, historical national accounts, and rich lists, we document that the top 1% wealth share has fallen by half, from close to 50% in 1895 to 26% today. Nearly all of this decline was the result of changes that occurred between 1914 and 1952. Using a novel decomposition framework, we show that collapsing equity prices after World War I and in the Great Depression as well as taxation in the aftermath of World War II stand out as great equalizers in 20th century German history. After unification in 1990, two trends have left their mark on the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising business wealth while the middle-class had large capital gains in the housing market. The wealth share of the bottom 50% has halved since 1990. Our findings speak to the importance of historical shocks to the valuation of existing wealth and taxation in driving the evolution of the wealth distribution over the long run. In addition, our data revisions reveal that Germany’s current wealth-income ratio is about 120 percentage points higher than previously thought.",

          "authors": "Xijia You",
          "abstract": "Research on the migration‐fertility nexus has generated five theoretical mechanisms – socialisation, assimilation, selection, disruption, and adaptation – that are typically examined in isolation from one another. Drawing on 66 life‐story interviews with internal migrants in Shenzhen, China, this article argues that these mechanisms share a common foundation in fertility norms, understood as socially embedded expectations about reproduction. While socialisation and assimilation have always centred on normative processes, the empirical analysis demonstrates that selection, disruption, and adaptation are likewise mediated by fertility norms – shaping how migrants assess destinations (selection), experience changes in normative constraint (disruption), and reinterpret reproductive expectations across contexts (adaptation). By establishing fertility norms as a unifying analytical lens, the article shows that migration and fertility operate as coordinated life domains. The analysis reveals that prior to migration, individuals evaluate destinations in light of anticipated fertility norms (selection). During migration and settlement, geographic separation from origin communities weakens normative monitoring and sanctioning, creating space for revising reproductive plans (disruption). Over time, sustained exposure to destination contexts reshapes fertility orientations and practices (adaptation), all unfolding against the longer‐term influence of childhood socialisation and intergenerational assimilation. This coordination reveals individuals as strategic navigators who integrate spatial mobility and reproductive decisions together, rather than experiencing them as separate, sequential events.",

          "authors": "Luis Llases, Juanjo Mediavilla, Arthur Lauer, Raquel Gallego‐Medina",
          "abstract": "Rural depopulation linked to aging populations, economic decline, and reduced public services has accelerated migration to urban centres in various parts of the European Union and increasingly attracts the attention of policymakers. This study employs the SPANDAM system dynamics model to evaluate the effectiveness of different policy approaches across three representative Spanish rural territories ( Zamora , Pirineo Navarro , and Vitigudino ) through five simulated scenarios: business‐as‐usual (BS), macroeconomic focus (PS1), rural economic development (PS2), service‐centred approach (PS3), and combined strategy (PS4). Results demonstrate that while targeted interventions can improve socioeconomic indicators and slow demographic decline, only the comprehensive strategy (PS4) combining economic and service policies showed significant impacts, nearly stabilizing Zamora 's population and reducing the decline in Pirineo Navarro to a very slow pace. However, even this integrated approach failed to fully reverse depopulation in areas with severe demographic deterioration like Vitigudino , highlighting how initial conditions critically determine policy effectiveness. The findings yield several key insights: (1) national economic improvements (PS1) have minimal local impact in the absence of concrete policies on the territory, underscoring the need for place‐based strategies; (2) larger municipalities benefit more than smaller municipalities from many of the policies implemented due to economies of scale; and (3) the implementation of partial policies (PS2 and PS3) improves the quality of life of the inhabitants, but does not halt the depopulation process. These points underscore the imperative for enhanced multi‐level governance coordination to enable integrated policy interventions that can meaningfully counteract rural depopulation.",

          "authors": "Francesca Tosi, Giulia Dugar, Livia Elisa Ortensi",
          "abstract": "The diversification of young people's life trajectories in Europe over the past 50 years has been significantly influenced by more uncertain social and economic conditions, marked by high youth unemployment and increasing job insecurity. In Italy, precariousness has propagated unevenly across regions and social strata, particularly affecting women and young people from the South, exacerbating existing territorial disparities. This study adopts a centre‐periphery approach to explore how the territorial features of Italian university graduates' places of origin impact their early occupational outcomes. Using individual‐level data from the Istat Survey on the Professional Paths of Italian Graduates (2015) and Eurostat's territorial typology indicators, we employ Heckman modelling to estimate the risk of non‐standard employment 4 years after graduation. Our findings reveal that graduates from marginal areas (predominantly rural, mountainous, or non‐metropolitan) face higher risks of non‐standard employment compared to those from central areas. No clear evidence links marginality in Southern areas to worse employment outcomes; instead, the highest internal territorial divide in terms of job insecurity is observed between central and marginal areas in Central Italy. Furthermore, we find that mobility during the school‐to‐work transition mitigates job insecurity risks, with movers from both central and marginal regions reporting better employment outcomes than stayers. This study contributes to the literature by adopting a new and underinvestigated geographical approach to the school‐to‐work transition, by highlighting the importance of territorial disparities in shaping young people's labour market trajectories and underscoring the complex interplay between territorial characteristics of places of origin and young people's employment prospects.",

Using a time‐sensitive approach, this study unpacks the individual‐institutional temporal entanglement against the macro‐level socioeconomic changes in China and Pakistan between 2019 and 2023. Shifting from study to work, Pakistani PhD graduates face age‐based discrimination, temporary contracts and lack of permanent residency prospect in China. Meanwhile, deteriorating conditions in Pakistan's academic sector, over time, further constrained options. Despite aspirations to reach the ‘Global North’, participants experienced reversed migration decision driven by precarity rather than advancement. This study highlights the limitations within ‘South−South’ academic mobility and the difficulty for highly educated migrants to align their mobility strategies with an increasingly uncertain global socioeconomic environment.",

First, it illustrates the stark sub‐national variation in geographies of age segregation; second, it demonstrates the value of an analytical and interpretive framework using concepts of urban hierarchy; third, it causes us to rethink typical understandings of ageing and the urban hierarchy. In particular, the analyses reveal high age segregation and low age diversity in urban areas together with the potential polarisation of older‐ and younger‐age areas in some parts of cities; stable age mixing in rural areas (but with decreasing age diversity); and accessible (town and rural) neighbourhoods exhibiting both increasing age segregation and diversity and acting as the lynchpin for understanding the local dynamics of age mixing over the last decade. Attention to spatial nuance also reveals that change in age diversity is spatially clustered. The paper raises questions about the demographic dynamics and social meaning implied by spatially‐varied age mixing, with implications for population and community planning in Scotland and elsewhere.",

          "abstract": "Camp studies have grown markedly in recent years. While the field has by and large been critical of camps as spatial technologies of protective custody, biopolitical control, minority oppression, racial segregation, custodial care, militarised rule and colonisation, there has been a reluctance to embrace more overtly abolitionist approaches, which have become increasingly influential in research on other carceral spaces like prisons or detention centres. In this article, I contend that Camp Studies today cannot remain simply another field of detached academic enquiry but has a responsibility for solidarity with encamped people in thought and action. If we are to be engaged and critical scholars of camps who are committed to social justice and liberation, then we must throw our weight behind the already unfolding abolitionist praxes of those who actively struggle against their own encampment. However, instead of exceptionalising the camp as a bounded carceral technology that can be undone in isolation, the ultimate task of carceral abolitionism writ large is to reimagine society, reformulate belonging and dismantle the nation‐state, so that the camp itself becomes unthinkable as a solution.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Sandu, Katy Huxley, Jen Keating, Tony Whiffen, Rob French",
          "abstract": "Understanding spatial variations in educational outcomes is important for addressing educational inequalities. This study examines how socio‐economic factors and household characteristics influence age 16 standardised attainment across Wales using linked administrative and census data. In terms of methodology, we employed logistic regression modelling at the individual level, while at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level, we used both Ordinary Least Squares and Geographically Weighted Regression. At the Individual level, results reveal strong associations between attainment and household characteristics, with household education level having positive effects, while socio‐economic disadvantage is negatively associated with attainment. The spatial analysis highlights significant variations in how these factors impact attainment across Wales. Household education level shows consistently positive effects throughout the country, while eligibility for free school meals and special educational needs demonstrate varying negative associations across small geographies. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between place, socio‐economic status, and educational outcomes in Wales. These findings suggest that one‐size‐fits‐all educational policies may be insufficient and emphasise the need for geographically targeted interventions.",

But does reelection show the same gendered effects? Recent research suggests that compared to male leaders, women leaders often come to high office in more difficult conditions; enter with lower approval ratings; and experience more rapid decline in ratings over time. We know little, however, about the conditions that affect their odds of reelection. Does the type of office—president or prime minister—matter? Do economic and political conditions during their tenure affect their odds of success? We analyze gender and leader reelection across electoral democracies in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia,1960–2023. We show that among leaders eligible to run, men and women have roughly equal odds of winning. We also find that women run somewhat more often than men.",

          "abstract": "Policymakers influence citizens’ behavior through language and through policy. In this study, we build on this distinction and use Large Language Models to study how fathers are talked about, i.e., portrayals of fathers, in parliamentary documents. The case is Sweden, a forerunner in policies encouraging an engaged father. Portrayals of fathers are related to policymaking and to fathers’ use of parental leave. The results show that an active fatherhood role dominates over a passive role in this type of documents, and that an active positive role dominates over an active negative role. However, over time (1993–2021) there is a narrowing of the gap between mentions of active positive and active negative fatherhood roles, which coincides with stalled developments in fathers’ use of parental leave. We conclude that portrayals of fathers are more mixed than expected and theorize about a signaling mechanism through which language surrounding fathers may influence their behavior.",

This article investigates how shared language and practices of anti-trans feminist and traditionalist coalitions enact opposing sex/gender orders. I explain this alliance through grounded theory generated from a critical discourse analysis of my dataset of 1016 anti-trans texts from 175 organizations. I develop my Affective Orientation Threat Structure, which explains the affective governing process of this coalition, and then apply this framework to anti-trans discourses about trans threats to womanhood. I find that anti-trans feminists and traditionalists generate fear via shared threat constructions but frame threat differently in order to mobilize affective energy in service of diverging regulative regimes and sex/gender orders. I argue that the illogics produced by contradictions within this incompatible coalition benefit both camps by maximizing affective disorientation and generating momentum through paradox.",

To better understand such opposition, we conceptualize, measure, and analyze perceptions of feminism as a threat, using a novel survey measure of feminism-related threat perceptions in Spain. Our results show that general psychological predispositions to feel threatened are among the most important predictors of perceptions of feminism as a threat. Contrary to expectations, women feel similarly threatened by feminism as men, which is driven by women’s generally higher predisposition to feel threatened. Further, men’s and women’s perceptions of feminism as threatening are associated with different political profiles: Men who feel threatened by feminism tend to sympathize with the far right, while women who feel threatened by feminism do not have a particular political profile. Our results highlight that feminism faces challenges that go beyond the expected anti-feminist attitudes driven by the intersection of gender and ideology.",

Themes and patterns across data sources are assessed, including information collected that informs a corporate criminal career perspective and what remains unexamined. Main findings reveal: (1) most longitudinal studies do not explicitly focus on the corporate criminal career; (2) a significant number of companies offend occasionally over time, but others offend often (chronically) or not at all; (3) typically, studies examine one or two types of offending, offering little insight into crime mix; and (4) identifiable groups of corporations show evidence of both stability and change over time. Studies provide insights for understanding the dimensions of corporate criminal careers (some more than others), but more explicit and detailed longitudinal work is needed. We conclude by identifying potential areas for theoretical advances and future research.",

          "authors": "Caroline Cecot, Robert W. Hahn, Eslem Imamoglu",
          "abstract": "Policy makers are showing increased interest in understanding the impacts of public policies on subgroups of the population. We provide the first cross‐regional comparison of distributional analyses by examining 907 benefit–cost analyses (BCAs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union from 2016 through 2020. In these regions, we find almost no quantification of net benefits for a population subgroup (2 US BCAs, 0 UK BCAs, and 1 EU BCA). Distributional weights were also rarely used (5 UK BCAs, none elsewhere). Moreover, when distributional weights were used in the United Kingdom, they were used mainly to evaluate policies involving income transfers between low‐ and high‐income groups rather than in broader regulatory analyses. We consider possible explanations for the lack of quantification of net benefits by subgroup along with the implications of our findings for conducting distributional analysis.

          "abstract": "The ethics of the international monetary system (IMS) can be framed either as a case of background injustice or of structural injustice. Both ideas suggest that due to the background conditions, the interaction of agents, in a context of no rules, can lead to domination and unfairness. Moreover, both ideas emphasise the need to create regulation, or a structure, that prevents domination and unfairness. This article asks how (if at all) do monetary regimes, or each of the three scenarios that stem from the Mundell-Fleming trilemma, raise domination and unfairness. This article identifies domination and unfairness in both regimes with open capital markets: the one with floating exchange rates and the one with fixed exchange rates. Moreover, it offers a principle of non-domination, according to which institutions of the IMS ought to guarantee effective sovereignty of participant states or offer an equal distribution of this value when securing full effective sovereignty for all is not possible. For the last regime, of closed capital markets, this article identifies unfairness but no domination. By identifying domination and unfairness in each regime, this article proposes policies and regulation, or a structure, to prevent and mitigate these issues.",

This paper investigates a crucial yet underexplored dimension: the interplay between media consumption, authoritarian nostalgia, and far-right voting behaviour. Focusing on Spain and Portugal – two countries with distinct yet comparable histories of authoritarian rule – survey data analyses suggest that readers of ABC in Spain and Correio da Manhã (CdM) in Portugal may develop higher levels of authoritarian nostalgia, which in turn correlates with a higher probability to support VOX and Chega, respectively. A content analysis conducted on these newspapers indicates that this pattern may be driven more by the tone adopted by the tabloid (CdM) and conservative ( ABC ) newspapers when discussing the authoritarian past rather than by higher levels of authoritarian nostalgia compared to other newspapers. This study contributes to political communication research by highlighting a mechanism through which media narratives shape historical perceptions and electoral choices.",

          "abstract": "Prior work shows that passive news engagement, such as selection and consumption, exhibits strong news selectivity. Far less attention has been given to more active forms of news engagement, however. News commentary, an active form of engagement, may reflect cross-cutting engagement rather than pro-attitudinal selectivity, given its expressive and often confrontational nature. Using ten years of commenting data from South Korea’s largest news aggregator—amounting to over 250 million comments posted by approximately six million users—and a deep-learning content analysis to classify political attitudes and hostility, we examine whether hostile commentary is indeed characterized by cross-cutting patterns across both content and source levels. We specifically analyze whether users comment on counter-attitudinal news stories and whether hostile commenters are structurally confined within fragmented outlet clusters in co-engagement media networks. Findings show that hostile commenters are more likely to cross boundaries by targeting opposing news stories and exhibit weaker echo chamber structures, reflecting cross-cutting engagement beyond their clusters. This pattern is especially pronounced in political and societal domains. In today’s media environment, hostility and opposition may ironically disrupt, rather than reinforce, echo chambers.",

          "abstract": "With the rise of AI, concerns about its potential for manipulation in political communication have intensified, accompanied by discussions about regulatory measures. Research has explored perceptions of risks and preferences regarding AI use and regulations among the general population, and in fields such as journalism. However, little is known about attitudes toward AI in political communication or how individual factors, such as internal and external political efficacy, may shape these views. Using a representative survey of the German population ( N = 1991), this study aims to assess citizens′ perceptions of risks, acceptance, and regulations for AI use in political communication, and predictors of these attitudes. Results show that AI is perceived as risky and is associated with threats to democracy. AI tasks such as translations are more accepted than its use for creating realistic visual content. Transparency measures are preferred over stricter regulations. Knowledge and curiosity about technology are associated with a more nuanced perspective on regulations, favoring transparency. Fears about AI increase, while external political efficacy decreases preferences for regulatory intervention. Findings underscore that the use of AI in political communication requires education about AI, transparency, and targeted regulatory measures to address concerns and build acceptance for its use.",

To construct these estimates, we develop and validate a generalizable downscaling technique based on satellite imagery that allows for training and prediction with observations of arbitrary size and shape. We show how our estimates can improve decision-making and that more than half of the global population was previously assigned to the incorrect Human Development Index quintile within each country due to aggregation bias. We publish the satellite features necessary to increase the spatial resolution of any other administrative data that is detectable via imagery.",

Traditionally, economists model trade using gravity models, which rely on explicit covariates that might struggle to capture these subtler drivers of trade. In this work, we employ optimal transport and a deep neural network to learn a time-dependent cost function from data, without imposing a specific functional form. This approach consistently outperforms traditional gravity models in accuracy and has similar performance to three-way gravity models, while providing natural uncertainty quantification. Applying our framework to global food and agricultural trade, we show that low income countries experienced disproportionately higher increases in trade costs due to the war in Ukraine’s impact on wheat markets. We also analyse the effects of free-trade agreements and trade disputes with China, as well as Brexit’s impact on British trade with Europe, uncovering hidden patterns that trade volumes alone cannot reveal.",

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship has emphasized methodological innovations to mitigate preference falsification in public opinion data, yet systematic scrutiny of bias in regression analyses remains limited. Drawing on analyses of political trust in China, we offer three key insights. First, determining the direction of social desirability bias in regression estimates—whether over- or underestimation—is challenging ex ante . Second, analyses of two nationally representative Chinese surveys, one incorporating a list experiment, cast doubt on the purported positive effect of social welfare expansion on political trust. Extending beyond social welfare and the Chinese case, we find similar biases when regressions rely on direct questions. Third, we show that certain identification strategies can partially mitigate regression bias when direct questions are unavoidable.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how political information is transmitted requires tools that can reliably and scalably capture complex signals in text. While existing studies highlight interest groups as strategic information providers, empirical analysis has been constrained by reliance on expert annotation. Using policy documents released by interest groups, this study shows that fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) outperform lightly trained workers, crowdworkers, and zero-shot LLMs in distinguishing two difficult-to-separate categories: informative signals that help improve political decision-making and associative signals that shape preferences but lack substantive relevance. We further demonstrate that the classifier generalizes out of distribution across two applications. Although the empirical setting is domain-specific, the approach offers a scalable method for expert-driven text coding applicable to other areas of political inquiry.",

We study participation in such events with a large, randomized field trial in which Australian voters received varying invitations to a telephone town hall with their representative. In addition to invitations framed prospectively or retrospectively , a control condition provided no rationale for participation. Surprisingly, the control group had higher acceptance rates than retrospective for both events, and for prospective in May. After accounting for this, treatment groups remained on the call longer, significantly for prospective in July. We see no differences by gender, but the youngest cohort had higher acceptance rates in the prospective condition than in the control for both events.",

          "authors": "Carolina F. T. Batista, Ernesto Calvo, Shibley Telhami",
          "abstract": "We implement a survey experiment to measure the effects of confirmation versus refutation frames in fact-checking wartime corrections. Respondents were presented with semantically equivalent statements that either confirmed accurate information (e.g., “It is TRUE that President Zelensky remained in Ukraine”) or refuted its inaccurate version (e.g., “It is FALSE that President Zelensky left Ukraine”). We evaluate whether confirmation frames increase sharing behavior compared with refutation frames. We also test whether refutation frames elicit more negative sentiments—such as anger and disgust—while confirmation frames generate more positive emotional responses. The experimental design mimics a Facebook post and employs four randomized treatments that vary in framing (confirmation vs. refutation) and news source ( The New York Times vs Fox News ). The survey was administered to 2091 U.S. adults in May 2022.",

          "authors": "Lei Chen, Kun Zhou, Sang Jung Kim",
          "abstract": "Digital platforms have facilitated body-positive discourses that challenge appearance norms, yet these often intertwine with postfeminist elements, creating paradoxes that both resist and reinforce hegemonic ideals. By deploying computationally assisted critical thematic analysis across 1915 #RejectBodyAnxiety posts on RedNote, this study reveals both the breadth —the full variety of user-generated discursive elements and their articulation patterns—and the depth —the discursive meanings configured through these articulations, of this feminist digital activism site. The findings show that body-positivity discourses under #RejectBodyAnxiety are profoundly reconfigured through their articulation with localized postfeminist formations and platform-mediated empowering mechanisms, reframing body positivity as ideal positivity —a postfeminist discourse that refines hegemonic beauty ideals by shedding their extreme traits ( Selective Subversion ) and making them appear attainable ( Tactical Conformity ), thereby transforming them into seemingly positive forms. While fostering empowerment, this discourse risks new exclusions, marginalizing some women and intensifying postfeminist contradictions. Tracing these sensibilities through social media, the study highlights their new forms in non-Western contexts and underscores the need to address emerging discourses in body image promotion.",

          "authors": "Chloe Mortenson, Erik C. Nisbet, R. Kelly Garrett",
          "abstract": "American public discourse about online misinformation often exaggerates its prevalence and persuasiveness, potentially harming Americans’ evaluations of democratic governance. This project uses two studies conducted during the 2020 and 2022 elections to test whether the presumed prevalence/persuasiveness of online misinformation (P3OM)—the perception that online misinformation is both widespread and persuasive—undermines Americans’ satisfaction with democracy. Fixed-effects regression analysis of an eight-wave online panel survey reveals that both dimensions of P3OM are correlated with reduced democratic satisfaction. A follow-up online survey experiment provides evidence that exposure to messages about online misinformation reduces democratic satisfaction. Theoretical implications and strategies for reducing the presumed influence of online misinformation on democratic satisfaction are discussed.",

          "abstract": "People are influenced by the choices of others, a phenomenon observed across contexts in the social and behavioral sciences. Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet, several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock in. Here, we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the “marginal majority effect”: a discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of a marginal majority effect in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.",

          "abstract": "The vision of the edible city revives lost urban food traditions and gains global recognition for fostering community, democracy, and participatory urban dynamics, now framed as urban food commons. Despite diverse local contexts, urban food initiatives face recurring challenges in funding, land access, and institutional integration, which we analyze through co-creation processes in six Living Labs, using semi-structured interviews to explore team dynamics, working methods, and outcomes, offering lessons to guide future edible city solutions. Through qualitative analysis of interviews with participants, we identify key factors influencing the success and effectiveness of co-creation. The findings demonstrate the transformative potential of co-creation while, at the same time, highlighting obstacles such as power imbalances, “projectification” effects, scalability issues, and representation gaps. Co-creation was found to foster trust, collaboration, and innovative solutions, although high expectations sometimes led to frustration. We also found that social entrepreneurs played a pivotal role, though broader societal engagement remained limited. Conflicts often emerged as both challenges and opportunities for joint learning. Our findings suggest that, despite its complexity, co-creation can empower communities and support pathways toward more sustainable urban transformation through collective action and innovation. We conclude by offering insights for future co-creation initiatives, emphasizing the importance of inclusive governance, continuous reflection, and integrating Living Labs into stable institutional frameworks.",

          "abstract": "Flooding from short-duration extreme rainfall poses growing risks to rapidly urbanizing regions under climate change. This study integrates 2035 urban planning into simulations of extreme rainfall-induced flooding in the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan region. Results show that while urban planning has limited impact on reducing overall hazard, it plays a critical role in redistributing it spatially. Flood hazard and exposure in 2035 were assessed under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Hazard decreases by about 10% in SSP1, remains stable in SSP2, and rises in SSP3 and SSP5, with SSP5 showing a 12% increase. Population exposure grows across all scenarios, with increases of 21% in SSP1, 25% in SSP2, 13% in SSP3, and 56% in SSP5. Asset exposure shows even larger increases, from 29% in SSP3 to more than 100% in SSP5. These results highlight that while urban planning can alleviate hazard locally, long-term resilience is dominated by socioeconomic development trajectories.",
